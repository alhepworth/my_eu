The aims are divided into six objectives: 1) develop practical resources grounded in asset based knowledge to support new ways for public service actors to re-define operational processes, 2) produce and deliver nine real-life pilots to co-create a set of relational public services with various combinations of public sector, civil society and commercial actors, 3) draw together cross-cutting lessons from pilots and utilise innovative visualisation methods to share and validate new ideas and models of good governance, 4) apply innovative approaches appropriate to local contexts and user groups to gather the necessary user insight to co-create services, 5) ensure sustainability by establishing local trainers for animating dialogue and collating user voice, embedded in community networks, 6) mobilise new knowledge from piloting and validating by creating an accessible, user friendly roadmap to co-creation for service providers and their partners.\n\nThe project will be implemented as a joint venture with 24 partners from 10 EU countries.", 316767.0, 4329190.0, 10, 24, "CoSIE", null, "http://www.mmu.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212384_999847580"], [1430438400000, 1509408000000, "Innovative Social Investment: Strengthening communities in Europe (InnoSI)", "The Manchester Metropolitan University", "There is growing consensus in Europe that an active set of approaches to welfare known as Social Investment will improve human capital, enable more people to participate in society, and reduce intergenerational deprivation, yet implementation has been uneven across member states and much remains to be learned, especially with regard to regional and local realities of Social Investment.

Microbes may be thought of as biological 'micro-machines' that process information about their own state and the world around them. By sensing their environment, certain bacteria are able to move in response to chemical signals, allowing them to seek out food, for example. They can also communicate with other bacteria, by leaving chemical trails, or by directly exchanging genetic information. We focus on this latter mechanism.<br/>Parts of the internal 'program' of a bacterial cell (encoded by its genes, and the connections between them) may be 'reprogrammed' in order to persuade it to perform human-defined tasks. By introducing artificial 'circuits' made up of genetic components, we may add new behaviours or modify existing functionality within the cell. Existing examples of this include a bacterial oscillator, which causes the cells to periodically flash, and cell-based pollution detectors that can spot arsenic in drinking water. The potential for bio-engineering is huge, but the process itself is made difficult by the noisy, 'messy' nature of the underlying material. Bacteria are hard to engineer, as they rarely conform to the traditional model of a computer or device, with well-defined components laid out in a fixed design.<br/>We intend to use the inherent randomness of natural processes to our advantage, by harnessing it as a framework for biological engineering. By allowing our system to evolve, we use natural selection to build new functional biological devices. We begin with a large number of simple DNA-based components, taken from a well-understood toolbox, which may be pieced together inside the cell to form new genetic programs. A population of bacteria then absorb these components, which may (or may not) affect their behaviour. Crucially, the core of our bacterial computer is made up of engineered microbes that can detect how well they are performing, according to some external measure, such as how well they can flash in time with light pulses.The better bacteria are allowed to release their program components back into the environment in much larger numbers than the other, less impressive cells. As these 'good' components are then increasingly taken up by the population of cells, in a continual cycle, we gradually refine the internal program, until the whole population performs well. There are many potential benefits to this work, from both a biological and ICT perspective. By evolving new functional structures, we gain insight into biological systems. This, in turn, may suggest new methods for silicon-based computing, in the way that both evolution and the brain have already done.

HySchools is a partnership of 4 Universities with specialisms in HFCTs, 1 Regional Authority, 1 Energy Agency, 1 Science Park and 1 training provider based in 6 countries across Europe, which together will work to create teaching resources for the HFCT sector that educates learners and teachers alike, at all levels of the educational system. \r\n\r\nHydrogen fuel cells and the \u2018hydrogen economy\u2019 are considered a big solution to our future clean energy needs. However, the skills required to support the growing industry are lacking and in order to remove some of the barriers that exist (lack of teaching resources, confidence of teachers to teach, lack of awareness of wider uses for HFCTs and links to wider curriculum etc), a programme of practical educational resources for university students, pupils, teacher training departments and school teachers is required. \r\n\r\nThis is happening at a time when the trajectory for employment in the sector is upwards. The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCHJU) suggests the number of jobs has been increasing in the sector by approximately 6% per year since 2007 to 4,000 (FTE) today globally and Survey respondents in the industry expect employment growth of 9% pa, doubling the number of jobs 2013-20 to around 8,000 globally. A Call for proposals from the Commission funded FCH Joint Undertaking (FCH-04-3-2017) sets out need ' a firm basis needs to be prepared for an EU-wide human resources development of scientists & especially engineers to feed the growing European fuel cell and hydrogen (FCH) industry. The SET Plan Education, established in 2012/2013, expected a human resource of 57,000 highly skilled staff required by 2020, and 190,000 by 2030 in the FCH business. Supplying this resource is a major challenge in reliably building the FCH value and supply chain.' The achievement of higher level skills in HFCTs is hindered by a lack of teaching in schools. \r\n\r\nThe needs of the education system are equally matched with a demand for this step change in provision from industry to enable it to draw on an a highly skilled, prepared and enthusiastic future workforce. However the two require effort to facilitate the required educational solution and resource at all levels. \r\n\r\nNeeds in relation to the education systems we seek to influence include:\r\n\r\n- in Secondary and Higher level schools the subject of HFCT applications is only taught from a scientific perspective, not linked or across wider disciplines and at primary school it is not taught at all;\r\n- teachers do not understand how to teach about HFCTs;\r\n- teachers, especially at primary schools require additional CPD opportunities to help them deliver;\r\n- practical teaching resources are needed for all age levels to aid both learning and teaching;\r\n- even Chemistry teachers, whilst they are aware of HFCTs,  do not have expertise in teaching about HFCTs or their industry application;\r\n- there are no current direct links between most schools and the industry;\r\n- a lack of activity in all of the above means there are no role models or aspirational stories to engage and energise young people;\r\n- as a result there is a lack of available equipment to teach appropriately and in a practical way;\r\n- in order to influence curriculum change it requires an understanding and appropriate input with cyclical reviews of the curriculum and ongoing dialogue with exam boards.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these barriers HySchools will focus its activity on the provision of 7 Intellectual Outputs covering: \r\n\r\n1) Education & Industry Alignment of need and demand \r\n2) Creation of practical resource for secondary schools\r\n3) Creation of practical resource for Post 16\r\n4) Online HFCT resource for schools & industry \r\n5) Demonstration & Awareness Open Days\r\n6) Toolkit for integration within EHTN  linked to higher level skills\r\n7) Dissemination\r\n\r\n HySchools aims to bring teaching of HFCTs across a range of age levels and subject matters and as a resut it will immediately impact on Pupils, Teacher Trainers, Trainee Teachers, Teachers, Careers Advisors, Industry, Stakeholders & Policy Makers and ultimately in the future university students across a range of disciplines to provide the industry with the higher level skills it requires.", "http://www.mmu.ac.uk", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036645_coordinator"], [2018, "Gamifying CLIL within a Mathematics Context.", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 280665.0, 4, 6, "Gamifying CLIL to narrow the digital, language and numeracy gap for students/learners for whom the language of instruction is not their first language.  This project will see the fusion of two innovative pedagogies to help secure equality of access and provision for young people from refugee and/or migrant backgrounds or those for whom the language of instruction is not their first language.  A key aim is to equip these young people with the skills and competences to increase employment opportunities, enabling them to contribute positively to economic growth and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within each partner country. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe dual focused approach of CLIL, where an additional language is used for the teaching and learning of both content and language simultaneously, promotes higher order thinking skills such as problem solving and reasoning and creative thinking.  Adopting a CLIL pedagogy affords teachers opportunities to exploit the synergies between mathematics and language learning to help combat the language gap. Common to both disciplines and a factor that can have a significant impact on teachers is their own emotional responses to them.  Mathematics can provoke anxiety and negative attitudes in the same way as learning a second language. Teachers can lack confidence in their own ability and lack experience of teaching in increasingly diverse school contexts.  A recent EU Commission in 2017 found that whilst there are a growing number of learners from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, teachers in most European countries remain largely homogenous.  \r\nWhen playing computer-based games, learners are practising and applying a set of 21st century skills that can be applied in the real world. (Prensky, 2006).  Learning does not just involve acquiring knowledge and content, game-based resources can offer a different way to engage and interact with this content and promotes different ways of thinking, as well as inspiring creativity, interest and social interaction. (Squire, 2011).  The problem solving elements embedded within the games along with a narrative thread, require the learners to engage with a series of challenges or quests where they assess situations, analyse information, make decisions and decide on a course of action and respond to the consequences of their actions in order to progress through the different stages of the game, all of which are key to cognitive development.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s focus on GBL will help to ensure greater equity for all learners, enabling access and opportunities to develop their digital literacy skills, contributing to a \u2018narrowing of the gap.\u2019 These digital literacy skills are essential for a 21st century workforce and will enable all learners to contribute positively to social cohesion, economic growth and sustainability.  \r\n\r\nImpact/results\r\nCombining Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and game-based learning (GBL) within a mathematics context, will result in significant linguistic gains with students/learners having opportunities to engage with and exposure to the language of instruction within a meaningful and purposeful context.  The GBL resources require students and learners to engage with and access the language to process and assimilate the mathematical concepts, leading to a more secure and deeper understanding.  Through engagement with the GBL resources, students/learners will have opportunities to develop their digital and linguistic competences, which in turn will begin to address the current digital and language gap that exists within students/learners from a refugee and/or migrant background. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, schools and teachers lack the resources and expertise to fully meet the diverse needs of students/learners from migrant backgrounds or students that do not have the language of instruction as their first language.  This often results in student/learner disengagement, leading to poor or low attainment when compared to their peers. The innovative practices encouraged through this project and development of the GBL resources, will contribute to a narrowing of the attainment gap and promote inclusive practice. Student/learner participants engagement with these innovative and GBL resources will secure gains in their key digital and language skills and competences.  Increased competence in numeracy, digital literacies and communication will facilitate more positive contributions to future economic growth and prosperity and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within the participating EU countries.\r\n\r\n A longer-term objective of the project is to provide a blueprint to enable schools and teachers to capitalise on and maximise the potential of innovative pedagogical tools to increase student/learner engagement, to enhance digital and language learning and to narrow the attainment gap, promoting inclusive practice, social justice and equal opportunities for all.", "http://www.mmu.ac.uk", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048071_coordinator"], [2016, "Professional Action and Practice for Youth Refugees and Asylum Seekers", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 226106.0, 5, 5, "The 'refugee crisis' has brought public, policy maker and media attention the dire situation of displaced people from war-torn and unstable countries, such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Central African Republic. Over half of the world\u2019s displaced people are children (up to age 18) and if we include people up to age 30, this proportion rises to over three quarters (UNHCR 2014). Youth workers are in a prime position to lead support work with young refugees and asylum seekers and, indeed, many already do around Europe. However, excellence in practice with refugees and asylum seeker youth not consolidated in an accessible, innovative form that enables the widest possible engagement from youth workers from diverse sectors. To raise the standards of youth work around working with these vulnerable young people is vital. The objectives of PAPYRUS, a two-year project, will fill this gap through a transnational strategic partnership; PAPYRUS stands for Professional Action and Practice for Youth Refugees and Asylum Seekers. The 5 country Project Consortium is comprised of EU-based NGO and HEI partners (CESIE an NGO from Italy; Kopin, an NGO from Malta; the University of Applied Science, Finland and Manchester Metropolitan University, UK), along with an NGO from a third country partner, the Western Balkans Institute from Serbia, who bring added value to the team. We will harness the combined expertise and youth networks in our strategic partnership, to create innovative online training and knowledge sharing tools, hold innovative face to face and virtual training and generate peer-to-peer networks, to enable the maximum number of youth workers (from all sectors in Europe) to share and learn about working with refugees. The European Commission 'Quality Youth Work' Report (2014) that states that the EU youth labour force requires up-skilling to deal with the challenges of youth work under austerity, in times of rapid social change and in relation to new cultural challenges. But youth work is diverse & provided in various ways across the EU, from the part time, informally trained youth worker operating from a small faith organisation to the university-educated youth worker, employed full time by a large urban municipality. This diversity of youth practice is central to PAPYRUS's objectives that focus on creating innovative and accessible ways for all youth workers to share knowledge, build expertise and develop practice. Our NGO/HEI consortium will produce online interactive resources and learning opportunities for all youth workers who support refugee youth or are interested t. The project uses innovative virtual methods to ensure high & broad engagement with the project & the production of quality open learning materials, partner training sessions, webinars, blogs & forums, will create numerous engagement and dissemination points with wider stakeholders. Organisations that work with youth will be another main target group of PAPYRUS, who will also be able to use the outputs and engage with our activities, through the online features, and webinars. In all of these countries, and others, there is best practice to share and PAPYRUS consolidates refugee youth practice in one accessible online resource. It will create web training tools and resources, disseminate knowledge in innovative ways & facilitate sharing of knowledge, training & networks to enable the maximum number of youth workers to share, contribute and learn skills for working with young refugees.  A key aim of the project is to have a high impact on innovative practice in youth work and pan-European enhancement of youth worker skills with youth refugee and asylum seekers. Linking further with other projects and aims of the EU, the PAPYRUS Consortium will ensure dissemination of knowledge about youth work with refugees and asylum seekers in target groups, wider beneficiaries and EU policies, in areas such as education and skills, social inclusion and employment. Multiplication of impact will be facilitated via promotion of the open learning resources and trainings, live-streaming of face to face training, encouragement of wider stakeholders to utilise open access web PAPYRUS will also create a methodology model for co-production of open resources around youth work best practice in Europe, which will provide a framework for future projects in this area. The impact of the project will be high because PAPYRUS is able to reach out to a variety of youth worker groups and individuals, operating in different sectors and working in different ways, to build confidence and skills in working with youth refugees and asylum seekers. Other stakeholders include NGO's who work with youth, policy makers at all levels in the EU, humanitarian and aid workers and organisations and all professionals who might have contact with youth refugees.

The REFLECT LAB project intends to support universities, more specifically lecturers, to implement the currently discussed implementation of inquiry based learning. For this socio-scientific teaching/learning laboratories - REFLECT LABs - will be developed and tested. The objective is to establish an innovative course structure which fosters self-directed learning at Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Students do autonomous research in REFLECT LABs with socio-scientific methods towards pressing political and socially issues. Lecturers accompany and support this process and the critical discussion. As such the project sets a counterpoint to the widely criticized reduction of learning in HEI to sole knowledge transfer. TARGET GROUPS and RESULTS of the REFLECT LAB-Project:a) Lecturers at universitiesThey will be familiarized with the concept of inquiry based learning in the form of teaching/learning laboratories: By testing the REFLECT LABs at national level and by running the international professional development course. An IT-platform, which is accessible for all interested persons, serves for exchange, information and mutual support.b) StudentsLecturers will be trained so that their seminars will be structured in a more inquiry based way. The competence of differentiation, historical competence, competence of justice and reflection competence of students will be fostered adequately.c) PupilsFuture teachers are able to create inquiry based learning settings for their pupils, also at the extra-curricular learning environment university.

It is crucial to equip people with key competences, including the basic skills: good communication in mother tongue, foreign languages, interpersonal skills and digital abilities.The success and development of any community is brought about by affective change and development over a period of time. It is crucial to develop the young adults of tomorrow, the future leaders and entrepreneurs with the abilities to persuade, negotiate, to be flexible, be adaptable and to take sensible decisions.

Allied to a more creative and imaginative use of ICT the young person, people and communities who have these skills will prosper. This project aims to develop the young people\u2019s key competences in communication, interpersonal skills and ICT in its broadest sense. It is clear in schools that students engage with the online world at an increasing rate but the face to face contact and verbal discussion is weaker. This project will go a significant way to addressing that imbalance and skills shortage.  This work will develop their understanding of speaking a common language and listening and reacting positively to different cultures, therefore improving co-operation and cohesion.  The schools involved in the partnership have pupils coming from families belonging to a medium-low social economical background. The pupils experience outside the immediate area, the opportunities for travel and knowledge of other cultures are very limited.  Pupils unfortunately cannot always see the use of modern foreign languages in their limited context, so therefore are not motivated to develop language skills.  The current economic status of European countries is affecting the employment opportunities of all partnership pupils.   The target group for this project will be students 14-16 years old, with 16 from each school being offered the opportunity to travel; whilst many more will have access to the resources, lessons and project results.  The project will offer a chance to improve their social level and move up the social ladder.This project will allow pupils to experience the commonality of ICT content across five different schools, whilst developing new computing skills to address issues more creatively than merely presenting or re-presenting information.  They will experience different teaching strategies and they will use foreign languages in a full immersion context, in concrete situations of learning and of ordinary life.   The enhancement of communication skills will be enriched together with the knowledge of a much deeper understanding of issues which we face in Europe \u2013 for example Migration; Race; Ageing Populations; Mental Health.The groups of pupils will, hopefully as a result of this project, improve their English Language skills skills, interpersonal skills, problem solving, critical thinking and ICT, whilst developing their knowledge of other Education systems, culture, habits, and communication.

The identification of this skill and training gap is the outcome of a past research collaboration between the lead partner IME GSEVEE and the University of Patras partner.The Open up Entrepreneurship (OpEn) project fills this identified knowledge gap where existing and prospective entrepreneurs seek for business solutions into the digital technologies but lack the skills and capabilities to exploit the vast potential of e-business models in the global market.  OpEn project aims at exploiting innovative practices and technological tools to design and develop multi-disciplinary reusable Open Educational Resources for cultivating entrepreneurial mindset and economic thinking in the digital world.  It aspires to provide the basic principles of international entrepreneurship from the perspective of e-business in order to acquire the necessary skills, competencies and capabilities for the exploitation of the opportunities offered by the digital economy through the design and implementation of an open E-module and laboratory. Such an open material addresses a diverse set of user training needs taking into consideration the training needs of existing enterprises and young highly educated prospective entrepreneurs (i.e. students). The project partners will develop innovative common multi-language e-modules that will be applied and evaluated by the consortium's HEI and VET centers of social partners.  However due to the open feature of the educational material, the related e-modules could be used to support young entrepreneurs throughout Europe.", "http://www.mmu.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EL01-KA202-014168_4"], [2016, "Learning Games.

By submitting learning games to a process of monitoring, evaluating and assessing we will search for the relevant aspects of games and playing, that have a significant role in facilitating the communication and integration on a social level, in creating bridges to other fields of interest, in crossing language and cultural barriers, in overcoming stereotypes and in  providing the learner with a new insight and confidence in his cognitive potential.\u201cLearningGames\u201d will negotiate the idea of integrating games in formal and non-formal training structures proposing and discussing standards, outputs and evaluations supported by research and analyses that can be validated on a European level. Partnership Profile:The consortium of 6 partners from 6 countries represents a best practice partnership of (small) companies, institutions, NGOs, and Universities. Our team of experts will ensure a smooth implementation of the project. Through their network the participating institutions will realise a wide dissemination strategy on the local, national, regional and international level.\u201cLearningGames\u201d is rooted in the experience of the project promotor W-Point with non-formal learning frameworks in adult education and his interest in researching about the cognitive and educational value of games and their practical application.Methodology & Implementation Activities:Five MasterGames have been devised during the preparation of the project by the partners following clear guidelines. These MasterGames will be introduced, considered and discussed in the first of four transnational partner meetings. Playing activities (playing events) of the MasterGames monitored individually by every partner will take place between the meetings. The information gained through the monitoring and evaluations will be presented in the next partner meeting in the form of an overall assessment considering the factors predefined in the methodology of the project. In the next step, (equivalent to the 2nd meeting), the master MasterGame games will be exchanged in the partnership and consequently be played in the new environment, monitored by the respective partner. A similar procedure will take place in the 3rd meeting when we will also undertake a new assessment of the game considering the exchange and rotation factors. In the final (4th) meeting we will concentrate on the particularities of the evaluations, the validity of the observations and assess learning games matching results and insights with our predefined goals and objectives. The findings and results will be documented on the project\u2019s website.Observations done during the monitoring will be related to subjects that play a key role in the current discourse on learning games, e.g. flow of information, time frame and time line, (self-)evaluation, strategy and metacognitive factors. These concepts have been considered in the preparation but definition and usability of them will be revised and determined in the course of the project by the partnership as a result of the experienced praxis.The information flow between the partners will take place peer to peer and in the group. Forums, mailing and online conferences will complement the partner meetings and support the exchange.Results and Impact:The result will be a set of best practice guidelines for teachers, trainers and facilitators considering the monitoring and evaluation standards developed and applied during the project.The project\u2019s intention and vision is to give a further input to concepts and practices in adult education by emphasising the importance and status of ludic elements in learning.", "http://www.mmu.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA204-016747_5"], [2016, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 36073.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

We are entering a period of change in terms of language learning where languages are likely to become compulsory in KS4 and we are also developing new provision in KS5. We want to make sure that our languages teachers are fully equipped to meet these challenges and continue to provide outstanding MFL provision giving our pupils the best possible opportunities and continuing to promote a love of languages and interest and curiosity about other cultures. We want to encourage high uptake of languages KS5 and continue to build uptake in KS4. To do this we want to ensure that staff are fully confident in their language skills and cultural knowledge and have access to new and innovative teaching strategies and high quality resources.We want to increase the amount of target language used in the MFL classroom and increase extra-curricular provision so that learning can be reinforced. We will create new teaching materials which will incorporate more authentic resources and focus on increasing target language, reinforcing literacy concepts and promoting the value of other cultures. We want our whole school to reflect the importance of languages and other cultures, involving many different departments staff from different roles and backgrounds in promoting language learning. We want to introduce a European dimension into other subject areas and help pupils to recognise the status, value and importance of language learning and its relevance to their own lives. We want to create further international links to give our pupils a real insight into how children of their own age live in Spain and France, develop friendships with these pupils and become more open to other cultures and experiences.We want all of our staff to have access to high-quality CPD. We want support staff to increase their role and responsibility and be better equipped to respond to pupils\u2019 individual needs. MFL staff will become more flexible in their role and increase their skills and staff from other departments will add a new dimension to their teaching so all staff are better equipped for their future careers with an increased professional profile. We want staff to experience life within a different school setting and different educational system to to share their own good practice and assimilate the best practice of others.We have planned a project that will achieve our aims. We plan to send 5 members of MFL staff on one mobility each to Spain and France and also send other members of staff on Spanish/ French immersion courses over a two year period. By involving staff from many different areas of the school, we hope that this will have the maximum impact on our school\u2019s international dimension. We would like them to take part in training courses which include intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching ideas, methodology and placement in a school. The skills acquired will mean that we are better equipped in terms of staff competence to be able to deliver languages at KS4 and KS5, and ensure that our provision remains outstanding. There will be increased use of target language both within the languages classroom and across the school as a whole leading to higher attainment. Languages, other cultures and the European dimension will become visible across our whole school and integrated into every aspect of school life. Parents will be more involved in learning and teachers will be equipped with the skills and ideas to promote cultural events resulting in improved community cohesion.Involving the whole school in this project and developing links with French and Spanish schools will lead to a more open and accepting attitude among pupils, staff, parents and the community. Our pupils will become more outward-looking and more open to new opportunities in their future lives and careers. They will become more enthusiastic about languages and other cultures.There will be more extra-curricular provision introduced as a result of improvements in staff skills and knowledge and better resources.
