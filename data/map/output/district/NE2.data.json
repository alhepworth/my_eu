The challenge is, therefore, for educational institutions to build new roads towards education and stable employment for young people. One of these roads is practice-based learning, as it takes place in the spectra of non-formal to formal learning. The partners in this project agree that this learning approach should be taken much more into consideration, and a way to do that, is to widely share information on ways to document and assess learners who are learning-by-doing. \r\nConsequently, the project seeks to discuss, brainstorm, write and assemble thoughts and ways, which explains the ways that the partners assess and documents the learners\u2019 competences in the spectra of non-formal-formal, but practice-based learning. The partners all play an important part in rethinking education and training. We are organizations and institutions working with learners who have been left behind by the educational system and/or labor market because they have not been able to fit into conventional education (NEET). In our workshops the learners are presented with a learning concept building on practical work and production of real goods and services, purchased by costumers. Here learning unfolds in binding working communities where theoretical instruction is integrated in practical work. \r\nThe partners will work on 2 products. The first seeks to be a helpful tool for others working in the spectra of non-formal to formal learning with a practice-based focus. It is a catalogue presenting the partners\u2019 national contexts and then the ways the partners assess and document the learners\u2019 competences and progress in order to help them into further education and/or the labor market. The second is an article targeted EU and national politicians and opinion-makers within education, social and labor market policies. \r\nThe project has a simple cycle with 4 transnational meetings, which serves as a platform for the partners to discuss and develop the catalogue and article on a continuous basis, in order to reach the best-value products possible. That most of the time at the transnational meetings are reserved for product development ensures alignment and agreement on the material produced and provides a forum for discussions. VET and labor market will be involved by commenting on the catalogue and the use of it \u2013 their input will have an impact on catalogue the article. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the partner organizations as well as the target groups. The partners learn, share, discuss and develop together, which makes for professional growth. The project partners achieve an expanded network with likeminded colleagues with whom they can discuss and develop ideas concerning practice-based learning and documentation of non-formal learning in particular.\r\nThe direct target groups \u2013 the educational institutions working with practice-based learning - gain new tools, which they can implement and adapt to their national settings. The partners all differ on the scale of non-formal to formal learning, and have main cooperation with different ministries. This is a strength for the partnership and it ensures that the receivers of the catalogue can find examples fitting their own national settings. The political stakeholders and opinion-makers will also gain insight into the importance of assessing and documenting practice-based learning, and hopefully realize that the educational approach of this is important to have in the educational system in all countries. \r\nBy putting the value of practice-based non-formal-formal leaning on the European educational map, a big problem in Europe today is targeted. By sharing and collecting ideas and ways to document and asses, the project also makes the approach more visible and accessible. This to benefit the young in NEET situations and help them in their future endeavors. The mass youth unemployment has to do with young people not having viable options. For many young people, a stay at a school/institution with the focus on practice\u2014based learning is the best solution. \r\nThe material produced during the project\u2019s lifetime will be disseminated via a subpage on IPSO\u2019s website. We know that this website will also be used by the majority of the project partners after the project has finished, and, thus, that the material will be used and disseminated in the future.\r\nAll this is part of the agenda in a joint project concerning recognition of the production school form as an indispensable part of the educational system.", "http://www.idlimited.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA202-004305_6"], [2014, "Enterprising People - Practical Vocational Learning", "Interactive Development Education Ltd", 25985.0, 2, 2, "We have confirmed our partner again as Hvidovre Production School in Copenhagen following a first placement as part of the 2010 Leonardo da Vinci Mobility call and a second completed in October 2013 with the project end date of February 2014.

The revenue generated by this industry is more than \u20ac400M in Europe. However, the European Union has a net negative trade-balance in bee products, mainly honey, producing only 54% of its demand (the EU imports from cheaper producers, namely Argentina and China). However, despite its importance and the obvious potential for growth, serious problems face the sector. Bee populations and beekeepers numbers in Europe have been falling at an alarming rate. Honey imports to the EU have risen by 20% since 2001. Action to halt the decline in the European beekeeping sector is also urgently needed because bees also play a vital role in agricultural productivity. The role of bees as a pollinator remains the most important economic contribution, far outweighing the collective importance of all hive products. The economic value of pollination worldwide is estimated to be at least \u20ac153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. More than 70% of food crops and 35% of food production still depend on pollinators; 84% of vegetables grown in Europe depend on pollination.\nOur project will develop the first monitoring tool that would detect changes in honey bee activity within the beehive for the effective management of bees. Changes in the activity within the hive will indicate early signs of potential swarming and possible poor health, so the beekeeper can intervene to manage the colony. The tool will allow beekeepers to remotely diagnose colony status without the invasive opening of hives for physical inspection.\nThis will increase the efficiency of beekeeping allowing small and hobby beekeepers to more closely manage their colonies and predict behaviour that requires intervention remotely, and will allow commercial beekeepers to keep more hives over greater geographical distances so increasing their efficiency and profitability.", 267382.0, 1467690.0, 5, 9, "Swarmonitor", null, "http://www.arnia.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/149698.jpg", "fp7_105847_952820913"], [1509494400000, 1588204800000, "Beehive health IoT application to fight Honey Bee Colony Mortality", "Arnia Limited", "For the past 15 years, European beekeepers have been reporting weakening bee numbers and colony losses. The situation\nis worsening as according to a recent study of the European Union Reference Laboratory for honeybee health, some\ncountries are losing up to a third of their colonies every year. Honey bees are essential in the pollination of many agricultural\ncrops and concerns have been raised about the ability to maintain the pollination services required to ensure pollinator\ndependent food production. Nowadays European citizens consider the decline in bee numbers to be the most serious\nenvironmental issue \u2013 more than climate change.\nThe IoBee consortium wants to disrupt the beekeeping market by reducing colony losses by at least 50%! Through this\nproject, we aim to pilot and commercialise a new Internet of Things (IoT) sensor application that can automatically assess\nthe threat status to a colony. The system will wirelessly transmit results to a cloud server, making field data available for\nrunning prediction models, perform risk assessments, issue warnings and make historical analysis using a SDSS- Spatial\nDecision Support System. This will allow beekeepers to be active participants in colony surveillance programmes with\nunprecedented accuracy and responsiveness, and as a result, unhealthy or threatened colonies will be remotely detected\nearlier with greater precision, saving millions of Euros in potential losses.\nMany systems to monitor beehives already exist in the market.

The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety. Thus the more analyte present, the more binding of secondary antibody occurs and the more signal is produced.", 1000949.0, 3779421.0, 6, 11, "SALIANT", "http://www.saliant.eu/home", "http://selectiveantibodies.com/www/", null, "fp7_95761_995416038"], [1277942400000, 1404086400000, "NANOTECHNOLOGICAL TOOLKITS FOR MULTI-MODAL DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENT MONITORING", "Selective Antibodies Limited", "NAMDIATREAM will develop a cutting edge nanotechnology-based toolkit for multi-modal detection of biomarkers of most common cancer types and cancer metastases, permitting identification of cells indicative of early disease onset in a high-specificity and throughput format in clinical, laboratory and point-of-care devices.
