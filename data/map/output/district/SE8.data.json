In 2012 the role of volunteering in the EU was highlighted in a resolution adopted by the European Parliament. The resolution stated that \"the competences and knowledge gained by volunteers should help them find jobs or be recognised as part of their training\". Although different target groups can have different motivation for volunteering, depending on their age, gender or life aspirations, as a result they all develop new competences or improve existing ones, gain work experience and boost their personal development. These are competences and experiences which could be used in a variety of different jobs, help achieve new qualifications, build a career or simply gain personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, they are often not properly validated in a way that would be recognised by public institutions, certifying bodies or potential employers. Our partnership aims to develop a methodology for validation of different competences acquired through volunteering.\r\n\r\nThe EQF was developed to make qualifications more readable and understandable all over Europe. Different European countries are developing different NQF and are on different levels of implementation. Finding different validation tools and comparing the structure of them with the NQF and also the EQF will on the one hand show the differences between NQF but on the other hand support the comparison of NQF and gives a chance to include a new European validation tool for volunteers.\r\n\r\nWithin these project nine different states/organisations are working together. On the one hand it is a mixture of organisations who are experts in the field of competence validation (f.e. University of Paderborn) and organisations who are dealing with social inclusion (f.e. Fundaci\u00f3n CV Pacto Empleo Valencia). On the other hand it is a combination of partners who are experienced, little-experienced and not experienced in European Union projects.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is the visualisation, documentation and recognition of formally, non-formally and informally acquired competences in the field of volunteering. Based on that, the development of an online tool for validation of volunteering competences is made. The project objectives are creating an online tool for validation of volunteering competences, which makes the management of human resources of organisations easier, who are working with volunteers by providing them with an online and multilevel validation methodology helpful during recruitment, training and referencing. The access to validation tools for disadvantaged groups will be improved by creating a website which includes a personal and multilevel competences endorsement mechanism and information about different NQF and the validation in another countries. We are supporting awareness raising of public body and policy makers about the importance of a common validation framework for the competences acquired through volunteering in third-sectors and facilitating the recognition of volunteering competences by relevant stakeholders by engaging them in national seminars and transnational conference.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes within this project will be:\r\n- information through a structure analysis about the NQF in the partner countries and validation tools for competences,\r\n- a guideline of validation methodologies from different countries in different languages available on a website,\r\n- an online tool for validation of competences (tested and improved) available in different languages, and\r\n- an ebook available for everyone containing all information from the project and additional one.\r\n\r\nProject short term targeted group is composed by volunteers first job seekers, volunteers unemployed, volunteers switching sector, career changers, third sectors freelancers, human resources managers of NGOs, volunteering associations and social services public body.

It is designed in response to two European policy challenges for which European voluntary and other third sector organisations are not fully prepared: 1.  The European Commission\u2019s recommendation on the validation of non-formal and informal learning (2012/C 398/01), which acknowledges the role of civil society actors in facilitating processes for the validation of non-formal and informal learning; and 2. The EYV Alliance's policy recommendations following the European year of Volunteering in 2011: creating an enabling environment, enhancing quality, recognition of volunteering, and acknowledging its value.\r\n\r\nBringing together educational institutions, third-sector organisations and other actors from 10 countries (BG, FI, HU, IT, LV, PO, PT, RO, TK and UK), the FutVol project approaches  these issues by designing and testing a new skills concept aimed for adult learners who are volunteers. The skills concept combines a set of defined future volunteering skills, peer learning and foresight activities.\r\nIn order to design and implement the new skills concept, the FutVol project shall:\r\n\r\n- develop and test a design thinking -based peer learning model to help volunteers acquire what are defined in this project as \u2018future skills\u2019\r\n- design a tool for volunteers to observe and manage change in their everyday work using e.g. weak signal detection methods\r\n- a future skills in volunteering skills concept that is aligned with the European Key Competences ofr Lifelong Learning with validation processes tools for the learning outcomes that will be tested by participating learners\r\n- produce a publication \u2018Future Skills Guide to Volunteering', the aim of which is to combine grassroots observations of change in volunteering with expert insight on skills needs to raise awarenes across Europe\r\n\r\nAs a result:\r\n\r\n- Adult learners (volunteers) will acquire a set of skills that they can use in many contexts such as work or formal education and learn about how their volunteering relates to European citizenship,\r\n- Partners and stakeholders will have a clear understanding of future skills needs in volunteering, documented learning outcomes for related learning processes and processes and their validation. This helps them in volunteer supervision and strategic planning.\r\n- Volunteer managers, volunteers and other third-sector actors have access to a peer learning model that can help volunteers and their organisations gain future skills and get to manage change in their environment. The model will give voluntary and other third sector organisations easy-to-use tools to be used for training, and the activities tested will yield new information about the future of volunteering on a grassroots level.\r\n- The \"Future skills guide to volunteering\u201d publication will help volunteers, partners and practitioners in the field understand skills needs and volunteer supervision and to plan their work accordingly,\r\n- Various other stakeholders such as decision makers can build on their awareness on issues affecting the voluntary sector, which will help them in developing infrastructure for volunteering in general.\r\n\r\nThe FutVol project also aims to raise discussion about the future of volunteering in Europe by engaging various stakeholders in its activities: learners shall as part of their learning process collect information about the future of volunteering at the grassroots level,  and thepartners shall produce publications and organise two multiplier events each and joint webinars to reach experts and policy makers in the debate. \r\n\r\nFor the long term, the FutVol project works towards increasing the ability of voluntary and other third sector organisations to build their volunteers\u2019 capacities for understanding their learning needs to meet future challenges, and to provide a skills concept that is useful for learners and easy to adapt to many contexts.", "http://www.ecocom.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA204-034696_3"], [2015, "Future Skills for the Third Sector", "Eco Communities", 146527.0, 10, 10, "The objective of the Future Skills for the Third Sector (FUTUR3) project is to help third-sector employers (associations, NGOs, foundations etc.), employees and educational organisations that train professionals in the field to identify future skills needs in the sector and to prepare for them.This project focuses on organisations with volunteering activities, and the main target group is professionals working with volunteers: volunteer managers, coordinators and so on.\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe, third-sector employees\u2019 educational and employment backgrounds are diverse. Employees performing similar tasks with volunteers have a wide educational background ranging from vocational qualifications to research degrees, and differences between EU Member States are vast, as the third sector is more structured in some countries than others. Occupational standards for professionals working with volunteers have been developed in some countries (e.g. the UK), but in most countries they do not exist. \r\n\r\nThe growing importance of the third sector as an employer has been emphasisedf throughout Europe due to, for instance, a reorganisation of welfare services, which places growing pressures on the sector to provide effective professional services and for its HR capacities. This also means the greater involvement of volunteers.  These factors make knowledge management in the sector challenging as the need for growing professionalisation has not in all cases been met by professional development opportunities or codified standards that display the level of professionalism required of personnel.\r\n\r\nThird-sector employees in some countries have identified e.g. ICTs and social media, cooperation with a range of partners and dealing with uncertainty in e.g. funding and volunteering as the most pressing future skills needs. Universities, VET centres, and other educational institutions need information on future skills needs to prepare students for employment in the third sector. Both the personnel and volunteers of third-sector organisations make a significant contribution to inclusion, well-being and social cohesion in all European countries.\r\n\r\nThrough its future-oriented outlook and by engaging a wide range stakeholders and experts, the FUTUR3 project shall address these needs. It aims to increase understanding of skills needs in the third sector on a European level and to discuss them from a future perspective. The project will discuss education-work life correspondence in this field of employment, combining the macro-level (the European thrid sector as an employer) with localised peer learning activities for meeting future needs in supervising volunteers.\r\n\r\nFUTUR3 aims to:\r\n-Increase knowledge about the educational paths, qualifications and careers of volunteer managers and similar third-sector professionals in Europe.\r\n-Increase understanding about future skills needs in the third sector to help stakeholders, especially educational institutions and third-sector organisations, to manage and respond to these needs\r\n-Increase the ability of European third-sector organisations to cooperate on volunteering issues. \r\n\r\nThe working methods of FUTUR3 include:\r\n-Benchmarking process to collect and publish information about employment and work-education correspondence in 10 countries, incorporating discussions with third-sector and futures specialists in order to gain insight about the current situation and future needs of the sector. This will result in a downloadable report.\r\n-Peer learning model tested locally by e.g. volunteer managers. It includes activities that prepare third-sector employees to identify skills gaps and make joint plans for professional development that meets future needs.\r\n-General awareness-raising\r\n\r\nAs a result, staff in third sector organisations will be better equipped to manage their duties and to support volunteers at the grassroots level; third sector organisations will have a better understanding of professional development needs and can improve their performance as employers; local education providers can also use the new information to review their curricula. There will also be increased cooperation between third sector organisations on the local level.\r\n\r\nIn each country the project's outputs and results will help educational institutions and policymakers in the fields of education and labour to understand changing skills demands in a growing employment sector. \r\n\r\nThe desired long-term impact is an increased ability within the third sector and VET and other educational institutions educating or training third-sector personnel to tackle growing demands of professionalisation.

Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education.

Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project \u2018Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions\u2019 (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas.
