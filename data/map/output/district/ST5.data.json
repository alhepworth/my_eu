Over 500M people are afflicted by this disease world wide; however, this is an underestimate as incidence is rapidly rising as PF becomes better diagnosed. There is currently no efficacious therapeutic intervention which can either halt or reverse the disease process. Pulmonary Fibrosis carries a very poor prognosis of less than 3 years from diagnosis. Hence, PF morbidity and mortality imposes a huge socioeconomic burden as a chronic irreversible lung condition across the European Region, contributing significantly to the annual 102 billion Euros respiratory health cost and rising; most is due to hospital and community care support as well as early retirement / loss working days in those affected before 65yrs. There is a desperate unmet clinical need for PF patients across Europe and globally. PF thus presents a major therapeutic challenge. Recent research in PF pathogenesis suggests that inadequate regeneration of alveolar epithelium following presumed recurrent micro injury is a key factor in propagating development of fibrosis (over-scarring) within the lung. Whilst a number of plausible mechanisms may be responsible for this repair dysfunction in the alveolar epithelium, a likely hypothesis is that presence of a PF- related aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation prevents a healthy epithelial cell \u2013 fibroblast balance. It follows that modulation of alveolar repair processes, and influence on fibro / myofibroblast transdifferentiation, represents a novel target in anti-PF therapeutics.

To investigate the reasons for the exclusion of the elderly in clinical trials and to provide solutions for this problem. INTRODUCTION. Although the elderly account for high drug consumption, they are underrepresented in clinical trials. With an increasingly ageing European population it is essential to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of drugs. Clinical trials need to take into account the relevant issues of this population, i.e. changed metabolism, multiple chronic conditions and poly-pharmacy. To examine this issue and effect a paradigm shift it is necessary to target gatekeepers and stakeholders of clinical trials. METHODS. The project will be coordinated by the Medical Economics and Research Centre, Sheffield, with guidance from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Ageing at Keele University, UK. The 5 work packages (WP) will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of highly qualified experts in Geriatrics, Gerontology and social sciences. WP1 will involve a systematic review of the literature and review of ongoing clinical trials to assess the extent of exclusion of the elderly. Based on these findings WP2 and WP 3 will investigate why the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials and what can be done to improve their participation. This will be carried out in 9 countries: UK, Spain, Holland, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Israel and the Czech Republic. WP2 will research the views of health professionals and ethicists using structured questionnaires. WP3 will explore the perceptions of older patients and carers using a focus group methodology.

It is estimated that in Europe there are 30 million asthma sufferers and 15,000 will die each year from an asthma attack even though the drugs used to treat asthma are safe, effective and if used correctly, would prevent many of these deaths. Asthma attacks result from ineffective monitoring leading to inadequate doses of prescribed drugs and therefore poor control of symptoms. Monitoring is vital as asthmatics will often not notice a gradual worsening of symptoms and will not adjust their medication accordingly potentially leading to a severe attack. Peak flow meters are currently used by asthmatics to monitor symptoms on a regular basis but compliance is poor as they are difficult to use, particularly in the young or old, and the technique required can cause exacerbation of symptoms plus the output then requires interpretation. We have developed a prototype of our easy to use home monitoring device that uses normal tidal breathing to generate breath profiles that change as symptoms deteriorate. The device incorporates our patented sensor housed in the mouth piece, which captures the breath profiles, attached to a handheld screen to display the interpretation of the breath profiles using an easy to understand traffic light system.

PH is a rare and life-threatening disease, present at birth, characterised by high endogenous levels of oxalate that damage the kidney and cause renal failure. Enteric elimination of oxalate via the gut provide an alternative elimination pathway for the oxalate and treatment with pharmacological doses of O. formigenes would facilitate such enteric elimination. The treatment employs a new approach whereby bacterial breakdown of excessive oxalate occurs in the gut, inducing an alternative pathway for the oxalate, thereby protecting the kidneys from failure. The O. formigenes approach to treat PH is an ideal model for bacterial treatment of metabolic disease.\nThe three SME participants will utilise the expertise of nine specialised research providers to increase the understanding of the characteristics of the sensitive, anaerobic and highly specialised O. formigenes, to implement the manufacturing process to obtain a clinically effective drug, to optimise drug delivery and to develop specialised analytical methods to monitor clinical effects following treatment. Technology advancements will be confirmed by clinical studies in PH patients and by mapping the presence of the bacteria before and after treatment with the O. formigenes drug.\nThe ELIMOX project will advance current standards and methodology in i) manufacture of anaerobic bacteria for pharmaceutical use, ii) identification, quantification and tracking of microbes in the human gut and their impact on human microbiota during treatment, iii) optimisation of tools to monitor clinical effects during treatment with anaerobic bacteria.", 451586.0, 2174541.0, 6, 12, "ELIMOX", "http://elimox.se/", "http://www.cobrabio.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/158873.jpg", "fp7_110344_953744353"]]}}, "7LA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1419984000000, "Wearable Wireless Kit for Detection and Monitoring of Ischemic Conditions", "Hallmark Electronics Limited", "Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) and its direct consequences is the number one cause of death in high income and middle income countries such as EU countries and the number four cause of death in low income countries; in 2008, IHD caused 7.25Mn deaths globally and a little over 1Mn in the European Region.
