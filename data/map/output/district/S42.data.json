There is however a current trend for axles to be withdrawn from service before this because of corrosion on the surface long before their design lives. The decision to withdraw from service is taken without the full knowledge of the way in which the failure will result from corrosion, as this requires a crack to initiate and the mechanism for this is unknown. Cracks in axles can also initiate from ballast strikes and electrical faults. The failure rate is about 2 axles per year in the UK. If these withdrawals take place while a train is in-service there is a consequent significant cost associated while the train is out of service for additional maintenance. Inspection of the axles for cracking takes place at intervals set by knowledge of crack growth rates and inspection sensitivities. The most sensitive inspection methods are surface inspection methods designed for crack detection (such as MPI, eddy current and ACFM) and these do not typically attempt to measure the corrosion. However inspection of axles while the train is in service is still required and this is inconvenient and costly for the train operators. WOLAXIM aims to provide three new and better methods of crack detection and corrosion assessment for railway axle inspection. One method is for the exposed body of the axles (intended primarily for freight wagon or passenger trailing axles) and can be carried out automatically as the vehicles pass an inspection station that could be installed in carriage sidings or marshalling yards. A second method is specifically for the hollow axles of high speed trains and aims to improve the speed of the inspection and improve crack detection reliability. This could be deployed while the train is in depot overnight and without dismantling of the wheelset. The third method is to improve the measurement of corrosion and therefore the sentencing of corro", 266167.0, 1261622.0, 3, 9, "WOLAXIM", "http://www.wolaxim.eu", "http://www.appliedinspection.co.uk", null, "fp7_96662_984542241"], [1367366400000, 1430352000000, "Development of a high sensitivity ultrasonic phased array Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method for the early detection of creep damage (Type IV cracking) in alloy steels used in high temperature, high", "Applied Inspection Limited", "Creep is the time-dependent, thermally assisted deformation of a component operating under stress. Metal pressure components such as boiler tubing, headers, and steam piping in fossil-fired power plants operate at thermal conditions (above ~1,000\u00baF [538\u00baC]) conducive to causing creep damage over the operating life of the component.\nTo ensure safe and reliable operation of such components in service, utilities periodically use non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to inspect these components for damage. These inspections are largely targeted at detecting late stage creep damage in which cracking is active in the component and provides qualitative rather than quantitative data.\nRecent advances in NDE technology have provided enhanced capabilities for incipient creep failure detection. CreepTest will seek to apply time reversal focusing and full matrix capture techniques that have already shown a capability to identify early stage creep damage. A library of defects will be produced with the aim of providing inspection limits and the probability of detection for the techniques developed in the project and thus enable accurate life cycle prediction for components under inspection.\nThe objectives of the project will be:\n\u2022\uf020To develop new ultrasonic phased NDE testing techniques for the detection of Type IV creep cracking\n\u2022\uf020To determine the sensitivity of defect detection and the limits of technique/system/ultrasonic array performance.\n\u2022\uf020To produce a field prototype NDE ultrasonic array system, signal processing and software for the examination of power plant steam pipe welds for creep damage.\n\u2022\uf020Quantify results to assess the extent of creep detection and categorise into (i) cavitation formation (ii) cavitation coalescence (iii) formation of micro-cracking and (iv) macro-cracking.\n\u2022\uf020To demonstrate the NDE systems performance on in-service, in-situ steam pipe welds and to validate the technique results against representative samples containing realistic creep defects", 256231.0, 1045921.0, 4, 7, "CreepTest", null, "http://www.appliedinspection.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155761.jpg", "fp7_108424_984542241"], [1448928000000, 1527724800000, "Whole Life Rail Axle Assessment and Improvement Using Ultrasonic Phased array and Corrosion Inspection Systems", "Applied Inspection Limited", "The overall objective of the RAAI project is to develop novel NDT solutions for the corrosion assessment and crack detection as well as reliability software for high cycle variable amplitude corrosion fatigue of rail axles. Currently, the most sensitive non-destructive testing methods for inspection of rail axles are surface inspection methods designed for crack detection (such as MPI, eddy current and ACFM) and these do not typically attempt to measure corrosion. Besides current trend is that axles are withdrawn from service long before their design lives because of suspected corrosion developed on the axle surface. The decision to withdraw from service is taken without the full knowledge of the way in which the failure will result from corrosion as this requires a crack to initiate and the mechanism for this is unknown. \nRAAI aims to develop two novel methods: 1) corrosion assessment 2) phased array ultrasonic. The first method assesses the effect of corrosion on high-cycle fatigued component such as the axle and evaluates its remnant life thereby improving the sentencing of corroded axles. The second method is specifically for hollow axles of high speed trains and aims to improve the speed of the inspection (by 75%) and improve crack detection reliability (almost 100% with a crack of 2-3 mm depth) without dismantling the wheel-set and with minimum time of inspection. The primary impact of the project is to improve the competitiveness of the SMEs in the project by enabling them to provide NDT solutions to reducing the cost of and improving the safety margins of rolling stock operation.

From a strict techno-economic aspect, the two CSP technologies which are currently commercially viable are those based on parabolic trough and Linear Fresnel Reflector designs. Parabolic trough concentrators are the most widely deployed type of solar thermal power plant. Most of the existing parabolic trough plants operate up to 400\u00b0C, but with recent technological advances the maximum operating temperature of newly commissioned plants can reach 550\u00b0C. Solar thermal power plants still face several technical problems related to the structural integrity and inspection of critical components such as the absorber tube and piping of the coolant system. It is currently impossible to inspect the absorber tube as it is located inside a glass envelope under vacuum. Moreover a significant proportion of the coolant system is insulated to minimise heat losses and therefore it cannot be inspected unless the insulation has been removed beforehand. One of the highest priorities for the European solar thermal energy industry is the significant improvement of the structural reliability of critical components of CSP plants. This should involve a solid reduction in inspection and maintenance costs mainly associated with unpredicted failures and leaks.\nINTERSOLAR seeks to decrease by a noticeable margin the number of failures associated with the coolant system and absorber tubes of CSP plants resulting in the minimisation of corrective maintenance costs. The consortium members of the project will achieve this through the development and successful implementation of an intelligent guided waves inspection platform based on the use of preferably non-contact Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer Sensors (EMATs).", 162323.0, 1084671.0, 5, 9, "INTERSOLAR", null, "http://www.appliedinspection.co.uk", null, "fp7_110019_984542241"], [1491004800000, 1553990400000, "An ultrasonic non-destructive testing system for detection and quantification of early stage subsurface creep damage in the thermal power generation industry", "Applied Inspection Limited", "Creep damage detection in pressurised steam line components is a major concern in the power generation industry. Currently, replica metallography is used to inspect these components.

This results in catastrophic component failures which cost the industry more than \u20ac500,000 in lost revenue per day out of operation. \nTo combat this, we will commercialise the CreepUT system, which employs a proprietary Ultrasonic (UT) technique that enables the early detection of sub-surface creep damage.
