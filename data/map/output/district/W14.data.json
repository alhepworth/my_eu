However, employers require graduates who are prepared in both professional and personal terms to handle tasks and problems in the workplace. The subject Professional experience provides a link between the world of education and work. However, we have noticed that work experience is often only formal and does not bring expected results. Previously we implemented a project of foreign professional experience through mobility, entitled \u201cPraxis abroad improves the school quality\". The impact of the project among all of the parties involved, convinced us that it is indeed the correct way to increase the quality of professional practice and hence also of the professional formation and competencies of the students in order to prepare the graduates for both national and international labor market, and at the same time to increase the prestige of the school.

Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by developing technologies along with the policies for their use.

The second stage is CASE STUDIES wherein the partners will identify the privacy, data protection and ethical issues arising from five different emerging technologies and their applications. The third stage focuses on CITIZENS. The partners will analyse various existing surveys to assess citizen concerns and knowledge of the way in which their data are collected, stored and used and their concerns about new technologies and how their concerns have changed over time. The partners will examine 20 top websites and interview data collectors to assess how easy or difficult it is for citizens to access their information and to find out it is being used. The fourth and final stage focuses on development of a NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PRIVACY AND ETHICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. The partners will develop four scenarios as an element in this new framework, which is based on an integration of the results of this study and on privacy impact assessment guidelines such as those of the UK. The partners will invite a multi-disciplinary panel of external experts to comment on the deliverables and discuss issues raised in a workshop at each stage. The project will conclude with a final conference to which experts, policy-makers and other stakeholders will be invited in order to debate the project\u2019s findings and recommendations.", 193775.0, 1068989.0, 4, 4, "PRESCIENT", null, "http://www.trilateralresearch.com/", null, "fp7_93108_999705281"], [1454284800000, 1548892800000, "Developing Careers through Social Networks and Transversal Competencies", "Trilateral Research Ltd", "A key challenge in improving life-long learning, employee flexibility, and skill-matching is the assessment of workplace relevant competencies and the planning of individual learning paths for career development.

It is also a chance to follow courses at this school for employees.\r\n\r\nThere are also plans to start a commonly organised school (Graaf Willem V college)  somewhere in the Netherlands \u2013 Germany border area, where students graduate who meet the criteria in both the Dutch and the German market\r\n\r\nTalented Engineering students have been enrolled in its Plus program  since 2016; 4 Engineering students have worked on a development project in Gambia, together with Stichting Bouwen Nederland as well as the local population. This cooperation is continued in the years to come. \r\nThis year a number of students in the Automotive department together with a regional garage company, will start a project in Ethiopia as part of their excellence program. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, an application was done this year for MIJN SCHOOL for 6 students. Many of these students have had only little opportunity to meet people outside of their relatively limited social circle. We also applied for funds for one accompanying person. \r\n\r\nIn this application the Graafschap College applied for three teams of employees for subsidy; the team of building services for Denmark ,the team of commercial and legal services for Germany.and the team of employees for training co-teaching with EQF level 1and 2.  The Main topics are:\r\nExchanging knowledge and skills in a certain professional areas, with a focus on innovative methods\r\nImproving a foreign language, in most cases German or English\r\ncooperation in the future with these schools\r\ntraining for co-teaching\r\n\r\nSome employees of the department of health and care Graafschap College applied for subsidy for individual internships abroad. They already described their personal and professional skills they would like to learn in schools or companies abroad.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has appointed de Achterhoek as anticipation region.Graafschap College actively participates in collaborations and administrative communication structures such as Achterhoek 2020, Platform Onderwijs Arbeidsmarkt and the Provincie Gelderland because of the Human Capital Agenda.From this cooperation, Graafschap College will play an initiating role in the future of our students and employees, in order to meet the requirements of well-educated employees who can be hired on a flexible basis. Employees who will continue to learn throughout and who can work in an international environment. In relation to this, Euregio plays an increasingly important role.In its new strategic plan 2015 \u2013 2020, Graafschap College has listed five strategic policies, one of them being:education in the Euregio network  and in an international global context.Graafschap College aims to offer both students and employees a learning environment where they acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to work as a professional in the dynamic, complex, increasingly international and culturally diverse society.These competences can be achieved by physical mobility. In order to (further) develop our students\u2019 international and intercultural competences, Graafschap College also offers internationalisation at home. Graafschap College students are prepared for a dynamic labour market focused on an international environment. Think of the border region with Germany for example.Main topics from September 2015 (start of the charter)In the fall of 2015, a study trip to Finland was organized together will colleagues from ROC Twente, for members of both Boards, directors and educational managers. Its central theme was VET in an international context. At this moment, the insights acquired are used to write the new framework document on internationalization, and a hands on approach in all sectors.Plusprogram for talented Engineering students:Four Engineering students will leave to Gambia in half a year\u2019s time, to work on a development project in close cooperation with Stichting Bouwen Nederland.Graafschap College by now participates in RADIX. This is a reference group of a number of internationalization coordinators of different regional schools. Graafschap College is secretary for the new Intereg V application, for the Gronau-Enschede euregion.At this moment Graafschap College looks into the possibility to become co-organiser of the so-called Europe Summer School. This implies offering a one or two week summer course to foreign students.De sector educatie en participatie stelt vanaf dit jaar 15.000 euro ter beschikking voor studenten en medewerkers om meer ruimte te bieden voor  internationale stages (soort scholarships)For this call, the above means that in comparison to previous calls, the accent shifts towards Germany. We are applying for a fund to allow 23 employees to increase their knowledge of the German language and to cooperate with a Berufskollege in Berlin. The cooperation started in 2015, is extended and enhanced at the least.By mutual successful visits to each other\u2019s school, a project is now started to have students orientate on their profession, language skills (German and English) in order to prepare students even better for the professional and labour market. These students explicitly chose for optional program 1 International. Students take classes half of the day, or cooperate in a project (English and German) and join German students to their internship workplaces in Berlin. By now both optional programs have already been translated internationally for the Berlin Berufsschule, so that students can be received well prepared. It is expected the project will have a renewing and promotional influence on students, and that programs can be tuned into each other.Almost all students are offered German classes by now!Just like last year, there is an application for MIJN SCHOOL studentsBeside gaining practical skills, it is mostly about giving students the opportunity to become acquainted with another culture, society, and educational system. Many of the students enrolled in this project have been offered the opportunity to meet people outside their relatively limited social life. The vocational aspect of the exchange will be substantial. A guide is included in the application for this group. We apply for a fund for 63 students for a foreign internship in Germany. Last year there were 25 students.In total 33 employees and 244 students have been taken up in this call. Over 100 students more than last call (especially more Technical and Healthcare students).", "http://www.bedsandbars.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA116-022699_20"], [2014, "Graafschap college is going abroad 7", "Beds and Bars Limited", 189892.0, 11, 22, "Context and background:\r\n\r\nThe relevance of internationalisation of intermediate and higher professional education is firmly  emphasized and facilitated by the European Union, as it appears from the \u201cBruges Communiqu\u00e9\u201d and the ensuing EU-policy for this topic up to 2020. In its framework memorandum internationalization (appendix 1) funding programmes are described on the basis of which Graafschap College has been able to carry out several successful international projects. The projects of Graafschap College carried out within the programmes Leonardo da Vinci and VETpro have been assessed as  'Very Good' by the Dutch national agency of the Lifelong Learning Programme.  \r\n\r\nMerely because of the geographical location of our Achterhoek region in relation to Germany, internationalisation is a key focus area in the strategic policy of Graafschap College. Over the past few years Graafschap College has frequently gained experience with international work placements and student and teacher exchange projects. In its strategic policy \u201cSolid education for a solid region\u201d, the concept of labour globalisation has been adopted as an important development which Graafschap College wants to join. In 2014 and 2015 our institution wants to realize even more ambitions than in the recent past.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\n\r\nIn the next few years internationalisation is going to play an increasingly prominent role for Graafschap College. It is inescapable that the opening of the borders in Europe will also have major consequences for the Achterhoek region and that our school will take an even more active role in this matter. Starting point of the policy is that all activities and projects should match the goals of Graafschap College as described in the strategic policy 2010-2015. \r\n\r\n- leading player in the region\r\n\r\n- stimulating Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\n- innovation as a result of creativity\r\n\r\n- success from talent\r\n\r\n- strong professionals in a professional organisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasing international awareness and compentences among students and staff corresponds with all strategic goals. Cross-border experiences and encounters are accellerators of creativity, talents and learning power. In this way Graafschap College, as part of her core tasks,  gives an innovative impuls to the labour market. This impuls is even more desirable because, relatively speaking, both the economy and the working population in the Achterhoek region are more introverted than those in other regions. It stands to reason that the favourable geographical location in relation to Germany will be more and more benefited from, in particular the Euregion, i.e. the federal states of Nordrhein-Westfalen and Munsterland. Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in the field of exchange programmes and work placements in countries outside the Euregion.\r\n\r\nDerived from its strategic mission Graafschap College wants to be a school offering full scope international development opportunities for students and staff. International experiences are an integral and prominent part of the institutional portfolio. \r\n\r\nThe students are from the departments of Technics and Infromation Technology, Health and Welfare and Economics and Financial Services. In all cases it concerns students of levels 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe international work placements for students take place in Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, France, Finland and Portugal during the period from July 2014 till May 2016. The placements cover periods ranging from 3 until 20 weeks. \r\n\r\nFor a description of waht a student has do do before, during and aftera n international work placement and what requirements apply, we refer to appendix 3, pages 15 and 16. From students\u2019 presentations and reports it appears time and again that they have increased their language skills and developed an open mind for habits in a different culture. Their independence has grown enormously and they have learned to deal with clients and customers with a different social and cultural background. \r\n\r\nThe international work placement for staff members takes place in Finland, Malta and Belgium. The staff members are from the same departments as the students. These work placements last one week. The staff members who go on such an international work placement are obliged to discuss their personal and professional learning aims with their manager. Ultimately the manager will decide if the staaf member in question is eligible for the international work placement.  \r\n\r\nThe staff member defines his/ her own personal learning aims. These aims are also discussed during the annual personal development interview with the manager.", "http://www.bedsandbars.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000034_17"], [2015, "Graafschap College Grenze(n)loos", "Beds and Bars Limited", 187481.0, 10, 18, "Context and backgrounds of the project\r\nIncreasing international awareness and competences with students and staff meets with all strategic aims. Cross-border experiences and encounters increase creativity, talents and learning power.\r\nIn this way Graafschap College, acting  from its core tasks, gives an innovative impulse to the labour market. This impulse is the more desirable considering the introvert character of the working population of the Achterhoek compared to that of other regions of our country. It is obvious that the favourable location in relation to Germany will be much more used, especially the so-called \u2018Euregio.\u2019 Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in offering work-placements and exchange programmes with countries outside the Euregio.\r\nAs a result of the economic crisis the labour market perspective in the region has deteriorated fora n important number of jobs. This has led to a substantial growth of (youth) unemployment. A growing orientation and education with an international focus reduces the mbo-student\u2019s vulnerability.\r\nFor this call the implications are that the focus is much more directed towards Germany, as compared to previous calls. For 33 staff members a subsidy will be applied for to increase their German language skills in order to start a co-operation with a \u2018Berufskolleg\u2019 in Berlin. This is expected to have an innovative effect and appeal to students and that education programmes can be adapted to each other. For 25 students Germany is already scheduled in their diary.\r\nIn this call 39 staff members and 154 students have been included. Compared with the previous call 2014-2016 this means an increase of 100 individuals.\r\nThe total calculated amount fort his call is \u20ac 657.056,-.  Taking into account the amounts we received for students in the last two years, we as kan amount of \u20ac 461.834,- fort his call.\r\n\r\nAims and results\r\nIncreasing international awareness and competences with students and staff meets with all strategic aims.\r\nAt any rate an international orientation ensures a reduction of the student\u2019s vulnerable dependence of the regional economy. Besides, an external orientation contributes to general competences and a more active and creative professional attitude among graduates, which adds to the attractiveness of a candidate for a potential employer. Finally the candidate will be inclined to focus on other regions more readily.\r\nStaff members are expected to implement the newly acquired views, methods and knowledge.\r\nNumber and profile of the students\r\nThe students are mainly level 3 and 4 students of the departments Healthcare and Welfare, Economics and Finanacial Services and Technics and Information Technology. A new group of partcipating students is formed by students from \u2018My School\u2019, a very special group of students within Graafschap College.\r\nThe work-placements vary from 2 to 20 weeks\r\nImplementation of the project \r\nThe project will be carried out in co-operation with long-standing foreign partners and with intermediaries. Graafschap College serves as co-financing agent for students who make use of one of four intermediary agencies which have been acknowledged by the school. For every one of these students Graafschap College contributes an amount of \u20ac200.-\r\nIntended results and impact\r\n1 Improvement of the students\u2019 labour market perspective. From presentations and reports by the students it always becomes clear that language skills have improved, that they confront other customs and cultures with an open mind and that their independence has increased.\r\nStudents and staff  bring back extra professional baggage as a result of their international experiences and in this way they contribute to the development of the region the moment they start working for a company in their own region. This is the case, for example,  when they bring in a valuable network resulting from their international experiences. But, of course, outside the region internationally qualified employees are also wanted. \r\n2 By exchange programmes with other schools and companies/ institutions abroad Graafschap College can acquire new ideas and gain new knowledge which can be implemented in its own education. Of course the reverse is possible, too. This exchange of knowledge can be directed at both education methods and at professional topics.\r\n3 Ambassadors role for students and staff with international experience\r\nBest practices are shared at all levels within the school. Example: curriculum: pilot internationalisation, but direct lines within Graafschap College ensure that internationalisation is on the agenda, both as part of the policy and in realization. Staff and students are aware that they can move their horizons and can learn in an international setting owing to the international activities Graafschap College offers.", "http://www.bedsandbars.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008610_12"]]}}, "9NL": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "CHU SHIN LTD", 1987.0, "Other management expenditure (31.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_30752"]]}}, "9QN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Sustainability Club", "Youth Action International LTD", 22649.0, 3, 3, "The young people who came up with the idea of the project Sustainability Club (SC) are youth concerned about European Union\u2019s problems, particularly sustainable development. Due to rapid development of many industries and human activities we think that the natural environment is becoming more and more endangered and as the youth generation we feel obliged to take action. The project anticipates organisation of 2 youth exchanges which will be mainly concerned with the topic sustainable development and eco-entrepreneurship, both in England and in Poland. Young people from England, Poland and Germany will take part in these two activities.The main goal will be to raise awareness and make participants identify themselves with the idea of sustainable development. Moreover, the goal will be to provide knowledge about values and attitudes aligned with sustainable development and thereby strengthen ecological sensitivity in participants and local communities. Increasing the number of young people who share the idea of sustainable development in a society will be of importance. Then the follow-up event will be more focused on equipping young participants with green business skills and stimulating them to become more entrepreneurial in their working career.The project is designed to first provide participants with generic information about sustainable development and let them together explore topics of Europe 2020 strategy in a very accessible way using non-formal education methodology. Then in order to further engage and to ensure continuation of the learning process, we will make a second exchange in Poland, where more emphasis will be put on eco-entrepreneurship, in order to look for solutions and business ideas which will be accordant with rules of sustainable development. It will enable us to broaden knowledge and improve entrepreneurial skills.  This time will be also devoted to giving participants the chance to develop their business ideas and stimulate their creative thinking. The goal of this event is to foster personal development and make participants more self confident future workers and business people.In order to extend the dissemination we plan to organize main events at the end of both initiatives: Eco-happening in the streets of Cantenbury and Stand-up during The Tatra Mountain Festival in Poronin. Local communities will be engaged in the organisation of these initiatives.", null, "Youth Action International LTD", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024976_coordinator"]]}}}}
