The E+ Ka-1 funding request for 2018 has a larger number of participating schools and that number is still increasing. Mondriaan has 30 schools and 25 of these are VET oriented. The interest in internships and study visits of students abroad has increased. And the success is great in terms of learning outcomes and student satisfaction. Mondriaan has included in its strategic objectives that from 2019 there are 900 students with an international experiences  and that 10% of the staff (240 employees) have gained a foreign experience at the end of the period of the strategic policy plan in 2019. Experiences are a working visit, -study, (retraining) or knowledge sharing. Mondriaan has 18,000 VET students and 6,000 students in adult education and 2100 employees.\r\nIn 2017, the aim of a percentage of 6% of graduated students with a foreign experience has been amply achieved. The standard of Erasmus + is used (14 days or longer for students and a minimum of 2 days for staff).\r\nAs possible study exchange problems as a result of Brexit, contact has been made with Malta with two schools and a language teaching institution. This contact is further expanded for more Mondriaan training courses and internships on Malta. The ICT school has been able to send students to Hungary and the Czech Republic for a longer training period. This pleased both parties so that here too there is an expansion of the internship offer. The training for Dance and Performing Arts has established contacts in Hamburg, Paris and London and intends to introduce students to cultural expressions of those countries on a regular basis. A Ka-2 strategic partnership is a next possible step. This school will also participate in the EU  VET skills week in 2018. In 2017 they had a try out.\r\nBecause of also their enthusiasm this  increases the number of mobilities in the current application. From the excellence program, which also has an internationalization component, contacts outside Europe are maintained. In addition, 5 schools in China are involved for student / teacher exchanges and we help to build a Degree Course Hotel management in Bangalore (India) for the underprivileged.\r\nMondriaan regularly receives requests to receive delegations. As a Mobility Card holder, we fulfil the requests. For example: board members of a Belgian school visited Mondrian, a visit from German with teacher students, we received two delegations from Southern Mediterranean countries and a Finnish school visited us for their knowledge enrichment in the field of early school leaving. The MBO Council, Nuffic, SBB and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science also know where to find us.\r\nMondrian is administratively active in European partnerships such as EUHOFA (directors of Hotel schools from all over the world, the AEHT (European Association of Hotel and Tourism Schools), INNOTECS (International Network of Technical Schools) and EfVet and with a few partners we are in the lead to set up a European association in the field of sports education (MOVES).\r\nThis means that our  international office will have a broader content and a wider reach.\r\nIn the field of bilingual (TTO) courses (English/Dutch) our TTO training for Marketing and Communications is active and the TTO training for executive secretary is now also going to include a foreign experience for their students in this application. The existing TTO of the Hotel School wants to go to one of the partner schools on Malta. The Hotel school wants to follow up the language trainings abroad. The Tourism school has already reached good results for their student. The relationship with NSTS is strengthened and we think it is a good institute for raising the language level and offering promising internships. For some of the students of Life Style & Movement and Economic legal services we planned an international experience on Malta too.\r\nThe administration for the students and staff who make use of Erasmus+ funding is done by a permanent employee and is going smoothly and transparent.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\n\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year.

Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\n\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 9 experienced intermediate organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee.

On one hand, some space debris are routinely tracked, making the collisions predictable, but they increase the cost of space missions\u2019 management. On the other hand, most debris are untracked because they are too small, making prediction impossible. The way to reduce vulnerability is then to reduce severity of collision and probability of occurrence. The proposed P\u00b2-ROTECT project aims to assess the risks associated with collisions and recommend possible solutions such as better prediction, protection or action on debris environment to reduce vulnerability of missions. But it is mandatory to elaborate a vulnerability index which quantifies the efficiency of solutions with respect to trackable and untrackable debris effects and provides access to sensitive terms of collision probability or severity. Furthermore, trade-offs are made between efficiency and cost to propose new design options for space infrastructures.

Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.  There is little guidance on how to incorporate alternative study designs into a development programme to optimally meet the needs of all stakeholders over time.\nThe GetReal consortium aims to improve the efficiency of the medicine development process by better incorporating real-life clinical data into drug development and to enrich decision-making by regulatory authorities and HTA bodies through: \n\u2022\tBringing together regulators, HTA bodies, companies, patients and other societal stakeholders\n\u2022\tAssessing existing processes, methodologies, and key research issues \n\u2022\tProposing innovative (and more pragmatic) trial designs and assessing the value of information\n\u2022\tProposing and testing innovative analytical and predictive modelling approaches\n\u2022\tAssessing operational, ethical, regulatory issues and proposing and testing solutions; \n\u2022\tCreating new decision making frameworks, and building open tools to allow for the evaluation of development programmes and use in the assessment of the value of new medicines; \n\u2022\tSharing and discussing deliverables with, among others, Pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, HTA / reimbursement agencies, clinicians and patient organizations; \n\u2022\tDeveloping trai", 92968.0, 13004527.0, 10, 30, "GETREAL", null, "http://www.ema.europa.eu/", null, "fp7_203672_997654895"], [1425168000000, 1582934400000, "Standardization and Development of Assays for Assessment of Influenza Vaccines Correlates of Protection", "European Medicines Agency", "Background: Influenza viruses cause annual epidemic and occasional pandemics, both of which induce significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza infections affect all age groups but children and adults over the age of 65 are at most risk of developing severe disease.\nVaccination is the most effective approach to reduce the impact of annual influenza outbreaks and potential pandemics, however, the currently criteria of correlates of protection(CoP) show limitations in predicting protection for seasonal and pandemic vaccines. \nThe Haemagglutinin Inhibition(HAI) antibody titre is the most widely used CoP for seasonal influenza vaccine even if there is a lack of standardisation for conducting HAI and other serological assays and therefore  results obtained from different laboratories are not comparable. This leads to the urgent need of  improving international standardisation of serological assays to reduce inter laboratory variability and to generate supportive immunological assays to be used in studies aimed at developing clinically relevant surrogate markers of protection of influenza vaccines.\nObjectives: The main long-term aim of the FLUCOP project is to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and to develop new assays for the better evaluation of the CoP of influenza vaccines.\nMain specific FLUCOP objectives include:\n-\tachieve standardization of HAI and Virus Neutralization(VN) assays;\n-\tpromote the understanding and application of Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and Neuraminidase (NA) assays as tools for the evaluation of influenza vaccines; \n-\tdevelop selective new assays which might potentially used for future clinical trials for influenza seasonal vaccine evaluation\nFLUCOP Consortium and Project Impact: The FLUCOP consortium brings together 26 groups from 7 European countries, and includes contributors from the academic, governmental, non-for-profit and pharmaceutical sectors. As a whole, the consortium has a balanced array of expertise and each group has been carefully selected to avoid overlaps in research activities and to collectively address the planned objectives. FLUCOP is expected to have a significant impact to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and develop new assays to better evaluate influenza vaccines. This will contribute to the future clinical trial evaluation and possible establishment of correlates of protection Through a public-private collaboration FLUCOP will reach a common agreement on assays and methods to be used by all groups both from the public and private sector for testing influenza vaccines in humans. These efforts are expected to aid evolution of the regulatory guidelines and the practice of the pharmaceutical industry following the application of the methods to efficacy studies.\nProject plan: To reach the proposed objectives, the FLUCOP project is composed of five focused interconnected work packages(WP).\nWP1:Standardization of HAI and VN assays.\nObjective: HAI and VN assays are commonly used to quantify influenza specific antibodies but they show to be highly variable between laboratories. Moreover different protocols are in use in different laboratories, which may contribute to the variability of the assays. This WP aims to improve the standardization and harmonization of these assays and also preparation and qualification of critical reagents.\nMethodology: Adult and paediatric pre and post influenza vaccination serum samples will be available to consortium partners who are recognized as leading experts in serological analysis of influenza vaccine responses. A target protocol profile will be developed jointly and statistically powdered studies will be design to compare, screen and evaluate consensus protocols. Sera will be analyzed in iterative rounds of testing of the empirically selected consensus protocols and assay conditions.

Attitudes, behaviour and intercultural understanding are key elements in reaching the goal of making the participants global citizens with sound knowledge of Europe and the world.\r\n\r\nAs internationalisation should be an integrated part of education and training and contribute to the overall quality of education, we work continuously to mobilise schools and training offices to participate in mobility projects. Quality mobility stays give pupils and apprentices the opportunity to acquire further professional knowledge, improve language skills, and create positive attitudes. Further, the mobility stays contribute to the development of transversal skills that will be important in a in a long-term competence development perspective. In this application, we have seen a tendency that companies wish to send their apprentices abroad to cover parts of the curricula that is difficult to complete at home.\r\n\r\nThis project give great importance to the development of cross-sectoral group staff mobilities aiming at strengthening innovative international cooperation across different sectors, fields and levels.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have close links between businesses, the educational sector, and regional/local administration to increase competence and innovation across sectors. Educational provision should be in line with regional needs and restructuring to green workplaces. This year, HCC has especially targeted tertiary VET schools for participation in the project. These projects will address themes such as developing quality tertiary VET, competence requirements for Ocean Space Technology, recent approval and start-up of a study programme about local food culture at Hjeltnes, and the development of a new study programme for alternative energy in collaboration with NCE Maritime Cleantech. These staff mobilities also provide opportunities to create a European network for potential future mobilities of tertiary VET students.\r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 47 mobility projects, which count 177 pupils and 17 apprentices from 13 different secondary VET schools and 7 training offices, and 64 accompanying persons.

Fishmongers play an important role in society, thus they inform customers about fisheries products, encouraging healthy habits amongst population. Nevertheless this sector has many difficulties related with training issues, and attracting new employees (surprisingly this sector has many job opportunities, but young people are not attracted by this labor market).In addition, there is also great inequality in the imparted and required professional training amongst different countries. Some countries have well determined schemes, levels and qualifications (UK), while others do not have any official qualifications, or the training schemes cannot be put into practice (Spain, Portugal). All this adds up to the lack of training culture, professional ageing (this situation hinders the access to e-learning training) and long working days, which hinders professional retraining.For all these reasons, society does not value this fishmonger occupation, and makes it occupationally unsolicited, resulting in the loss of market share for the retail format.e- FishNet will try to connect with the new consumer, increasingly practical, interactive and new sale strategies lover, with fishmonger\u2019s collective.

Encouraging entrepreneurship for youth is part of the European Reference Framework on Key Competences, while the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combating unemployment. Social entrepreneurial competences, such as business and strategic planning with a social dimension, will be the main pillar of the capacity building course curriculum to be developed for the young potential entrepreneurs within the scope of PROMYSE. Elements of entrepreneurship education such as marketing and promotion will form part of the course curriculum. Social entrepreneurship constitutes a flourishing field of work, which not only facilitates entering into the labour market, but also doing so contributes to the community\u2019s well-being by solving pressing social issues of the society, generating a positive return in society. PROMYSE seeks to exploit this advantage by (re)skilling youth accordingly to actively join this field. The project will provide the young participants with the fundamental skills, knowledge, tools and mind-sets to put \u201ctheir entrepreneurial ideas into practice\u201d, while serving the community as well. Following this approach, challenges in the participating countries, which may have come as a result of persisting socio-economic crises, can be tackled in the long term with the introduction of new health and social care services, designed and applied by the young participants of the project. PROMYSE essentially grants a unique opportunity for young people to contribute to their communities while advancing their own career needs.\r\n\r\nThe second Sectoral Priority (YOUTH) is 'Promoting high-quality youth work, particularly in the processes related to youth development'. The project partners, active in the youth work field, will gain considerable insight on identifying and analyzing the needs of youth, especially with regards to education and training, and will build their internal capacities to better meet those needs. The project lays down activities that intend to satisfy the needs of young NEETS, setting fertile ground for applying their creativity and initiative. In this sense, partners are implicated in crucial youth work aiming at engaging with youth to deal with issues like unemployment, low educational attainment and social exclusion. The Role of Youth work is stressed in the EU Youth Strategy, which stipulates that youth work \u201ccontributes to all fields of action [of the Strategy] and their identified objectives\u201d. Youth work is elevated in PROMYSE by the increased capacities of the organisations as a consequent of implementing the activities but at the same time promoting employability of young people in this sector while providing recognition of the skills for conducting this work in a transnational framework (Youthpass and CPD Accreditation). The project equips young people with the necessary skills to get involved in youth work themselves, since the health and social care sector is a field directly related to improving the conditions of subsistence for children and young people.\r\n\r\nFinally, the project will address Horizontal Priority 'Open and innovative practices in a digital era', by developing and providing a modern, integrated and holistic e-learning and networking platform, tailor-made to the needs of young prospective social entrepreneurs. This will allow them to develop and enhance their social entrepreneurship and business skills; improve their understanding in social entrepreneurship principles and community needs in the field of health and social care; and identify social entrepreneurship and collaboration opportunities.

However, socio-economic integration is difficult to achieve for a refugee and humanitarian migrant coming to Europe. In order to achieve socio-economic integration, an individual has to more than access public services, or gain entry into the Labour Market. \r\n\r\nThe Strengthening Employment, Education and Employment Skills for Integration \u2013 refugee, migrant and asylum seekers (SEESI) project will establish the frameworks and curriculum to create a role that enables first language support on key concepts of the local labour market, economic, social and civil integration whilst transitioning the individual refugee to be able to effectively access and benefit from available host country services. Socio-economic integration is a long term and holistic process, incorporating a wide range of different elements, including: refugees and humanitarian migrants application process advice; general Information, Advice and Guidance on benefits, housing and local support services; skills and education development; employment support and community engagement. Without one element in place, not only will have the socio-economic integration process have failed for the individual but it could also result in long-term instability, community isolation and general lack of social participation on a range of levels for the individual. A key reason for this failure is ultimately the language barriers that exist for refugees throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SEESI project\u2019s main objective is to resolve a fault to the socio-economic integration process through mobilising a unique 'Life(skills) before Language' (LBL) approach to the language barrier that refugees and migrants experience upon arrival in Europe. Through developing the skill-sets of \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Workers, who are often the first contact point, refugees and migrants meet in their new host country, the SEESI project aims to revolutionize the socio-economic integration process throughout Europe. The SEESI project aims to design a unique training LBL framework and curriculum which will change Support Workers role from helpful members of refugees/migrants own community into a new dynamic job role, responsible for an essential progression route for new refugees/migrants entering Europe and the local community and ultimately the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, currently provides advice and guidance to refugees and migrants, in their mother tongue language, which often provides key information to these groups. Furthermore, official Refugee Support Workers, Employment Advisers, Counsellors, Integration Advisers, as well as local municipality staff depend greatly on the work Support Workers do especially in interpreting and language support. By developing the skill-set of the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, from basic advice to targeted socio-economic integration service, the role will become more formalised, increase skill-set and will be able to offer targeted support which will ultimately support refugees and migrants integration.\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker will develop training, mentoring and teaching skill-sets alongside their wider community support role, which will ensure that refugees and humanitarian migrants also have the opportunity to develop their skills, knowledge, and wider competences from day one of entering their new host countries. This alternative strategy, Life before Language, will result in refugees and humanitarian migrants gaining the Labour Market skills they require, while learning their host countries\u2019 language on a parallel basis. Rather than the current format where a refugee and humanitarian migrant can only develop civic, social and labour market skills once they have gained a basic level of their host countries\u2019 language. This revolutionary strategy offers a fast track approach of Refugee integration and all through the development of the Support Worker role through the SEESI project.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI project will achieve this through the creation of 6 innovative intellectual outputs designed to increase the Adult Education sector\u2019s knowledge on integration issues, while formalising a unique training methodology aimed at developing the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker creating the future dynamic Refugee Support Workers. Alongside a training curriculum, the SEESI project partners will create Community-based Train the Trainer manual and guidance, offering accessible guidelines on how to deliver the SEESI Support Worker training programmes to volunteers and staff, as well as launching the SEESI outputs on a digital learning platform.

International Monetary Fund confirms in its report from 2015 that \u201cInvesting one euro in welcoming refugees can yield nearly two euros in economic benefits within 5 years\u201d. \r\n\r\nHowever, this group is particularly vulnerable and require targeted support at the beginning. They generally arrive with weak, if any attachment or link to the host country and have gained qualifications and work experience in very different labour market conditions. On EU average, it takes between five and six years to integrate more than 50 % of humanitarian migrants into the workplace and as much as 15 years to reach a 70 % employment rate converging towards the outcomes for labour migrants (European Parliament). Long periods of inactivity also lead to demotivation and deskilling; deskilling in turns means that they could only accept low-skilled jobs, remaining trapped in a low socioeconomic cycle. This impacts on their willingness and resilience to effectively commit to their integration. Moreover, low-skilled refugees are even more negatively affected than other migrants and they are left to find their own way in societies with high labour market threshold (European Council). \r\n\r\nThe corrective action of ARIVE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 integration to boost levels of integration in communities, namely:\r\n- Lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;\r\n- Deskilling and social isolation;\r\n-Lack of working experience in the host country and peer networks at a suitable professional/ vocational level;\r\n- Language and understanding of the civic and social landscape.\r\n\r\nThe general objective of the project is to develop quality learning opportunities in order to encourage low-qualified and low-skilled humanitarian migrants to assess and upskill their competences in order to enter the labour market at early stages. This integration shall be facilitated taking into consideration the individual needs/capacities and labour market demand. \r\n\r\nTo this end the project will:\r\n\u2022 facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for integration skills assessment to enable signposting to suitable peer support groups; \r\n\u2022 transfer new qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored courses that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language and digital skills; \r\n\u2022 provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories facilitated by refugee support groups.\r\n\r\nThe target group of ARIVE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe. The project will address mostly (but not exclusively) low-skilled refugees. Female migrants will be given special consideration, integrating a gender approach in the design and implementation of project\u2019s products. Although the beneficiaries of the action are constituted by humanitarian migrants only, the project\u2019s products will be applicable to other kinds of migrants as well.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d is a phenomenon that is involving Europe as a whole, therefore, any action addressing this phenomenon should be carried out transnationally. Moreover, when they are granted protection, refugees often move to other countries and it is useful to have common tools and procedures for refugees\u2019 skills assessment and training methodologies.  The action is in line with the recommendations of the international community. In its \u201cNote on the integration of refugees in the European Union\u201d (2007), UNCHR states that host communities should facilitate the development of refugees\u2019 language and vocational skills and assist them in pursuing employment.

To enable VET professionals across schools, employers and social organizations to deliver i-VET and C-Vet that is attractive and inclusive and easily accessible and career orienting in line with the objectives set out in the Global Vision for VET 2020 set out in the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9\r\n\r\n3. Utilizing the Open Method Co-ordination approach to develop, test and implement a partnership framework and curricula for active peer learning and exchange of good practice between VET professionals, schools and employers in line with SO3 of ET2020. \r\n\r\n4. To develop a accredited Euro-VET qualification framework for VET professionals which will enable the transfer and accumulation of learning outcomes that facilitate transnational mobility and transnational learning, enhancing and improving VET practice and provision in line with the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 and Europe2020. This will link with Euro pass and ECVET. \r\n\r\n5. To develop sustainable partnerships between VET professionals and organizations working in education, training and work including social partners who engage with marginalized young people across the EU. This is to increase the shared understanding of the labour market, and promoting a collective responsibility towards utilizing robust VET to combat poverty and social exclusion among young people from marginalized communities in line with EU2020 Flagship Initiative on promoting a new agenda for skills and jobs.\r\n\r\nIn developing this project we have deliberately shifted focus from the  locations to focus specifically on urban deprivation -London, Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona and Dublin where the demographic mix of high migration and youth unemployment are at the heart  of the issues we seek to address.\r\n\r\nTarget group numbers:\r\n\r\n-50 VET professional participants will attend the Learning/Training/Teaching activities\r\n-220 participants will attend the local dissemination events (Multipler Events) and 35 from abroad", "http://www.rinova.co.uk", "15billion", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013665_1"], [2018, "CULTIVATE SCHOOL ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET THROUGH HOLISTIC APPROACH TARGETING TEACHERS AND PUPILS", "RINOVA LIMITED", 277191.0, 5, 9, "According to the study of the EU (2012)  <Building Entrepreneurial Mindsets (EM) & skills in the EU\r\n* evidence suggests that developing Entrepreneurial mindset is a key ingredient of endogenous growth & a must for sustainable local & regional development & social cohesion.\r\n* the role of education in promoting entrepreneurial attitudes & behaviors is widely recognized today.

Many serious diseases in adulthood have their roots in adolescence. Illnesses as cardio vascular diseases, diabetes or overweight are especially caused by unhealthy behaviour as smoking, poor eating, lack of physical exercises or other harmful manners in the youth - and often have a negative effect on the employability. Young adults living in vlnerable family contexts with socio-economically disadvantages and/or migration backgrounds often lack a healthy lifestyle due to the absence of positive role models within their intimate social environment. \r\n\r\nHealth Points addresses European trainers, educators tutors that work with these young adults. Being able to raise interest and motivation in this area is a major challenge. Hence, the project will follow a game based blended learning approach to make use of the existing positive attitude towards using online games and social media \u2013 in combination with an accompanied training offer and guided learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of Health Points are to:\r\n- Develop a game based approach and learning game to provide an attractive access to information on health prevention and education for young disadvantaged groups;\r\n- Equip trainers, educators and youth workers with an innovative tool to promote awareness for and provide information on health related topics in their training or in any other context or initiative addressing young disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nWhich ultimately aims to:\r\n- Reduce unhealthy behaviour patterns and lifestyle diseases among young adults;\r\n- Promote motivation for self-responsibility and changing unhealthy behaviours into healthier ones;\r\n- Empower young adults to take care of themselves as important contribution to their employability and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the first phase the specific needs and interests in terms of health education and promotion as well as perceived barriers will be explored by means of interviews and dedicated focus groups involving both trainers and young adults themselves. On the basis of findings from this activity, the methodological concept will be created, with specified learning objectives, together with the organisational structure of the training programme (game and setting according to the contextual surroundings) will be set up. The learning game will be the technical realisation of the methodological concept. A technical framework will incorporate 'gamification' and 'nudging' aspects. Its goal is to create an highly interactive learning environment and resources for trainers and learners. The learning game will be implemented in a fully responsive HTML5 framework supporting smartphones, tablets, desktops and notebooks.  \r\n\r\nThe game-based approach to Health Points with be designed to be integrated into existing educational initiatives for young disadvantaged adults. Trainers and facilitators  working in these contexts will be supported to use the game as an integrated, interactive learning resource that will be accessible and attractive to their learners, using techniques, devices and media that respond to many disadvantaged young adults positive responses to non-formal and non-traditional learning programmes. Health points incorporates robust processes for the testing and validation of its design. Feedback and experience will be gathered in order to adapt and improve the approach. The piloting will also be used to evaluate changes in motivation, action taking and awareness towards health literacty issues among the beneficiaries and to validate competency developments. This will be published together with an assessment of the results and case studies will be compiled in an impact study report. The project will be completed by the production of an e-Manual guidance publication. It will describe the design and use of the Health Points Programme and the game in a user-friendly and non technical language. This will provide background information on the importance of promoting health and well-being literacy and awareness to young adults, and highlight the reasons why the learning targets were chosen and why they are relevant for young socially disadvantaged adults.\r\n\r\nHealth Points will create very concrete products that can be used also beyond its life cycle in many different settings involving young disadvantaged adults.

It is defined as a short form of digital media production that allows people to share aspects of their life story. \"Media\" may include full-motion videos with sound, animation, stills, audio only, etc. which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea. Digital stories are often presented in compelling, interactive and emotionally engaging formats. Recently, the use of maps and connected media for digital storytelling has increased. Story maps combine interactive maps and multimedia content into user experiences. Geographical location helps organizing and presenting information.The role of storytelling with maps in education has not been reviewed due to its contemporary  nature. So far, there has been no research about the potential impact it might have on the engagement of learners. However, storytelling with maps offers high levels of active engagement as it allows people to personalise their contribution, it gives possibilities for creative collaboration, the potential for changing perceptions and opportunities for deep learning through discussion and sharing of the stories.The specific aims of the project are:- to explore factors of preventing drop-puts rates from school through digital storytelling and digital mapping- to enhance two key competences of early school leavers and those at risk of early school leaving: digital competence and communication competence- to raise awareness of the reasons of early school leaving and for the personal consequences of this decision- to pass on experiences from early school leavers to the next generation- to contribute to reducing drop-out rates from schoolThe project will start with a research phase on the results of previous projects related to early school leavers, and on the topic of digital storytelling and mapping. Based on the results of the research, the development of the project will follow: early school leavers will be trained to gain digital competences; then, they will put them into practice by producing visual materials which will be showed to the public afterwards.These aims will be pursued by the method of digital storytelling with maps. With this method, early school leavers are trained in key digital competence to tell their story of leaving and the consequences this decision had on their lives.The most important is the impact on the beneficiaries themselves.

The gap in labor market participation at EU level between EU citizens and migrants has increased in 2014 (Eurostat\u2013Migrant Integration Statistics-Employment). During the last eight years, the activity rate (% of active persons in comparison to the total population) of the EU-28 population of non-EU countries has recorded systematically lower activity rates than EU citizens. Since 2009, this gap has increased noticeably (3 % points). Also the unemployment rate per sex and educational background is higher for migrant women with low educational background (Eurostat).
