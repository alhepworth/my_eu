This will allow us to follow new Scottish Government Policy 1+2 for Language which also follows the European Union's strategy for introducing modern languages at an early stage. It will give our school the opportunity to find a partner school abroad and allow pupils to communicate with pupils from a different culture. From this project staff will have greater confidence and ability to teach French. They will have a greater cultural awareness which can be transferred to pupils. It will also improve teaching methodology for languages within our school and embed the target language. It will enable our school to progress with our identified targets in our School Improvement Plan.", "https://avochschool.wordpress.com", "Avoch Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023150_coordinator"]]}}}}
