EUROPE\u201d collaborative project on sport, health and participation pursued two primary adjectives: 1. To increase the awareness of, and evidence base for, the health benefits of golf for European citizens and 2. To drive increased participation in the sport of golf at a pan-European level. The five partner countries of the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal were chosen mainly because of their differing golf cultures, which would allow sound comparison and post-project application to our countries around Europe. They partnered with the University of St Andrews (St And), who provided the research methodology and literature review, and the Professional Golfers\u2019 Associations of Europe (PGAE), whose principal role is golf education. PGAE provided an innovative coaching methodology called P.L.A.Y.I.N.G.: Play, Learning and Activity for Youth IN Golf, specifically designed to meet basic youth needs of autonomy. The GoGolf! programme was implemented using a partnership approach across federations, schools and coaches with the University driving programme-level evaluation. The imperative for interventions for youth participation was realised because of the desire for golf to ensure a flourishing future with strong junior cohorts of players and members who continue through adolescent and youth years to play golf as young and then older adults. Golf can contribute to addressing the health crisis and many young people today are inactive and at risk of related non-communicable diseases, lonely, or disconnected from nature. The golf sector also wants to ensure a flourishing future, with players and members, who continue through adolescent and youth years to play golf as adults, continuing healthy, active behaviours throughout their life span.The students\u2019 progress was monitored and assessed, via a research programme tailored by St And, in terms of their aptitude for continuing in the sport and their recognition of the health and wellbeing benefits being offered. The factors affecting participation and access in golf, especially regarding youth were investigated, and guidelines were produced as an applicable \u201cgreenprint\u201d towards successful youth participation. The guidelines, while intended primarily for golf institutions and organisations, such as federations, Professional Golfers\u2019 Associations and individual clubs, especially across Europe, have wider relevance for state, NGO, school and other organisations and institutions worldwide that are considering developing interventions for youth participation, and they offer insights for sports other than golf.Within the GoGolf! Europe programme, around 2 out of every 5 youths responding to the final survey were interested in playing golf in the future, with almost 1 out of 5 pursuing that interest soon after the programme. The innovative coaching methodology developed coach practice and engaged youth in golf as a sport.We regard the GoGolf! Europe project\u2019s results as contributing to a broader drive for golf to contribute to healthy societies living in thriving environments, as well as ensuring that the golf sector and individual organisations have a vibrant, sustainable future.", "http://www.pgae.com", null, "erasmus_557996-EPP-1-2014-1-LU-SPO-SCP_1"]]}}}}
