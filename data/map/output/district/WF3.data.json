Volunteers will develop their professional skills and knowledge as well as their intercultural experience. Each RO is involved in activities that benefit local communities, so volunteers will be directly aiding these communities with their service.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n1) Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n2) Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n3) Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n4) Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n5) Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n6) Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life\r\n7) Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds.

It is anticipated that the project will be accessed by both male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe specific tasks of a volunteer will vary with the different ROs, but all will involve an element of service to others, and all volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods (including the Youthpass tool and various TfG-created documents) will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.", "http://www.morleycommunitychurch.org.uk", "Time For God", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036071_12"], [2016, "Changing Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership", "Morley Community Church Trust", 119406.0, 11, 24, "The project \u201cChanging Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership\u201d has been developed by Time for God drawing on our 50 years of experience in international volunteering. The project involves volunteers from 3 countries (Spain, Germany and the Netherlands) travelling to the UK for a year to volunteer full-time in various projects based in local communities. The volunteers will be given lots of support by people in their projects as well as Time for God, and will be able to develop their skills and improve their knowledge as well as benefitting the local communities. Time for God has built strong partnerships with organisations in the sending countries who will help to recruit the volunteers and prepare them for the experience, as well as supporting them during the project. The project is designed to meet the following objectives:   -  Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society- Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering- Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams- Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019- Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)- Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life - Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. It is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. In particular Time for God will encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems or economic obstacles. It is hoped that the project will be accessed by both male and female volunteers. The actual tasks that each volunteer will be involved in will vary depending on where they are based, but each placement will involve an element of service to others. All volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. Several methods will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants. These methods include the Youthpass tool, Time for God\u2019s On Arrival Checklist and Mid Term Review documents, and online surveys. For more information, please see sections F and H of the application form. For the participants, the project is expected to have a huge impact on their knowledge levels, particularly relating to English culture, language and specific work skills relevant to each project. The positive impact also extends to each local community where a volunteer is based, as the presence of an enthusiastic and able volunteer adds value to the work of the project.", "http://www.morleycommunitychurch.org.uk", "Time For God", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023705_16"]]}}}}
