These ligno-cellulosic materials originated from rural locations will be upgraded and densified into uniform sizes at source, allowing cost-effective transportation to existing industrial sites. The core enabling technology is superheated steam processing (SHS). SHS has been implemented in diverse drying applications at industrial scales, due to its superior heat transfer properties. At pilot scales, SHS has been proven to torrefy biomass at temperatures up to 300\u00b0C with minimal ligno-cellulose breakdown. Unlike conventional torrefaction techniques, which use flue gases as heating medium, it does not contaminate the torrefied biomass and volatile fractions, allowing economic recovery of chemicals. Moreover, it is also readily scalable for continuous operation. In SteamBio, a transportable demonstrator unit will be operated at five different rural locations where it will be used to torrefy tonnage quantities of six different agro-forestry residues at a throughput of 500 kg/h. The demonstrator unit will be operated at these rural locations throughout the last twelve months of the project to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the composition of the materials being valorised. The torrefied biomass fractions (solid and liberated volatiles) will then be validated as green building blocks in commercially relevant chemical production and in bioenergy use. Life cycle experts will validate that SteamBio will have positive environmental impacts. A robust business strategy will be developed to enable the results to cross the 'valley of death' post-project and to ensure widespread market replication. Project delivery will be achieved by an interdisciplinary team from research and from the entire industrial and commercial supply chain from fields through to factories.'", 275653.0, 5701746.0, 4, 12, "SteamBio", null, null, null, "h2020_193430_929063188"]]}}, "1QF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1235865600000, 1298851200000, "A novel modular solar air source heat pump system", "TEV Ltd", "There are 195 million households in Europe whose combined domestic heating needs account for 26% of Europe\u2019s energy demand and 500 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Reducing this will be important if Europe is to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets, reduce its excessive reliance on imported energy and the decrease costs to households and industry. The most effective way to decentralise energy production is to increase the amount of generation at source, in this case within the home. A common barrier to the adoption of most energy saving technologies is the high initial investment cost which results in long payback periods considering current energy prices. However, with prices on the rise, existing technologies such as solar thermal heating systems and heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. Although both are reasonably efficient, existing solar thermal heating systems generally only provide up to 60% of a typical household\u2019s annual hot water demand. Air source heat pumps are more effective and can provide up to 100% of total household heating requirements but their performance decreases significantly in winter and they suffer from frost-build up. As these technologies are becoming commodity products, SME\u2019s in these markets are coming under increasing pressure from cheap and often unreliable imports from Asia.  It is therefore paramount that European SME\u2019s keep a technological edge over these competitors. We therefore propose to develop a novel solar air source heat pump system which is 25% more efficient than a typical air source heat pump and 7% more efficient than a combination of a standard ASHP and a solar thermal system while only costing 60% of the combined price of these separate systems.

A growth in single occupancy, an increase in multi-dwelling buildings (flats) and a fall in household floor space have all driven an increase in the purchase of combined washer-dryers, growing at 9% p.a.\n\nHowever, washer-dryers are inefficient, using as much as 50% more energy to wash and dry a load than separate systems. This is a concern both for energy consumption and cost for the user - estimated 15 million washer-dryers consume 18 TWh of electricity worth \u20ac300m and indirectly emit 10,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. As well as energy efficiency, washer-dryers also have practical limitations. Due to the small drum size of the machine compared to a dedicated tumble dryer, it is not possible to dry a full wash load in one go, adding to cost and significantly reducing convenience.\n\nLoWash will address these issues by creating a highly energy-efficient machine capable drying a complete wash load without user intervention. It will achieve this by combing an innovative hydraulic load balancing drum with a unique passive/active heat pump drying chain to create a washer-dryer capable of washing and drying a complete 7kg load without removing any of it from the machine. It will do this using <50% of the energy required by current washer dryers.\n\nRealising this vision would provide a \u20ac34m market opportunity to our consortium for washer-dryers.

The evidence for such need comes from the alarming data provided by the 2012 OCSE PISA  National Report on L1 reading skills, from the 2013Report on the promotion of reading skills,  and from the 2012-2013 Invalsi report. What\u2019s more, the Lang Survey on Language Competences showed that also  the reading skills for the L2 are set at B2 level, which means they are hardly  spendable on the labour market. \r\nOur pro-reading partnership among the schools involved will look at reading competences as the key to triggering thinking skills and leading to wise adulthood. The general objectives identified and described in the project are:\r\n1) Promoting reading literacy among the youth so that they can understand a variety of messages, so as to improve L1 reading skills towards OCSE standards, as well as increase the percentage of top performers; \r\n2)  Improving L2 language and comprehension skills to facilitate mobility on the European labour market;\r\n3)  Favouring the development of social skills to create a European network among students.\r\nThe project group are 14-17 year-old students and their teachers.

The pupils as well as teachers will thus build new skills in IT. It is obvious that this input is also an asset for the professional future of our pupils.\r\n\r\n3. European diversity as an asset\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to establish an intercultural dialogue between young European pupils coming from very diverse social and geographical backgrounds (about 200 teenagers from seven different countries) about the theme ''Land and Food.''

They will get to know the differences that there are between them and their neighbours and also their common points.\r\n\r\nFirst, the pupils will study the geography and the climate of their own countries in order to know more things about themselves before discovering other countries and cultures. We will lead them to question their knowledge so that they can eventually do a reliable and precise presentation of the geography, the climate, the resources and the productions of their regions and countries to their partners. To achieve this, the pupils will be asked to use different mediums such as a website, a wiki, emails or a blog.\r\n\r\nThe pupils will then make hypotheses on the resources and productions of the partner countries, based on what they know best: their own countries. They will take into account the similarities and differences between these countries inside the European Community. An introductory course of the languages of all the partners will be included at this stage.\r\n\r\nFinally our pupils will question their regional gastronomy and that of their partners and their link between the resources and the local productions. The exchanges with the partners will allow to understand how the natural resources but also culture have an influence on what we eat.\r\n\r\nThe final production of this project (the interactive book of recipes and its paperback version) will bring a very concrete dimension to this great work, which we hope will be carried on well beyond the expected end, through the continuation of personal and professional exchanges between pupils and teachers. There is no reason why we couldn't regularly update and add new things to the recipe book and the website.\r\n\r\n5. The impact of the project\r\n\r\nThe impact we expect to get thanks to this project is multiple.\r\n\r\n- First, it has to do with our pupils: we hope to teach them tolerance and what it truly means to be a European citizen, thanks to a better self-knoweldge and an acknowledgement of others.\r\n\r\n- It will also impact the teachers who, thanks to many exchanges on teaching between European partners, will do their best to diversify their teaching approaches and, consequently, make their teaching more attractive.\r\n\r\n- Each school will be impacted and, thanks to the dynamics set by the teachers, their influence on a local and regional scale, will shine.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we can undoubtedly say that what the pupils (and the teachers involved) will live and go through in terms of experience will be an everlasting source of personal satisfaction and enriching.", "http://www.rastrick.calderdale.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002534_3"]]}}}}
