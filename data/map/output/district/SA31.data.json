Skills will be developed across the curriculum with a multilingual and intergenerational approach. Having undertaken a variety of activities the end results will show increasing progress in children's standards across a range of skills. Apart from increasing basic skills the wider community of each partner school will have an increased awareness of the importance of healthy living and the use of modern technology to enhance long life learning.  The project will offer training opportunities for staff, pupils and stakeholders. We will be using the expertise that we know exist between the partner schools to address staff development requirements.  Additionally, we have agreed upon developing community cohesion by addressing intergeneration events, activities and incorporating local expertise e.g. craftsmen, local entrepreneurs. The collaboration between local entrepreneurs and pupils will influence and offer opportunities for future employment and transferable skills. By participating in such events and training the whole community will benefit. Their innovation of the use of i pads and online learning inspired us to further develop our use of ICT emerging into the 21st century. All schools have some innovative ideas that we can all learn from and transfer back to our respective schools.Activities will be arranged to ensure that all age groups will have opportunities to participate in the partnership such as preparing the presentations of their own region to be shared.  This also includes a a number of teachers who are eager to develop an expertise in a certain area.  Before commencing any project a baseline assessment will be undertaken, and evaluations at the beginning, middle and end will take place.  The co-ordinator of each school will be responsible for the implementation of these assessments and evaluations with the project co-ordinator overseeing the whole process.  Also, children and parents will undertake questionnaires in response to activities and the other stakeholders, depending on the nature of the task, will have opportunities to evaluate for example, intergenerational activities.All project results will be disseminated via schools' websites, hwb+ (a Welsh national online learning platform), newsletters, open events, local media and e twinning.Our projects have sustainable values and results.  Our healthy living project will have a direct impact on the pupils', staff and local communities' lifestyles,  with the aim of them continuing with these healthy ways. Children will acquire other skills such as  ICT and numeracy skills which they will be able to  apply in other cross-curricular activities.  Teachers will also develop their skills to be included in their future lesson plans. Also, linguistic knowledge will support the pupils in secondary or higher education.

Forestry and sea power became inextricably linked, creating new geopolitical tensions, alliances and forest regulations. Key questions in this context are: could Iberian forest resources sustain the increasing demand of sound timber, or was the wood imported from elsewhere? If so, how were the trade networks organized? And did the lack of raw material force the technological changes occurred in shipbuilding in the 16th century, or were they a result of exchange between Mediterranean and Atlantic shipbuilding traditions?

The coordinator of the project is the General Inspectorate of Education in Catalonia, a regional educational authority, which supervises and evaluates equity in schools. In terms of educational authorities with similar competencies, we have as partners, the Evaluation Council of the Education System in Catalonia, the Ufficio Scolastico Regionale per la Lombardia, the Inspectorate of Education in Sibiu and Scholengroep Brussel, a school group with administrative power. With also count with Istituto Casati and Institut El Calamot, two secondary schools that along with some schools from Scholengroep Brussel have successfully tackled equity with good practices. Finally, the Welsh Centre for Equity in Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu have expert knowledge on equity in education and are essential to set theoretical frameworks and publish good quality materials. \r\n\r\nThe target participants of the project are:\r\n- Students will participate in awareness activities: logo competitions, recording of equity school practices\r\n-Head teachers and school leaders are the key to spread good school practices in schools, to implement ways to evaluate it and to supply a bottom-up perspective\r\n-University researchers will provide the theoretical knowledge of the topic\r\n-Educational authorities staff will enhance the evaluation of equity in schools within their area of influence\r\n\r\nTo achieve the objectives of the project, several activities and intellectual outputs will be produced:\r\n-General activities: project website, logo competition, erasmus+ corners, term newsletters\r\n-Intellectual outputs: framework to assess school equity with methodological guide, digital tools and training course for school leaders and a specialised school equity portal with theoretical framework and recording of good practices\r\n\r\nWe will apply action research and reflective practice methodologies, as they involve active participation, reflection, problem solving techniques and a process of continuous learning. We will use teamwork as an organizational strategy with the setting of a steering committee with one member from each institution acting as project leaders and four different work teams: project management, communication, evaluation and documentary production. \r\n\r\nWe expect the following results:\r\n-School heads will be empowered to deal with equity in their schools due to professional development course and the availability of tools to evaluate equity\r\n-All stakeholders will become more aware of the importance of equity in education due to the availability of the project\u2019s intellectual outputs and the planned dissemination activities: school leaders meetings and multiplier events\r\n-All the staff in the project institutions will increase their knowledge and expertise on school equity thanks  to their participation in the project\r\n\r\nWe also expect a very important outcome, which is an increase of the number of schools that evaluate equity and implement good school equity practices within the project's area of influence.

The teachers are supported by teaching materials but the assessment methods are vague and require a lot of extra work from the teachers as they are used to one-correct-answer tests. We would like to support those teachers by providing them with a range of suitable assessment tools that they can adjust or use as they are.  The basic training and emphasis in Entrepreneurship Education promotes creativity and action (entrepreneurship) and the importance of EE is now widely accepted although not generally seen as a core subject throughout educational levels. There is a need for practical and reliable assessment methods in Entrepreneurship Education in Europe to enhance this kind of teaching and learning and benchmark the qualities such education offers.

It will build on the collaboration of leading specialists in EE, their experiences and research learning from each other and harvesting the latest relevant European reports in the area.   The project is structured around a sequence of peer learning activities (workshops) that will enable participating organizations to gain experience and to strengthen their capacities. On parallel, partners will share learning internally and locally among key stakeholders and discuss the possibilities of embedding some of the lessons learned in each workshop into the practices of relevant organizations and devise a feasible action plan.  Each workshop will contribute to the co-production of a vision of success that could be accepted by all partners.
