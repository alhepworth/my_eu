This experience will develop through a five week abroad mobility which provides, after an initial preparatory stage during the first week stay, work placements experiences similar to those of the Alternating School Work project, performed by the member schools of the consortium. The project emphasizes the focus on the changes that are affecting the tourism sector: the first condition to attract tourism to areas located inland, and at the same time to face the change of tourism 2.0, it is to act on future operators\u2019 education and training. These are in fact already 'digital natives', but their skills have to be studied and addressed in an informed way in the direction of a professional growth, as well as personal and civil. The selected students will be 110 all attending the fourth and fifth form of a school network involving: ITS Sansovino Oderzo (TV); ITST Mazzotti Treviso, Castelfranco, IPPSAR Maffioli (TV), ISISS Scarpa Motta di Livenza (TV), ITCS LB Alberti and ITTS Vito Volterra San Dona di Piave (Ve), IIS Lazzari Dolo (VE). The students come from the following different high secondary school courses of study: technical economic (Administration, Finance and Marketing, Tourism); technological (Graphic and Communication, IT), vocational (food and wine and hotel hospitality). The different sectors are integrated in the knowledge that the tourist reception 2.0's needs on the one hand to strengthen operators\u2019 behaviours that have to become more and more engaging and customized, and on the other to optimize the management aspects of the front office, back office, business organisation, and the application of strategic, territorial, commercial marketing techniques. Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field. Web technologies and social instruments are in fact necessary to the whole chain to communicate and promote new flows, to intercept, to organize accommodation, to manage tourism industry. The consortium continues in the wake of the positive past experience LLP Leonardo da Vinci realized from to 2007 to 2013 with the project 'Sile', widening historical network of sending member schools. The countries of mobility destination are the United Kingdom, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic. The decision took into account the offer of various but complementary types of tourism, and the impact that the development of IT has on this economic segment sector. The majority of the foreign partners is part of the ECVET network, and all project partners have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which regulates the implementation of ECVET procedures in internships. This will enable the validation and recognition of learning outcomes from sending schools according to the principle of educational equivalence training. The fallout of the project outcomes within sending schools, besides strengthening existing network ties and the sharing of methodologies (in particular on the definition of the learning paths in non-formal contexts, on validation and recognition of the results) will contribute to raising their internationalization, fueling the interest and willingness to carry out projects with foreign countries (language studies, exchange experiences). Added value is given by the participation in the consortium of people coming from and representative of the world of work, involved in part of the preparatory and evaluation - dissemination activities, in order to strengthen their ties and further lighten the elements of self-reference that school usually presents in terms of definition of educational objectives.", "http://www.riviera-english-school.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004383_10"]]}}, "2BB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "E-TOURISM 2016", "Torquay's Dinosaur World", 270772.0, 6, 14, "The project is presented by a Consortium composed of six Technical schools and a Vocational one, social partners, companies, and public bodies of Treviso Province; many local partners provide their external support.

The project aims at offering the operators of the future some training opportunities which can strengthen these skills. This will be realized through preparatory activities and the mobility during summer 2017; the mobility will last 5 weeks, being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time work experience in companies in Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), Lithuania (Vilnius), UK (Liverpool, Brighton , Reading, Torquay) and Spain (Valencia).

So I'm going to carry out the project with lower and upper formers in the English and Italian lessons and the students (only upper formers) in my English and Italian moduls. ( as mentioned before we have the Modulare Oberstufe (a modul system) at our school). \r\n\r\nI really hope that I will get the chance to attend those two language courses in Torquay and Taormina in the summer 2017. It would be  perfect timing, because next school year I'm also going to teach three English \"speaking moduls\" and one Italian \"speaking modul\" (one is named \"speaking is fun\") and for those moduls the experience I would get from those courses in Torquay and Taormina would be awesome as the main focus of the moduls is actually on speaking and that in a fun way. \r\n\r\nWhat I would also like to do in my project is teach English using the teaching methods acquired in England and teach Italian using the methods acquired in Italy and compare the results of the teaching methods. Which teaching method is better? Are the methods acquired in Italy better for teaching Italian? Are the ones acquired in England adequate for teaching English in Austria? Is a combination of them , using the best aspects of each teaching method the best choice/solution ? Is there anything that needs to be/could be improved ? Those are the questions I'm going to ask myself and I will try to answer them as precisely as possible throughout my project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, attending those two language courses will also help me personally  as a teacher, because I would like to improve my language skills in both foreign languages and my own teaching style and methods, including the best aspects of the teaching methods and styles of both countries. This, as a result, will be advantageous ,especially for the students, because what they get is better, more motivating teaching and fun lessons, but they will  also learn a lot at the same time ( but the fun way ) .\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would also like to include circle models in my teaching, i.e.  students get a worksheet including many different activities and so every learner type can try out new activities. In addition, working together with different partners can also increase the pupils\u2019 own learning process.Pupils have to be creative and do different types of activities and games alone, in pairs or even together in  small groups. Therefore,  we are not talking about normal and boring lessons, but about creative and very motivating lessons, because they are fun and pupils enjoy them, but also learn a lot. In my opinion, they even learn more that way.  Last but not least, it can also have a lot of benefits for a future job, because it helps  develop and increase skills, such as creativity, problem solving and team work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would also like to find a school class in England that would be willing to write emails with my class. This way my students could practise their English in a fun way and learn a lot at the same time. Writing to people their age is much more interesting and fun and, therefore, further motivates them to continue studying. If possible it would be great to include an exchange (one week or ten days) so that we could also meet and visit the English students and their country. This way the students could perfect their English skills and learn more about the country, the people and their customs and traditions. Personally, I think that the students will be really motivated, interested and enthusiastic about studying English. Teaching and learning the fun and creative way is the most important teaching method, because it is the only thing that really motivates students and turns the subject English into a passion ! I've already done that with one of my Italian classes and an Italian partner school and they enjoyed it a lot and benefited a lot from it.

The observation and support of that group of professionals by the participants is seen with regard to the current change of German schools towards inclusive whole day care provision and the increased need of professionalised educational support staff in that field. The beneficiaries will investigate tools of scheduling day structure, differentiation and inclusion as well as strategies of cooperation between professions at school.

All coming projects are also intended to be pool projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A1:\r\n\r\nThis project is for trainees from the commercial business sector throughout Germany. The aim of the project is to strengthen intercultural competence and to further develop linguistic skills. Furthermore, personal, social and professional skills should be developed. As a result of globalization, such skills have become essential for future employees to be able to compete on the European market. A total of 600 participants will travel to the UK in groups of at least 10. The project consists of prior preparation in Germany and a three-week learning period in Great Britain. Participants are provided with a cultural and work-related introduction in the UK. Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in England. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills. Participants also have the chance to take part in cultural activities outside of the internship. An understanding and a willingness to support such learning experiences abroad during traineeships should be encouraged and promoted on a national level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A2:\r\n\r\nThis project is directed at students completing a full-time school-based traineeship to become commercial assistants. The aims of the project are the same as in project A1. As these participants do not work in companies, the program duration will be longer allowing learning outcomes to be consolidated more effectively. The previous project of its kind was awarded the title \u201cBest Practice Project\u201d by the NA-BIBB in 2012. Twenty-four participants will take part in the six-week program in Bournemouth, UK. Alongside preparation in Germany, participants complete a week-long language and intercultural training course in Bournemouth, followed by five weeks work experience.

In the first year, thirty traineeship graduates should complete a three month internship including an introductory course and an accompanying evening class in the UK. The combination of scholastic and practical elements should allow graduates to develop skills which are not able to develop fully in a purely academic environment. This should improve their employment outlook and initiate an interest in international mobility at the beginning of their professional career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A5:\r\n\r\nThis project is designed for thirty graduates from hotel and catering traineeships. Participants will undertake a four-month learning period abroad consisting of a specialist internship and an introductory course in the UK.

Over a period of ten days, a group of thirty teachers will receive inter-cultural and linguistic training in Torquay, UK; pay visits to educational institutions in the area; and take part in cultural activities. As a result of this experience, teachers should be able to strengthen the understanding of the importance of inter-cultural competence in vocational training on a regional level, and function as experts in the execution of learning experiences abroad.

Two key aspects of the Strategy: 1) the promotion of a \"sustainable, smart and inclusive\" economic growth; 2) the reduction of early dropout in charge of young people. The overlap between the current economic crisis and the data, that emerge from ISTAT surveys on training poverty of young people, give us a complete inescapable picture: in Italy there are more than 113.000 young people between 14 and 17 years old out of the school\u2013training channels and they represent 5% of the resident population in the same age group; there are more than 2 million young people who do not work and do not study, representing 22% of the population, the incidence is significantly higher than in other European countries; the proportion of NEET is prevalent in the South, where the incidence of the phenomenon reaches 30,9%, although in recent years is also growing in the Central-North, especially the Northeast, where the crisis has intensified the phenomenon of non-employment. Let's Go is coherent with the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and taken back by the Italian government document \"Italia 2020: piano di azione per l\u2019occupabilit\u00e0 dei giovani attraverso l\u2019integrazione tra apprendimento e lavoro\"; the project would promote the development of techniques skills (compared to the demand of enterprises) through the creation of an internship period, carried out during the course of the studies - as advocated by the Italian document - to develop the culture of work and enterprise, of language skills and citizenship skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Let's Go promotes 300 mobilities for the realization of internship in enterprises, pointed towards young people of the circuit of Education and Vocational Training. These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua. The beneficiaries are: - the second and third annual paths of regional qualification (in some cases fourth annual path where required under regional regulation); - neo-qualified of qualification paths of not more than one year; - young of the4th and 5th class of technical professional institutes; - the graduates of not more than one year from the education pathways and technical professional. The young beneficiaries come from 17 Italian regions (from North to South Italy). Let's Go is a \"multi- sectorial\" project because it involves young people from different professional backgrounds (33% catering, 20 % mechanical, 17% agro-alimentary transformation, 7% of electricity, 10% of thermo-plumbing, 10 % well-being, 3% graphics). The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing). Lets'Go project also provides for the use of ECVET tools (learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding) for the personalized design of transnational mobility, in view of the enhancement of learning outcomes, acquired in the individual experiences of mobility. The mobilities include the realization of internships in enterprise, being this a true learning context (Work-based Learning). The expected impacts are of long-term and  they are related to the design of mobility as an active investment of the promoter in social and employment integration policies. Let's Go intends to pursue: the integration of training and transnational mobility in the life project of the beneficiary (in recognition of the mobility in the formal learning pathway, awareness of enterprise\u2019s stakeholders to the value of learning mobility).", "http://www.ttpl-uk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000123_33"], [2017, "Europapraktikum f\u00fcr Berufssch\u00fcler", "The Training Partnership Ltd", 601534.0, 4, 8, "The overall aim of all projects is to strengthen the so-called key competencies (linguistic, intercultural and social and personal skills and competences).

The project aims therefore at increasing their competences as regard the use of interactive communication tools based on the web and the touristic e-commerce. The participants will be 110 students at the end of the fourth year of study at the following schools: ITCG Sansovino -Oderzo (Consortium Coordinator); ITST Mazzotti \u2013Treviso; IPPSAR Maffioli \u2013Castelfranco Veneto; ISISS Scarpa \u2013 Motta di Livenza;  ITCS  L.B.

The specific professional skill alone is not sufficient unless it is supported by the mastery of key competences, in particular as concern the communication in foreign languages, the digital competence, <learning to learn>, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, intercultural awareness. The project aims at offering the operators of the future some training opportunities which can strengthen these skills. This will be realized through preparatory activities and the mobility during summer 2017; the mobility will last 5 weeks, being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time work experience in companies in Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), Lithuania (Vilnius), UK (Liverpool, Brighton , Reading, Torquay) and Spain (Valencia).

The focus then becomes polarized toward the handicraft sector and SMEs, with attention to the construction sector, green technologies for energy conservation, rehabilitation and restoration. The training contents of the project include the following topics a) the growth of professional skills in relation to recovery, maintenance and reorganization of the territory and its redevelopment (primarily energy and sustainable one) b) the development of awareness about the need for interaction among different profiles. This is true within a single sector and among different sectors. Transnational mobility is an opportunity for the development of key competencies as digital competence , communication, self-learning, as the basis of a vocational path and personal growth. In addition, the integration of different professions and sectors as proposed by the project will be reflected in order to dialogue with other mobility projects proposed by high schools networks that insist on the same territory.

Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field.

In so doing the staff will better understand how  the companies work, and at the same time they will improve their knowledge of the professional language. Each school will manage a greater number of mobility scholarships  than in the past. The beginning of VET  staff mobility for CLIL teachers, represents a real step forward towards the internationalization of the school, and a chance to compare its teaching and learning strategies with international training organizations.

They show a certain mistrust in respect to their future employment prospective, needing of a concrete solution for how to turn their formal and non-formal educational pathway into practical use.The implementation of training experiences in companies which have adopted circular and sustainable models, will offer the beneficiaries the opportunity to develop proper competences and thus overcoming the above-mentioned aspects.  The mobility experience abroad will be accurately prepared before departure, thanks to a linguistic, cultural, pedagogical and professional preparation (OLS, training on health and safety at work place, propaedeutic  and sector seminars).  The quality of the foreseen activities as well as the recognition, the certification and validation of competencies will be guaranteed by the application of ECVET tools.The expected results, in consideration to the identified needs and objectives are: - Development of communication and linguistic skills and technical-professional competencies of the participants, in respect to the project sectors;- Strengthening of technical professional competences, and the consequent improvement of the professional curriculum, through a certified, recognized and validated professional path;- High quality mobility experiences that can be transferred to the local, cultural and professional local environment: families, social partners and companies, by the participants themselves;- Training experience designed to promote employability of young people and a life-long learning process; - Strengthening the project\u2019s synergies with other initiatives to favour the creation of a permanent network and the realisation of future successful projects, thanks to increased cooperation among schools, companies and social partners, also by the use of common and  transparent tools.The following elements reflect an important innovative approach in the way of conceiving, describing and certifying the learning process, contributing in a positive way, at local, national and European level, to the development of a quality culture and institutionalisation of the mobility:- the capitalization of the experience through the active participation of beneficiaries in  activities such as vocational guidance and meetings with local companies and social partners;- the active participation of the project in the ECOMONDO fair, with an exhibition space dedicated to the project;- the concept of learning outcomes, developed according to the ECVET system.The promotion of tools such as Europass and ECVET among potential employers, allows to fully valorise the experience and to create solid basis for a greater cooperation, internationalization and transparency of the educational system.", "http://www.ttpl-uk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005292_7"], [2018, "FROM SCHOOL TO WORK 2018", "The Training Partnership Ltd", 232560.0, 6, 7, "The learners\u2019 86 mobilities will take place in August 2018 (n.36, in FR, ES, UK) and in summer 2019 (n. 50, in AT, UK, IE).

The requirements for qualified employees are rising \u2013 and therefore the importance of learning how to handle these challenges as early as possible.\r\nIn the training curricula as well as in the training regulations, these aspects often don\u2019t get the required attention \u2013 resp. only a theoretical treatment of these subjects is possible.\r\nTherefore our objective is to offer the apprentices, their educational centres and their apprenticing companies the opportunity for a practical and application-oriented experience.\r\nDuring their month-long internships, the apprentices do not only prove and improve their know-how. They will also learn a lot about themselves and will improve and strengthen their social competences. During that time the participants will also receive the task of realise a small individual project in order to contribute their personal expertise. For example, this could be an intercultural cooking event that the apprentice arranges by himself.\r\nWe provide a comprehensive preparation for their stay abroad to turn it into a positive and enriching experience. During preparation meeting the participants receive a general and individual guidance and a portfolio that contains information regarding their travel, the country, the company and the local characteristics and contact information about their mentor.

In addition, we support and consult in every other aspect (e.g. in language and every day live requirements). With this combination of preparatory offerings fears should be dispelled and their joy of discovery should be strengthened.\r\nAfter their stay abroad we encourage the participants to share their experiences and therefore spread the idea of the project.

Its objectives are fixed against the background of a previously relatively low mobility of young people in the dual training system which currently stands at about 4 percent. Additionally, conventional measures of mobility for apprentices are usually carried out in groups and are too inflexible for interested individuals or do not match due to their technical, spatial or temporal orientation. However, this project provides promotion of individual practical trainings abroad, irrespective of time, country of destination and the occupation requiring formal training. But the project determines clearly the funding period which in each case is scheduled to last three weeks. This schedule is based on the experience that this period usually already allows young people to a positive experience mobility with sustainable effect and that on the other hand longer periods of absence of the apprentices is in most cases hardly accepted among their training companies. Moreover, the realisation of practical trainings abroad shall now also be possible for those youngster, who just finished their apprenticeship. The 3-week-training abroad has to be completed within the first 12 months after their successful final examination.

The individual internship abroad promotes the intercultural and language competences and supports the personal and professional development of the participating apprentices and trainees. The positive impact of the acquired competences will become clear in the domestic apprenticeship.
