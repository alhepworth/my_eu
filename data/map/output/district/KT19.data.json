The trainees in the Ortenaukreis, as well as the training companies, the zweiteSchule gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft (a non-profit organization), and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr work closely together for the mobility project. Local companies have been sending their trainees to European subsidiaries and other cooperating companies for several years as a mobility activity. It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance. The \"European thought\" can be considered as a long-term benefit. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. The mobility project is going to take place from July until beginning of October 2016.  Thirteen of 20 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Austria and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad. An important part of the mobility measure is the realization of a project which usually deals with current European topics. It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. Work on the topic \u201cEffects of the demographic changes on the social security in European countries\" poses the question, which results are to be expected.   The chosen topic should reveal  the social policy of our European neighbours. Of course the project is awaited with great interest. The results of the research made will be collected and  analyzed in teamwork.  The dissemination of results is already described in I.2 .", "http://www.ceseurope.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002788_11"]]}}}}
