Golf courses are often targeted as using excessive amounts of water, especially in drier. Some governments have labeled golf course usage as agricultural in order to deflect environmentalist\u2019s charges of wasting water.

The high level of turbulent skin-friction occurring, e.g., on the surface of an aircraft, is responsible for excess fuel consumption and increased carbon emissions. The environmental, political, and economic pressure to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions associated with transportation means that reducing turbulent skin-friction drag is a pressing engineering problem.\n\nThe current project will tackle this problem with the development of superhydrophobic nanostructured top coatings, which do not only exhibit improved aerodynamic efficiency but at the same time they prevent icing on the aircraft. The nanostructured coatings will be based on metal oxides or nanostructured carbon (carbon nanotubes or graphene). Both types of nanoparticles can become superhydrophobic by suitable surface treatment while nanostructured carbon can also thermally activate the coating using the plane's on-board electrical system.\n\nThe proposed project involves the synthesis and chemical modification of ad-hoc nanoparticles. The latter will be employed for the synthesis of novel composite coatings, based on epoxy or polyacrylic resins, which will be characterized to obtain information on the structure and topology of the coatings. Wind tunnel tests, in combination with fluid dynamics modeling, will be conducted to optimise the application methods and the effect of different substrates, icing fluids, contaminants etc., thus correlating the aerodynamic and de-icing behavior to the morphology of the material.

This year\u2019s project is titled \"New Dimensions in Bilingual Education\" in the framework of which 16 colleagues take part in various mobility programmes. The project summarizes the most important outcomes of the mobility activities and their possible effects. It includes taking part in courses and job shadowing. Courses benefit all levels of the school from lower and upper primary to secondary, both the bilingual and the language preparation classes through the acquisition of intercultural and ICT competencies, new methods and teaching/thinking strategies. The job shadowing activities are all connected to the previous projects and our eTwinning network. Job shadowing has contributed to the school\u2019s internationalisation to a great extent.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities in harmony with the strategic development plan of the school contribute to \r\n- the development of a high command of English and German indispensable to the effective multifaceted communication inside and outside school\r\n- the extension of the number of bilingual subjects\r\n- the classroom material design for bilingual subjects\r\n- the training of professional personnel for bilingual education\r\n- the methodological and professional revival of the teaching staff\r\n- the promotion of using ICT and project-based strategies in all classes\r\n- the continuous professional self-training of the teaching staff\r\n- the motivation of students\r\n- the cooperation and teambuilding of the partakers\r\n- helping in the integration of non-Hungarian students\r\n- the successful integration of students with special needs\r\n- the enforcement of the European Dimensions in the school\r\n- helping with keeping the school in the European educational mainstream\r\n\r\nThis project is the continuation of the development that was started earlier. The school successfully complies with the regulations of bilingual education and effectively prepares students for the advanced level Matura exams. One of the school\u2019s new head teacher\u2019s major goals is to implement the cutting-edge methodology of the Western European educational system into our teaching process. The targeted mobility activities offer great possibilities to gain insight to the freshest knowledge / know-how available. The front-line methodology and ICT technologies motivate students and revitalize the lessons. Thanks to our expanding international network the students can practise the English and German languages with more efficiency. The project also helps us prepare for the realisation of the Digital Educational Strategy. Beside the teaching competencies, some transversal competencies are developed as well, such as learning abilities, communication, problem solving and the leadership and management skills, not to mention creativity and the ability to take part in teamwork.\r\n\r\nWhen planning this project, we were very specific to pay attention to all the details and needs of the whole school and its sections. We have been preparing very carefully so as to be able to collect the most diverse and variable experiences during the mobility activities. During the planning of the application, different liabilities were assigned, all partakers contributed to the compilation of the project design. The whole team keeps in touch and cooperates during the project and represents the school and the country to the best of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nA great emphasis has been put on the dissemination of the knowledge gained during the mobility activities. All partakers have the possibility to disseminate the practices they have acquired on various platforms. We have already established a new educational tradition in our district, which is titled the Professional Day in Pasar\u00e9t. This is a dissemination event where colleagues can share their experience gained during their mobility.\r\n\r\nThe most visible and immediate effect of the Erasmus+ mobility applications was that the colleagues taking part in the programme started to think together as a cohesive team for the good of the school and its students. The various mobility activities in the long run contribute to the school\u2019s innovation and open new professional dimensions.\r\n\r\nAll applying colleagues find that the programme engulfs in significant linguistic development, intercultural experience and professional revival, and all these help to impede the process of burning out. In a broader context, this mobility programme means a high quality jump towards the future, a development in the abilities necessary to meet international educational expectations and to get in the mainstream system of European schools.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever world offers you, curiosity will make you see it the way you want it.\" (L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3: Curiosity)", "http://www.stcatherineprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA101-047352_2"]]}}, "8HZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1430438400000, 1556582400000, "Competitive SolAr Power Towers \u2013 CAPTure", "K Controls Ltd", "The main objective of this project is to significantly reduce costs of concentrated solar power, in order to pave the way for its deserved competitiveness on the power market.
