The steel demand in Europe in 2011 was estimated to be 145M tons, of which 39M tons p.a. for the construction sector and 16M tons p.a. for structural steel. Most of this steel is carbon or mild steel (as opposed to stainless steel) which corrodes at a high rate and although there are a significant number of anticorrosion solutions on the market, protective coating is most widely used, thanks to its low cost and high versatility. Often, an anticorrosion primer is applied just after manufacturing of steel in order to prevent rusting during storage and transportation before fabrication (cut,weld,drill,etc). Most anticorrosion primers last max 6 month due to poor quality or mechanical damage resulting in corrosion. Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50\u03bcm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer. If the primer is thin enough (~25\u03bcm) to allow welding, its anticorrosion properties are so limited, not reducing the risk of corrosion. Above all, the increased zinc content in the weldable primer formulation in order to achieve the anti-corrosion property result in health hazards and discomfort during fabrication process as it releases significant amount of zinc fumes. Alternatively, primers are simply not used at all but the expensive and hazardous blast cleaning of steel is carried out before fabrication which may sometimes be too late that it results in huge material waste and cost. The problem to be solved is the inability of the weldable primer produced today to allow both good quality welding and durable corrosion protection without health hazards.\nThe WeldaPrime project proposes an innovative approach for a zinc free corrosion protection primer with an optimum thickness and affordable cost, offering durable corrosion protection, resistant to mechanical damage and weldable without zinc fumes.", 361979.0, 2124821.0, 6, 10, "WELDAPRIME", "http://weldaprime.com/", "http://www.coatings.org.uk", null, "fp7_111373_952287704"], [1388534400000, 1483142400000, "Improved Service Life Prediction and Test Capability for Wood Coatings", "The British Coatings Federation Limited Lbg", "The paints, coatings and varnishes manufacturing sector in Europe is worth an estimated \u20ac20billion, supporting approximately 4130 SMEs and is responsible for employing 59,600 people within these SMEs. In particular, the wood coatings sector is facing a number of threats. The sector is coming under increasing pressure from low cost imports from Asia that have low solids content and subsequently poor durability. There is a need in Europe to maximise the use of timber as a sustainable resource within the built environment. For coated components including windows, doors and cladding this requires maximising service life and minimising maintenance costs. Wood coatings have themselves undergone considerable change in response to environmental and other legislation and require substantial testing to establish or predict service life across different wood species and climatic zones. The pace of development and potential long life of modern coatings means that real life durability data will not be available when new products are brought to the market place and this creates a risk which affects SME joinery manufacturers and applicators. Ultimately it will also affect the downstream customer and consumers who in the absence of credible guarantees may use less sustainable substrates for components, such as uPVC or Aluminium. A response to this problem has been the emergence of national and institution certification schemes.
