It is a global business and global labour market. There is fierce competition, not only domestically, but internationally as well. In England in 2013-14 the top eight Premier League clubs made 44 new signings and 33 of these players were foreign. Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal. The host partners will provide access to different European teams and coaching systems, which are each applauded as having world class records in talent identification, coupled with innovative coaching and enhanced player-development pathways.  Innovations in physiological development, coaching delivery and tactical analysis will be used to improve skills\u2019 acquisition for mobility participants. Improved employment rates for VET learners, with improved vocational attainment, enhanced accreditation and mobility certification will help improve career progression and job security for all participants. \r\n\r\nThe key competences that are to be acquired/improved are listed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tImproved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility                          programme.\r\n2.\tSkills and technology transfer between the mobility apprentices and players and coaches in Europe.\r\n3.\tImproved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4.\tImproved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5.\tIncreased maturity, initiative and increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n6.\tEnhanced cultural awareness.\r\n7.\tIncreased participation and retention rates in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football.\r\n8.\tEnhancement of soft skills.\r\n9.\tIncreased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n10.\tCloser links between VET Providers in Wales and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA will allocate a sum equivalent to 10% of the total budget to fund dissemination before, during and after the mobility period.", "http://www.wrexhamfc.tv", "FAW Football in the Community trading as Welsh Football Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012873_2"]]}}, "2AW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1451520000000, "Far Infra-red Space Intereferometer Critical Assessment: Scientific Definition and Technology Development for the Next Generation THz Space Interferometer", "Glyndwr University/Prifysgol Glyndwr", "For knowledge to progress in many aspects of astrophysics it is clear that we need to make observations at all wavelengths that at least match the spatial resolution achieved in the optical by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThis is especially true in the Far Infra-Red waveband (FIR - 30-300 micron - where our atmosphere is opaque) where the necessity of space borne experiments combined with long wavelengths makes achieving high spatial resolution particularly difficult.

Methodologies This project will combine diverse innovative education methods including: 1. inquiry-based learning as one of the student-centred approaches to teaching and learning that is based on self-directed or guided inquiry or research undertaken by the student. By studying and using the ways of inquiry in different social science disciplines, students will develop their capacity for critical thinking and understanding of complexities of migration process. 2. multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives to capture the topic of migration from complex and multidimensional perspectives. As such, this project will involve a) postgraduate students from social science disciplines (including Sociology, Social Policy, Politics and Education) and b) students from art and design faculties This project will also involve migrant organizations to ensure diverse perspectives on migration processes are outlined and discussed with students.3. human-centred design methodology to involve diverse stakeholders (migrant organisations, migrants, students and academic) in collaborative project on human mobilities.  This innovative methodology for teaching and learning has been selected for this project as it combines academic rigor with practical relevance including  artistic research, design driven exploration on emerging technologies and materials, as well as action research oriented development of new design methods and approaches.  Results: This project will produce the following outputs: 2.    Developed and tested educational modules focusing on issue of migration from the perspective of particular social science discipline including Economics, Education, Politics/Sociology/Social Policy and Social Work. 4.    Community of Practice created around open access virtual platform with developed, ready-to-use e-modules, including learning outcomes, description of the workshop programme, description of teaching and learning approach, examples of teaching activities and assessment strategy5.

It will contribute to students\u2019 cultural competences as well as their critical understandings of migration processes. In the longer term this project aims to contribute to greater equity and social cohesion within Europe through understanding of complexities of migration processes.

Enhanced intercultural competences, knowledge and understanding will help those graduates to challenge anti-immigration rhetoric with using the scientific, objective reasoning in the broader context of the impact of migration on society, economy, public services including education and social work or politics of immigration.  The project will enhance the teaching skills and knowledge of the project team in designing enquiry-based modules but also creating social design courses and translating the materials into graphic language.
