SeaBioTech will reduce barriers to successful industrial exploitation of marine biodiversity for companies more accustomed to \u2018terrestrial\u2019 biotechnology. SeaBioTech directly addresses five key challenges to remove bottlenecks in the marine biodiscovery pipeline, leading to (1) improvements in the quality of marine resources available for biotechnological exploitation, (2) improvement in technical aspects of the biodiscovery pipeline to shorten time to market, and (3) developing sustainable modes of supply of raw materials for industry. The two last challenges centre on enabling activities to enhance the marine biodiscovery process: first, clarification of legal aspects to facilitate access to marine resources, their sustainable use, and their secure exploitation; second, to create an improved framework for access to marine biotechnology data and research materials. To achieve its goals, SeaBioTech brings together complementary and world-leading experts, integrating biology, genomics, natural product chemistry, bioactivity testing, industrial bioprocessing, legal aspects, market analysis and knowledge exchange. The expertise assembled within the consortium reflects the industry-defined needs, from the SME partners\u2019 initial definition of market and product opportunities to their ultimate proof-of-concept demonstration activities. SeaBioTech will have significant impact on research and technology, on innovation, on European competitiveness and on economic growth. It will provide a model to accelerate the development of European biotechnology into a world leading position.", 182002.0, 7862744.0, 10, 16, "SeaBioTech", "http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/seabiotech/", "http://www.marinebioploymers.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153339.jpg", "fp7_104332_968348285"], [1356998400000, 1451520000000, "Novel high performance, waterbased \u201chigh solids\u201dand bio-based industrial wood coating", "Marine Biopolymers Limited", "The stringent Solvent Emission Directive (1999/13/EC), fully transposed in 2007, imposes limitations of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) due to the use of organic solvents in paints and varnishes. The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece. The aim of NEXT1KOAT is to give European woodworking and furniture manufacturers a long-lasting solution by developing a first triple system (exterior uses impregnation; interior uses undercoat and topcoat) of one-component (1K) \u201chigh solids\u201d (>70%) water-based coatings. NEXT1KOAT will be produced by European SME coating manufacturers due to its affordable chemistry based on seaweed polymers, and it has been designed for European woodworking and furniture small and medium coating installations. NEXT1KOAT will have the following advanced properties: Less water content (30%), reduced drying time and less grain raising, improved wood wetting without the use of surfactants, less foam formation, more glossy final aspect and increased hardness.", 170822.0, 1964064.0, 7, 15, "NEXT1KOAT", "http://www.next1koat.eu/", "http://www.marinebioploymers.com", null, "fp7_106527_968348285"], [1483228800000, 1498780800000, "Alginor`s Ocean Refining Total utilizing technology", "Marine Biopolymers Limited", "Alginor will carry out a feasibility study on its innovative AORTA technology for sustainable utilization of seaweeds. The feasibility study includes examining the technical- and economic viability, identification of specific technical risks, raw material risks and alternative sources in order to proof the viability of the technology and highlight the economic benefits. The proposal is outlining the need for elaboration of vital commercial elements in a Business Plan, including development of an Organizational and Financial strategy.\n\nAlginor will establish a biorefinery for seaweeds based on our highly innovative AORTA technology. The concept aims at total utilization of seaweed by a multiproduct blue biorefinery. The concept achieves cost-advantages through cost-sharing over multiple products such as biopolymers, savoury, bioactive compounds as well as food and feed products. The product portfolio will facilitate new value chains and meet customer demands, especially according to mega-trends within Pharma & API, Health & Nutrition, Food, Biomaterials, Feed, Agro and Chemical industries. Initial focus in the key markets is the need for high-grade powders to the food-, health- and nutrition industries. Higher product yield from an ultra-pure and formula-specific product portfolio improves overall economy of the project. Further, the AORTA concept will increase raw material utilization to ~100% and make utilization of environmental chemicals in the production obsolete.  \n\nThe planned feasibility study is a step towards minimizing risks during commercialization of the technology. The ultimate business goal is to establish a large scale manufacturing unit (the biorefinery). Risk minimization through first performing a demonstration-plant of smaller scale in order to control project-risk is vital for future financing. The present feasibility study will lay the foundations for an Investor Memorandum (Phase 2).", null, 61054.0, 2, 2, "AORTA", null, "http://www.marinebioploymers.com", null, "h2020_207951_968348285"]]}}}}
