Our staff currently lack confidence due to their lack of knowledge of the language, the strategies in how to effectively teach it and the methodologies behind the speaking, listening and writing. It is hoped that the staff that go will enthuse and excite all staff at our school with new teaching styles and pedagogies. There will be a number of new cultural activities made available to all our children as a result from the partnership. We envisage that our staff will also learn new and alternative behaviour strategies for our more challenging pupils in the DSP. Therefore, our main objectives stem from behaviour policies and implementation, teaching styles in spoken and written language, pedagogy across the curriculum and enrichment opportunities linking to prospective cultural activities. We want our children here at Northwood to strive for achievement. They need the opportunities brought to them in a safe environment. They aren't exposed to the wider world around them when at home with most never been to Liverpool our nearest city only 8.5km away from where we are situated here in Kirkby. It is our passion to instill a vision of a wider world with open opportunities and endless places to visit and learn about. We want to empower them to live beyond their current limits either academically, financially or physically. By joining the staff on their journey through blogs, we hope that the children will achieve such ambitions and broaden their horizons. \r\n\r\nThe staff that will be apart of  this journey will be ; (12 each year) 3 SLT members, 3 DSP staff members and 3 mainstream members. THey will have their desired outcome briefed and organized for them prior to commencing the job shadowing and once completed they will cascade the information back into school to all staff through staff meetings, twilights, school website and the local newspaper. We will share all success and new strategies with parents and governors plus the wider network here in Knowsley. \r\nOur unpinning motive is to report back to all parents, staff and children that there is a wider world and enthuse them to learn a new language so they can become globally aware.  Mentioned above was the socio economic background our school, children and parents are in plus the many barriers they experience such as: \r\n\u2022 well above average national deprivation - School 0.57 opposed to 0.21 nationally\r\n\u2022 well above average SEN statement and EHC plan - School 7.0 opposed to 1.3 nationally\r\n\u2022 well above average SEN support - School 24.2 opposed to 1.3 nationally\r\n\u2022 well above average % of pupils eligible for FSM - school 67.3 opposed to 25.2 nationally\r\n We envisage  along lasting relationship with our partner school for continued communication between adults by sharing good practice and developing a platform for our children to write to each other online and in letters. In the future, we plan on bringing small groups of children over to Spain to let them experience the cultural differences and similarities for themselves but to do so we a strong, save and secure relationship  created.", "http://www.northwoodcommunityprimaryschool.co.uk/", "Northwood Community Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047315_coordinator"]]}}}}
