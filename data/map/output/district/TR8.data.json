The 220 young people involved in the Erasmus + program will go to 15 different countries: Romania, Malta, Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Finland, Cyprus and Greece. The young people will leave for a month in a company of one of these countries on the spring season of 2017.

They aim the alternating training and social and professional integration of young people. As such, an immersion in a European country should allow young people to better adapt themselves to the jobs of tomorrow. Live a new experience, with different professional practices in host countries, while discovering the cultural characteristics guarantee of openness and personal development should enable greater creativity to flourish in our society and European citizens. The project aims to improve youth employability by acquiring new skills carried out within the framework of a reciprocal process of sharing knowledge while being in compliance with the standards degrees. In addition, training masters and mobility referents of each MFR co- construct term objectives for each young person to discover the host company, organization and progress of tasks and responsibilities assigned. Beyond the strictly professional contributions, language learning will help to overcome shyness in practicing foreign languages and facilitate integration into family units or lodging structures. The challenge is that every young person can, after its training course, become a European citizen engaged and proud of it to create the jobs of tomorrow and improving the competitiveness of Europe.HELP PROFESSIONALS TO  EXPERIMENT A EUROPEAN MOBILITY IN ORDER TO GET A NEW EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING OR AT WORKIn parallel with the mobility of young people in vocational training, the FRMFR wants to mobilize teachers who have a true educational mission to youth. Their responsibilities are great in the implementation of the mobility project but also in the implementation of alternate training, educational project, monitoring alternation business / MFR and social and professional integration of young people. For this, the FRMFR aims to enable 8 teachers to live a European mobility for a week, to meet the objectives of the movement of MFR which are to boost education and teaching teams by strengthening their capacities and skills to re - update their knowledge to progress and innovate in their practices. Sharing experiences will improve the quality of relationships with European partners and particularly institutions, host companies and social partners to enable recognition of qualifications and skills acquired including non-formal situation. Comparison of training systems is rich and allows us to understand another reality that is taking support on these distancing own practices. Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support.

So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded.
