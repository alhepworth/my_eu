The outcome after in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation is often disappointing resulting in a tedious iteration process. The main objective of this project is to achieve radical innovations in state-of-the-art biomaterials and to design highly performing bioinspired materials learning from natural processes. By this outcome driven project comprising first class academic and industrial participants the project will create scientific and technical excellence and through links with these SMEs will strengthen the technological capacity and their ability to operate competitively on an international market. BIODESIGN will (i) perform a careful retrospective-analysis of previous outcomes from clinical studies performed with humans through animal modelling in a reverse engineering approach applied to an in-vitro to the molecular design level, (ii) develop new strategies for a more rational design of ECM mimetic materials serving both as gels and load carrying scaffolds, (iii) link novel designs to adequate and more predictive in-vitro methods allowing significant reduction in development time and use of animals and (iv) evaluate these concepts for musculoskeletal and cardiac regeneration. By the development of safe, ethically and regulatory acceptable, and clinically applicable materials this project will promote harmonization while at the same time creating awareness in society of the benefits of these innovations as one of the key points is to improve health and quality of life of the patients. BIODESIGN will stimulate technological innovation, utilization of research results, transfer of knowledge and technologies and creation of technology based business in Europe. It will also support the development of world-class human resources, making Europe a more attractive to top researchers.", 394565.0, 11778861.0, 7, 21, "BIODESIGN", null, "http://www.locatetherapeutics.com", null, "fp7_101537_985810031"], [1456790400000, 1472601600000, "Feasibility study on Opto-Magnetic Imaging Spectroscopy for cancer screening", "Tumour Trace Ltd", "Cancer is among the leading causes of death in the modern world with over 8 million cancer related deaths globally and over 1 million in the EU. The estimated economic costs of this EU social problem in 2009 was over \u20ac120 billion with the healthcare costs at 40% of this amount.  Early identification of cancers continues as a key priority to reducing loss of life and subsequent treatment costs. Screening for cervical cancer is very effective at controlling the disease, but the costs for the 32 million women involved in EU screening programmes costs approximately \u20ac960 million per year. Tumour Trace Limited have developed OMIS, an innovative cancer screening methodology and device which offers a reduction of 75% costs for laboratories and accuracy of over 95%. This technology uses Opto-Magnetic Imaging Spectroscopy (OMIS) to provide an objective cancer diagnosis and offers a step change in accuracy, costs and speed of screening. Current methods are expensive, time consuming and subject to false results as the screening technologies rely on pathology judgements rather than objective molecular biophysical properties that are measured by OMIS. Tumour Trace have validated this technology with several pre-clinical studies for cervical cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer. Tumour Trace have plans to commercialise this technology in cervical cancer screening programmes initially for the UK, Serbia and India; however further market research included in this Phase 1 application is required to support uptake across the wider EU market and to explore the potential impact in other cancer areas. This ground breaking technology will lead to improved clinical decision making and better health outcomes through earlier cancer detections and a reduction of false results; this in turn will contribute to more efficient sustainable healthcare provision.", 39838.0, 56912.0, 1, 1, "OMIS", null, null, null, "h2020_201711_933100522"]]}}}}
