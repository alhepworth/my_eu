By applying for a training and development grant (staff mobility) to support 5 teachers' learning, we expect to raise standards in subject leadership as well as improve the quality of teaching French in Key Stage 2, in order to meet the new statutory requirements of the National Curriculum.

In the long term, we expect the children to have a better grasp of another foreign language so that they are better prepared for adult life where communication is a vital key skill for life.

Preschool Matija Gubec with its project \"Different approaches to creative teaching in early and preschool age children\" encourages lifelong learning of its employees through professional training in EU. To develop and raise the quality of work of the institution, we recognized the importance of two specific areas. The first area relates to education for sustainable development and outdoor education with children. Environment of the child, especially a natural one becomes an important factor in the educational process. It encourages a full psycho-motor development of the child, develops awareness of the importance of physical education and a sense of living in harmony with nature and learning about ecology (exploitation of natural resources and raising awareness of responsible attitude towards the environment). The second area is early English learning, which we consider to be an important factor in helping preschool children develop communication competence in a foreign language. Increasing the quality of short and full daily curriculum enriched with English learning is one of the goals of our institution. This is possible only with high-quality continuous training of employees working in the programs. These areas are an important part of the curriculum in our institutions and in accordance with the National Curriculum for Preschool Education. The main objective of the project is to improve knowledge about unconventional ways of teaching based on the latest psychological and pedagogical knowledge, theoretical and methodological assumptions in accordance with the modern concept of creative teaching. Objectives of this project are: improvement of key competencies and skills, promoting quality and excellence in innovation and internationalization of the institution, increasing the awareness of employees about the importance of lifelong learning, improvement of international dimension of education and training and teaching and learning of languages  encouraging linguistic and cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nParticipation of 15 employees is planned based on the activitites of the project: 8 educators for the job-shadowing activities and 7 workers for the structured courses.\r\n\r\nJob shadowing action plan involves the following preschools :\r\n\"Mezmalina\" preschool (Latvia) is a recognized Eco-preschool which shows a specialty of their work through teaching children outdoors. \"Long Buckby Infant School\u201c (UK) puts emphasis on a stimulating environment and natural environment in the forest where children are able to learn to appreciate nature and the environment that surrounds them.
