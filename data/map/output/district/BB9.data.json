It is a multilateral exchange gathering 40 young people and 10 group leaders coming from European cities and partner countries neighboring the EU : Creil (France), Pendle (United Kingdom), Marl (Germany),  Krosno (Poland), Zalaegerszeg (Hungary), Nowomoskovsk (Russia), Dakhla (Morocco), Nefta (Tunisia) and Bethlehem (Palestine).\r\n\r\nThis project gathers many cities from EU countries, but also cities from other continents, what enables to ask oneself about  European concerns (citzenship, sustainable development, citizens rights) in a larger context.  Thus we can broaden the reflection, bring testimonies and contributions from other sources ans compare situations within Europe and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this fifth edition is to enable the emergence of an international citizenship among young people by favoring intercultural dialogue, social integration and solidarity and by making them become aware of worldwide different social and cultural realities.\r\nThe activities program will be composed of : \r\n\r\n\u2022 3 thematic workshops entitled \"interculturalism\", \"towards a responsible consumption\" and \"Right to the essential\". During the week, the 3 groups of young people will each tackle only one subject in order to be able to deal with it in detail and to formulate concrete conclusions and restitution supports it will present to other participants at the end of the week. This will provide an accomplished work on each subject.\r\n\u2022 4 artistic workshops  (dance, theatre, writing and singing, graffiti) around the subject of international citizenship will enable young people to express their creativity and ideas and to create together one performance, led by a local professional artists company and some local artists. It will be a different and original way to deal with international citizenship and convey some messages to the public about this subject.\r\n\u2022 One visit to the \"European House\" in Paris, accompanied by the association\"Europe Direct Picardie\" (certified Direct Europe Information  Center ), will develop the knowledge of European institutions and European citizenship. Through a conference debate, this visit will favor the awareness among young people of different realities and encourage intercultural dialogue through concrete examples.\r\n\u2022 A sport challenge will take place at the end of the week; Beyond its recreational dimension, sport conveys important values such as respect, fair play, team spirit. It creates emulation and a strong cohesion feeling among participants.\r\n\r\nLearning methods will favor the active participation of young people and multilingualism : icebreaker games, role play, debates, involvement of young people in the preparation, restitution and evaluation times.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also have the opportunity to enjoy informal and daily life times to learn to know each other, discover other cultures, develop skills like solidarity and mutual understanding. the spectacle and restitution of workshops will enable young people to show the skills they could develop during the week. \r\n\r\nExpected results  of the International Youth Meeting concern before all young participants of all cities. They should go back from this experience with knowledge and skills about European and international citizenship and solidarity, having understood worldwide interdependence mechanisms and the possible leverage effects they can individually or collectively apply to encourage changes towards a fairer and more united world. The aim is to make them want to be actors and involved citizens at local and international levels thanks to information they got during the week about partners and tools existing to act concretely.\r\nFinally, the purpose is this action adopts a long life perspective for all participating cities. Some tools and supports will emerge from the workshops and will be adapted by the cities (for instance sensitization campaigns against discriminations, for responsible consumption...) and local actors will be mobilized to favor this emergence of a European and international citizenship beyong the week of international youth meeting : within youth town council, youth department, associations, interventions in schools or in municipal participating structures...).", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR02-KA105-009776_1"]]}}, "8LF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Make Every Step Count", "Pendle Community High School", 129919.0, 6, 7, "During the development of our project all participant institutions will encourage everyone to realize the importance of personal development, to make steps towards developing key skills, taking on personal challenges and reflecting on their own progress.

Despite the unrivalled capability of fibre-delivered laser sources to perform a wide range of processes, the potential flexibility of the laser source is limited by the need to change the processing head for these processes to be performed. The majority of industrial laser systems are employed to perform low-variety and high-volume manufacturing operations. However, current manufacturing trends (such as increased automation, individualisation and next-shoring) are driving the need to develop manufacturing systems which are capable of performing a higher variety of manufacturing operations.\n\nThe ModuLase project will develop a re-configurable highly flexible processing head system, which will be capable of covering  welding, cladding and cutting.

The market is expected to grow a further 6% in 2012, and approximately 50% of revenues are generated from sales to European manufacturers.  The large increase in uptake observed since 2004 has primarily been driven by recent developments in solid-state laser technology leading to the commercial availability of fibre-delivered Yb-fibre, Yb:YAG disc and direct diode laser sources, which have resulted in improved capital cost and reduced operating costs.  However, despite these cost reductions and potential benefits, the uptake of laser welding technology is still limited, especially amongst SMEs, for three related reasons: complexity, lack of flexibility, and difficulties in using lasers for \u2018non-standard\u2019 welds.\n\nMost existing laser systems are fitted with either a standard process head or a 2D galvanometer scanner \u2013 both of which deliver a \u2018standard\u2019 Gaussian or \u2018top-hat\u2019 energy distribution to the work piece.  However, this relatively simplistic energy distribution is not directly suitable for many applications and significant laser welding expertise is required in order to develop acceptable process parameters. Laser beam welding with a tailored energy distribution produced by a galvanometer beam scanner is possible, but this technology is not economically attractive. Diffractive optical elements are a robust, simple tool and are capable of producing (virtually) unlimited tailored energy distributions.\n\nThe aim of the TAILOR:WELD project is to develop and demonstrate an innovative laser welding system, that uses simple and robust diffractive optical elements, which will increase the flexibility and simplify the application of laser welding; removing the key barrier to entry for a large number of SME fabricators.", 28661.0, 1294041.0, 8, 9, "TAILORWELD", null, "http://www.graham-eng.co.uk", null, "fp7_111008_951895533"]]}}, "9SZ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXR", "Pendle Community Hospital", "nhs_RXR50"]]}}}}
