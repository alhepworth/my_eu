The demand for safe, efficient and high quality animal protein will rise significantly over the next decade with a concomitant increase in the world population of domesticated livestock. Infectious diseases continue to impact upon the productivity of farm animals and threats of disease incursions are further increased by the globalised trade of animals and animal products. Rapid and reliable diagnostic systems can play an integral role in the detection, monitoring, control and subsequent eradication of animal diseases and pathologies.\n\nThis proposal will develop and bring to market new tools to achieve effective diagnosis of livestock, companion animal and wildlife diseases.  The project RAPIDIA-FIELD will develop multiplex pen-side tests that can be used to support local decision-making by animal health practitioners. These tests will be simple to perform, robust, inexpensive and also provide unambiguous results for easy reporting. This concept also includes work to develop test formats for use in non-specialised front-line laboratories.\n\nIn addition to the development of the specific tests and assay platforms, the project will also consider how these tests will be used in the field or in local laboratories, and how data generated by the assays will integrate with other new (and existing) systems that contribute to the diagnosis, monitoring, control and subsequent eradication of animal diseases. Aspects of this work will include real-time monitoring on line of animal health on farms to collect parameters such as feed consumption and water intake as well as using thermography or thermal chip to look for early signs of clinical disease. Together with the data generated by the assays, reporting protocols will also be established to ensure that the critical information collected is correctly archived and is traceable to international quality standards.\n\nThe project will also pay some attention to new technologies and protocols only carried out in sophisticated laboratories. The idea of this work is to position animal health in a new frontier of science that will maximise our chance to identify new diseases and problems before they become overt health threats.\n\nConcluding, the proposed strategy is devoted to define, develop and bring to the society products and services that contribute to Animal Health control at field level.", 194573.0, 3510149.0, 8, 12, "RAPIDIA-FIELD", null, "http://www.enigmadiagnostics.com", null, "fp7_101747_998873991"], [1451606400000, 1577750400000, "Ion-Molecule Processes for Analytical Chemical Technologies", "Defence Science and Technology Laboratory", "Soft chemical-ionization mass-spectrometry (SCIMS) is an exquisitely sensitive analytical technique with applications to health, the environment and security that are vital to the EU.

IMPACT addresses this skills\u2019 shortage by establishing an intersectoral and multidisciplinary SCIMS training network. IMPACT also brings cohesion to the fragmented SCIMS research and development activities within the EU. To date, most SCIMS developments have been driven not by users but by manufacturers, whose main focus has been on increased sensitivity. However, just as crucial is improved selectivity. Indeed, many users consider improved selectivity to be the key to taking SCIMS technology to a whole new level. Instead of private and public sectors working independently, we need a fresh, intersectoral approach. IMPACT will achieve this through intersectoral work packages and multidisciplinary research projects. In place of major and costly changes in instrumental design, IMPACT\u2019s projects will focus on developing new methods for improved chemical specificity by manipulating ion chemistry. Hence, IMPACT\u2019s fresh approach will produce a step change in SCIMS instrumentation to deliver both economic and societal benefit to the EU.

Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.
