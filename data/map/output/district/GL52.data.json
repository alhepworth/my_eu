As the wealth of training materials grow, this will increase the quality of higher learning opportunities in emerging countries and economies and strengthen the understanding of the business context in those countries in more developed countries.\r\n\r\nWe are expecting approximately 700.000 people to benefit from this project directly or indirectly, as the developed case studies will increase the quality and the relevance of higher education in entrepreneurship, business and management in emerging countries, and also inform students at  various levels about emerging country contexts and business problems. It will also enhance entrepreneurial tendencies and creativity among student circles across the world with interesting examples of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe project will be governed by a management structure consisting of a project board, an executive committee, a project coordinator, project control officers providing financial and administrative support and an external advisor overseeing project risks and progress. Together with the project management structure, we also employ a detailed management plan and a set of management tools for the successful completion of this project.\r\n\r\nWith  a large number of diverse activities, with complementary results and impacts, the project aims to bring higher education more relevant to the real life problems and enhance its content.  After a series of case teaching  and case writing workshops, intensive training sessions, case review courses, roadshows and multiplier events, this project aims to create two international case repositories, with diverse cases from emerging country contexts, located at  ITU and METU, two leading technical universities of Turkey in partnership with SMART Partners and Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management - Case Development Center. The project also expects issuing an international volume of emerging country case studies, in the form of an edited journal special issue, or an edited book.\r\n\r\nIn the longer-term the project will potentially:\r\n1. Create more case studies, in  entrepreneurship, business and management, particularly about SMEs and provide diverse examples to readers from various sectors and backgrounds, giving them realistic warnings about what to expect in emerging country settings.\r\n2. Help higher education institutions offer a more realistic preview of the post-college work experience, due to the  skills generated by the case method, such as communication, teamwork, analyses, and learning to learn, that are essential to meet workplace demands.\r\n3. Create future opportunities of teamwork and collaboration, particularly in the area of joint case study authorship and editing, at the international level with partner and participating universities, and enhance the diversity of teaching cases and the case study writers community worldwide.\r\n4. Trigger and enhance university-industry collaboration at the pan-European level, due to invaluable opportunity provided by the case study development by mixed teams.\r\n5. Provide broader access to cases in emerging markets such as Turkey, and therefore helping higher education institutions to train future managers and expatriates with more effectiveness and relevance.", "http://www.smart-partners.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA203-021948_4"]]}}, "6FR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Senki nem marad le", "St Edward's Preparatory School", 27608.0, 4, 5, "Our project was inspired by the realizing that the results of our students were far behind those of the previous years and that we experienced a decline in the standards of education.

We would like to make our school more popular and likable for our students. For this, we are going to learn new techniques to organize groups and free time activities. Our school provides special art and language learning possibilities. This also explains why art and language teachers especially need to refresh their methodological expertise. We would also like to adapt the acquired methods for teaching other subjects.

IMA1G replaces multiple, dissimilar equipment with fewer common processing and I/O modules, sharing high speed communication links. IMA1G has demonstrated possible implementation and derived benefits when applied to a limited number of aircraft functions for example; the number of processing units in the new A380 is half that of previous generations and a reduction in airline operating costs of between 15 and 20% is expected through significant weight reduction and maintenance savings.

The first major DREAM objective is to design, integrate and validate new engine concepts based on open rotor contra-rotating architectures to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 7% beyond the ACARE 2020 objectives. Open rotors are noisier than equivalent high bypass ratio turbofan engines, therefore it is necessary to provide solutions that will meet noise ICAO certification standards. The second major DREAM objective is a 3dB noise emission reduction per operation point for the engine alone compared to the Year 2000 engine reference. These breakthroughs will be achieved by designing and rig testing: \u2013 Innovative engine concepts \u2013 a geared and a direct drive contra-rotating open rotor (unducted propulsion system) \u2013 Enabling architectures with novel active and passive engine systems to reduce vibrations These technologies will support the development of future open rotor engines but also more traditional ducted turbofan engines. DREAM will also develop specifications for alternative fuels for aero-engines and then characterise, assess and test several potential fuels. This will be followed by a demonstration that the selected fuels can be used in aero-engines. The DREAM technologies will then be integrated and the engine concepts together with alternative fuels usage assessed through an enhanced version of the TERA tool developed in VITAL and NEWAC.
