The project will offer vocational students in these subjects inspiring and educational 4-week work placements with our experienced European host partners. The project also offers VET tutors the opportunity to undertake 7-day staff training visits to European host partners, to learn from their training methods, share experience and form lasting mutually benefical partneships. The project will fund 4-week placements for 47 environmental students and 55 craft students. PETS will also fund 7-day staff training placements for 18 teachers from environmental courses and 26 craft tutors (all from VET courses level 1-3).\r\n\r\nThis application benefits from over 10 years of Grampus promoting environmental and traditional skills and craft placements through the Leonardo da Vinci programme. This application and consortium combines the experience of delivering two certified IVT projects \u2018Training in Contemporary Applications of Traditional European Crafts\u2019 (TICATEC) and \u2018Developing Environmental Skills In Rural Europe\u2019 (DESIRE) within the Lifelong Learning Programme. (mobility certificate UK/09/LLP-LdV/MC/Z007) \r\n\r\nHost countries represented in the consortium are Czech Republic, Slovakia, Cyprus, Germany, Romania, Iceland, Slovenia ,Bulgaria Ireland and Turkey.\r\n\r\nParticipant students and recent graduates will develop a higher degree of self confidence, put theory into practice, gain new skills, improve existing skills and competences, inspire a renewed interest in their chosen subject, gain new language skills and complete a CV enhancing placement which will improve employment prospects and/or enable an informed progression to higher level study.\r\n\r\nParticipating staff will benefit from placing their own training in a wider European context. Travelling tutors will not only explore new skills, methods, approaches and techniques but will also share their own experiences with host organisations. This experience will give staff access to new ideas and approaches to training which will have a positive impact on their own training delivery. This will ultimately benefit vocational students of the tutor and enable the tutor to pass on new skills and information with a broader European scope.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: 1 Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for beneficiaries studying environmental and craft courses in the UK at VET level. 2. To ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the participant\u2019s course of study and can be accredited as such. 3. To increase the appreciation in beneficiaries of the benefits of European cooperation and the fact that we are facing similar challenges across Europe. 4. To provide beneficiaries with sufficient time and support to increase competencies in key environmental and craft skills being used on the placement. These include:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Skills: planting, coppicing, footpath design and construction, countryside furniture construction (bridges, steps benches etc), biodiversity assessments and species identification, basic surveying, habitat management, organic sustainable food production.\r\n\r\nCraft Skills: weaving, embroidery, silversmithing, blacksmithing, ceramics, wood carving, green wood construction, traditional building techniques (natural materials), \r\n\r\n 5. To develop a sustainable European VET partnership (hosts, UK colleges and Grampus) which can share experience and develop future cooperation projects. 6. To increase the employment prospects of participating students through gaining real-work experience and laying the foundation for language skills 7. To enhance UK VET training provision in environmental and traditional skills by providing 7-day staff placements for tutors with relevant European hosts.\r\n\r\nThe project management methodology for the PETS consortium is consistent with the 2001 Recommendation on mobility for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers and the ten principles set out in in the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nStudents are accredited as part of their UK course of study for the mobilities. All participant mobilities are recognised through the Europass certificate as well as the Europass CV and language passport. Host partners provide a minimum of four language lessons with professional tuition. All staff mobilities are recognised within an agreed CPD plan with their own organisations. Host partners also provide certification and a record of achievement in their own format as additional evidence of achievement.\r\n\r\nDetailed learning agreements are drawn up prior to placement through discussion between participants, hosts and UK colleges. These provide a realistic benchmark against which the success of the project and placements will be evaluated.", "http://www.westcollegescotland.ac.uk", "Grampus Heritage and Training Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000265_22"], [2018, "BRICKS OF SKILLS", "West College Scotland", 256316.0, 6, 7, "CONTEXT\r\nOn 30 November 2016, the European Commission presented a package aimed at boosting clean energy transition in Europe, the Clean Energy for all Europeans package. This transition towards a decarbonised economy is not only a necessary response to the threat of climate change, it is also a great opportunity \u2013 in terms of generating growth, investment and jobs in innovative and sustainable solutions. \r\nIn the construction sector, it is expected to be a major source of both low-skilled and high-skilled jobs created in the context of Energy Efficiency investment, there will be a demand for new competences at both the design and construction stages. It is fundamental to identify common approaches to  standards and recognise these skills and favour the mobility of workers across Europe. \r\nBRICKS OF SKILLS OBJECTIVES: \r\n\u2022develop flexible learning pathways focused on energy efficiency which can modernise, reward and resource the education and training of people for competitive and innovative solutions in Europe.  \r\n\u2022design EU recognised and standardised qualification pathways in accordance with the ECVET model, with the aim to overcome the fragmentation of construction professions and facilitate free movement of construction professionals in the EU\r\n\u2022favour a cross-cutting understanding of the different trades in the construction sector through the flexibility of blended Learning Outcomes which are transferable and applicable to the different qualifications \r\n\u2022enable learners to build a qualification at their own pace from learning outcomes acquired in their own country and abroad\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY, ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS \r\nThese goals will be achieved through: \r\n\u2022Intellectual Outputs : \r\nIO1: Energy Skills Units of Learning Outcome (ULOs) based on the ECVET model. \r\nIO2: Guidelines for Energy Skills ULOs assessment and validation. Partners will sign a MoU where they will commit to voluntary recognize and validate the LOs acquired through the Energy Skills units and adopt BRICKS of SKILLS  guidelines for their assessment and validation\r\nIO3: Position paper to mainstream project results to policy/decision makers providing recommendations for the BRICKS of SKILLS  take up at regional /national/EU level.\r\n\r\n\u2022Learning Activities: \r\nLA1: trainers and teachers will be trained in the delivering and assessing Energy Skills ULOs enabling training and education centres to deliver qualified and up to date teaching that meets 2030 energy targets.\r\nLA2: mobility of a group of VET learners (EQF4-5) undertaking upskilling activities in the form of Energy Efficiency.  \r\n\u2022Multiplier events will be organised in each of the partners\u2019 country involving numerous stakeholders to encourage BRICKS OF SKILLS knowledge of transfer ato other organisations enabling innovation.\r\nA solid management framework will ensure the achievement of the project goals in compliance with the time set in the project GANTT, in order to successfully accommodate the complexity and scale of this project.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS and EXPECTED IMPACT  \r\nDIRECT PARTICIPANTS\r\n-project partners and their staff who will be involved in the activity of the project\r\n-trainers and mentors in the construction sector (12): will participate in a train the trainer event in Caen. It is expected that, once back to their own institutions, these trainers will be able to transfer their knowledge to others increasing the number of the project beneficiaries meeting  industries needs. \r\n-VET learners (EQF4-5) in the construction sector(12 plus 6 accompanying persons): they will participate to the mobility in Portugal (Porto). The Skills of Energy ULOs will be tested and included in the training pathways during the project life cycle, therefore we expect a larger number of learners from the construction sector to be involved. Students will acquire new competences in line with industry needs resulting in their increased employability, not only in their own country but also others due to their skills being validated. \r\n\r\nINDIRECT PARTICIPANTS \r\n30 stakeholders will benefit and endorse the BRICKS OF SKILLS project per country, representing both the private and public sector from both the education sector and industry. Indirect participants will represent the following categories:  VET providers and public education authorities, building companies, Trade Unions, Accreditation bodies, Local council policy departments, policy-makers responsible for education, accreditation and employment, NGOs working with green building, chambers of crafts, employers\u2019 organisations.", "http://www.westcollegescotland.ac.uk", "West College Scotland", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048017_coordinator"], [2018, "Go Global Vers. 4", "West College Scotland", 151363.0, 6, 8, "AARHUS TECH has been through many changes the past two years. Implementation of the reform of the vocational system, a restructure of the organization and a cut back of 10% of staff. This could easily have had a negative influence on the international opportunities for our students. This is not the case. In 2015 a first version of the international strategy was developed and different implementation strategies tested. In 2016 the strategy was approved and the college is now in the implementation phase focusing on embedding internationalisation through 4 focal activity areas: Internationalisation at home, International mobilities, development activities and network and competence development. \r\nIn January 2018 the strategy was revisited and adjusted. The strategic focus continues to be on the four dimensions already mentioned, though in the implementation putting a stronger focus on teachers involvement and competence development. The number of student and staff mobilities have been adjusted reflecting the lower number of students and staff. The target is still to send 7% of our students on international mobilities, which with today\u2019s number of VET students is equivalent to 115 students a year. This means that the objectives of the strategy will be reached before 2020 \u2013 and most likely we will achieve above our objectives. The revised international strategy is attached. \r\n\r\nThe majority of our students going abroad will replace part of a main course with an international module. The modules are being implemented in our yearly schedule, which means students can plan ahead and select modules according to their interested and the interest of their employer. Mobilities in this project will support students from ICT, painters, Industrial technicians, blacksmith, civil construction, carpenters, electricians, gastronomy, media graphic and property service technician to attend international and fully accredited modules in Netherlands, England, Scotland, Finland, Spain and France. Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU that is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership. In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge (F) and West College Scotland (UK) is following the same concept and guidelines although the colleges are not yet a part of the EMEU network.\r\nFor basic course students we have developed and testet an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an 2 week ECVET accredited mobility experience UK. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global includes a course for the students on cultural intelligence, communication, teamwork and prevention of conflicts. The course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. \r\n\r\n112 students and 30 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. 7 of the students are on long term mobilities in either Spain or Turku, Finland. Furthermore the board of AARHUS TECH consisting of 14 members from social partners and student representatives wish to do a study trip to Gradia college in Finland to learn from their vocational educations in general and specifically on internationalisation.  \r\nA total of 30 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET. In this application new educational areas are being involved (electricians, media graphic and property service technician). Our experience I that a first step for success is always to exchange teachers and give them a chance to find a common ground, this way we can identify the best fit modules for ECVET accredited modules.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect upon.\r\n1. Implementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules.\r\n2. The Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English. \r\n3. Dissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. In the future the implementation of the international strategy should also includes a dissemination strategy.", "http://www.westcollegescotland.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA116-046891_3"], [2014, "Learning for life - vocational training abroad", "West College Scotland", 150998.0, 4, 12, "Internationalization is very important for the Municipality of Eskilstuna, Sweden, and its schools.   For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results.  Our cooperation with our partners around Europe has developed in a positive way and our intention is to continue this work together so that more and more students are able to participate.  Most of the students participating in this project are in vocational programs within the fields of  Restaurant, Trade and administration, Childcare, Nursing and health care,Trades such as hairdressing and finally Hotel and Tourism and they attend the local schools St Eskils gymnasium, Rekarnegymnasiet and Rinmangymnasiet.  Participating in the project is also a group of students with special needs.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are many objectives of a project like this, and for the students it involves both professonal ones and personal ones.  The 72 students that we'd like to send abroad will get training in their respective field, training that corresponds to the objectives in the our national curriculum.  \r\n\r\nOur goal is also that the students develop on a personal level, as a result of intercultural learning.  Since our students change country for a while, meet and cooperate with people who speak a different language and who have different backgrounds but work in the same field. they get a larger intercultural understanding.   This kind of project gives the students an increased knowledge of foreign languages, and it promotes the study of languages. \r\n\r\nWe want the students to spread information about their experiences doing vocational training abroad, to inspire other students to do the same.  All kinds of international cooperation is beneficial on different levels.  Locally it's important that students have an increased knowledge and understanding of different cultures, to hinder segregation and racism.  This is true also an a national and european level.   The more positive contact we have with people from other cultures and countries and the more international projects we run the better.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen earlier that the students get increased selfconfidence when they do vocational training abroad, which is very important for their future,  It helps them to complete their studies and possibly start new ones.  Drop-outs is an increasing problem both in Sweden and the rest of Europe and this kind of project can increase the students' motivation to get an education.  The project can also have a positive impact on their belief in themselves to apply for jobs and possibly make them more inclined to look for work somewhere else.  They see that they can handle working far away from home, or they get curious about doing something like this from listening to their friends sharing their experiences.  This is important since unemployment is an increasing problem and it would be positive if young people would be willing to move to other cities or sometimes other countries to find work.  Overall a project like this should make the students more employable.\r\n\r\nWe know that vocational training abroad is beneficial in many ways;  not only do the students learn a trade but they experience a personal development that is beneficial to them for the rest of their lives.", "http://www.westcollegescotland.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA102-000300_11"], [2016, "Acquisition of key competencies and international transfers of professional experience in new Technologies in engineering", "West College Scotland", 147425.0, 4, 4, "FLOW No 1: New Technologies on Motor Vehicle System Diagnostics and Hybrid technology - West College ScotlandThe participating students have been selected as they are currently attending the motor vehicle course at school.

Implementation of the reform of the vocational system, a restructure of the organization and a cut back of 10% of staff. This could easily have had a negative influence on the international opportunities for our students. This is not the case. In 2015 a first version of the international strategy was developed and different implementation strategies tested. In 2016 the strategy was approved and the college is now in the implementation phase focusing on embedding internationalisation through 4 focal activity areas: Internationalisation at home, International mobilities, development activities and network and competence development. The international strategy is attached together with description of procedures to support embedment of administration of mobilities, receiving and sending students. \r\n\r\nThe majority of our students going abroad will replace part of a main course with an international module. The modules are being implemented in our yearly schedule, which means students can plan ahead and select modules according to their interested and the interest of their employer. Mobilities in this project will support students from ICT, painters, Industrial technicians, blacksmith, auto mechanics, civil construction, carpenters, electricians and gastronomy to attend international and fully accredited modules in Netherlands, England, Scotland, Finland, Spain and France. Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU which is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership (participating partners: JAO, Finland; Horizon College, Netherlands; XABEC and Bizkaia, Spain; Bridgwater & Taunton, UK). In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge (F), Da Vinci College (NL) and West College Scotland (UK) is following the same concept and guidelines although the colleges are not yet a part of the EMEU network. \r\n170 students and 25 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. \r\n\r\nPreviously the main international activities for students were integrated in a prolonged the basic course. With the new reform, we had to rethink this. The spring of 2016 a test of an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an ECVET accredited mobility experience UK, was tested. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global was tested with ICT and Auto Mechanic students. Go Global a course for the students on cultural intelligence. This part of the course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. Another learning from the test course was that a 3 week mobility was too long for a large group of students to be able to pass the basic course. 3 out of 19 students did not pass the exam. We have decided to continue to run the optional course but reduce the mobility to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA total of 25 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance and administration of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET and of course specialised educational areas as advanced testing of materials (Lycee Monge), decorative painting (Bizkaia) and racing (Bridgwater&Taunton). Furthermore 3 teachers will have teaching assignments with partners on areas where we have expertise (accuracy in CNC), specialised welding.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect.\r\nImplementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. \r\n\r\nThe Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English.\r\n\r\nDissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. Therefore, the communication department is also involved in this project as active participants.

The aim is to provide the growing Vaasa region with a competent labour force that will thrive in the international, multicultural and multilingual working life and society. The objective of the project Professional Skills through Mobilities@vamia.fi is to implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are based on the ECVET system. The methods for identifying and recognizing skills achieved abroad will be further developed for all students. The students\u2019 personal digital portfolio  will be further developed, and the students and staff will be more deeply familiarized with the utilization of it. In addition to this, all the practices regarding adult education students will be developed in order to create a high-quality process for international mobilities.\r\nThe project will enable all staff members and students to participate in international mobilities.The project will pilot and in the future intends to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students.  The project will enable shorter mobilities for students with special needs.  Multilingualism will be promoted by developing Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and training (starting in autumn 2017) as well as developing CLIL in all vocational education and training programs.\r\nIn the project new partnerships will be created. New partners will be given the opportunity to job shadow or do on-the-job learning in Vaasa. This will allow the staff and students of Vamia to get internationalized at home, make new contacts and together develop the quality of student mobilities.\r\nDuring this project we strive to further develop genuine and high-quality partnerships and networking while supporting Vamia\u2019s strategy and benefiting all stakeholders as well as contributing to quality assurance and safety of student mobilities. The aim is continuous improvement of the quality of international activities and mobilities by applying and developing LEAN tools such as continuous development boards, and by simplifying and standardizing practices. This applies to preparatory courses for students, on-the-job learning and assessment, the administration of international activities and the uniformity of practices across Vamia.  This also includes continuous training of the staff on the areas of responsibility and the phases of the international guidance plan as well as the continuous development of the students\u2019 use of the personal digital portfolio.\r\nThe aim is also to provide everyone with the opportunity to go abroad regardless of their study program, age, sex, and language or cultural background. The aim of the project is also to develop and increase the mobilities of adult students. Short mobilities for special needs students with an accompanying teacher (2 weeks in Glasgow), and a system for financially supporting students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds will be developed. A framework and a transparent application process will be developed for this.\r\nIn the project one of the objectives is to develop the competence of the management and staff through job shadowing. Vamia\u2019s management group of 15 persons (principal, vice principals, heads of department, development manager, financial director, manager of international affairs, and the people in charge of LEAN development) aim to do job shadowing in a vocational school in Tilburg, Holland, and learn about their LEAN and Oppiscrum system. The school has been developing their management system according to LEAN principles while Vamia has been using LEAN in teaching and learning environments. The two schools will learn from each other through mutual exchanges. Furthermore, we aim to send three teachers from the department of business and administration to Kunskapsk\u00e4llan in Sweden, where they can deepen their knowledge of e-commerce. Kunskapsk\u00e4llan is situated close to Bor\u00e5s, which is a center for e-commerce in Sweden. Vamia, together with local companies, will start export mechanical fitter education in English. Four members of the staff will be going to Elgoibar, Spain, to get acquainted with their English-speaking programs for fitters. The aim is to create job shadowing and cooperation between the two schools as well as to together create and share teaching material and develop cooperation with companies. The staff mobilities will consist of job shadowing in vocational schools and local companies, creating contacts and developing the quality of student mobilities.

It has been difficult to arrange work placements abroad for security programme students because of the local legislation abroad.\r\nNew partnerships have been created through different projects which we now want to pilot. Some of the previous partners will no longer be in this project because changes of contact persons has made the collaboration less qualitative. The collaboration between partners is mutual and this give a good opportunity for personnel and students in Vamia to internationalize at home, build new contacts and to develop the quality of student exchanges together.\r\nNew partners will also  be given the opportunity to job shadow or do traineeship in Vaasa. There are eg mutual partners in Portugal (a new country), Denmark and Basque country. Collaboration with Germany will be further developed (a big demand in Technics).

They will develop further LEAN procedures in their own department. The collaboration is mutual. The participating personnel will get trained for Erasmus+ procedures, ECVET and travel security so they are more confident when they send teachers and students abroad. Also 3 representants from working life Villa Isolahti will participate in expert exchange together with Vamia\u00b4 s personnel to get to know elderly care and practical nurse education in Spain Gijon. Villa Isolahti reseive on yearly basis several Spanish exchange students. The rest of the exchanges in this project consists of job shadowing visits to school and local companies, to build contacts and to develop student exchanges.\r\nThere will be transferred 2 expert mobilities from year 2017 to autumn because of the wishes of host partner. All student mobilies for spring 2018 will may be not used in fully and if that\u00b4s the case there will be transferred approximately 20 student mobilities to early spring 2018.

Ostrobothnia and Vaasa commuting area is bilingual and multilingual. There are many international companies who has English as working language, specially in technology (energy). International competence and good language skills are tools for future success. \r\n\r\nDuring 2013-2015 Vaasa Vocational Institute started piloting ECVET principles in the international mobilities for students. At the same time the institute has tried to establish a continuing and mutual collaboration based on mutual trust and understanding with the partners in Europe. The aim has been to get all study programs at Vaasa Vocational Institute involved in the international activities. \r\n\r\nOVERALL GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE: \r\n\r\nThe project Establishing_ECVET@vao.fi is a mobility project for students and staff at Vaasa Vocational Institute. The project offers mobility to all study programs (EQF4) within the framework for  ECVET -principles. The focus lies on quality and security of mobilities and also on  indentification and recognition of knowledge and skills gained  during the whole mobility process from the beginning to the end with the help of portfolio combined with a electronic  blog.  \r\n\r\nThe focus lies even on the possibilities that the new national curricula for vocational education enables   and on identification and  recognition of informal learning and key competences for lifelong learning. A big emphasis lies also in participants commitment in planning the participants mobilities. \r\n\r\nThe participants are selected among second and third year students from initial vocational programmes (EQF4) within Vaasa Vocational Institute. Students within all disciplines are offered the possibility to participate.  Participants from staff will be head of departments, vocational teachers, study councellors and international co-ordinators. The amount of students is 74 and experts 15. \r\n\r\nThe partners abroad concists of organisations in Sweden, Estonia, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, Spain and Slovenia (totally 15 partners). \r\n\r\nWHY  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration with the partners and the ECVET work at Vaasa Vocational Institute has now come to the point that there is a need to deepen, extend, establish and to develop the quality of the exchange. Also identification and recognition of knowledge and skills that the students acquire abroad has to been extended outside the vocational objectives. Vaasa Vocational Institute is developing models and tools for identification and recognition of knowledge and skills based on the  possibilities that the new national curriculum is enabling (starting in August 1th 2015). These models and tools will be piloted in this project. There is a need for established collaboration with the existing partners with focus on quality and security of the mobilities.

The mobility will provide the opportunity for students and apprentices to apply prior learning and skills in a different context.  The programme responds to significant needs in high levels of youth unemployment across the West of Scotland, and in particular amongst young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  A high proportion of students enrolled at West College Scotland come from disadvantaged backgrounds. 49% of students reside in the 20% post deprived postcodes in the whole of Scotland.  Further , 14% of students have a declared disability.The \u2018enhancing employability and skills through mobilities\u2019 programme is thus targeted at a student population that faces particular disadvantage in the labour market and less opportunities to develop added value skills and experiences due to the background of income and employment deprivation that many students face.  The mobility programme will support 26 students across a range of curricular areas, including apprentices and those studying national and higher national qualifications.  WCS have developed a programme collaboratively with partner institutions in Finland and Denmark, focused on providing high value placement activities that both align with and add value to the SQA vocational qualifications that participants are pursuing, and offer the opportunity to develop core employability skills.  Partner organisations have developed placement opportunities that WCS students will be invited to apply for.  Students will be selected for the programme and the placement opportunities refined and tailored to their particular learning needs.  Participants will be supported throughout the placement period through a supervisor from the host organisation.Planned results and impact for the project include achievement of ECVET credits for activity undertaken, Europass Mobility for each participant.

The menus will be displayed in Spanish in addition to English and there will be theme days with Spanish food on the menu.The head teacher and 1+2 co-ordinator will use their acquired language skills in the delivery of whole school assemblies.Learning assistants will use the skills gained from the course to produce accurate Spanish displays and classroom resources, lead games in Spanish during playtimes and breakfast clubs and support teachers in the modelling of good Spanish practices.We envisage that on completion of the immersion course, as well as being able to further and with increased confidence embed Spanish in the daily life of school we will be able to hold Spanish theme days within school where we concentrate on Spanish culture as well as the language.  We hope to be able to invite local schools within our learning community to join us on some of these as well as inviting parents to attend.

In compliance with the Scottish Government's 1+2 strategy, in 2014 we started to deliver West Dunbartonshire's Spanish programme to all classes throughout the school. Locally it was decided that the second additional language would now be French and we therefore commenced the delivery of a French programme to Primary 6 and 7 in 2015, utilising our one member of staff who had previously completed the MLPS French course. The upcoming national requirement will be to roll out French lessons from Primary 5 upwards. This will potentially entail 6 classes requiring tuition in French, for which we do not currently have a sufficient number of qualified personnel to deliver. We therefore believe that the attendance of 2 members of teaching staff and a Learning Assistant on the French Immersion course is necessary to enable the school to meet these national and local authority requirements. As we are committed to continuously improving and building on embedding Spanish within our school ethos and curriculum, we fully support the Continuing Professional Development of all staff in Spanish. We therefore hope to allow another member of the Senior Management team (SMT) the opportunity of completing the Spanish Immersion course. This will also enable the SMT to work together to track, observe, evaluate and assess the teaching and learning of Spanish throughout the school. It will also allow classes to benefit from being covered by a professional who can use Spanish confidently within the classroom. The attending member of SMT will be able to support new teachers at the school in their Spanish delivery and will use her acquired language skills in the delivery of whole school assemblies.After the training it is planned that the attending French teachers will work collaboratively to develop and provide a programme of French lessons for all pupils in primaries five to seven, utilising the resources provided on the course. The Learning Assistant will provide invaluable support to the teaching staff through modeling conversation, creating stimulating displays and using French outside the classroom.We envisage that the completion of the French immersion course will provide the participants with the necessary linguistic skills and knowledge required to create and deliver a progressive, engaging and accurate programme of learning experiences for our pupils. In addition to this the increased abilities of the staff members will allow us to better utilise our existing link with our partner french school and possibly develop further links, communicating via e-mail and Skype.We will build on our current momentum for European culture and languages by holding both Spanish and French theme days within school.

We are following our Local Authority Planner which has been designed to introduce all pupils (from Primary 1 to 7) to Spanish at Primary 1 level in year one, progress to Primary 2 level in year two and so on, following a full seven year programme. We are currently working on the second year of the programme.  At the start of each school year time is allocated to all our staff to work together discussing the planner for each term and suggested resources and methodologies which can be shared in delivering this.  As the appointed 1 + 2 Languages Co-ordinator I lead these sessions for all 11 staff and our small compliment of 18 pupils.  The Spanish planner was designed in line with the Primary 1 curriculum, for example, as pupils are becoming more confident with the days of the week, colours, numbers, daily greetings and class room instructions they are learning them in Spanish at the same time.  This is done using a variety of resources, including some lovely songs from the internet.  Greetings have become very popular with all staff and pupils and weekly assemblies often begin with a Spanish song or learning a little bit about Spanish culture.  Last year we had a whole school Mardi Gras celebration at Easter and term 4 was dedicated to Spain across the whole school.  This was very successful as pupils enjoyed daily visits to our Spanish market where they would greet each and order fruit in Spanish.  Pupils then employed maths skills to work out totals in euros and change to be given.  Pupils then kept their fruit and sat at our Spanish cafe and ordered drinks (in Spanish of course).  Further lessons developed from this across the curriculum, eg adjective lessons (choosing from 3 Spanish adjectives) to describe the taste, feel, smell of the fruit and veg.  Food was used to demonstrate halves and quarters and in art a collage was made of a healthy Mediterranean dish.  I am very keen to keep the pace of enthusiasm up and believe that by accessing the mobility activity this would go a long way to help me continue to deliver Spanish language and culture lessons with new teaching methods or tools.  My objectives are to help keep staff and pupils motivated by introducing other methods of good practice for us to share and enjoy.  The pupils never object to learning new Spanish words alongside, for example, learning the months of the year in English.  I envisage becoming more confident in my knowledge of Spanish and learning more about sentence structure rather than isolated words.  I believe this would have a very positive impact on staff and pupils alike.  Pupils are becoming more and more interested in the language and have began to enquire how certain sentences or phrases are said.  With the knowledge and skills the course provides the results both now and in the long term for our school would be very beneficial.   Pupils are demonstrating confidence in their learning and adding depth to this would have a very positive impact on their self-esteem.  It is very rewarding observing these pupils as they embrace the Spanish language and culture.During the Spanish topic term I expect the impact to be positive and I plan to help deliver a greater cultural awareness to staff which can be transferred to pupils.  Pupils and staff have been shown a real interest in any Spanish traditions we have learned about and by attending the course I aim to ensure we keep staff and pupils motivated and engaged for many years to come.So far the implementation has been very successful and I believe the mobility activity will enable me to continue our good practice over the coming years.", null, "Cunard Primary Schhol", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023408_coordinator"]]}}, "1RR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "RHI Magnesita on Tour 2018", "RHI UK", 4009.0, 2, 2, "Didier-Werke AG is an international company in the refractory industry and also an important partner of the steel industry.

Where other modes of transport benefit from the economy of series production, this is not the case for maritime products which are typically designed to refined customer requirements increasingly determined by the need for high efficiency, flexibility and low environmental impact at a competitive price. Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).\nOne of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. \nAdvanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions.
