In this proposal we look at short supply chains from the perspective of urban rather than rural development. Short supply chains can play a role in addressing urban problems such as climate change, obesity, storm water control, etc.\nShort food supply chains have been advocated as a means to reduce CO2 impact of the agricultural system. Although a reduction of food miles certainly contributes to reducing climate impact, this proposal takes as premise that to really improve the ecological performance of the food system other flows of goods and services need to be shortened as well (e.g. nutrient, water, and carbon cycles need to be closed). In the current context these aspects are usually treated separately, this proposal argues to treat them more integrated.\nThe research will analyse the way in which several European city regions deal with short supply chains in food, nutrients, water, and carbon. The project will facilitate selected SMEs to further innovate in food production and delivery, nutrient and water management, and multifunctional use of space, and will disseminate the results among a wider audience of SMEs. By doing so, the research will look beyond the state of the art, it will suggest how city regions could look like if they chose to further relocalise their food system.\nFinally the project will also establish links with stakeholders and RTD activities regarding urban and peri-urban agriculture and short chain delivery of food in urban and peri-urban areas in developing countries.

(ecology, 3 foreign languages and immersion class)\r\n\r\nOur school conveys general knowledge and enhances abilities which will enable students to climb the corporate ladder or to enroll in academic studies. It is HLW\u2019s objective to offer a solid education and to implement intellectually challenging learning experiences.\r\n\r\nFostering communicative abilities are encouraged as well as presenting an appropriate self-portrayal. Additionally pupils are inculcated to value tolerance, thoughtfulness, open-mindedness, solidarity etc.\r\nAll faculty members assist our students in developing skills to become independent and self-sufficient adults who will succeed and contribute responsibly in our global community. \r\n\r\nFor the last seventeen years the HLW staff has encouraged its students to take part in the mobility EU-Leonardo vocational training program, providing the individuals working experience abroad and enhancing efficiency and innovation in the field of gastronomy.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve week compulsory internship in the hospitality industry the trainee is supervised by a professional food and beverage mentor. The trainee gets a comprehensive view of all the processes at work which the professional is involved. He/She is mentored to develop and promote his/her knowledge in gastronomy, enhance in their foreign language and IT skills, and improve their EU cultural awareness competencies.

In spite of the influential role of PAHs in the ISM, their lifecycle, catalytic activity, interaction with interstellar radiation, gas and grains and their role in the organic inventory of solar system bodies is still poorly understood. The EUROPAH ETN aims to change this by creating a highly multidisciplinary network that combines astronomy, molecular physics, molecular spectroscopy, environmental science, quantum chemistry, surface sciences, and plasma physics in a comprehensive research and training program. EUROPAH will train 16 ESRs through cutting edge individual research and innovation projects investigating key physical and chemical processes of PAHs in space and related terrestrial settings and linking directly to R&D needs of our industrial beneficiaries.
