The internships are an integral part of the education.  Internships abroad require financial support in order to give as many students as possible this opportunity.The students work in a broad spectrum of companies, from planning agencies, design companies, and forestry schools, to gardens for vegetables and flowers.  They thereby not only test the knowledge they amassed while at school, but they also learn the first steps in beginning a career, which may not be widespread in Austria, such as specialized perennial nurseries, planning agencies, that also execute plans, nursery facilities, etc.  By working abroad in a country with a foreign language, the students can deepen their understanding of the English language.  This should also awaken an interest to think outside the national border, when the students choose a future place of work or study.  In the first phase of the project, a total of 20 students will be placed in 6 European countries:  8 in Great Britain, two in Ireland, two in Italy, two in Sweden, one in Portugal and 6 in Germany.  12 students specialize in the market gardening program, while the other 8 focus on garden and landscape design.  That is more than half of the entire student population in that class year.In the second phase of the project, we expect an even larger number of students, because the internship program can be promoted right from the beginning.With our advice and support, the students look for internships themselves.  We provide the students with the appropriate information and insurance.  All the participants can contact us, the advisors, at any time via email or cellphone.  The interns are required to keep a journal for the duration of their internship.  This is necessary for the positive completion of the internship.The internships can be considered a success if the students integrate their work abroad into their plans for the future as a matter of course.In the long-term, we are working on building an informal network of companies and institutions, which will share our commitment to the internship education of the students and offer young people the chance to broaden their horizons.", "http://www.graduatelandscapes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016488_4"]]}}, "7NY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Sharing experiences", "Bohunt School", 36298.0, 3, 3, "N\u00f6sn\u00e4sgymnasiet work strategically with internationalization for both staff and students. For this year's application has the following development areas been identified;  - Increase the quality as well as work on new methods in education which, in turn, will discourage early school leaving and exclusion. This will be achieved through participation in different courses. Participants will be selected by the principals. Language teachers (3 pieces) as well as special education teacher (2 pieces) will participate in the training courses. These courses are organized in Scotland, England, Ireland and Finland. The courses include the development of teaching methods, English in education for students with special needs as well as how they in Finland has reached such good results within the schools.  - Implement a change concerning the programs which focus on math, science and technology when it comes to teaching methods, the job shadowing will take place at Bohuntschool, England. To Bohunt all teachers (20 pieces) within mathematics, science and technology will job shadow for five days over a two year period. Since the school in England are in the top place when it comes to the results in these topics we like to find out more about what makes the school so successful. This knowledge will the teachers receive through job shadowing. - Developing teachers' skills in information technology. The ICT educationalists at school (5 pieces) will job shadow colleagues in Oslo, Norway, which has extensive experience of one-to-one teaching methods and also other methods of using the computer as a tool in teaching. N\u00f6sn\u00e4sgymnasiet must develop the use of the computers and get new inspiration for both students and teachers. The results of these activities will be increased competence relating to language, the ability to understand teaching methods in different countries and what it is that gives the successful results, new methods and teaching way. In the long term, the increased skills of staff will give higher proportion of students to achieve even better results In conclusion, the project will contribute to the EU's specific goals within the school grounds with improving quality and performance in learning, as well as the Swedish goal  to increase the skills of educational staff, increasing the capacity of basic skills-mathematics and science as well as discourage early school drop-out.", "http://www.bohuntschool.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA101-021812_1"], [2018, "V\u00e4gar att st\u00e4rka elevers motivation i ett europeiskt perspektiv", "Bohunt School", 33678.0, 5, 5, "Student evaluations conducted in recent years at Nyhemsskolan show a lack of commitment and motivation among many students. For us, as for many other schools in Sweden, it is a challenge to motivate students and help them find their \"grit\". We believe that we, the educators, have a big role to play and we must strive to develop methods that create motivation, grit and interest in learning. In the analysis of student surveys, we have identified four different areas of development that all create motivation: \r\n\r\n* Authenticity in teaching. This gives students a sense of context and make them see the benefits of the knowledge they are expected to learn, ie students see the value of use in school skills.\r\n* Find ways to organize and implement  teaching so that students find their grit and  inner motivation, increase students' accountability and help them own their own learning.\r\n* Create a functioning classroom ecology with routines, structure and high expectations of students which can give students  external motivation. (Leadership)\r\n* Find alternative organizational models for how to work with students in need of special support so that these students feel that they are part of a context and consequently, develop motivation.\r\n\r\nWorking with  quality improvement and peer learning during the previous academic year, teachers at Nyhemsskolan realized how much we can learn from one another. The interest in continuing, and developing the quality in our education through peer learning increased. In conversations with our neighboring school that recently started  an Erasmus-projects, we found it interesting to hear how schools in Europe repeatedly succeed better than Swedish schools, despite the fact that they, in many cases, do not have the same conditions as we do. Could there be a difference in how schools in other European countries work with ambition?\r\n   \r\nThrough comparative didactics, we intend to compare our teaching with teaching in another socio-cultural context.  As we believe motivation is the key to success, our shadowing will focus on the four identified development areas. Through shadowing we will be made aware of the various aspects that build our own practice and this way we can develop new methods to strengthen students' motivation. In order to do this we need a different context to relate to, which  is offered to us by schools in other European countries. The shadowing is  supplemented with reflexive conversations with teachers at the receiving school in order to deepen our understandinng and knowledge, as well as for mutual learning. Back at school, the reflexive conversations continue when teachers share their experience at meetings for peer learning.  In this process, we now notice things we have taken for granted in our own practice and we can therefore develop methods for creating authenticity, context, meaning, routines and structure that promote the students' motivation and willingness to learn.\r\n\r\nWe will perform our shadowing activities over a two-year period, so the meetings for peer learning will be part of our quality work for a long period of time eventhough the content might develop gradually. The project will be carried out with the support of an associate professor of the R & D unit to ensure scientific quality.\r\n\r\nTo us, this project is extended peer learning that concerns all educational staff and therefore our ambition is to include the entire staff in either job shadowing activities and/or the follow-up learning at school. We will visit four schools in France, Italy, England and Germany. All are chosen with care based on our four areas of interest. We will conduct five job shadowing activities and each activity involves six teachers. The arrangements for the visits will be more or less the same and in each of these, the receiving school will be visited during three school days during which job shadowing will be carried out. In addition, the receiving school will arrange meetings for reflexive discussions.\r\n\r\nToday, our school offers solid education, modern technology and very competent  teachers. Still, we (and maybe even Swedish school in general) do not reach the levels you would expect considering our resources. We believe that a great deal is due to the fact that many Swedish students seem to be poorly motivated. The pupils, and especially the boys, do not see the meaning and value of what they learn because there is often a lack of authenticity, context and maybe even a lack of structure and leadership.\r\n\r\nWe expect this project to result in new methods for organizing teaching so that students become more committed and motivated. We also hope to find a balance between successful traditional methods and new ideas. By finding the keys to the students' motivation we can open up their opportunities to reach the school's educational goals and, most importantly, to motivate them to become  responsible and committed adults who reach their full potential in life.", "http://www.bohuntschool.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038795_3"]]}}, "7QW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1328054400000, 1454198400000, "Effective Communication in Outbreak Management: development of an evidence-based tool for Europe", "Strategic Social Marketing Limited", "Although scientific knowledge to respond to outbreaks has increased, deficiencies remain in the ability of health authorities to communicate the need for large-scale measures such as vaccination and antiviral therapy and increase its acceptance.
