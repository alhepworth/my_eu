In this way the project relates to the EU2020 target for inclusive growth.\r\nIt also relates to the following points of the EC\u2019s European Disability Strategy (2010-2020).\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nQuality is one of the values that the EUSE (European Union of Supported Employement) wants to develop in the coming years as a strategic key point. Because by improving the quality of the service providers (in EFQM terms: improving leadership, strategy & policy, people, processes, partners & resources) you get better results (in EFQM terms: people results, customer results, society results, key performance results). Hence the final target group (workseekers with a (dis)ability) benefits: improving people by improving the quality of service providers.\r\nThe auditsystem related to this model will be designed via the \u2018single audit principle\u2019. So organizations who already have a quality model can easily assess their organization(and make up a growth and development plan) on the basic principles of supported employment.\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nWe want to develop 4 products.\r\n1. A quality framework\r\n2. A self-assessment toolkit. The result of this self-assessment is an overview of points in which the organization can grow, improve and further develop in using supported employment.\r\n3. A growth and development plan. The quality framework ensures that organizations are comparable (benchmark) and share good practices and thus come via this route to growth and development.\r\n4. A training module for the Supported Employment Quality Assessor. This training ensures that the self-assessment takes place in a standardized way. We will also develop a train the trainer module so future assessors can be trained (= dissemination).\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nThere are 6 participants: SUEM.be, IASE, BASE, Fondation Emplea, SENO en EUSE.\r\nEUSE is the European umbrella organisation witch unites 17 countries on the topic \u2018supported employment\u2019. All the other organisations are national umbrella organisations, who also unites different local service providers working on supported employment (e.g. SUEM.be consists of 4 national organizations)\r\nOne of the most important aspects in successfully implementing a quality model is the support of the management. This is why the management has a very important role in the development and implementation of the 4 products.\r\nNext to the management, technicians with the necessary expertise on the supported employment proces are involved. Also teachers/trainers are necessary to develop the training program.\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: We made up a time shedule in which we respect the PDCA- quality cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Adapt). We have a wide experience in project management and will develop the project as such.\r\nResults: become better organizations in provinding supported employment. Having a quality model so we make sure our customers (vulnerable workseekers and their employers) get the best service in order to find and keep their job on the regular labour market.\r\nLong term benefits: by becoming better in provinding supported employemt the 'turn over' gets shorter, so more people can benefit  from the service delivered by supprted employment organizations.", "http://www.base-uk.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE02-KA202-012362_5"], [2017, "Safety at work", "British Association for Supported Employment", 6145.0, 2, 3, "Safety  is something which is considered as a fundamental item when speaking about people at work. Safety of workers with Down syndrome (SD) and more generally of  workers with intellectual disabilities is something even more specific and fundamental. Until now just some countries have already dealt with this subject and there are no European guidelines avaliable. This is the reason why the Italian Association of people with Down syndrome (AIPD), which has a long-time experience in the field of job placement of its members, has recognised the need to face such an issue. \r\nTwo UK associations made them available for an exchange of experience and a face to face training to AIPD staff. They are: the British Association of Supported Employment and The Down's Syndrome Association. They are disability associations and have specific experience in the field of  job placement. They have been selected among others because of their multiannual experience in dealing with safety at work for this pscific target of would - be workers. \r\n\r\nThus, if the general objective of the project is to increase job placement rate of people with DS, the specific purpose is the awareness raising and the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes of 5 educators of AIPD staff about safety issues related to people with Down syndrome at work.  Two participants are part of the staff working at AIPD's headquarters (one belonging to the international relations office and one being the person in charge of all job placement actions within the association). The other three are working in AIPD's local associations and are trainers and managers of social cooperatives which employ people with DS. These group will then act as dissemination factor within the whole association.\r\n\r\nThe strategy adopted by AIPD to deal with safety at work within this project foresees the following activities:\r\n  -  Desk analysis and Internet research on safety at work of workers with DS.\r\n  -  Contacts  and agreement with European and foreign organisations working in this field.\r\n  -  Preparation of the participant staff in the concerned matters, by the means of materials and resources provided by partners.\r\n  -  5 days  study visit to UK organisations dealing with job placement of people with DS and especially experienced in safety at work issues.\r\n  -  Evaluation of the experience and diffusion within AIPD and EDSA, the European Down Syndrome Association, which AIPD currently holds the positions of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nFollow up of the project envisaged should be the draft of national guidelines of safety issues at work addressed to workers with DS, possibly in collaboration with the Italian Institute for safety at work (INAIL) .", "http://www.base-uk.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005769_2"]]}}, "3NF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "A European approach to the development of educational support for social businesses.", "The Enterprise Centre Ltd", 128490.0, 7, 7, "The Third Sector model is becoming increasingly more attractive as a prime provider of services in particular for the public sector as it falls in line with Government initiatives across the European Union, for example The Big Society in the UK and other regional responses to the financial difficulties of the last five years. When trained appropriately these organisations can be as effective, if not more so, in the delivery of products and services for local communities as they are committed to their social purpose. This brings vast amounts of added value to their work and a significant contribution of social and economic capital to individuals , local communities and the wider society. They are also overlooked as a growing source of employment crossing over a range of more traditional sectors such as public services, niche design and manufacture and hospitality and health.\r\n\r\nThe project has been developed to overcome the lack of EU exchange of best practice and appropriate support models for social businesses, described within Objective 4, as a model of social business support (SBSM). The ultimate product is the OnlineIncubator which is the on-line platform hosting the SBSM and all of its functions: incubator for partnerships and mobilities; a model of European best practice for social enterprise support and training. The project partnership has been working on the proposal for several years and comprises SMEs (social enterprises), local authorities and a university. An essential outcome of this project proposal is access to greater mobility across the EU alongside the formal recognition of the lifelong learning that this will bring. New initiatives in training and business support models for social enterprises, voluntary/ community groups, co-operatives and regional hubs of expertise will be generated through this proposed initiative. New strategies for successful and innovative delivery will be developed and shared across the project teams. \r\n\r\nThe current partnership has evolved over several years of working on this project proposal. Initially the partnership developed from contacts made via the Ecorys database, or from previous project partnerships. \r\n\r\nThe innovative aspects of the project proposal are considerable and will lead significantly to the development of \u2018future capital\u2019 and European Added Value for each partner as a consequence of shared experience and best practice. The innovations within this project include the unification, development of shared good practice to support new start SMEs, social enterprises and the third sector; the sharing of good practice, especially with respect to innovative and interactive methodologies, for both TVET and adult education; the development of internships and work experience across the third sector of the EEA/ EU and the greater use of social media platforms for marketing, dissemination and communications which may not be innovative per se but is for the third sector.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the project is (1) to bring together a network of likeminded agencies, Social Business support providers (SBSPs) to cooperate and support the development and growth of social enterprises and co-operatives across Europe through the development of sector-led training.  This forms the basis of the Social Business Support Model (SBSM). This new network will share expertise and experience and then transfer that knowledge to new or emerging community based initiatives through training, dissemination events and using various ICT models, particularly social networking. (2) In keeping with the processes of ECVET and EQAVET as identified within ET 2020, another key aim of this project is to work towards the standardization of the accreditation of social business support models and training and to give it a currency which can lead to progression to formal academic education if wished.\r\n\r\nKey Aim of the Project:\r\n\r\nThe project will develop an integrated pan-European approach to the educational and training support of social business in all of its forms.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nBy the end of the project, the following would be completed \u2026\u2026..\r\n\r\n1.

Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.
