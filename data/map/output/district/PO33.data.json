For aerospace applications, currently only conventional slip rings, with brushes, are on the market. The technique is proven, fairly reliable and robust, but there are clear drawbacks: wear, size and compromised signal integrity due to electrical noise.  \nA few commercial wireless slip rings are now available, however not designed and certified for aerospace applications. Flight-critical applications in harsh environments require a fault-tolerant design. The future need for qualification has to be taken into account from the start of the development.\nThe call for proposal asks for the development of wireless slip rings for power and data transfer for a flight-critical application within the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). This CfP is a technical and industrial challenge, which provides an opportunity for improving competitiveness on this important improvement part of the NGCTR program of the CS2 work plan.\nFor the development of Constance, NLR will combine their tiltrotor experience from the FP5 TILTAERO and FP7 NICETRIP programs with their patented wireless slip ring design and knowledge from the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor project of the CS2 Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft program. The distinguishing feature of the Constance slip ring is the specific orientation of the rotor and stator parts of the contactless slip ring which makes the design mechanically robust, safe and fault tolerant up to high rotational speeds. For the extension towards the flight-critical application on the tiltrotor the expertise of DDC Electronics Ltd. on power converters will be fully incorporated into the proven technology.   \nIn Constance, three redundant slip ring assemblies with flight clearance will be delivered to the topic manager for ground and flight testing on their NGCTR and two models will be used for extensive qualification tests.

Our vocational college educates students in the fields of electronics, IT, structural and civil engineering, timber construction and integrated building technologies. The Erasmus exchange allows students to complete an internship with an international company, in a foreign country. This takes place, as part of their vocational education, at some point between July 2018 and June 2019. The name of the project is \u201cHTL Rankweil 2018 Internship Abroad and Internationalisation\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur school is known outside of Austria and is situated in Vorarlberg, which lies in the heart of a prosperous and highly technical area of the Rhein valley (\u201cRheintal\u201d), where there are many international companies. Our graduates are sought after as skilled workers by these firms and as such, it is important that our students receive a high standard of education which not only provides a contemporary approach, but also considers elements which will be important in the years to come. Through our school\u2019s cooperation with with international companies, our students can complete a professional internship, as well as gaining professional experience in a foreign country. The project allows students to gain new knowledge and skills in their field, as well as giving them an important insight into the professional world. \r\n\r\nSix students from the Electronics and IT pathway have the opportunity to undertake their internship in the UK with international companies like Zumtobel Group, Liebherr and Neutrik AG. These internships last 4-6 weeks. From the construction pathway, four students can gather professional experiences with the construction company S+B Group in Prague or Warsaw. The aim of the project is to allow students to learn new, discipline-specific skills from a company in a foreign country and further develop what they have already learnt at school. In addition to this, it is a chance to improve their foreign language skills, as they are required to use English in the workplace. Furthermore, they receive international experience and develop valuable connections for later in their careers. The project strengthens cooperation with foreign companies and is an important stimulus for the school\u2019s international outlook. The school\u2019s network is further developed by the project because the students also get to know other firms and institutes whilst in their host countries. Through their residency, the students also get new socio-cultural awareness of another country and experience more of the European Union. This exchange also imparts social competences onto the students through working in a team and promotes independence, far away from home. The students develop greatly in terms of character.

Indwelling urethral catheters (IUC) are the most commonly deployed medical devices, it is estimated that ~100 million IUC are used annually in healthcare systems globally, which equates to ~190 catheterisations per minute. However, IUC are vulnerable to infection, undermining their utility, jeopardising patient welfare and posing a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. Over 40% of CAUTIs may be attributed to P. mirabilis, which poses particular problems in the care of catheterised patients. P. mirabilis causes encrustation and blockage of catheters, leading to serious complications such as pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock. It is difficult to eliminate from the catheterised urinary tract, even after the catheter is removed, and often causes chronic infection recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic therapy. Given the prolific use of IUC and corresponding prevalence of CAUTIs in healthcare systems across the world, development of bacteriophage based strategies for control of CAUTIs would open a niche in a global market that is projected to reach an annual value of \u20ac2 billion by 2015.'", 155787.0, 859162.0, 2, 4, "BATCIC", null, "http://www.biocontrol-ltd.com", null, "fp7_101397_968492427"]]}}, "2SG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Learning Paths Across Traditions History Society", "The New Carnival Company CIC", 115418.0, 5, 5, "The project \"Learning Paths Across History, Traditions,Society\" (L-PATHS) wants to start a new, different, way of practising inclusion. \"Inclusion\" of disadvantaged groups of people very often walks on a strange way of \"exclusion\".  Migrants, refugeees,handicapped, elderly are often \"excluded\" from social living ways by creating something just for them: learning courses for them, cultural paths for them, places for them in which the presence and the work of the \"others\", the so-called normal, is just a fact of leadership, coordination, temporary engagement. \r\n\r\nAccording to the UN resolution of November 2011, the human rights education is \" an ongoing process through which people at all levels of development and in all strata of society learn respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods to ensure that respect in all societies . \" We're talking about human rights : the right to be born equal in freedom and dignity, the right to personal integrity and self-determination. Human rights are fundamental. They exist independently of the existence of laws and can not be influenced by the habits and beliefs of a particular community. We have human rights even if there are no laws to protect them , because they are universal and inalienable ,  belong to every individual, whatever their ethnicity, social status, physical and mental health condition , political condition . We all have a duty to promote the dignity , tolerance and peace , educating individuals and groups to respect them, working to defend and support them.\r\n\r\nThrough the present project we want to create a stable cooperation between schools, associations , government agencies, voluntary, because the human rights education can move from single  and temporary interventions to a continuous joint action in order to start  the way for a real opportunity for self-affirmation of the weaker ones whose rights , if they exist, are daily trampled, ignored. Interventions will work on two interconnected paths: a cultural one and a more operative one.\r\n\r\nEach partner will put in action learning and cultural opportunities,using Arts and Performing Arts, especially Music, to promote and foster learning as well as social inclusion and a new citizenship. Arts will be the medium to learn about history, cultural identity,  language of the country where learners, both native and newcomers,live by involving them in long- lasting lab activities. Integration of different cultures and languages will obviously come along, due the composition of the groups. Language mediators will help in keeping communication alive, yet giving English, language of the project, the the preminent role. In particular in the first year labs will be on The Nature Life Cycle: folk rythes and festivities linked to seasons, weather, harvest... In the second year we'll exploit The Humans' Life Cycle: folk rythes and festivities linked to life and death, divinity, the supernatural....\r\n\r\nThese actions will be accompanied by more operative measures directed to minor groups and aimed to enhance enterpreunership. They will be both strictly connected to the making of the project's outputs and to the fulfillment of its objectives. So we all will build long-lasting crafts workshops as well as specific labs according to the target group each partner is addressing. The aim of the laboratories like the one described above is not only to ensure the little revenue to the members of the laboratory, but start a new community that could turn into social cooperative in the future. It is a first step to switch from openness to progressive participation of immigrants to build a common citizenship and acquire a new community that is able to overcome the difficulties of the present, projecting every effort towards the near future , making it feel not the immigrant but most host city in its own right , accepted and integrated into every neighborhood in a new town atmosphere. \r\n\r\nAll the activities, both cultural and operative, will be documented by the same learners guided by trainers, through videos, newsletters.
