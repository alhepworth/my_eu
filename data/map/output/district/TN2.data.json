In these schools, the preparation aims at transferring technical and professional competences linked to the field of tourism and hospitality, with particular attention to linguistic skills.

The project wants to be an opportunity of integration of the scholastic preparation because the theoretical acquaintances will be supported and completed with practical ones. The training will place students in various cultural and social contexts, encouraging them to develop adaptability and flexibility.
