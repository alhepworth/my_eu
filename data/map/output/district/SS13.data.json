It also aims to develop the confidence and managerial skills of our middle leadership team whilst enhancing our school's early years practice. \r\n\r\nWe want to send 28 participants on four different training activities over a period of two years. The project is divided into three main areas of whole school improvement; MFLs, Early Years and Middle Leadership. Each of these three areas have separate objectives that the project aims to meet. \r\n\r\nWe aim to send eleven of our KS1 and KS2 teachers to Spain so that they may develop an enthusiasm for teaching Spanish regularly when  the new 2014 curriculum is enforced, meaning that the teaching of MFL is compulsory. We aim that the training course they will undertake will help to build the foundations of a life long passion for teaching MFL. The impact of this will mean that Spanish will become an integral element within our school's curriculum and that teachers will place greater emphasis on the importance of this . \r\n\r\nWe aim to send six of our early years teachers to Sweden and six to Italy on courses to study high quality Early Years practice. The objectives of this activity are to give each teacher the opportunity to broaden and strengthen their existing knowledge within the Early Years.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to send five of our middle leaders to Finland for training in working in collaboration and to train in and develop good managerial strategies. The objectives of this activity aim to impact upon the way in which our middle leaders lead their key stages and areas of responsibilities. Ultimately, this activity will also strengthen the succession planning that the school already has in place. \r\n\r\nFinally, we hope that the impact of these training activities will increase our educational offer and help to enthuse, value and build staff moral so that our staff has good levels of staff retention.", "http://www.briscoe-pri.essesx.sch.uk", "Briscoe Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002091_coordinator"]]}}}}
