The potential applications for this technology are very broad however, in response to the COMPET-3-2016b we will focus the development on micro propulsion consistent with satellites having mass spanning the range from a multi-unit CubeSat to small satellites less than 100kg. The performance target is a thruster whose efficiency is ~50%, some 6 times that possible with typical current PPT designs, but comparable to conventional EP such as GIE and HET. The ECEPS can be designed to operate over a broad range of Isp from ~1000s to ~4000s; herein and consistent with resources of micro-satellites we will demonstrate an Isp of 2500s. ECEPS thrust scales with thrust head active area, anticipated to be ~0.2mN/cm2. This new electric propulsion system will have low volume and low power demands and is ideally suited to micro satellite constraints.

The project is restricted to two years, so there will be a limit to the amount of new research possible.  Therefore an essential part of the project will be to engage a forum of experts to redefine the current knowledge on normal tissue damage following radiotherapy, identify gaps in the knowledge and make recommendations for future research, data collection, and technological developments.  The final report will consist of a series of focused documents directed to clinicians (for the application of normal tissue risks in treatment optimisation), equipment manufacturers (recommendations on safety design), and the research community (summary of knowledge and recommendations on data collection and project proposals).", 56907.0, 3416402.0, 8, 13, "ALLEGRO", "http://www.allegroproject.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2011-04/45872.jpg", "fp7_89383_997919026"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["RWH", "Lister Hospital", "nhs_RWH01"]]}}, "4QR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1609372800000, "High Precision Process Chains for the Mass Production of Functional Struc-tured Surfaces", "Contour Fine Tooling Limited", "The ProSurf project aims to enhance the surface functionalities of six demonstrator parts by using a wide range of high precision manufacturing technologies, such as diamond machining techniques, enabling the mass production of cost effective, structured parts with accurate replication technolo-gies, like micro injection moulding. By implementing these technologies to manufacture a variety of benefiting functionalities, it is critical to assess the parts quality in a safe and fast manner. Therefore, the ProSurf project incorporates the development of robust in-process metrology as well as the derivation of the surfaces\u2019 functions to three dimensional parameters for a fast measurement of functional relevant surface characteristics and specific function testing of the produced demonstrators. Due to the spectrum of surface functionalities linked to the part demonstrators and their varied application fields that range from optical to medical, ProSurf makes possible to reach a high impact on several areas of the society by, e.g. increasing the safety of medical procedures and the performance of moulds for ceramic injection moulding as well as cleaning rolls for electronic parts.", 107003.0, 4547812.0, 7, 14, "ProSurf", null, null, null, "h2020_212863_951928901"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "CONTOUR FINE TOOLING LIMITED", 97683.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_9048"], [2017, "CONTOUR FINE TOOLING LIMITED", 9308.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_32008"]]}}}}
