The 1 plus 2 approach that has been elicited by the Scottish government has given rise to a need to train staff to ensure that they are confident in delivering high quality teaching and learning experiences in modern languages to all stages in the school. \r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThe project involves participating in immersion courses in France and Spain. These courses will be taught in French and Spanish, which will help to build the teachers' skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening at their own level as adults. \r\n\r\nParticipant:\r\n\r\nMr Brown currently teaching in the upper school and has experience in all areas within the primary school. He is an enthusiastic teacher who aims to provide the best for the children in his care. Mr Brown aims to work alongside the teachers in the school to embed French in a more immersive way that allows the children to encounter the language throughout the school day and through each stage within the school. \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\n\r\nThe course will involve an element of comparison of educational systems, it will introduce a range of new teaching resources, promote the sharing of good practice in the teaching of modern languages, and provide experiences of cultural activities in the host country (such as historical tours). Through participation in the course, the teachers and school will gain access to a European e-platform through which links can be made with other schools both for e-twinning and to share good practice and seek advice and support through an expanding network of practitioners. \r\n\r\nMethodology to Be Used In Carrying Out The Project:\r\n\r\nThe course will be taught entirely in the language of the host country. The focus will be on group discussion and sharing of good practice as well as smaller group interactive activities to allow the teachers to experience using the new resources which they will then take back to the school. Visits to local schools as well as cultural visits have been planned to allow the staff to take their learning forward in a real context. \r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nThe overarching aims of the project are to firstly develop the attending member of staff and build on his confidence in the teaching of modern languages. This will the enable him to bring about positive change to the implementation of the current modern languages programme within the school and through working with colleagues within the cluster (both primary and secondary) develop and continue to improve the learning experiences the children are involved in.  As a school we also aim to promote the benefits of knowing another language and the uses that such skills can have throughout children and young peoples lives. This will be promoted through the school and within the local community and hopeful involve parents in the celebration of these skills the children are acquiring. ICT, social media, Glow and the local press will be used to continually share and evaluate learning experiences and new ideas which will lead to benefits at a national level. The e-twinning and cross cultural links made will mean that benefits are reaped in schools throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nPotential Long Term Benefits:\r\n\r\nIf we can enthuse the children from a young age and make the learning experiences enjoyable, memorable and meaningful then hopefully they will be encouraged to carry on the learning process through their school career.  This in turn could help develop a passion for languages that can benefit them in different avenues of their lives. Opening the children's eyes to the opportunities outwith the UK we can promote the real-life benefits of participating fully in the modern languages programme.  These improved skills will hopefully entice more families to visit other European countries, increasing tourism and economic growth.", "http://www.blacklands.northayrshireschools.co.uk", "Blacklands Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002019_coordinator"]]}}, "7GW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Primary French/ Spanish Immersion Course", "Corsehill Primary School", 1649.0, 1, 1, "Context/ Background of Project:\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for the project came from the school and local authority's desire to improve and modernise the teaching and learning of modern languages in primary schools.

These courses will be taught in French and Spanish, which will help to build the teachers' skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening at their own level as adults. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of Participants: \r\n\r\nThere are two participants in this Project (Mr Kirk and Miss Frew). Both are currently teaching at the middle stages in the school but have experience of teaching at all stages in the primary school and are keen to teach foreign languages across the school. Mr Kirk intends to attend a course in France during the summer of 2014. Miss Frew intends to attend a course in Spain during the summer of 2014 and another in France at Easter 2015. Both participants have sufficient language skills in the targeted languages to cope with the demands of the course, but would benefit from furthering these skills and building their confidence. \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\n\r\nThe courses will involve comparisons of educational systems, the introduction of new teaching resources, sharing good practice in the teaching of modern languages, and experiencing cultural activities in the host country (such as historical tours).

As a direct result of the project, the staff will be able to use more modern teaching methods and resources and train others to do so. This will lead to improved attainment in and motivation for modern languages amongst learners. Through activities for parents and the community, as well as a shift in the schools culture to further embrace modern languages, motivation to learn new languages and experience European culture will be spread to the wider community. ICT, social media, Glow and the local press will be used to continually share and evaluate learning experiences and new ideas which will lead to benefits at a national level. The e-twinning and cross cultural links made will mean that benefits are reaped in schools throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nPotential Longer Term Benefits: \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that as more children are experiencing (and developing a love for) modern languages from a younger age, children's capabilities in modern languages will be much stronger by the end of their primary education. This in turn will lead to the children having increased access to educational and employment opportunities across the European Union and wider world.
