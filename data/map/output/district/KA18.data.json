This course will focus on the development of Learning & Teaching within MFL to improve learners' skills and competencies, Literacy Education, School Leadership and more. The course will provide  an opportunity to widen teaching practice while further developing language skills and intercultural understanding specifically when attending one of the immersion courses. The course  is offered as a complete package that includes instruction delivered by specialist trainers, single room occupancy accommodation, meals, transport/travel, a series of cultural visits and time in a local educational establishment where applicable, providing additional opportunities for partnership development.\r\nThis course will offer a member of staff the opportunity to further improve their learning and teaching methods and their knowledge of French.  It will allow the attendee to focus on their language skills as well as the opportunity to keep themselves up-to-date with current French culture.  The attendee will have the opportunity to discuss their practice with other practitioners from both foreign and UK establishments and it provides an excellent forum in which we can establish professional relationships and share resources. The attending member of staff will seek advice on the following areas: motivation of the learners, learning and teaching strategies for mixed-ability classes, primary to secondary transitional projects and the development of senior phase resources that we can use when teaching National 4, 5 and 6.  \r\nIn preparation for the course the member of staff will complete a self-evaluation to highlight areas of strength and to identify areas in need of development.  The member of staff will keep a record of their teaching practice both before and after the project to allow comparisons to be made.  The member of staff will also meet with the Principal Teacher of the department and a member of the senior management team to discuss the current improvement plan and to ensure that the aims and objectives are clear to the staff member.  \r\nAfter completion of the project the member of staff will offer whole-school CPD as well as departmental sessions to ensure that the information learned is shared with other practitioners.  The staff member will reflect on their practice and evaluate the success of the advice offered through gauging the success of the learners' progress.  It is intended that the staff member will work with the department to address the outlined areas for development and employ their newfound skills to help our department to reach its' aims.\r\nIn terms of long term benefits, it is hoped that relationships established on this project will provide opportunities to share resources with other establishments and provide a medium through which we can enter into professional dialogue with other practitioners of modern foreign languages.", "http://www.cumnock.e-ayr.sch.uk", "Cumnock Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000106_coordinator"]]}}, "3ND": {"life": {"data": [[2013, "LIFE hen harriers - Conserving the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland", "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1842941.0, 921470.0, "The hen harrier (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>) is a species of European conservation concern and is listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive. After several decades of recovery in the UK, the population is currently declining. While the reason for this is not fully understood, it is clear that illegal persecution associated with commercial shooting of red grouse (<i>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</i>) is a significant factor. The decline is particularly serious in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland, where the hen harrier is nearing extinction as a breeding species. Other factors that are likely to be impacting breeding success include inappropriate land management, human disturbance, and predation of eggs and young from nests. Recent analyses published by the UK government indicate that enough suitable habitat exists to support up to 2 650 pairs in the whole of the UK (compared to 630 pairs in 2010), suggesting that, in the long term, the potential for population growth in the absence of persecution is significant.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4935", "http://www.rspb.org.uk/henharrierlife/,", "life_142"]]}}}}
