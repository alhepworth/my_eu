SMEs employ approximately 55% of the EU workforce in transport, and their important role in the value chain is expected to increase and change, especially in the emerging Low Carbon Transport (particularly road and air transport) sector, where reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions and alternative power sources require innovation in a wide range of technology.\n\nThe rigid value chain of the transport sector is stifling the introduction of innovation by SMEs into new vehicles and transport-related products. SMEs (usually Tier 2 suppliers) find it difficult to interact with vehicle manufacturers, as they generally have short-term supply contracts to Tier 1 companies, who are strongly linked to specific large volume OEMs. Tier 2 SMEs have no collective voice or influence at European level and the EU is not taking advantage of or supporting directly the thriving innovative companies in this sector.\n\nINTRASME will address this market failure and focus on the opportunities that new markets offer to innovative and dynamic businesses. Responding to the call for proposals TPT.2012.3-2: \u2018Bringing innovative products and services to the market:  analysis of pathways and best conditions for innovation\u2019, INTRASME addresses the European manufacturing capability offered by SMEs of different EU Regions targeting the main goal of \u201chow to bring more efficiently and quicker innovative products and services to the market.\u201d The emerging Low Carbon Transport market will be used to examine barriers to innovation and to develop mechanisms to support the innovation potential of SMEs\n\nINTRASME brings together key European partners, in the areas of transport innovation.

The resultant microalgal biomass will form a carbon neutral, environmentally sustainable raw material that is a source for commercially valuable end products, among them renewable energy. The set task is to utilise unwanted effluents as nutrient sources for photosynthetic microalgae, thereby reducing effluent discharge by SMEs and yielding high quality biomass which will be harvested and upgraded using an integrated biorefinery approach into valuable products. Leading commercial systems for microalgae cultivation will be optimised for capturing inorganic nutrients from aqueous effluents (intensive agriculture and aquaculture; municipal anaerobic digesters) and CO2 from power plants, thereby mitigating the environmental impacts of these sectors and contributing to the European Low Carbon Economy via a new source of biomass-based biofuels, and by reducing the discharge of GHG to the atmosphere. Novel physical processes will be developed to efficiently harvest, stabilise and fractionate microalgae biomass for downstream conversion into valuable products. An innovative biorefinery approach will be adopted incorporating biomass pyrolysis (liquids, gas and char) for bioenergy and biofuel production, as well as separation into lipid, protein and carbohydrate fractions. Processes will be optimised for transforming micoalgal lipids into second generation transport fuels. Biomass extracts and purified compounds (eg, omega 3 fatty acids, pigments) will also be developed for use as food and feed additives.

Assessment WPs will inform action WPs that will: (1) redesign holistic farming systems to best reconcile the various demands concerning productivity, sustainability and societal values. (2) Identify industry solutions that aim to improve sustainability and productivity of sheep and goat systems through breeding, including new phenotypes linked to sustainable animal productivity. iSAGE, together with stakeholders and end-users, will draft a roadmap for further research and policy making.
