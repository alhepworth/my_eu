The reason that this existing WTDT is so widely employed is that it is cost-effective because it makes use of widely available industrial components and adopts a low-cost partially-rated converter. The proposed medium-speed WTDT leverages the advantages of the existing DFIG WTDT, but also improves upon the intrinsic reliability by adopting: a) Medium-speed Brushless DFIG, excluding brush-gear and slip-rings, known to be the highest failure rate components in the generator; b) Partially-rated converter, identical to the high-speed WTDT; c) 2-stage gearbox, excluding the third high-speed stage, known to be the highest failure rate section of the gearbox.

BACKGROUND: Cilia are microtubule-based, centriole-derived projections from the cell surface. They transduce extracellular signals and regulate key processes in which signals of the extracellular environment are translated into a cellular response, such as cell cycle control, Wnt signalling, Shh signalling and planar cell polarity. Disruption of cilium-based processes by mutations can cause very severe disorders. Many of these ciliopathies have overlapping phenotypes. There is evidence, that ciliary proteins are organized in cell/context specific complexes and/or in shared regulatory circuits in cilia of affected tissues. Yet, knowledge of the composition, wiring, dynamics and associated signaling pathways of the corresponding molecular building blocks and associated protein networks remains very limited. APPROACH: We propose here that ciliopathies can be considered systemically as specific perturbations in a versatile dynamically regulated multifunctional molecular machine. Mainly based on the comprehensive description of the ciliary interactome, quantitative functional assays as well as human genetic data derived from ciliopathy patients, we will generate a comprehensive stream of content-rich quantitative data towards systemic analysis of ciliar function. These data will be used to generate and validate discrete models that describe functional modules and regulatory circuits in the ciliome as well as predicting biological context specific features of cilia as well as perturbations leading to ciliopathies.

The underlying assumption is that DM leads to better quality of care, more health-conscious behavior, and improved disease prevention and control. In the short run, disease management would decrease costs by optimizing utilization of medical care. In the long run, DM lead to improved health status among patients with chronic conditions, thereby avoiding medical expenditures and improving workplace productivity.   Many health care systems in Europe and elsewhere are beginning to embrace DM programmes. Although the concept of disease management offers great promise, these programs\u2019 ability to reduce cost and improve care has not yet been empirically demonstrated; more and more policymakers are demanding objective assessments of a programme\u2019s impact. Part of the problem is that there are no universally accepted evaluation methods to measure and report programme performance in a scientifically sound fashion that is also practicable for routine operations.   This project seeks to bridge this gap.  It will provide an overview of approaches to chronic care and DM methods across Europe and test and validate possible evaluation approaches.

The project will be led by Balik Arts and organized by a consortium of partners from France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. \r\n\r\nActive citizenship is the glue that keeps society together, because if everyone merely focused on going to work, earning a living and promoting their own individual interests, society would fall apart.

These days, life is not easy for young people in many States in Europe, with the latest\r\nunemployment figures rising to over 20%. Through volunteering, as an important element of active citizenship, they can become involved within their society, make a constructive contribution, and at the same time acquire new skills and experiences that will make them more employable and be of long-lasting value to society. \r\n\r\nWe believe that youth organisations and youth work in general can and should address the above-mentioned issues and can encourage, educate, train and engage young people to take an active part in society. In order to achieve this, the training course will support the professional development of youth workers by empowering them with the competences to provide more qualified services to young people on a local, national or international level that aim to train young people about active citizenship and volunteering. We believe that Active Citizenship is one of the key factors for development of societies and volunteering is one of the best ways to make it real. We, Balik Arts, want to promote active citizenship and volunteering in our local community and impact positively on people\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\nOur target group is youth workers who are already working or have a strong motivation to work on active citizenship and volunteering topics.

In recent years, the global burden of dengue disease has been rising dramatically and this prolific increase has been connected to societal changes such as population growth, urbanization and the transport of infected hosts and vectors. In addition, rising temperatures and global climate change may lead to the expansion of the range of major mosquito vectors, extension of the transmission season in areas with currently circulating dengue virus and increase in the mosquito spp. vectorial capacity. Active surveillance to detect in-coming dengue virus (DENV) in regions at the limits of DENV circulation are an important initial step in the prevention of dengue epidemics in Europe. Asymptomatic infections likely play a crucial role in the initial invasion process and DENV transmission and, although hitherto ignored, must be addressed.\nUsing retrospective and prospective data from Asia, the main objectives of the program are (1) to identify key factors determining dengue transmission, outcome of infection and epidemics; (2) the development of novel diagnostic tools to detect asymptomatic infections.

Training will naturally encompass a wide range of skills, requiring a joint effort of chemists and biologists to introduce young researchers in a structured way to and array of research methodologies that no single research grouping could provide. The incorporation of early-stage and later stag ebiotechnology enterprises ensures that commercialisation of methodologies as well as the drug development process is covered in this ITN. We hope that MMBio will train scientists able to understand both the biological problem and the chemistry that holds the possible solution and develop original experimental approaches to stimulate European academic and commercial success in this area.", null, 3464270.0, 7, 18, "MMBio", null, "http://www.drop-tech.com", null, "h2020_205527_968526474"]]}}}}
