EOs are the main ingredient in some pest - control products and some over \u2013 the - counter medications. They\u2019re used in the food industry because of their preservative potency against food - borne pathogens thanks to their antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. Increasing consumer disposable incomes and rapid expansion of food & beverage industries are expected to contribute to the demand for natural fragrances & flavors produced using EOs. The added health benefits of EOs are expected to trigger their demand in pharmaceutical applications as well. Rising demand for aromatic cleaning agents and bio-based personal care products is expected to stimulate demand for home care and personal care products. The increased use of fragrances and flavors owing to the expansion of end-use industries in emerging markets. Most of the exotic EOs are produced from rare crops and plants which are either difficult to harvest or are a very species in nature. Restrictions on harvesting and cultivation of such trees & plants will probably add to the raw material scarcity. EOHUB will bring together technological companies, HEIs and research organizations in order to provide a training and support path for young scientists toward entrepreneurship, innovation and conservation in the field of EOs. It will merge scientific knowledge on EOs, practical examples and case studies of successful companies providing services within EOs, business models/case studies of business that trade and value natural products, connecting bio-applications of EOs, involving research centres and companies.

European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas.

First of all, our Bilingual Section demands teacher training aimed at improving its members' communicative competence in English, together with training on CLIL methodology, following the principles for foreign language teaching (MERC) set by the European Union, as well as training on the acadeemic use of ICT as key tools for teaching innovation and students' future employability. This demand includes teachers of both linguistic and non-linguistic subjects, for all of them are members of the above-mentioned Bilingual Section, despite the fact that this project's objectives are far-reaching and definitely meant to involve other teaching departments outside the Bilingual Section, having innovation of the whole School Educational Project as its ultimate aim.  \r\n \r\nBeing our secondary school located in such a rural context, the lack of institutions offering specific training is a fact, as our school is almost the only alternative for students and teachers requiring basic or further education. This so, the acquisition of new teaching tools and approaches is mandatory in order to extend bilingualism and reinforce the European dimension on both students and teachers in our school. Besides, communication with bigger cosmopolitan urban areas is expensive and scarce, so this project is also aimed at establishing partnership with other European countries and cultures, as a way to increase student motivation to speak foreign languages and learn in different contexts from their own.\r\n \r\nThence, an effective methodology for the coordination of both linguistic and non-linguistic subjects is required, always keeping their respective curricula in mind. Our main goal is to provide the same methodological guidelines not just to the Bilingual Section, but to all teaching departments by using an accurate communicative competence, an appropriate CLIL methodological basis and a variety of ICT resources as our core teaching instruments.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, eight participants were chosen to carry out eight different mobility activities, consisting of seven structured teacher-training courses together with one job-shadowing period, including training on CLIL methodology, the use of ICT in the classroom, the English language and its teaching, and several visits to different European schools. In spite of their varied profiles, all participants share a common wish for both professional and personal improvement throughout such activities, eager to setting all new competences in motion as soon as they return to their daily teaching routine in their specific subjects.\r\n \r\nConsequently, the effects of this project will be immediately felt, as well as in the medium and long term. The creation and execution of new innovative didactic units will be one of the main outcomes of this project, showing most new competences acquired by all participants and having a measurable effect on students. The enhancement of both teacher and student command of English along with the upgrade in their digital competence will be also two major results of this project, in addition to encouraging greater involvement in international teaching and learning actions among the whole school community. In this sense, our School Management Department will favour all activities proposed by this project from a flexible comprehensive point of view.\r\n \r\nAccordingly, all new experiences will be widely spread by means of several teacher meetings, informative articles appearing in school, local and regional issues, radio and television interviews, essays on various educational websites, seminars arranged by a number of teaching resource centres, among other activities previously stated.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, since our school is based in an exceptionally rural area with high unemployment rates and, thus, low purchasing power, a matter which is closely related to low education standards and limited access to learning opportunities for free general and bilingual education, the Erasmus+ programme emerges as a highly suitable response to the learning needs of our teachers, students and sociocultural environment.", "http://www.rgshw.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-014562_1"]]}}, "7NQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "In sight", "The Highcrest Academy", 104660.0, 3, 10, "This project supports equipping all young people with the knowledge and skills to think for themselves, challenge and debate ideologies in a safe environment.

The project brings together the relevant partner countries in the following way(i) It brings together regions who have unique characteristics but at the same time due to the rise in migration and new arrivals to our respective localities/ countries there are similarities which draw us together. (ii) World events have come together to impact on our respective countries in similar ways including a rise in discrimination especially against new migrants, the increasing influence of ideologies of the extremists including the Far Right and the Daesh are drawing a number of young people to extremist views . In the UK over 800 young people have travelled to Syria to fight with the Daesh. (iii) There is a desire from all the countries represented in this project to come together and share common issues affecting our young people.

Both Buckinghamshire Montpellier and Madrid  are very aware of the tensions rising across Europe based on differences between people.

Of late the work has also focused around the integration of newly arrived young refugees, and supporting the holiday, education and advisory, services locally.\r\nProvision has included activities during holidays such as games and matches, training and education fairs with local schools entitled JUBIZU. \r\nThe team at Kelkheim had already delivered youth work across borders in Europe, with young people having the opportunity to undertaking free educational breaks in France, Coatia, and Italy.

The resolution highlighted the present challenges faced by girls and recognized  that girls in many parts of the world are exploited and discriminated against on various levels and remain at a disadvantage. In this project we would like to draw your attention to the fact that not only girls, as is often assumed from Third World countries are affected, but also girls in Europe today. In our daily work with young women we have identified a high demand for empowerment measures, especially for girls, as hierarchical and classical role assignments influence their life enormously. This form of discrimination seems often promoted and strengthened in todays media landscape. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind and through multiple forms of consultation with young girls on both youth projects young women identified a wish to better understand their bodies and their identity. This need informed our decision making process for this project, and we were able to design a project which will empower young women to host their own conferences, learn about new cultures and build confidence through visit a new country, whilst also obtaining the YouthPass.\r\nWork delivered will center around the facilitation of workshops to allow young women to plan and deliver their own conference, one in each country for their peer groups and professionals with the aim of:\r\nOpen dialogue around the role of young women in modern Europe.\r\nDiscuss the identity of young women in Europe\r\nExchange their experiences of being young women in an ever changing Europe\r\nExplore the representation of young women and body image in the media. \r\n\r\nThe cohorts of girls selected from both organizations will be largely made up of young women who attend youth groups aimed at young girls who are struggling with their identity and image, and have been identified as vulnerable, either because they have been diagnosed with Autism, behavioral difficulties, or have faced particularly difficult life journeys. It is hoped the project will strengthen their self confidence and encourage them to develop a positive self image. \r\nMeasurable outcomes which the success of the project will be measured against will be:\r\nThe delivery of two conferences delivered by each group, one in Kelkheim and one in High Wycombe. \r\nGirls will complete evaluation forms, expressing their satisfaction with the journey.\r\nParticipants will have achieved the YouthPass Certification through the duration of the project. \r\n\r\nThe long term impact of this project will be in the confidence and achievement of the young women who take part in the workshops, conferences and youth exchange, their aspirations and an increase in positive self worth. As a direct result of taking part it is hoped, young women will be able to form positive cultural identities for themselves and each other. Better understanding diversity and celebrating the differences in todays Europe. Through the workshop discussions young women will be able to reconcile cultural expectations with a positive European identity, and in line with the LAG M\u00e4dchenpolitik Hessen hope to identify customized solutions for the development of identity of young women.", "http://www.wycombeyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015415_1"]]}}}}
