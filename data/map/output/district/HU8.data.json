Particular anxieties exist about the social disengagement of those with differing cultural, social and religious backgrounds and the difficulties in addressing this through education by traditional means. These concerns have been heightened by international terrorism and high-profile extremist events.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background young people from communities with different  religious or cultural identities can find it difficult to identify, engage with or be welcomed into an inclusive sense of citizenship in their host society and may not acquire a sense of inclusive citizenship which embraces Europe comfortably. The need for a contemporary and more inclusive conception of European citizenship and a wider participatory democracy has been increasingly noted both in EU policy and more widely.\r\n\r\nHowever the desire to develop a stronger, more cohesive sense of European and national citizenship by implementing Citizenship Education in schools has met with limited success. The intentions for citizenship education are sometimes contested and misunderstood, its delivery may make little reference to significant local and national issues and how politicians, the media and the wider society deal with these and in many schools, colleges and universities the general provision for citizenship education is inadequate. Teachers often find the topic problematic to teach, due to poor knowledge, inadequate training or resources and pedagogy that do not strongly engage young people. \r\n\r\nThere is growing recognition that European citizenship education needs to be more about engaging and empowering individuals and less about the study of academic content, citizenship duties, the institutions of government, or citizenship as social compliance and contribution. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to develop educational practices and innovative digital resources to allow young people in secondary, further and higher education to explore, develop and practice citizenship in a safe environment representing real-world contexts that deal with issues of direct relevance to them, their lives and their growth as European citizens in a pluralistic democracy. It will achieve this by using new and emerging digital technologies (including virtual reality) that are popular with and attractive to young people and motivate them to participate and therefore sustain their involvement. Research has shown that the imaginative use of ICT can, if used  appropriately, change long-held and culturally deep-rooted views and that the use of immersive virtual environments is effective in developing self-perception and a renewed sense of identity.\r\n\r\nExperts in citizenship, digital technology and educational pedagogy from nine educational institutions including primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities and organisations involved in training and teacher education from across Europe work together in this project, together with their students, to create a toolkit of innovative digital resources and a library of guidelines, manuals and training packages for educators. These will provide teachers, lecturers and trainers with the skills and resources to better engage their students to develop a stronger sense of European citizenship and understand and embrace the shared values underpinning modern democratic societies.\r\n\r\nThe resources will also include scenarios, responses and reflections on these by young people and because of their authenticity these will enhance their impact on citizenship education and create high credibility for the project outcomes. The resources will be extensively tested and widely distributed and enable educators to acquire the necessary skills to develop further resources using the training and guidelines the project will provide.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be to enhance the skills, knowledge and resources of educators to help them teach European citizenship in a more effective and engaging way that will motivate and inspire them and their students to create a deeper sense of European citizenship that identifies and embraces common democratic values to promote social inclusion and harmony. The project will also increase the acquisition of the digital skills, literacies and competencies of educators and students that are essential for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of the project will be to: identify what motivates young people and individuals with differing cultural, religious, political and social backgrounds and heritages to engage with citizenship education; promote greater engagement with public and political life; encourage informed debate to facilitate a deeper understanding of the concerns and values of other social, cultural and ethic groups; promote greater social inclusion, harmony and individual well being; and enhance the digital skills and competencies of citizens.", "http://www.wilberforce.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036710_9"]]}}}}
