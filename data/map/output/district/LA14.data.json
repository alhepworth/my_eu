As European citizens and local authorities often lack time, financial means and technical expertise to initiate the necessary energy renovations of their houses and public buildings, the potential for energy efficiency projects remains largely untapped. RESCOOP MECISE will develop an integrated and innovative approach that gives answer to this impeding challenge. By integrating both renewable energy and energy efficiency projects into one innovative investment scheme RESCOOP MECISE will elaborate a completely new financing format. The financing scheme will make European citizens, REScoops, local authorities, the European Investment Bank and other related investment funds partners into the transition towards a more sustainable society. Moreover RESCOOP MECISE will encourage citizens and local authorities to initiate deep energy renovation projects by providing them with personal assistance and technical expertise that now remains with the REScoops. The RESCOOP MECISE project will also provide a clear cut solution for the financing problem that REScoops face when they want to start up with their first project. By means of setting up a European fund for both renewable energy and energy efficiency projects or through the development of a financial facilitation service for REScoops the REScoop MECISE project will enhance the potential for more successful energy efficiency projects throughout Europe.", 232304.0, 1804745.0, 4, 6, "RESCOOP MECISE", null, null, null, "h2020_194616_939065149"]]}}, "4LF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTX", "Furness General Hospital", "nhs_RTXBU"]]}}, "4RF": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "YARL HYDRACENTRE LIMITED", 563.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_68799"]]}}, "5TS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Bildungs- und Erziehungskompetenz in Europa", "Hindpool Nursery School", 7921.0, 4, 6, "Growing requirements on the mobility and flexibility of professional beginners on the international labor market, on her didactic, methodical qualification as well as technical and personal competence are accompanied by the demand for comparability of the education contents as well as measurability of her quality. Besides these requirements, the strengthening of the social cohesion as well as the promotion of the intercultural dialog also stand for the professional first education in education measures of BAWI GmbH as sending facility in the center. The young people in this vocational training are trained in a specific job outline which increasingly orientates itself at the international (European) thought and at international standards, not least initiated by debates held transnationally around the topic of academicism of educational professions. How already described in section F.3, the responsible office of the Berlin Senate Administration for Education, Science and Research allows a foreign traineeship for students in the framework of their vocational education; but such an activity, however, isn't an obligatory component of the teaching curriculum for educating professions. Approvals are assigned only in exceptions and formally dealt with as such. Moreover, high administrative editions aggravate an unbureaucratic carrying out of such foreign projects. At present, there is a lack in perceptions of authority concerning the fact, that such projects represent a personal added value of social and fold competences internationally usable for prospective educators, which therefore can increase their career opportunities. \r\nWith the aid of this project, BAWI GmbH would like to give 8 trainees (who have been selected for this project about internal, technical, motivational and social criteria), aged between 19-24 years (of which three are Turkish, one Russian and one U.S. origin), the possibility,\r\n- > to obtain practical experiences in foreign social educational facilities as well as in the contact to people from other\r\n      cultural areas, to develop own social, emotional and personal competences\r\n-> to enlarge their foreign linguistic proficiencies\r\n-> to compare theoretical knowledge of their own with the professional abilities and skills of academic specialist staff\r\n-> in addition to acquire specific pedagogical-methodical knowledge as well as knowledge about politico-educational structures in \r\n     the educational system of the host country, aiming the adaption of this knowledge later in their own professional practice in a  \r\n     creative and innovative manner, e. g. conceptionally with integrated education offers for small children and teenagers with \r\n     impairments to avoid their educational discrimination \r\n\r\nAs already represented detailed in sections F. 2 and G. (main activities), this long-term internship is jointly to be prepared and to be carried out between BAWI GmbH an the project partners in compliance with a training program to be developed especially for this project, in which the project aims, educational formulations as well as the rights and duties of all involved partners are regulated. BAWI GmbH assumes the project management. The monitoring process, also described in detail in section G., contains all types of the systematic recording, observation or supervision of the project course. In order to optimize the communication between the facilities and persons involved, all technical means available are going to be used.\r\n\r\nFinally it is to notice, that one of the main project objectives is the effort to adapt the vocational education to the globalization process, i. e. to internationalize it, but to keep its structurally and conceptionally strong \"character\" and role as it plays in the German educational system. A third dimension arises practically out of this project, the education spreads out on three studying places: School, social educational facilities in the sending country and (now) foreign countries. \r\nIn the context of the project particularly \r\n- the social competence with regard to the intercultural orientation \r\n- the methodical competence with regard to the application of international education conceptions \r\n- the linguistic competence with regard to the enhancement of decision-making and responsibility\r\nare promoted. In the framework of the vocational education for state recognized educating professions (i.e. nursery) in Germany,  a narrow dovetailing of theory and practice is cared for; therefore, this didactical focusing represents the basis for the knowledge impartment  of educational contents, which are oriented at the social life reality of children and teenagers.", "http://www.hindpoolnurseryschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000682_2"]]}}}}
