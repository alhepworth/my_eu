Yet at these festivals, diesel generators are still the most employed source to provide electricity due to a large amount of power needed. Using diesel to generate electricity has big disadvantages: substantial CO2 emissions, noise annoyance of droning generators, and bad smell. With the latest developments in renewable energy, for instance vertical axis wind turbines, more efficient solar panels, improved batteries, now allow for an efficient and economically attractive approach to produce large amounts of power from sustainable resources only.\nPowerVIBES aims to reduce festivals\u2019 carbon footprint by 20% by making diesel generators superfluous. Instead, affordable and reliable energy is produced from renewable resources wind, biomass, and solar power. To illustrate, if the Netherlands\u2019 summer festivals cut their diesel consumption by 10%, over 1.000.000 litres of diesel and over 3,000 tonnes of CO2 is saved annually.\nThis project combines a vertical axis wind turbine, PV panels, and a battery, all customized in a containerized unit and with a bio-fuel generator as backup. All are connected in a smart grid. Two of such transportable units (with smart grid) will be built and tested on in total 16 festival sites. This extensive testing regime is essential as of large differences among festivals, as they operate under significantly different legal, technical, seasonal, locational, and environmental conditions. This process of reflection and feedback (with a loop of testing-analysing-adjusting-implementing after each test) leads to a (practically) universally applicable system, to be used in all countries of the NWE region.\nThis energy production is completely clean. Therefore, the unit can be clearly visible on a festival site to reach an audience of millions that experiences this sustainable energy concept.", 1483228800000, 1609372800000, 144126.0, "nweurope_39_5"]]}}, "9QZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1317427200000, 1412035200000, "Uptake of Climate related Research Results through Knowledge Platforms with African Collaboration Partners", "Practical Action", "The main aim of the AfriCAN Climate project is the development, operation and promotion of a web-based Knowledge Platform for efficient dissemination of climate change research results and good practices, to encourage users for uptake of success stories and research knowledge in new projects. Thereby, the project will contribute to mitigate climate change impacts on African regions and help communities to adapt to the changing climatic conditions.\nEmphasis will be placed on a variety of innovative and creative web functionalities (\u201ce-tools\u201d) when developing the interactive, multimedia, pan-continental, multi-lingual and interdisciplinary AfriCAN Climate Platform. The new platform visitors, the already registered users and the members of the online communities will be facilitated by the editorial team to actively participate in knowledge exchange and uptake of research results. The high profile consortium includes a large variety of experienced EU and African organizations, corresponding to the diversity of target audience addressed by the call. The experts in the consortium achieve full thematic, linguistic and geographical coverage to serve the African continent\u2019s climate change knowledge needs. They will jointly build and continuously update a knowledgebase to feed the platform. Country fact sheets on climate change impacts will be developed for all 54 African countries.\nStrategic networking meetings with information multipliers and FP7 National Contact Points will be held on a regular base to encourage them to become active on the Platform by building climate change interest communities, or joining existing communities.

INSARD partners regard agricultural research and development (ARD) as a process of innovation involving different participants making complementary inputs to produce research results that contribute to development. In this process, farmers do not merely receive new knowledge from research; they are involved in generating it. Smallholders and NGOs are already doing applied and adaptive research to answer questions to which formal research is not giving enough attention, e.g. how to improve local marketing systems. In bridging the gap and bringing smallholders and researchers into joint research on questions central to smallholders\u2019 concerns, civil-society organisations (CSOs) in the South and the North can play a vital role.\nThe main aim of INSARD is to ensure the informed participation of a broad range of European and African CSOs in formulating and implementing ARD. It will do so by:\n1) Designing a structure for coordination and communication between European and African CSOs involved in ARD and in influencing ARD policy and practice\n2) Identifying CSOs\u2019 research priorities and a strategy to communicate these to other actors in ARD\n3) Facilitating joint definition of specific research examples by CSOs and researchers, based on the smallholders\u2019 priorities\n4) Engaging in policy dialogue with key African and European research organisations and donors.\nThe project will build up a more transparent system for CSOs to provide well-founded inputs and positions in the ARD agenda and its implementation, so that smallholders are central to publicly funded ARD.

The issue originates in schools when many girls make critical subject choices that will effectively lock them out from STEM in higher education and employment. This is coupled with the pervasive cultural stereotype of the male scientist or engineer and entrenched parochial attitudes. The gender in-balance in STEM subjects and in employment statistics are transnational concerns which extend to most EU countries, yet these themes do not feature prominently in teacher training while initiatives and resources launched by subject associations, education providers and others often tend to feature a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach.This project aims to increase the employment potential of all young Europeans, but especially girls, by improving their interest and engagement in STEM subjects through linking these to a wider awareness of global issues. Our partnership organisations have evidence through their existing work that bringing together STEM and global education often with an additional local dimension results in added motivation for girls and a sustained interest in these key subjects.  By working initially with carefully selected pilot schools we will avoid the shortcomings of the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach. In addition, practical solutions to some of global challenges and problems on which the target groups will work are best developed internationally if they are to have wider credibility. The project will facilitate much of this work through the development of digital skills and especially through the collaborative authoring of eBooks. This aspect capitalises on existing partner expertise. It enables dissemination to new and developing networks exploring this pedagogy, but most importantly brings with it an inclusive element as young people incorporate their virtually ubiquitous access to mobile technologies into their learning. Our partnership of nine institutions brings together NGOs, universities and secondary schools. Each will contribute their experience of international partnerships, global education, previous STEM activities and cutting edge research into mobile learning to the project, but they also have in common their capacity to innovate and to work collaboratively. Although the partnership has been specially created for this project all the partners have previously worked with at least one other member of the team. The planned activities will initially focus on the work of the universities, NGOs and pilot schools to develop and test a series of bespoke Global STEM Challenges aimed at engaging all pupils, but especially girls, in creating practical solutions to real world global issues. With support from their national partner organisation schools will collect, adapt and produce materials which they feel will support other pupils to take part in a focused STEM challenge. They will trial these with younger (or other) pupils in their own school and in their partner school. A further part of the brief will be for pupils to interview female researchers working on global issues in different countries and to incorporate these video clips in their materials.  These outputs will form the nucleus of an online Teacher Toolkit. The pilot schools will also start the process of constructing and testing in-service and pre-service training materials that would help to convince teachers and teacher trainers to adopt these methodologies. The training activities will populate an online Teacher Education Programme to be demonstrated to early adopters through a series of local dissemination sessions and Multiplier Events. All of these activities will be rigorously benchmarked, monitored and evaluated, including pupil evaluations, so providing the partnership with credible data and enabling them to work together on a series of academic papers and presentations, an essential part of the dissemination process.  Throughout these activities we will employ a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach with carefully planned involvement of the pilot schools and their staff and pupils. For this reason pupils play a key role at the end of Year 1 in a Joint Pupil Mobility and staff at the end of Year 2 in a Learning Teaching and Training Activity.We envisage significant impact at local, regional, national and international levels. Our project partners, including pilot schools, have committed to incorporating project methodologies and outputs into their existing networks. These not only reach teachers and global educators but also influence policy makers and groups set up specifically to combat gender inequality in STEM.
