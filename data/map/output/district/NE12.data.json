Working in and across higher education, public school and third sectors, we offer a response which engages with the very heart of the learning process as experienced by young people across local, national and European levels. Young people\u2019s engagement with what they are learning is a  central aspect of how they are learning. The quality and relevance of skills and competences of young people who leave school is another urgent matter being addressed at European and national levels. This challenge has been met with an opportunity to \u2018rethink education\u2019 with a focus on \u2018stimulating open and flexible learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nWe propose that a lack of active involvement in one's own learning is a key component in the high percentage of young people who do not go beyond lower secondary education in Europe. Our solution is long-term investment in the principles of self-organised learning (SOL). SOL is a learner-centred approach in which the role of teacher is as facilitator rather than as transmitter of knowledge and learning content. SOL supports a learner-driven identification and reflection on what is, could and should be learned and how. Learning to learn through SOL is an essential component in how it can specifically promote learner autonomy, engagement and a disposition towards lifelong and lifewide learning. We therefore propose that a change in balance of control between teachers and students can promote engagement and reduce disengagement as a preventative measure towards tackling ESL, with a particular focus on basic and transversal skills.\r\n\r\nOur main project aim is to improve school education (students aged 13-18) in tackling ESL through the development of innovative forms of SOL as preventative and intervention measures. We join experience and capabilities to the delivery of the shared objectives of the project work at local, national and European levels. In doing so, we will straddle the spectrum of formal, in- and non-formal learning situations in a number of basic (maths, reading, science) and transversal skill areas (foreign language skills, digital skills, entrepreneurship, social and civic skills).\r\n\r\nThe project is built around the shared objective to develop, test and implement four sustainable and alternative SOL spaces across Europe. The idea of a space originates from the notion that one cannot design for self-organised learning itself but create an environment for the learning to take place.  In creating these spaces, we also intend to produce a number of transferable outputs which can be used by those working in school education, including young people. These interactive materials include:  a sustainable digital platform for the authoring of learning content in the area of basic and transversal skills; a handbook for facilitators of the SOL spaces in different languages; a guide on methods for student self-reflection and evaluation; links to accreditation for stakeholders creating the SOL spaces; and a guide on learning for change which others can use to implement change in their own settings. We also intend to underpin our activities with a strong research base, providing practice-based evidence about how the different SOL spaces foster engagement 'in action' and impact on engagement. Together, these results are designed to increase pupil engagement in learning basic and transversal skills and capacity for incorporation of new and alternative forms of learning like SOL into the school education context to tackle ESL.\r\n\r\nThe existing adoption of SOL principles across our different sectors coupled with its potential for adaptation provides fertile ground for knowledge exchange relevant at local, national, regional and European levels. Our project involves partners from three universities Newcastle University (coordinator, UK), Lahti University of Applied Sciences who will work with the Rudolf Steiner School Lahti (Finland), two NGO's - Toekomstonderwijs learning centre (Belgium) and Success4All cic (UK), Trinity College Dublin who will work with Irish schools (Ireland) and a public school- George Stephenson High School (UK). We will work together using a networked approach to design, trial and evaluate the SOL spaces as well as participate in transnational meetings and teaching and learning activities to share experience and expertise to benefit the holistic needs of the school education field. We will each play a part in developing a particular cluster based around key themes we think are relevant to knowledge building around tackling ESL. \r\n\r\nBy spreading our results and supporting the school education sector to enhance and transform the learning of basic and transversal skills through SOL, we intend to have an impact on national and European policy.", "http://www.gshs.org.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013439_1"]]}}, "6TS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE", "Grasmere Academy", 110657.0, 7, 8, "With I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE we want to promote Early Guidance as a useful tool for the achievement of the Europe 2020 target to reduce the rate of ESL and to improve the attainment of young people. It is important to help  children to look inside and around themselves, to imagine their future through this double perspective, by beginning to know the labour marked and educational opportunities, becoming aware that the learning process is a lifelong process and that school is a part of it.\r\nAIM OF TH PROJECT: to find and experiment teaching paths that allow students, from nursery onwards, to think about their identity in order to strengthen their capacity to make conscious  choices, to take into consideration the continually widening territorial, social and cultural environment and to understand the value of completing an education or training programme. \r\nTHE OBJECTIVES of   I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE are:\r\nAugmented consciousness and competence, in teachers, related to educational guidance and guidance-oriented teaching.\r\nIdentified and developed strategies and methods to help :\r\nAll students creating connections with the world of work and with the upper secondary schools/vocational schools of the school area.\r\nTeachers to promote inclusive teaching/learning approaches for all students.\r\nTeachers to identify and develop strategies to fight gender stereotypes in teaching, learning and in professional choices.\r\nWe will address STUDENTS  by analyzing three main areas:\r\nIDENTITY AND PERSONAL CHOICES \r\nThrough teaching paths students can learn:\r\nTo think about themselves, their potential and their abilities.\r\nBecome responsible and aware of the consequences of their actions.\r\nTake responsibility and take on tasks to make our societies work efficiently.\r\nLABOUR MARKET\r\nThrough the knowledge of  local and European areas and world of work opportunities:\r\nStudents can understand how to use their own competences.\r\nTeachers can be more conscious of the world of work needs in order to help students build life skills. \r\nEDUCATIONAL TRAINING \r\nThrough the knowledge of some jobs: \r\nStudents will learn to plan educational paths that allow them to achieve their own ambitions.\r\nWe will do this in cooperation with other different agencies and specialists at local level in order to enable the adoption of a 'whole child'approach' to Early School Leaving. \r\nThe target age of the project is: 5-12\r\nAll partners are schools: some of them have already collaborated in previous Comenius partnerships with Maniago ( Turkey, Latvia, Finland, Romania UK-England) two are new entries but they have a previous experiences in Comenius Projects \r\nSome of our partner schools are already providing career guidance pathways to their students, other are focusing on self-esteem and consciousness building activities, other have not yet introduced to these experiences: trough international cooperation, sharing our good practices and building guidance pathways we want to foster all schools, together with the territorial agencies, to deepen their knowledge about early guidance and its educational value, providing teachers with a tested, structured and shared equipment of tools and resources.\r\nThe main activities of the project are: \r\nPreparatory activities , transnational project meetings and on line meetings, short-term exchanges of groups of pupils and short-term joint staff training events. During the last meeting in Italy it will be organized a dissemination seminar supported by our Region (Guidance Department) \r\nThe school activities will be developed into the following main areas:\r\n IDENTITY AND PERSONAL CHOICES consisting of self-knowledge, self-analysis and self-awareness and discovering interests and aspirations and developing initiatives \r\nKNOWLEDGE OF THE LABOUR MARKET AND JOBS discovering past and present jobs in specific geographical and social contexts.\r\n KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATIONAL TRAINING discovering the value of educational training in order to get the job they want. In this way students learn the importance of a proper education process which in turn helps against early school leaving.\r\nTo implement the activities these methodologies will be used : cooperative learning, peer tutoring, lab teaching role playing and team work, see fit to develop key competences of lifelong learning  too. \r\nICTs have an important role in the development of this project. \r\nWith I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE  we aim to put in motion a concrete process to help preventing  early school leaving.

The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety. Thus the more analyte present, the more binding of secondary antibody occurs and the more signal is produced.", 93490.0, 3779421.0, 6, 11, "SALIANT", "http://www.saliant.eu/home", "http://www.celsgroup.com/home.html", null, "fp7_95761_995224075"], [1317427200000, 1427760000000, "HIgh Speed PRoteomics Analysis (Prot-HiSPRA): Solving the bottlenecks of proteomics technologies for time sensitive proteome driven medical decisions", "Centre of Excellence for Life Sciences Ltd", "The main objective of the proposed collaborative project Prot-HiSPRA is to remove time-consuming bottlenecks of existing proteomics technologies (sample preparation, fractionation, proteolysis, separation, data collection, and data mining) and bring the proteome driven analysis into time sensitive clinical practice.
