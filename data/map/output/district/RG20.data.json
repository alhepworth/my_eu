Also a comparative study of preschool activities shows that young children get involved in activities like constructing games, playing with toys, reading books, playing in the sandpit, using playground equipment, language, communication, art/creativity, health and physics whereas themes such as ethical and social issues seem to be neglected.This project is developed by UK, IT, LT, EE, TR with the aim of introducing moral values and ethics into pre-school education. The theme is decided by negotiation of all partners during preparation process. The tasks have been equally shared between all the partners. The project intends to increase the quality of kindergarten education and care services and it also aims to make it more accessible. Several preschool curricula will be analyzed and we will also make a theoretical study of ethical issues that should be forwarded to preschool children. Under the terms of the project, we will conduct a research of moral values of preschool children and a research among teachers and parents about the ways in which they try to acquaint children with ethical values. The project will provide more enjoyable education and training programs for kindergarten teachers and it will also address the individual needs of parents for ethical education of their children. Since all the partners invest in innovation and stated their school as applying an innovative strategy, there are different good practices at every institutions. The project will help to integrate those good practices and methods from each other in the daily activities of kindergarten curricula by teachers, so we will provide a strategic professional development for staff in line with individual needs and organisational objectives.Our themes are moral values, celebrations and culture of European countries. Connecting all of them, we will address the importance of tolerance and equality among friends in our kindergartens. The project will also promote team work, growth of children's imagination and healthiness (making up their own disciplines on internal Olympic Games, organizing their own kindergartens' special days, taking part in the project's international celebration days, eating habits, healthy meals for kids etc.), their socialization with each other and quality of time spent with their families.OBJECTIVES-To plan and conduct the activities in the field of social and emotional child development as a part of kindergarten practical curriculum. -to make a theoretical study of ethical issues that should be forwarded to preschool children-to conduct a research among teachers and parents about the ways in which they try to acquaint children with fundamental principles of ethics like fairness, honesty, empathy, truthfulness, responsibility, gratitude, patience etcThis project does not contain pupils\u2019 mobilities.

There will be pre-school teachers, a teacher of English,a Physicological Counselor, an ICT teacher from the neighbourhood will also be involved in the project. Approximately 250 teachers/adults will be indirectly affected.Administrative staff: The head teachers and a deputy heads will take part in the project, on average 15 administrative staff will be affected.Families: The number of the family members will be 100 in total and they will contribute to introduce the host country\u2019s culture, tradition and to prepare traditional food for an international evening. Approximately 2000 family members will be partly affected.Local community: Local community like local press, municipality, directorate of national education and PTA will help to disseminate the project to a wider community.
