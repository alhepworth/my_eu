A continent once marked by war, and the centennial remembrance of the Great War, has been transformed to a continent of peace. In this time of peace it is however essential, that we focus on educating future generations of Europeans to strengthen their understanding and tolerance of each other.\r\n\r\n\"A Peace of Europe\" is a cross curricular, developing project , where six countries; Denmark, Wales, France, Cyprus, Spain and Ireland via professional learning communities want to set up a radical, creative learning initiative for students to raise awareness of Peace in our time, to reflect and remember the conflict in Europe and celebrate the success of the Union in making the community a more peaceful and integrated society. \r\nThe peace project will develop learners literacy, communication and ICT skills through an authentic and motivating education and at the same time raise the awareness of the lives, cultures and history of our neighbours in Europe and the importance of friendships and peaceful solutions in a globalized world. It is important not to forget about one's own cultural heritage as well as to gain knowledge about other's history and cultural values. By focusing on an ever important topic which has influenced our history, identities and defined our culture both in the past, present and also in the future, we wish to bring our students together in a collaborative unit, where they will learn about themselves, their European friends and at the same time strengthen their academic skills in a coherens of authentic and motivating education. Within the theme of the project, all participating schools wish to raise the literacy, communication and ICT skill levels of all pupils.\r\n\r\nDuring the project period of three years, the theme Peace will be emphazised in four levels:\r\n=>=Peace of mind : individual perspective. Perception of peace within our communities : how to deal with stress and conflict on a daily basis. Collaborative collages and posters will be made.\r\n=>Story of peace : historical perspective : a wider scope of peace through our own country's history and the UE history. Timelines, stop motion films, Nobel prize winners' biographies, treasure hunts.\r\n=>Peace in our time : global perspectives. To help learners realise that the European Union is part of a global issue and that countries within the community are active within the United Nations as well as involved in areas of conflict.\r\n=>Peace forever. Within the European community we will listen to the Young ambassadors of tomorrow on how peace can develop within their own country, Europe and therefore globally, by using the model of the United Nations model.\r\n\r\nWe will work with various activites during the project period like;  diaries, jigsaw cubes-literacy, logo designs, Prezi workshops, peace quotations, Google Hangout sessions, angry boxes, wordle posters, time lines, ICT communication, stop motion films, historical research, children' s rights, design a peace charter and dream boxes-peace in the future.  All activities are easy to integrate into the school's curriculums and they all lead on to further detailed learning sessions on all schools in order to gain knowledge and understanding of each other.  All activities  cover multiple intelligences and lead the students towards the development of skills which are essential for learning autonomy. This project will become a living, developing theme within all schools visualized by a great amount of dissemination strategies on behalf of the creative processes within the project such as; installation arts, a project logo, posters, timelines and musical activities.\r\n\r\nThere will be ongoing  evaluation of the impact of the Partnership at school level by each of the partners. Evidence in the form of children\u2019s class work, plans, school website, schools database on skills, and school notice boards and display boards will be shared at the online partnership meetings each term and the partner meetings. The success and evaluation of the project will be assessed by pupils progress and the teachers will develop their professional skills collaborating with different teaching strategies.\r\n\r\nLast but not least , as citizens of the European Union, pupils, teachers, parents and other associated at the schools will find out, through project work, what being a part of a large European family means, and their multicultural understanding will be intensified. Schools will gain prestige and will be an educational institution which introduces its pupils to the European forum. The final results will enable to promote the school on a local stage and an European/world one and the communities of the partner schools will gain a great insight in each other's cultures and develop long lasting connections for a future with friendships in peaceful environments.", "http://ygaberaeron.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA201-000645_3"]]}}}}
