Project goals will comply with the Horizon 2020 targets to ensure that skills and qualifications can be more easily recognized, within and across national borders, as the project will focus on one specific sector on the European market, the explosives sector. The restructuring of the industry, in general, have led to many changes, such as lower job growth and skills drain due to workers retirement.  It has brought specific changes to the explosives sector related to education and training, where most training previously was organized as in-house training, now it is mainly provided by external education and training institutions. These providers need incentives to adapt their supply to better match industry demands, by the means of collaboration around education and training with industry partners. The project aims therefore to develop support structures dedicated for education and training initiatives targeted for the industry.  The target is twofold, 1. Implement selected key-roles from the occupational standards, specifically developed for the explosives sector in Europe, in five industry partner organisations in UK, Estonia, and Portugal, Sweden and Germany and 2. To develop easy to use and easy to understand tutorial materials, such as a step-by step guidance material for process management and a handbook of good practice. The project will be managed to lead five case studies at plant level, where the implementation process will be conducted in three phases. Each phase will develop learning outcomes that can be built into a tool for managing implementation processes. The three phases are 1. Initiation of the process, identification of key roles for implementation and setting up a time plan. Phase 2 is to implement the selected key roles and standards in the company\u2019s HR-routines and processes. Phase 3 is to disseminate results and to evaluate the learning outcomes and document good practice. The implementation process will be monitored and evaluated during the whole period in order to develop experience and knowledge for the intellectual outputs.  The project team will develop two intellectual outputs during the project period, number 1 is the Step-by-step guidance materials for implementing occupational standards and number 2 is the Handbook which includes a revised form of the step-by-step guidance to include good practice. The project group is set up by five partners representing organisations that worked together in previous EU-funded projects. These organisations represent Technical universities and education and training institutions, and they are all active in the European explosives sector.  In order to ensure high quality in the implementation process the project activities need to build on the experience that has been previously developed in other EU-funded projects by the project partners. In the new project the experts representing education and training will lead change processes at plant level and manage implementation processes in collaboration with company managers. The partner\u2019s previous knowledge and experience from working with occupational standards is essential for reaching project goals. Five partners are new to the project team, these organisations represent industry partners from five different nations. They have been selected and invited by national partners, based on their area of business and on the company manager\u2019s interest to participate in the project with the ambition to change their practice. All partners are members in a variation of European networks and they are specialists and experts in their field. The project aims to change the mindsets of company managers, HR-staff and stakeholder, to approach more proactive measures when implementing HR-routines and support structures in order to access demand led education and training.  The purpose is to show how the use of occupational standards, developed for the European explosives sector, can aid the companies in their ambition to find new practices to sustain workers competencies and skills and continue to provide safe work environments. By emphasizing how the occupational standards can be used as a tool for managing and supporting competence development and up-skilling processes at plant level company managers and HR-staff can develop knowledge, experience and skills of how to communicate their training and skills demands to VET-providers and FE- and HE-institutions.

There is a strong focus on creating opportunities for young persons between 16-29 years old to gain accredited skills to become competitive on an increasingly international job market. The EMEU4ALL project addresses all Erasmusplus program objectives (2014-3020) which prioritize the expansion of learning mobility opportunities, the creation of strategic partnerships for VET education and the accreditation of learning mobility achievements through the use of the European ECVET Toolkit instruments. Access for young VET students to teaching and training methods and work experiences in other countries will help to improve their employability in a global economy: work-based learning is critical for employability at all education levels, particularly in the current context of extremely high youth unemployment.  Student numbers have dropped dramatically in the last 10 years and therefore there is a clearly defined need to increase the quality and attractiveness of VET education in many European countries. The EMEU4ALL project therefore focusses on Learning Mobility which comprises both physical mobility and virtual activities, because current opportunities for physical mobility in VET education are low: in The Netherlands e.g. the number of secondary VET students involved in mobility programmes is just between 1-2 % . Internationalization@home (IaH) or Virtual mobility activities where staff and students work together at a distance are stable in HE and Universities, but very underdeveloped in VET; if activities are offered in VET, they are most likely not embedded in the curricula of VET colleges and therefore not validated. IaH, however, may be the only affordable key to mobilize the majority of non-mobile students.  With the predecessors of the EMEU4ALL project, i.e. the Automobility project, the Automovet project and Engineering Mobility across Europe (EMEU) project (2014-2016) the partnership has actively supported and addressed the EU aims described above by creating an open and sustainable network for learning, working opportunities and validation through ECVET thereof for Engineering students in VET education. The attention and nominations the EMEU project has received since its inception has strengthened our belief that the project formula will work in all VET sectors as practice has attracted new partners to the project. Thus, the EMEU4ALL project aims to transfer the EMEU products, procedures and website for Engineering/ICT to Health Care, Social Care, Business Studies (Marketing), Sports, International Trade and Service (Retail and Catering). The existing and tested EMEU products and procedures (see: http://em-eu.eu) will ensure a transfer to the new EMEU4ALL VET sectors with which we aim to: 1. create and test a minimum 40 virtual mobility activities; 2. create and test 40 modules; 3. Create vocational blood groups of  5 partners; 4. promote and execute longer-term work placements for students after finishing the modules. (This means that after the EMEU and EMEU4ALL project, the partners will have developed and tested 80 copy-left modules and virtual assignments. 5. adapt the existing EMEU website for engineering/ICT to the new VET sectors involved. 6. adapt the existing ECVET for ENGINEERING manual to an ECVET4ALL manual. The experience gained with understanding and applying ECVET will help to embed the modules in their own educational programs to become part of the partner\u2019s primary process; 6. Further develop teachers' professional skills in other VET areas regarding intercultural diversity, foreign languages and learning about the other VET programs in Europe. An extra focus for teachers will be on learning about and actively using social media, particularly through virtual learning mobility activities: If students are to be competitive on an international labour market, then it's necessary to gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary in an international context and to assess and validate their achievements. 7. Promote an active relationship between Education and Industry: during and/or after the modules the students will visit local/regional companies to experience educational theory applied in practical situations. Local and or regional industry will also contribute to the project by helping to develop the contents of the modules and by offering work experience opportunities to the transnational students. In a nutshell, through virtually and physically participating in and, more important, after this project, many more VET students will benefit from an international experience which will enhance their chances on an international labour market.

This means that people with low (or no) formal qualifications will find it more difficult to find a job in the future.\" To cope with this our project will enhance the current educational offer in automotive sector by creating completely new modules in a strategic field: energy sustainability (Europe 2020).\r\n\r\nThere is a clear need of VET all around Europe to keep updated, but sometimes this is difficult as innovation in industry goes fast and changes in VET systems are slow. The light transport industry is setting aside the derivatives of oil and turning into a cleaner energy, electricity; but VET providers, those who should train the technicians, are arriving late to these changes. We urgently need to create non-existing modules to train students about this new technology. \r\n\r\nEUmob will help us to create international on-line modules that will lead us to improve our offer and at the same time to promote mobility.

Similar numbers are found in Spain, Cyprus, and Malta. One of the differences is that in the project partner countries only GB has mandatory tests that need to be taken on a regular basis; e.g. employees in GB who get in contact with electricity (Building and Construction and industry) must pass a test on safety; the ECS (Electrotechnical Certification System). The main strength of the ECS is that it covers a wide range of safety issues and not just Electrotechnical dangers, out of 45 multiple choice questions only six are Electrotechnical, this has a major influence on wear and accident prevention, e.g. in Denmark, the National Research Centre for the Working Environment sent a questionnaire to 50,000 employed workers and received 27,000 responses (March 2014) that showed electricians compared to other work groups are involved in more than average numbers of accidents and suffer from more than average physical strain; e.g. working on knees or squatting 61.19% compared to an average for all groups of 17.2%, lifting or carrying more than a quarter of the work time 56.57% compared to an average for all groups of 30.68%, and working with arms lifted 51.43% compared to an average for all groups of 18.33% The different regulations for electricians\u2019 safety training/tests present barriers to mobility, this project will seek to remove such barriers by developing eLearning materials (versions for online and face to face courses) to support the teaching of safety in relation to working with live electrical installations, repairs etc. as well as initial test and post tests as part of the teaching about work environment and safety for electricians.The content of the course modules will be prepared so it may be used as part of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning), the CLIL scaffolding will mainly be based on online units with all words linked to dictionaries in 118 languages, this will help prepare craftsmen and apprentices for mobility.The project has two main target groups from the same sector; electricians and electricians\u2019 apprentices, but the bulk of the proposed outcomes will also be suitable for all employees and apprentices in the construction industry.

The college teams will develop a web-based OER (Open Educational Resource) containing multimedia rich interactive materials and cases for training Risk Assessment and a large volume of multiple choice questions on safety for electricians and other workers in the construction industry. All training materials will be available in Danish, English, Greek, Maltese, and Spanish.To exploit the project outcomes, the partnership will prepare curricula showing how to use the resources on an individual basis (long distance learning) and classroom teaching.During the project the developed materials will be tested to verify its effectiveness compared to the existing ECS-test system from GB. Based on the findings the project will compile a recommendation for safety training and tests of electricians.

This project aims at providing insight into sustainability. Focus: Health&Safety, environment, materials/resources, energy&water, equipment, customer experience and management (entrepreneur skills).\r\n\r\nContext\r\n\r\nThe hairdressing sector in Europe employs more than one million people across 400.000 hairdressing salons, receiving 350 million potential customers. Hairdressing services, together with beauty treatment - the H&B sector as it\u2019s called, form the personal services sector. Over the last years the sector has gone through a great deal of changes. The H&B often has more affinity with knowledge about their profession than with other aspects of the business. Attention to labour, health&safety, environment, marketing, service and services are crucial for successful entrepreneurship. A lot of these aspects can be shared under the label: Sustainability & entrepreneur skills.\r\n\r\nGoals, results and impact\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to develop innovative ways of learning about sustainability and to promote sustainability in schools and companies in the sector.\r\n\r\nWe will combine the sustainable ideas through education and training with innovative ideas within the sector. The educational products we want to generate during the process will include workshops on sustainability and innovation, teaching materials for schools and extracurricular education about sustainability in the 'green' salon (3 learning modules), a study of management systems of sustainability in the sector in Europe, develop a diagnostic scan for businesses and schools, a roadmap for introducing sustainability in the salon, a physical sustainability game for the sector, an Internet awareness game about sustainability and entrepreneurial skills, a final sector conference and student participation, with the aim of developing a magazine on sustainability in the H&B sector and a demo of sustainable hair creations. \r\nWe also communicate on the results of the entire project through a brochure, articles and press releases, a project website and the final conference in Amsterdam. By informing students, teachers and policy makers, we want to take steps towards more sustainability. Vocational education is in close contact with the companies in the local community and can open doors to changes in the industry. Therefore, activities will be organized with students, workers and employers in the partner countries. Several classes with students and teachers are actively involved in the activities in each country. Through this project we want to demonstrate that -in Europe- we need to act sustainably in the sector in a striking way.\r\n\r\nWhat and how\r\n\r\nIn the project we gather facts through research on management systems, the desired situation in a sustainable salon (core of a simple certification system), competences needed to reach this situation and research on a diagnostic scan to map the current situation on sustainability in a school or salon. The outcomes of the research we will discuss with experts and the results are input for developing the scan, the internet awareness game, the learning material in 3 modules and a final sector conference with student participation along the project. Using the competences of the different partners, their network, the experts, entrepreneurs in the sector and the teachers and students in the conferences and at home in the schools, we combine knowledge and perseverance to finalize the task in a good way.\r\n\r\nLong term\r\n\r\nThe effect of working sustainable in a \u2018Green salon\u2019 bottom line, is reducing risks and having more pleasure and satisfaction on the work spot. Sustainability creates less problems with health & safety, less environmental damage, less waste and a better and healthier use of materials and resources, a more controlled use of energy and water, more sustainable choices in investing in equipment and a higher level of customer experience and employee satisfaction. This all has to be managed by an entrepreneur or self-employed H&B specialist with the right skills. In this way the company can be more profitable and more competitive. This requires good and to the point education and training in regular VET and non-formal education accessible to people who are already working in the sector. \r\n\r\nPartners\r\n\r\nES-El Palo \u2013 Malaga, VET school: Hair & Beauty\r\nDK-Aarhus Tech, VET school: hairdressing department \r\nFR-IGS Lyon, VET & HE school: experienced in development of ICT games and entrepreneurial tools\r\nUK- Bridgewater College, VET school: hairdressing department\r\nNL- ROC Amsterdam, VET school: hairdressing department\r\nNL-Stivako \u2013 Commercial VET school entrepreneurial skills and sustainability & CSR in the creative industries", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA202-008844_2"], [2014, "Engineering Mobility in EUrope", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 241794.0, 6, 10, "CONTEXT Europe has clearly defined its ambitions in learning mobility for 202 There is a strong focus on creating opportunities for young persons between 16-29 years old to be employable on an increasingly international job market. The new Erasmus for All program (2014-3020) objectives prioritize the expansion of learning mobility opportunities, the creation of strategic partnerships for VET education and the accreditation of learning mobility achievements, also through the use of the European ECVET Toolkit instruments.  AIMS and PROFILES: VET education faces two challenges: 1. Engineering education in EU is not popular; there\u2019s a clear need to increase the quality and attractiveness of this sector in European countries as there are many job opportunities for engineering students. Learning mobility in an international context will help to provide such opportunities. And challenge 2. opportunities for physical mobilities, i.e. working abroad are limited due to limited funds. Numbers of students participating in physical work placement initiatives are still quite low; in The Netherlands for example the number of VET students involved in mobility programmes is around 1% of the secondary VET population, i.e. 16-19 year olds. By focusing on both virtual and physical mobility a much higher number of students can gain access to knowledge, skills and competences gained in an international context. Access for young VET students to methods, practices and technologies used in other countries will help to improve their employability in a global economy: work-based learning is critical for employability at all education levels, particularly in the current context of extremely high youth unemployment. The Engineering Mobility across Europe (EMEU) partnership project supports these aims by creating an open network for sustainable (virtual) learning and working opportunities for Engineering students in VET education. NUMBERS: To boost learning mobility the network partners will create a minimum of 40 modules based on the format transferred from the Automotive project (www.automobility-in.eu) to suit their national and EU partner students. The latter group will come from 10 partners in 6 EU countries. The EU students will be offered a work placement experience period during or after the modules. ACTIVITIES and RESULTS: the 10 partners create at least 2 modules per vocational area involved, in all a minimum of 40 modules. The vocational areas are Electrical and Electronic Engineering (6 teams), Mechanical Engineering (4 teams), ICT (3 teams), Civil Engineering (Construction, 6 teams) and Cabinet/furniture makers (3 teams). The partners will also create a manual on virtual communication activities to be done between students prior to, during and after the project. Local and regional industry will play an active part in deciding the contents of the modules and in offering work placement opportunities to the EMEU partner students.  All modules will be placed on the project website calendar, freely accessible (copy-left) by interested parties and they will be embedded in the partner\u2019s engineering curricula to ensure quality and sustainability of this type of education which EMEU calls \u201cEducation in an International Context or EIC\u201d. The modules will be will thus need to comply with criteria in the area of inspection, legal and quality assurance. Embedment strategies and procedures will be described in full for new EMEU partners.  The EU ECVET Toolkit documents, to create transparancy and mutual trust amongst partners will be used alongside national, legal documents and procedures. IMPACT The project will have  impact on various levels. The most important desired impacts are creating 1. high quality and sustainable mobility networks, 2. increased opportunities for staff and students to be internationally active.; 3. better relationships between education and industry on a local and/or regional level and to create a better understanding with both parties of demand (industry) and supply (education); on 4. opportunities to embed international activities in an educational context; no longer will we talk about Education \u00e1nd International project but about Education in an international context which will induce more VET colleges to becoming intrinsically motivated to be internationally active. LONG TERM BENEFITS The EMEU project creates an open network. All partners have been involved in mobility programmes for many years. As proven by the success of the Automobility project this EMEU project will 1. guarantee the commitment of partners to create sustainable mobility networks; 2. create opportunities to embed and valorise virtual and physical learning mobility opportunities for EU students; 3. reduce the workload of staff and students to find new work placement opportunities in the EU.

So step by step we are moving towards our aim. \r\n\r\nThe participants of current project will be carefully chosen according to each one individual training needs. Activities of mobility project will grow the learning motivation of the students, enable the precious experience of gaining new professional skills and knowledge abroad, develop the social skills, team work and independent work skills, grow initiative and self-confident. The mobilities are efficient tool to enable the foreign language skills improvement. The apprenticeship period done at enterprises will recognized as practice, set in the school curricula by using ECVET principles. \r\nThe mobilities of the employees will be recognized as official employee practice outside the school. All mobility learning outcomes are set according to the individual training needs of the participants.\r\n\r\nThe project team includes professional teachers, leaders of the vocational fields and management members, the aim of their work is to ensure the high quality mobilities. Project managers and project coordinator searched for the most appropriate partner institutions according to the set learning outcomes and signed the co-operation agreements. The aims of the mobilities, learning outcomes and timing are agreed with all of the partners and documented with letters of intent and memorandum of understanding. The learning outcomes of each mobilities are set in the memorandum of understandings. The learning outcomes will be negotiated once again before the mobilities, including the receiving enterprise in order to ensure its fulfillment. \r\n\r\nThe project will give the measure of International co-operation and gives an opportunity to improve the International co-operation field.

In its framework memorandum internationalization (appendix 1) funding programmes are described on the basis of which Graafschap College has been able to carry out several successful international projects. The projects of Graafschap College carried out within the programmes Leonardo da Vinci and VETpro have been assessed as  'Very Good' by the Dutch national agency of the Lifelong Learning Programme.  \r\n\r\nMerely because of the geographical location of our Achterhoek region in relation to Germany, internationalisation is a key focus area in the strategic policy of Graafschap College. Over the past few years Graafschap College has frequently gained experience with international work placements and student and teacher exchange projects. In its strategic policy \u201cSolid education for a solid region\u201d, the concept of labour globalisation has been adopted as an important development which Graafschap College wants to join. In 2014 and 2015 our institution wants to realize even more ambitions than in the recent past.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\n\r\nIn the next few years internationalisation is going to play an increasingly prominent role for Graafschap College. It is inescapable that the opening of the borders in Europe will also have major consequences for the Achterhoek region and that our school will take an even more active role in this matter. Starting point of the policy is that all activities and projects should match the goals of Graafschap College as described in the strategic policy 2010-2015. \r\n\r\n- leading player in the region\r\n\r\n- stimulating Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\n- innovation as a result of creativity\r\n\r\n- success from talent\r\n\r\n- strong professionals in a professional organisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasing international awareness and compentences among students and staff corresponds with all strategic goals. Cross-border experiences and encounters are accellerators of creativity, talents and learning power. In this way Graafschap College, as part of her core tasks,  gives an innovative impuls to the labour market. This impuls is even more desirable because, relatively speaking, both the economy and the working population in the Achterhoek region are more introverted than those in other regions. It stands to reason that the favourable geographical location in relation to Germany will be more and more benefited from, in particular the Euregion, i.e. the federal states of Nordrhein-Westfalen and Munsterland. Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in the field of exchange programmes and work placements in countries outside the Euregion.\r\n\r\nDerived from its strategic mission Graafschap College wants to be a school offering full scope international development opportunities for students and staff. International experiences are an integral and prominent part of the institutional portfolio. \r\n\r\nThe students are from the departments of Technics and Infromation Technology, Health and Welfare and Economics and Financial Services. In all cases it concerns students of levels 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe international work placements for students take place in Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, France, Finland and Portugal during the period from July 2014 till May 2016. The placements cover periods ranging from 3 until 20 weeks. \r\n\r\nFor a description of waht a student has do do before, during and aftera n international work placement and what requirements apply, we refer to appendix 3, pages 15 and 16. From students\u2019 presentations and reports it appears time and again that they have increased their language skills and developed an open mind for habits in a different culture. Their independence has grown enormously and they have learned to deal with clients and customers with a different social and cultural background. \r\n\r\nThe international work placement for staff members takes place in Finland, Malta and Belgium. The staff members are from the same departments as the students. These work placements last one week. The staff members who go on such an international work placement are obliged to discuss their personal and professional learning aims with their manager. Ultimately the manager will decide if the staaf member in question is eligible for the international work placement.  \r\n\r\nThe staff member defines his/ her own personal learning aims. These aims are also discussed during the annual personal development interview with the manager.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000034_1"], [2015, "Graafschap College Grenze(n)loos", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 187481.0, 10, 18, "Context and backgrounds of the project\r\nIncreasing international awareness and competences with students and staff meets with all strategic aims. Cross-border experiences and encounters increase creativity, talents and learning power.\r\nIn this way Graafschap College, acting  from its core tasks, gives an innovative impulse to the labour market. This impulse is the more desirable considering the introvert character of the working population of the Achterhoek compared to that of other regions of our country. It is obvious that the favourable location in relation to Germany will be much more used, especially the so-called \u2018Euregio.\u2019 Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in offering work-placements and exchange programmes with countries outside the Euregio.\r\nAs a result of the economic crisis the labour market perspective in the region has deteriorated fora n important number of jobs. This has led to a substantial growth of (youth) unemployment. A growing orientation and education with an international focus reduces the mbo-student\u2019s vulnerability.\r\nFor this call the implications are that the focus is much more directed towards Germany, as compared to previous calls. For 33 staff members a subsidy will be applied for to increase their German language skills in order to start a co-operation with a \u2018Berufskolleg\u2019 in Berlin. This is expected to have an innovative effect and appeal to students and that education programmes can be adapted to each other. For 25 students Germany is already scheduled in their diary.\r\nIn this call 39 staff members and 154 students have been included. Compared with the previous call 2014-2016 this means an increase of 100 individuals.\r\nThe total calculated amount fort his call is \u20ac 657.056,-.  Taking into account the amounts we received for students in the last two years, we as kan amount of \u20ac 461.834,- fort his call.\r\n\r\nAims and results\r\nIncreasing international awareness and competences with students and staff meets with all strategic aims.\r\nAt any rate an international orientation ensures a reduction of the student\u2019s vulnerable dependence of the regional economy. Besides, an external orientation contributes to general competences and a more active and creative professional attitude among graduates, which adds to the attractiveness of a candidate for a potential employer. Finally the candidate will be inclined to focus on other regions more readily.\r\nStaff members are expected to implement the newly acquired views, methods and knowledge.\r\nNumber and profile of the students\r\nThe students are mainly level 3 and 4 students of the departments Healthcare and Welfare, Economics and Finanacial Services and Technics and Information Technology. A new group of partcipating students is formed by students from \u2018My School\u2019, a very special group of students within Graafschap College.\r\nThe work-placements vary from 2 to 20 weeks\r\nImplementation of the project \r\nThe project will be carried out in co-operation with long-standing foreign partners and with intermediaries. Graafschap College serves as co-financing agent for students who make use of one of four intermediary agencies which have been acknowledged by the school. For every one of these students Graafschap College contributes an amount of \u20ac200.-\r\nIntended results and impact\r\n1 Improvement of the students\u2019 labour market perspective. From presentations and reports by the students it always becomes clear that language skills have improved, that they confront other customs and cultures with an open mind and that their independence has increased.\r\nStudents and staff  bring back extra professional baggage as a result of their international experiences and in this way they contribute to the development of the region the moment they start working for a company in their own region. This is the case, for example,  when they bring in a valuable network resulting from their international experiences. But, of course, outside the region internationally qualified employees are also wanted. \r\n2 By exchange programmes with other schools and companies/ institutions abroad Graafschap College can acquire new ideas and gain new knowledge which can be implemented in its own education. Of course the reverse is possible, too. This exchange of knowledge can be directed at both education methods and at professional topics.\r\n3 Ambassadors role for students and staff with international experience\r\nBest practices are shared at all levels within the school. Example: curriculum: pilot internationalisation, but direct lines within Graafschap College ensure that internationalisation is on the agenda, both as part of the policy and in realization.

To help students to become skilled labourors, to give teachers the opportunities to learn from methods used abroad and to improve the curriculum. \r\n\r\nEach sector in Da Vinci College has made a sector plan based upon the team plans, where international activities have to be a part. This together with discussions on the different sectors has lead to the policy plan of the International office (annex 1). Here we describe a number of goals + activities we will work on the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe big objective is to work towards a curriculum that has an International context. This is a process that takes time. We will start with one course where lessons will be given in English, the teachers involved get the possibility to do a CLIL course or a language course abroad.\r\nTo reach the overall goal we have different smaller goals:\r\n- student mobility, we want to send each year more students to reach te 6% goal the Dutch minister of Education has set.

As we are participating in three KA 2 projects and in 2017 in the application of 5 new ones we have allready quite a lot of international staff activities. We are planning to have a mutual agreement with two colleges in Denmark to exchange teachers and working life representatives. By combining school staff and working life representatives there will be a fruitful exchange of ideas, this will help to improve the quality of the courses in the College. \r\n- participating in KA2 projects, these help teams to get international contacts and to study on different topics.

We hope to increase these numbers every year.\r\nIn the coming month also level 1 students go abroad, with staff to visit Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe are also open for incoming students, every year there are about 30 students coming in, we try to integrate them in the classes of students that have the same course here in Da Vinci Colllege.\r\nIncoming teachers are offered a program in combination with working life, we always expect them to give at least one masterclass on their own expertise.\r\n\r\nOrganizational structure:\r\nIn Da Vinci college there is a platform of contactpersons from the different sectors, they meet 10 times a year to discuss new policy, practical issues concerning mobility or projects. This platform is important because the participants have to translate the ideas to the teams and students. The participants in this platform support the students in all the steps that are needed to go abroad, information, preparation, practical issues, tutoring, validation and dissemination. Also they inform and help the colleagues.\r\nThere is also a strategic platform, herein participate the director of the sector of Bussiness, the coordinator of the international Office and a member of the Board.\r\n\r\nWe use our website and ELO for information and training purposes. We have developed a number of documents and there is a list to control (annex 7). Students are doing a number of tasks before going. Their tutor in the college is deciding which tasks have to be done. Every participant has to write a final report which can be published on the website. Also they have to give a presentation.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our partners abroad.

Workplace instructor will support, give feedback, and assess the student. Student will keep a learning diary and receive feedback on the learning process from his tutoring teacher. A feedback discussion will be held after period abroad. Coordinator will check that student has taken care of all obligations. Knowledge, skills and competencies will be recognised and recorded.\r\nStaff mobility periods are mainly job shadowing. Staff members selected to mobility periods usually work as on-the-job learning tutors for leaving and incoming students. During mobility period they support students abroad, find new partners and negotiate on cooperation. Content of Staff training period can also be organised by of networks.\r\nProject and its results will be disseminated internally, locally, to networks and externally using e.g. local newspapers, Internet, and Facebook. Students will tell about their experiences to their peers in social media.\r\nThe project will have remarkable results and impacts. Students learn new professional skills, communication skills, critical thinking and new things about the culture and language of the target country. They become more independent, gain self-confidence and courage. An on-the-job-learning period abroad may contribute to a workplace. An international co-operation supports also lifelong learning of teachers participating in the project, leads to new international contacts and increases collegial collaboration. The project increases teachers\u2019 international skills, increases their enthusiasm towards the development of their own field of expertise and has a positive impact on their professional growth.

As an example of that we could point that this year we have decided to include a group of students with a new profile. Since 2016 we haven teaching \"professionalism certificates\" to students with intellectual disability who already are working in protected companies and they need to get their training accredited. We believe that doing their workplacement abroad will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy, both at a professional and personal level. Likewise, we have considered this is the right moment to add to this internationalization process a new dimension. We have included our teachers in our mobilities so that all this process does not finish with our students. To accomplish this task we will count with our european partners, who offer our students, and now, also our teachers, the chance to extend their academic training in other countries. \r\nWe want to offer to the participantes an European work experience that enables them to improve their professional competences and increases the opportunities to get a job. We have chosen different types of mobilities in each case:\r\n1.- VET students who will have their workplacement in companies abroad. The students will be divided according two different profiles:\r\n a.- Young people between 16 and 21 years old, mentally handicapped enrolled in a program that combines basic training with specific training carried out in workshops of different specialities.\r\nb.- Young people between 15 and 19 years old who have not reached the minimum goals in ESO (compulsory secondary education) in their centres of origin and attend the Centro San Viator. These students come to us with serious self-esteem issues and dragging problems (social, cognitive...) that have prevented them from getting their degree.\r\n2.-  VET students who will have a study period abroad, theoretical + practical. They are students who are studying VET Middle Degree(EQF3). Most of these students come from a VET education and therefore have already suffered school failure and have or have had risk of social exclusion. \r\nCHANGES regarding the participants' profiles:\r\n3. Students with intellectual disability who are already working in protected companies and are studying/have studied at our school to get the professional certificate  (in different areas) completelly accredited.  They will do part of their workplacement abroad and we are sure that it will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy.\r\n 4. One of our teachers (Ane Ruiloba) will spend a month in a Norwegian school that works with the Montessori methodology. She will improve her academic training spending a month there doing an observation/job shadowing period. The election of this teacher for the mobility has been made taking into account that she already has a officialy accredited B2 level in norwegian and this will allow her to interact with the students and take part in the academic school life with the rest of the staff, as well as having the same training the rest has, and therefore, make the most of the mobility.\r\n5. VET teachers who will get the chance during a week  to know, via job shadowing, the best educational methodologies in schools that have years developing them.\r\nThe long path this project has done, starting in 2007, has allowed us to know that the participants with special needs and the students  at risk of exclusion can not be alone during the mobilities; and we cannot forget that some of them will be minors. That's why we need that two teachers from the scholl travel with each group, so they can monitor and support the participants during the whole period. The number of carers has not been arbitrarily done, it has been analysed and carefully studied. Just a carer would not be enough,  if something happened with a participant and he/she had to  be accompanied ( to the hospital, doctor, etc.), the rest would be alone. But we also understand that more than two carers would be unreasonable. Experience also allows us to see that from an organisational point of view more people often cause a logistics problem, as for example, a minibus can only sit 9 people. We are aware that this project aims to allow the participants to acquire autonomy, but we cannot ignore that some of them need a planification and supervision of daily tasks as hygiene, feeding, means of transport...\r\nIn 2007 our project Aurrerantz started to ease the mobility of 8 intellectuallly handicapped students (and 2 carers) while they were doing their work placement. Through all these years the project has developed including participants from other different sections of Centro San Viator.

According to the UN, an estimated 650 million people in the world live with disabilities. Together with their families, that means that about 2 million people are directly affected by disability, representing almost one third of the world's population. More people have access needs; for example, older and less mobile people or people with pushchairs have access needs. The European population is ageing: by 2050 the number of people over65 will be 3 times what is was in 2003. For all of these people, travelling can be a real challenge. They represent a huge market potential for tourism which today remains vastly under-served. Making places more accessible is a social responsibility but also acompelling business case to boost the competitiveness of tourism in Europe.The Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROWTH), has responsibility for helping turn the EU into a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy by implementing the industrial and sectorial policies of the flagship Europe 2020 initiative, fostering entrepreneurship and for the COSME programme (Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) which recently called for proposals to facilitate transnational tourism for seniors in low season, recognising the substantial market availableIn July 2014, DG GROWTH held a conference and commissioned three reports detailing the current state of accessibility in tourism: the marketplace, skills and training needs and travel patterns. Two projects (TACTALL and TAFCITY) are mentioned; both aredescribed as innovative and useful; however, the awareness training they offered has not been made available on a wide basis, mainly because they were LLP 'pilots'. Some members of the project teams that created these projects feel that they have the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm to enhance, adapt and deliver sustainable training, with EU certification accepted by many member states.The unemployment rates in partners' countries is high, particularly in the under 30s. Setting up their own business is a viable option for many young people. Many rural areas have no work other than that provided by SMEs or micro businesses; many of these areinvolved in the tourist industry. The marketplace potentially is very large and growing. Recommendations in the 2014 report mentioned have been taken into account in this proposal, together with the consortium's now extensive knowledge and experience.This project will deliver accessibility as a new opportunity for the tourism market, creating a modular course using innovative methods: co-creation (Living Lab) and including disabled people in the curriculum design. Four modules will cover entrepreneurship, including social enterprise; accessibility awareness and comprehension; a standard that could be embedded into any curriculum with EU certification pursued; accessible tourism; marketing accessible tourism (in particular to open up the out-of-season market for older persons). It will also create  co-operation between education, business, social enterprises, NGOs and similar to raise awareness of accessibility. A business case for accessible tourism will be created, to ensure businesses recognise thepotential of the market available. In order to raise the profile of accessibility, via local, regional, national and pan-European networks, businesses associations, NGOs and similar, an online network/forum and quality evalation facility will be designed and delivered . An evaluation/review product, Acc Advisor (similar to the popular Trip Advisor) and an App are deliverables. It is certainly intended to make GROWMAT sustainable, seeking 'corporate' sponsorship, social enterprises or using crowd funding to maintain the profileThe partnership has a mix of skills: 3 VET institutions, 2 of them with experience of projects involving accessibility and elderly people and their needs; a University of Applied Science, with valuable knowledge of entrepreneurship and co-creation (Living Lab) methodology; a UK charity dealing with older people and knowledge of active ageing; a private training company who is also an entrepreneur; another entrepreneur who specialises in 'Design for All'; a European VET network with 1500 members.The project will run events and attend events to enable the partnership to find \u2018champions\u2019 (a person who vigorously supports or defends a person or cause.); the champions are considered very important to the project.The beneficiaries of this project include people of varying abilities, older people, anyone less mobile, students (particularly in hospitality and tourism), teachers and trainers, adults, unemployed persons, employers and staff.The potential long-term benefit of this project is for accessibility comprehension to be accepted as a basic transversal skill.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA202-024934_9"], [2015, "Work for Adults 2.0", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 153921.0, 5, 5, "We are currently facing a transition in working life: professional requirements are changing, professional careers are evolving and employments get more and more periodic. Vocational education and training faces many expectations, e.g. personalised educational possibilities, flexible educational pathways and versatile learning solutions. Common and simultaneous development of education and working life is both a challenge and an opportunity. In this project the representatives of both education and working life jointly develop procedures to meet the needs of both sectors. The aim is to develop and implement together innovative and work-based learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at developing vocational education according to the principles of WBL (work-based learning). Objective is to test in cooperation with working life partners the new procedures that utilise peer learning and ICT, social media and new digital learning solutions.\r\n\r\nThe project consortium (Omnia, the Joint Authority of Education in Espoo Region (Finland), Derby College (United Kingdom), Ikaslan/ Education & Mobility (Basque Country/Spain), Tartu Folk High School (Estonia) and Finnish Folk High School (Sweden))  commits to enhance the partnership between working life and educational establishments, lifelong learning goals and quality of education according to the strategic goals of Education & Training 2020 framework. First-rate WBL requires persistent development of partnerships, common project between working life and education and possibilities for peer learning (Work-Based Learning in Europe, 2013). In vocational upper secondary education the cooperation with working life has been more or less limited into on-the-job learning. Common development projects that have been closely linked to vocational learning have been fortuitous. The change in occupations and growing diversity of careers further increase the need for cooperation between working life and education.\r\n\r\nPIAAC (2013) study shows that the most important competences in information society are literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments. According to the study from the perspective of the working life the problem solving in technology-rich environments is a critical lifelong learning skill all over Europe. The demand for digital skills and competences increases rapidly in different occupations, which also adds to the need of developing these skills as a part of vocational education. Digitalisation can be seen as a common challenge and opportunity both to working life and vocational education.\r\n\r\nInternationally there are several challenges in WBL. These challenges can be related to e.g. administration or lack of long-term partnerships, common working methods or tools or to assessment of the activities. In this project the partners bring their own experience to the discussion and also take part in peer learning. The content of the project has been set up following the strategic objectives of each partner. \r\n\r\nIn this project social responsibility will be taken into account by developing tighter cooperation between educational establishment and working life, regional cooperation realises in participation of regional partners in the implementation of this project. At the same time the project develops and implements different new innovative ICT and digital learning solutions into WBL. \r\n\r\nThis project is targeted to vocational education organisations, working life, different actors in vocational education and training and students. Organisations develop high quality vocational education in accordance to the WBL principles taking into account their own most important development areas. Working life is encouraged and supported to participate and the articulation of the education and training in real job situations is increased by mutual planning. Actors in vocational education and training (e.g. teachers) develop their own expertise by cooperation with working life and with the help of innovative learning solutions. Students take part into the implementation of the project in cooperation with the working life partners while attending vocational education.\r\nAccording to the Europe 2020 strategy and European Commission\u2019s Council 2013 country-specific recommendations, there are more or less similar threats in all partner countries concerning the employment and the cooperation between (vocational) education and working life. These threats include among others mismatching skills and jobs, social exclusion of immigrants and high level of unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe economies and societies of the European countries are changing rapidly.

The objective of the Sustainable Student Mobility project (SUMO) is to centralize all student mobility under one project thus improving the quality of mobilities and making their management easier and more effective. During the project students in initial vocational education carry out a 4-10 week on-the-job training period or study period abroad. Part of the students give their vocational skills demonstrations abroad. In addition, students are encouraged to critical thinking by means of an assignment that deals with sustainable development. They are also motivated to make use of social media such as facebook, blogs, etc. during their on-the-job training period abroad. The beneficiaries of the project comprise 176 students in initial vocational education and 46 vocational teachers.\r\n\r\nStudents prepare themselves for the study / practical period abroad by means of self-study material collected in moodle and with the help of teachers. From the spring 2014, Savo Vocational College organizes annually in spring and autumn an international summer school offering students courses in English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, German and Russian languages, 32 hours each. When selecting students for practical periods abroad, attention is paid to those who have done summer school courses, because in this way students prove their commitment and ability to plan their studies longer ahead. Students, of course, make also the language test designed by the European Commission.

Actually the Chinese eCommerce company \"Alibaba\" is the world's largest retailer and the eCommerce business is still growing rapidly (growth rates of 15% or more in many countries). The new forms of trade are emerging because technology is developing at breakneck speed. All together this has brought about a multitude of new possibilities and at the same time a need for new skills among the workers in the online shops (webshops). \r\n\r\nThe association FDIH (the Danish industry association for eCommerce companies)  have made an extensive survey among its members. The results of the survey show that 41% of the companies lack skills in their actual workforce.19% of the survey participants have given up hiring qualified staff. FDIH conclude, that there is a high demand for basic trade skills. First and foremost it is a great wish (83%), that employees are skilled in marketing and marketing optimization. 35% of them want skills within customer service. Both these areas are usually covered within the existing curricula, so we need to challenge the exisiting teaching material and the online shops.\r\n\r\nEcommerce Europe has made a survey in 2016 showing that online merchants with cross-border ambitions are often held back by barriers such as legal uncertainty due to unclear or very different rules, taxation and payment systems that differ greatly, or high prices of delivery due to a lack of transparency in the market. Other difficult barriers to overcome when selling abroad are related to (online) payments, competition issues, language, client relationships and marketing.\r\n\r\nFrom an educational point of view we need to learn more about how to educate the future workforce in the eCommerce industry. \r\n\r\nThrough this project 30 eCommerce teachers from six different VET institutions in five different EU countries will exchange their knowledge and good practices in eCommerce teaching, and they will visit in total 30 web-shops in the five participating countries. Through this they will learn a lot about eCommerce issues taught in the other countries, as well as they will be provided with the latest up to date knowledge and the educational needs from the companies. The teachers will be taught by each other through job shadowing and through extensive meetings with the web-shop companies  and each other. \r\n\r\nFurthermore 60 VET students will participate in the project, doing a 14 days mobility mostly. They will stay at the hosting school for a couple of days and the rest of the periode they will tbe hosted by a web-shop. At the webshop they will stay in pairs and solve a specific company case for the web-shop and at the same time take part of everyday life in the webshop.  Because of this the students will have a heightened opportunity to learn from the webshop companies directly through internships. Finally the students will have a good opportunity to widen their own network and global mindset. \r\n\r\nIt is the primary objective of the PEAL project to provide the partnership schools with knowledge and inspiration through exchange of good practices and discussions with each other and with the web-shops involved. We expect every partner has already made changes in their eCommerce teaching material, when the project has finished.

Implementation of the reform of the vocational system, a restructure of the organization and a cut back of 10% of staff. This could easily have had a negative influence on the international opportunities for our students. This is not the case. In 2015 a first version of the international strategy was developed and different implementation strategies tested. In 2016 the strategy was approved and the college is now in the implementation phase focusing on embedding internationalisation through 4 focal activity areas: Internationalisation at home, International mobilities, development activities and network and competence development. The international strategy is attached together with description of procedures to support embedment of administration of mobilities, receiving and sending students. \r\n\r\nThe majority of our students going abroad will replace part of a main course with an international module. The modules are being implemented in our yearly schedule, which means students can plan ahead and select modules according to their interested and the interest of their employer. Mobilities in this project will support students from ICT, painters, Industrial technicians, blacksmith, auto mechanics, civil construction, carpenters, electricians and gastronomy to attend international and fully accredited modules in Netherlands, England, Scotland, Finland, Spain and France. Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU which is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership (participating partners: JAO, Finland; Horizon College, Netherlands; XABEC and Bizkaia, Spain; Bridgwater & Taunton, UK). In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge (F), Da Vinci College (NL) and West College Scotland (UK) is following the same concept and guidelines although the colleges are not yet a part of the EMEU network. \r\n170 students and 25 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. \r\n\r\nPreviously the main international activities for students were integrated in a prolonged the basic course. With the new reform, we had to rethink this. The spring of 2016 a test of an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an ECVET accredited mobility experience UK, was tested. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global was tested with ICT and Auto Mechanic students. Go Global a course for the students on cultural intelligence. This part of the course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. Another learning from the test course was that a 3 week mobility was too long for a large group of students to be able to pass the basic course. 3 out of 19 students did not pass the exam. We have decided to continue to run the optional course but reduce the mobility to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA total of 25 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance and administration of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET and of course specialised educational areas as advanced testing of materials (Lycee Monge), decorative painting (Bizkaia) and racing (Bridgwater&Taunton). Furthermore 3 teachers will have teaching assignments with partners on areas where we have expertise (accuracy in CNC), specialised welding.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back.

The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. \r\n\r\nThe Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened.

The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems.

Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy.

The consortium wants to carry out this project in order to meet the demands created by the increased international competitiveness by increasing competence, flexibility and employability of VET-learners, VET- staff and participating organisations in the Vehicle sector.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is European mobility for VET learners and Staff in the vehicle sector. The objectives in this project are:\r\n a) Increased skills and competences for VET-learners to improve their flexibility, employability and transition to the labour market by VET learners traineeship in companies in EU. \r\nb) Update, upgraded skills and competences for modernising and internationalising their mission by understanding the skills demand in the European Vehicle sector and VET through staff training abroad at a European VET-provider.\r\nc) Creating a network of VET-providers, social partners and companies to understand European VET and vehicle sector skills demand to reinforce capacity of managing international collaboration and increased international scope.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants: 50 VET-learners and 50 VET-staff\r\nProfile: The project is intended for VET-learners and VET-Staff in the Swedish Upper secondary school national programme The Vehicle Programme (fordons- och transportprogrammet) that provides Vocational education training. The mobility project focuses on the three sub-programmes to The Vehicle Programme: 1) The Lorries and mobile machinery programme; 2) The Body work and paint spraying programme; 3) The Passenger cars programme.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project are: a) VET learners traineeship in companies in EU; b) Staff training abroad at a European VET-provider.\r\n\r\nThe methodology that will be used in this project is the European Quality Charter for Mobility. We address quality and management issues by implementing the EQAVET model in the project work plan and in the design of the work packages in order to address quality and management issues in a sustainable way. The EQAVET model consists of four stages for the quality assurance cycle for VET-providers: Planning, Implementation, Evaluation and Review.

In order to increase the equality of learner mobilities, each unit/sector will be encouraged to send participants on mobilities. When selecting the participants focus is on who has the most to gain by taking part in a LearnMob2 mobility.

The aim is to rethink the learning approach within general subjects through improved opportunities for internationalization at basic course through the establishment of an international class. A key point in the internationalization is an unfolding of practice learning by the implementation of the learning partner concept. A learning partner can be a student in class or at school, a teacher or a farmer nearby. It is crucial that the learning partners function is to contribute to pupils' learning and job training. The use of new technologies (Mooc\u2019s, and online learning) and international internships means that learning partners can also be a student or teacher at a secondary school in Bulgaria or an agricultural college student in England, or a farmer nearby one of these educational institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Learning Partner concept allows us to work with the individualization of learning, at the same time as the context is broadened due to the linguistic and cultural challenges that internationalization brings along. Mobility helps to make learning both practice- and adventure-oriented. The use of new learning technologies will help to increase the learning effect, increase motivation and the innovative element in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is  that the use of active learning partner will contribute to the development of an active learning network where teachers, as active users of the learning partner concept, develop learning for common use both in language courses, academic courses and professional courses.

The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.We want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. Students have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  The new project will allow us to provide a more rigorous level of detail to our training before the mobility. Students will receive personal and group assistance for their mobility periods and they get detailed instructions to complete a Europass CV and final report among other things. Training course will also be developed to college's learning platform. Additionally students will participate in a shared, common training before the mobility period. The training program includes information about the destination country, its culture, objectivities for the period, insurances and other practical matters. At the same time, we ensure that students complete an OLS-language test both before and after the period. Teachers and students, who have been earlier on a mobility period are asked to share their experiences at a training session.With the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. Staff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.The objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy.

Participants for the mobility of students are recruited from students of the dual training in the metal sector and electrical engineering (industrial mechanics, mechatronics, machinist, manufacturing mechanics and precision mechanics). At the learning stays of Education personnel abroad participate teachers in the metal and electrical engineering of BSFT and training staff from the dual training establishments in Munich.For the mobility of learners foreign vocational schools offer three-week units of learning outcomes / modules, which are developed according to the principles of ECVET. The intended learning outcomes (LE) range of the content of the compulsory curriculum for the respective German courses. Participants attend the end of the stay in the host institution an assessment attesting to the LE. The LE are validated and recognized in the home institution.

As an example of that we could point that this year we have decided to include a group of students with a new profile. Since 2016 we haven teaching \"professionalism certificates\" to students with intellectual disability who already are working in protected companies and they need to get their training accredited. We believe that doing their workplacement abroad will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy, both at a professional and personal level. Likewise, we have considered this is the right moment to add to this internationalization process a new dimension. We have included our teachers in our mobilities so that all this process does not finish with our students. To accomplish this task we will count with our european partners, who offer our students, and now, also our teachers, the chance to extend their academic training in other countries. \r\nWe want to offer to the participantes an European work experience that enables them to improve their professional competences and increases the opportunities to get a job. We have chosen different types of mobilities in each case:\r\n1.- VET students who will have their workplacement in companies abroad.  Young people between 15 and 19 years old who have not reached the minimum goals in ESO (compulsory secondary education) in their centres of origin and attend the Centro San Viator. These students come to us with serious self-esteem issues and dragging problems (social, cognitive...) that have prevented them from getting their degree.\r\n2.-  VET students who will have a study period abroad, theoretical + practical. They are students who are studying VET Middle Degree(EQF3). Most of these students come from a VET education and therefore have already suffered school failure and have or have had risk of social exclusion. \r\n3. Students with intellectual disability who are already working in protected companies and are studying/have studied at our school to get the professional certificate  (in different areas) completelly accredited.  They will do part of their workplacement abroad and we are sure that it will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy.\r\n 4. VET teachers who will get the chance during a week  to know, via job shadowing, the best educational methodologies in schools that have years developing them.\r\nThe long path this project has done, starting in 2007, has allowed us to know that the participants with special needs and the students  at risk of exclusion can not be alone during the mobilities; and we cannot forget that some of them will be minors. That's why we need that two teachers from the scholl travel with each group, so they can monitor and support the participants during the whole period. The number of carers has not been arbitrarily done, it has been analysed and carefully studied. Just a carer would not be enough,  if something happened with a participant and he/she had to  be accompanied ( to the hospital, doctor, etc.), the rest would be alone. But we also understand that more than two carers would be unreasonable. Experience also allows us to see that from an organisational point of view more people often cause a logistics problem, as for example, a minibus can only sit 9 people. We are aware that this project aims to allow the participants to acquire autonomy, but we cannot ignore that some of them need a planification and supervision of daily tasks as hygiene, feeding, means of transport...\r\n So in this new  call we apply for the mobiliby of 25 participants (with 4 carers) during two school years with different approaches:\r\n- Work placement\r\n- Training in VET schools + companies\r\n-Job shadowing for teachers.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA116-049473_2"], [2016, "Dropout Reduction in Apprenticeship Training", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 66502.0, 5, 5, "According to the Europe 2020 Strategy, in order to improve young people's entry into the labour market through must be integrated action covering counselling and apprenticeships.

The application includes two long-standing partners and new institutions in Latvia and Malta, in order to maintain efficient and innovative relations. According to the Strategy, a strong international network of partners will be developed.The planned visits of students cover 5 countries, 6 vocational training institutions, 5 areas of education, 8 specialties:\u2022 an auto mechanic;\u2022 an auto electrician;\u2022 a plumber;\u2022 a joiner;\u2022 a furniture maker;\u2022 a trimming builder;\u2022 a thermal insulation builder; \u2022 a computer hardware engineer.It is planned 10% increase in students' interships. Suggested mobilities for students of different fields and specialties form more than a half of the expected number of specialties of in 2016. The project involves a variety of specialties which approve the values of the Strategy of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) such as equal opportunities and tolerance even though the managment of so mobilities is much more complicated than to organize a larger groups mobilities into fewer institutions. Moreover, it planned to provide students from low-income families with opportunity to participate in internships as a half of the learners of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) are from such families. According to the Strategy every student has the opportunity of comprehensive development.The duration of students\u2018 mobilities is 3 weeks. During one week students would visit educational institutions of practical training workshops (all host organizations in practical training workshops are equipped with modern teaching tools and practice equipment).  During the next two weeks students will proceed with their internships in companies. All students mobilities are related to the content of learning programme, therefore, in accordance with the Strategy, in order to ensure the transfer of skills and competences,  it is planned to assess students\u2018 outcomes and achievements using ECVET. It will not be difficult to manage during the mobilities of auto mechnics and auto electricians as we have experience in this field and basis for implementation of ECVET. It is also expected that there will not be difficulties in assessing learning outcomes of computer hardware engineers as we have signed the Memorandum with our education consortium. Moreover, Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) has a lot of experience in the implementation of ECVET.It is necessary to put more efforts within other mobilities for both the sending and the host organizations. On the other hand, the strong relations will be developed as the basis for long-term cooperation.Teachers\u2018 visits cover three countries. The visits to Latvian vocational training institutions will be held for. The participants will gain knowledge and practical skills both in host schools and in the companies of social partners. As a result, the teachers of wood processing and construction specialties will prepare a new module named \u201eRestoration of wooden products\u201c.  The teachers of trimming builders\u2018 and thermal insulation builders\u2018 specialties will prepare \u201eThe technological processes cards of mechanized plastering and painting\u201c. Thus teachers will implement their experience into the curriculum, ensuring development of international competence. According the Startegy, the mission of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) is to provide students with innovative vocational training, seeking the compatibility of curriculum content and methodologies with educational programmes of foreign countries.Furthermore, the mobilities for vocational teachers who wish to gain experience working with students who have problems with social integration, also are planned. It is important to pay particular attention to the teachers\u2018 development of skills who work with students from low-income families.The long-term goal of  Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) is to increase a well-known reputation in foreign countries.The mobilities of the teachers and students, cooperation in vocational education, intercultural integration, cultural awareness, update of curriculum content include all international of vocational training activities listed in the Strategy.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT01-KA116-022996_4"], [2014, "Mobilumas mokantis \u2013 patirtis gyvenime", "BRIDGWATER COLLEGE", 31486.0, 7, 10, "The analysis of student and teacher mobility during the period of 2007-2014 at Kaunas builders\u2019 training centre indicated that only 33 students and 12 teachers participated in trainings abroad therefore the institution focuses on increasing possibilities for learners to perform practical training abroad and for vocational teachers to observe the organization of practical training.
