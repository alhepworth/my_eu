With the exception of Swansea (Wales) , which is three- weeks long.\r\n\r\nThe methodology which organizes this project is based on the development of the internship which allows the development of the professional competences; the improvement of the professional and linguistic skills ; the strengthning of the personal , social and intercultural development in both  the companies and the educative centres.\r\n\r\nThe stays will be carried out in two flows: the first one between the fourth term in 2015 and the first term in 2016, and the other in the second term in 2016. They will be provided with a linguistic and cultural training . The educative centre will be in charge of the organisation of the stay ( trips, transfer, accomodation and living expenses, insurances) ,all the expenses will be covered, and in coordination with the host partners , the total  amount will be managed according to the different concepts. The stay will be certifified with a  linguistic training diploma , an internship diploma and the Europass Mobility document.\r\n\r\nFor all this, the expected  results are focused on the increase of the posibilities in the labour market and the motivation to take further studies.\r\n\r\n2.

While municipal water quality has always been a concern in some parts of the world, it is now becoming an issue in North America as well.

These problems are strengthened by feelings of disillusionment and in some cases a lack of perspective. One of the causes is the inability of many people, especially young people, to find suitable jobs or even any job at all. Many people are confronted with unemployment or are overqualified for the jobs they hold.Citizen Initiatives for Global Solidarity (CIGS) are small-scale initiatives set up by private citizens in the Global North on a volunteer basis. These small organisations are engaged in improving the living standards of people in the Global South, or dealing with global issues in the North. It is estimated that in Europe there are more than 200 thousand such organisations. People working on a volunteer basis in CIGS gain a valuable set of new skills and capacities, such as in management, language, negotiation, organisation, communication and many more. These skills and capacities are not formally assessed and rarely recognized. Should these skills and capacities be fully recognised they can contribute to the employability of the people who obtain them.The Global STEPS project therefore aims at providing evidence of the added value of global citizenship experience for skills development, facilitating recognition of key competencies developed through global citizenship experience and through this recognition, improved access to quality employment. The project intends to reinforce the positive effect of active global citizenship outside of formal education by raising self-awareness about the competencies people acquire in their global citizenship practices and helping to translate those into saleable skills.The project does so by creating a common understanding of what Global Citizenship entails amongst the 4 partners working in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Close links will be identified in the process with the European Key Competence Framework. With this, the partners will start developing a methodology that enables the identification and qualification of non-formal skills and competencies. A competence builder tool will be generated, and a model item will be developed to introduce into CVs/application forms which will also be applicable to the Europass CV. A certificate will acknowledge the process of acquiring competencies through Global Citizenship experiences. These tools and methodologies will be made accessible through an online interactive platform accessible in the 4 countries that enables participants to assess their current level of non formal skills and find new opportunities to improve their skills and competencies. In order to guarantee that the tools are relevant and well used, guidelines and training will be developed and delivered so that other stakeholder organisations are able to use them. Through development of the tools and platforms, more than 450 people will benefit from the project directly while 50.000 will be reached through dissemination events and other project activities.The project will be evaluated with the outcome mapping method, enabling partners, beneficiaries and CIGS to make assessments at the start and at the end of the project on those aspects and impacts of the project we consider essential.

The long-term voluntary work will focus on helping exotic wildlife which ended up as victims of illegal or inconsiderate human actions.  The work will be executed in two rescue and rehabilitations centers, being AAP in Almere, the Netherlands and its Spanish branch Primadomus in Villena, Spain. Despite the fact that the voluntary work is executed at two locations, it includes similar activities. Receiving international volunteers with AAP, Almere, the Netherlands is in fact prolongation of earlier successful EVS-projects. The selected volunteers are animal, nature and/or environment motivated young people, by coincidence both coming from Denmark. They will spent their EVS-time within teams of great diversity: paid staff next to many interns and volunteers, colleagues of all levels of education and about 10-15 European nationalities. Through meeting their peers from other countries and of different background they can explore and create an understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and values. Mutually, this will lead to a greater solidarity and tolerance. The second location of the project is Primadomus in Spain, participating in EVS since 2014. To safeguard a solid rollout of the project, we have chosen for support and coordination from AAP's headquarters in the Netherlands, accepting the temporal consequence that only Dutch volunteers can take part.In this project we aim on young people from all over Europe. With their involvement in the daily caretaking process, both NGO's will gain important basic support in their labor intensive daily work. The volunteers will increase their awareness and insight in issues of animal welfare. In a charity setting and together with many other European volunteers, they will help animals in need but also get better understanding of underlying problems. The volunteers will learn  skills, attitude and knowledge necessary for animal caretaking, but also gain general life, social and intercultural experience. As most of them have background or career plans involving animals, it's likely that their EVS-experience at AAP or Primadomus improves their chances on the labor market. On long term, as they regularly remain involved with NGO's in their home countries, they also help spreading attention to animal welfare issues internationally.Also internally, the receiving organisations will 'profit' from the project. Through intensive contact and long-term involvement of the volunteers, the staff comes into contact with diversity of ideas and habits from different European nations and cultures. This will contribute to better understanding of cultural differences and widen their social horizon as well.During their EVS year, at both AAP Almere and Primadomus the volunteers will actively take part in the caretaking process of different exotic species in the rescue center.

Receiving international volunteers with AAP, Almere, the Netherlands is in fact prolongation of earlier successful EVS-projects. The selected volunteers are animal, nature and/or environment motivated young people coming from as different countries as Greece, Finland an Spain. They will spent their EVS-time within teams of great diversity: paid staff next to many interns and volunteers, colleagues of all levels of education and about 10-15 European nationalities. Through meeting their peers from other countries and of different background they can explore and create an understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and values.

With their involvement in the daily caretaking process, both NGO's will gain important basic support in their labor intensive daily work.

In a charity setting and together with many other European volunteers, they will help animals in need but also get better understanding of underlying problems. The volunteers will learn  skills, attitude and knowledge necessary for animal caretaking, but also gain general life, social and intercultural experience. As most of them have background or career plans involving animals, it's likely that their EVS-experience at AAP or Primadomus improves their chances on the labor market.

Three years ago, Institute Voluntariat started with so-called 3-months \u201cpractical work for students and other youth\u201d. These practices were proven to be very effective method of youth involvement in NGO sector. Therefore, we took this basic model and together with partners from Bulgaria, Italy, Moldova, Serbia, Spain and Great Britain developed an international, intensive training for 21 young people aged 21 to 32. Beneficiaries are completing their studies or they are recent graduates from different directions-first-time job seekers.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\nFirstly to train 21 young people to work in NGOs, by strengthen their skills and encourage them to develop their own initiatives in order to achieve the increase in their employment opportunities both within and outside the sector. Second - exchange experiences and practice of supporting mechanisms for involving young people in the NGO sector at the European level. Strengthen cooperation with NGOs and encourage them to integrate youth into the work processes of their work organization and guidance of project participants with a good mentor (an educational visit to the workplace), in a variety of cross-cultural environments.\r\nWe have designed two activities that will train young people for work in NGO. First, at the 6-day intensive training, we will educate 21 young participants on diverse areas, which project manager in NGO is dealing with every day. With inclusion of experts/external collaborants, who will be present the whole time of training, and the use of innovative and varied methods, participants will be closer to the areas of: project planning and management, teamwork and team leadership, working in an international environment, PR and marketing. At the same time, during training, we will select 10 participants for job-shadowing. We will send one or two selected participants from each country to job-shadowing to one of the foreign partner organization, where they will transfer the acquired knowledge to practical work. During the job-shadowing participants will be involved in a specific project with the help of mentors.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to empower youth to take on responsible and also management positions in NGOs. The result will be 21-trained young people with reinforced (international) competencies that will much easier get to the functions of project assistants and co-workers in various NGOs. They will also be able to create and register their own project proposals, with what employees in NGO sector somehow maintain and create jobs.

The range of problems is very wide, and is mainly experienced by the South (Latin America, Africa, Asia). Therefore, a transition to a new economy and a sustainable use of natural resources is necessary. To reach this change in our own country, we need strong leaders and entrepreneurs who stimulate sustainable development in both the North and the South. In September 2014 CATAPA, together with Mediaraven, Putumayo and Act 4 Change, have started a new campaign named \u2018Generation Transition\u2019. The aim of this campaign is to offer the new generation or 'Generation Transition' (managers, leaders, politicians, CEO\u2019s, teachers etc) skills and tools on sustainable development, in order to make the transition towards a society that uses resources in a sustainable manner. We will thus offer the young generation the opportunity to learn how they can contribute to a sustainable society. \r\n\r\nThis specific EVS project forms part of the second phase of this campaign. This phase is in essence a promoting and supporting phase. The educational material and events, the website, the Facebook-page, the Twitter-account, the documentary festival, the project promo video etc.  will be made, enhanced and/or translated and/or given in English and Spanish. This way, we believe we can have an impact on the international level as well. International impact is further facilitated to cooperation with partners Europe wide and in Latin America.

The focus will thus be on solutions on how to contribute positively to a new economy. We will do this by stimulating entrepreneurship and leadership skills, and by focusing upon the \u2018good practices\u2019.  \r\n\r\nThe project is open for every participant, regardless of his or her background knowledge and skills.

We are situated in a beautiful Almerian village, Los Molinos del Rio Aguas. Sunseed is a project off the grid, committed to self sufficiency and a low environmental impact.\r\n\r\nWe are a well established international and multicultural community that works in collaboration with other projects and organisations at a local, national and international level, such as schools, universities, environmental associations, plus UK and Spanish media. We are developing both formal and informal ways to educate, so we offer workshops, seminars, guided tours, internships and apprenticeships. We also welcome volunteers from all over the world throughout the year to get involved with our various departments: Appropriate Technology, Sustainable Living, Organic Growing, Drylands Management, Communication and Education and Eco-construction. Activities that volunteers can get involved with include the following:\r\n\r\nSustainable Living co-ordinates the smooth running of Sunseed\u2019s low impact lifestyle. Volunteers in this department help oversee our food policy to ensure an ethicall and healthy vegetarian diet. This team demonstrates and encourages the use of solar cookers and other appropriate technologies; oversees the harvest, processing and preservation of local plants to produce jams, pickles, creams, soaps, toothpaste, herbal teas, etc. \r\n\r\nOrganic Growing focuses on organic food production, including composting and irrigation, in Sunseed\u2019s garden terraces, promoting practical self-sufficiency. This offers an educational hands-on experience of food growing using organic garden techniques. \r\n\r\nDrylands Management aims to halt the process of desertification, to replenish the soil by managing and harvesting scarce water resources and implementing planting programmes of indigenous plants, shrubs and tree species. We seek to understand the process of soil degradation through observation of natural ecosystems, and to use this knowledge as the foundation for advising on and applying appropriate practices.\r\n\r\nAppropriate Technology promotes innovation in the use of available technologies to reduce our impact on the environment. Volunteers in this department help to maintain the solar power and water pumping systems, and promote projects in areas such as biogas, solar energy and also water, wind and pedal-powered energy generating machines.\r\n \r\nEco-construction and Maintenance is responsible for the upkeep of the project site and our buildings. A mix of traditional and local ecological building methods and materials are used, such as ca\u00f1a, a type of bamboo growing locally in parts of south Spain. \r\n \r\nCommunication and Education co-ordinates the website, information and educational aspects of Sunseed\u2019s aims across all departments. Volunteers help to produce and to distribute information, research and literature produced by Sunseed, help with translations, open days, courses and developing partnerships and networks and contribute to the website in particular the volunteer stories.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is learning by doing and personal responsibility for yourself, other people and the environment. This is a source of knowledge for many people, especially young people, who after spending sometime in Sunseed, realise that they themselves are agents of change in our society. The various tasks and daily work that we do, from working in the garden to cooking for a group, to public speaking, to developing a project with the help of a coordinator, are factors that motivate and empower the volunteers.

According to Eurostat, \u2018youth unemployment rates are generally double or more than double than the unemployment rates for all ages\u2019. (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics ) In 2014 about 5.1 million YP in EU were out of work, increased from 4.2 million in 2008. (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Labour_markets_at_regional_level) PWFO face daily problems of social integration, differences of culture, difficulty in financing their education and training, and as a result at risk of marginalisation. COPE objectives:- to promote EU values, diversity, social inclusion, inter-cultural and social dialogue;- to fight against long-term work/education/training inactivity;- to connect YP in Europe to Erasmus+ (E+) beneficiaries to exchange good practices, discuss opportunities, - to increase YP participation in community,- to connect YP with job centres and E+ sending/hosting organisations,- to motivate YPWFO to take part in a mobility project. Research (http://ec.europa.eu/youth/tools/documents/evs-impact_en.pdf ; http://www.europemobility.eu/download/Workshops/DIMITRIOU_Workshop_Impact.pdf ; ADICE-Europe Direct Roubaix from Nord-Pas-de-Calais' study) shows that PWFO taking part in a mobility projects become more confident, open-minded, improve their language skills, enhance their employability skills and in consequence, find jobs easier. The partnership is aware that not all YP and especially PWFO are aware of the existence of such projects and proposes  Target group: youth and especially YPWFO. The consortium realises that YPWFO need more/simplified/bespoke training than others to increase their employability skills, prepare for the departure in a mobility project and have equal chances in finding a job. It is also known that PWFO participating in a mobility project are likely to face a \u2018cultural shock\u2019 not only upon arrival in the receiving country, but also in making the transition back to the values of their community at home. Activities and results: To address these needs, the following tools will be created: - An online platform: will gather all the created tools and give YPWFO in Europe the opportunity to connect and exchange good practices, advice, practical information, as well to develop their network and to keep in touch with people after their mobility project. The platform will also be used by the YP to write articles, share photos during their project and testimony, keeping a track of their experience. - EU and European and international mobility grants - making EU and mobility understandable to all YP. - A guide helping YP in their project preparation: the guide will explain practical information (e.g. how to get a European Health Insurance Card), the life cycle of a mobility project and provide a list with links and free online materials (grammar, books, videos, vocabulary) helping the YPto improve their language skills.- Online training materials to enhance YPWFO soft skills and support acquisition (documents, links that people can use to prepare themselves before the departure). Impact: As previous participants and managers of mobility projects are aware, the importance of exchanging knowledge with peers is paramount. Connecting people and offering an online training, will not only develop engagement on E+ projects, but allow them to socialise and exchange on cultural diversity, debate about community subjects, cultural events, methods of working. The platform will also facilitate youth managers work while preparing YP before the departure. The participants will already have an overview and know what to generally expect from their future project. Through this platform they can also get in touch with other people during their project and make the integration easier and avoid the project failure. The partnership expects from this project to increase YPWFO soft skills, to address the lack of information regarding the mobility projects, to increase the number of YP taking part in a mobility project and in the community's activities and to increase their cultural and diversity awareness. On long term, more YP will become more participative, increase their acceptance regarding other culture, will find easier a job and contribute to the economic growth. No maximum/minimum no of participants is imposed. The tools are accessible from a distance and at no costs which makes them available to everybody in Europe and around the world.

These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.\r\n\r\nThese placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person. Participants are supported with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures which organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.\r\nOur partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end. The diversity of the partners allows us to offer a large panel of relevant opportunities to the participants\u2019 needs and careers. Thus, our international strategy aims at offering internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.\r\n\r\nRegarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public.

These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.These placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person.  Applications are thus estimated with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. At the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures who organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.Our partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, etc.) a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end.  The diversity of the partners allows us to answer the majority of the candidates\u2019 needs. Thus, our international strategy aims to offer internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.Regarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Nord-Pas-De-Calais area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is largely exceeding the national rate (12.8%, while 10.0% in metropolitan France, especially for Young people aged from 15 to 24 years old, with a 23.6% unemployment rate, data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2015). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 22% of the local population. With mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.careerchangewales.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA116-023570_5"], [2016, "M\u0142odzie\u017c dla Europy - Europa dla M\u0142odzie\u017cy", "CCW-TRAINING ACADEMY LIMITED", 100435.0, 5, 6, "The \"Youth for Europe - Europe for Youth\" is an innovative project of EFM in the field of education and vocational training graduates of vocationally high schools from the area of Lower Silesia and Opole state.Till this moment, none of the NGO\u2019s in our region did any project regarding internships for graduates in vocationally high schools on these professions: IT technician, epicure, builder, hotelier and selers.Graduates who have completed upper secondary school and begin our training, will stay abroad within a year after graduation.

Our objective is activation of young people towards rising to the occasion of positive change.

It is creative way of project management consisting of four phases: Dreaming (Creating the vision), planning, realization and celebration. Educational process will be supported by experimental project for local community which will serve as a model case for learning. Young people will have opportunity to get project managing skills not only in theoretical but also in practical way. Another aim is exploration and acquisition of self managing skills and development of human talents also in fields of art, handicraft and healthy lifestyle. We expect personal progress of participants in the field of project management achieved by gaining new skills, competences, knowledge and attitudes to be responsible for their personal and also community life.

The participants may include orphans, PWFO and from dis-functioned families, early school leavers, YP who grew up in children homes, who have social difficulties, difficulties in communicating in a foreign language, lack of motivation, low self-esteem, economic difficulties (low income depending on the welfare system), difficulties to integrate into society because of their background, and not able to communicate about their fears or needs). \r\nProject objectives: \r\n1. to reach out marginalised youth and prevent social exclusion amongst young people with fewer opportunities (YPWFO) due to law education/qualification, poverty\r\n2. to help the volunteers to emerge new skills \r\n3. to give youth an alternative to combat long term inactivity\r\n4. to promote diversity, equality and cultural awareness  \r\n5. to increase youth participation in community projects \r\n6. to strengthen youth links with labour market  removing barriers to employment for YPWFO\r\n7. to raise awareness about Erasmus + projects amongst local youth (especially NEETS) through real life example - young people like them motivated to improve and discover new cultures. \r\n\r\nOutcomes and impact: The project will offer the  participants the opportunity to mix with other people and cultures, develop personal and professional network, combating isolation, change attitude and perspective towards new and unfamiliar; have a better view of their future career opportunity with confidence; increase self-esteem, gain employability transferable skills, reduce long term inactivity, develop cultural awareness, gain a sense of active citizenship and develop the tools to become an active European and global citizen, develop social awareness and solidarity as well as other human values and tolerance, acquire and develop civic, social and emotional competencies, through contact with the local community and with the host organisations staff, develop working capacities and values: group work, collaboration, interdependence; Erasmus awareness, understand commitment and reliability. As per the  European Economic and Social Committee ECO/343 Statistical tools for measuring volunteering document Point 1/1.1.1, volunteering is 'an important driver of inclusive growth, which contributes to both social and human capital, and fosters intergenerational solidarity, while also offering significant economic value'. LAW expects to impact within this project framework both participants, communities and economies.\r\n\r\nMethodology: the project itself, as well as each mobility project are composed by several steps: preparation (with the stakeholders and of the volunteers), implementation (of the mobility project and the design activities), monitoring (the activities and the volunteers participation and integration), evaluation (of the project and of the volunteers achievements, measure impact) and follow-up (of the volunteers). The learning methodology is based on group and individual tasks, training, evaluation, reflection, activities inducting informal and non-formal learning: group discussions, presentations, workshops, games. \r\n\r\nThe activities will be tailored according to the volunteers needs and capacities, including team working and computer tasks, presentations about EVS and their culture, research and development.", "http://languageacademywales.com", "Language Academy Wales", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035288_coordinator"], [2016, "The William Theatre", "Language Academy Wales", 11418.0, 5, 5, "\"The William Theatre\" project was a youth exchange between 16 and 2\t5 years old youngsters, that took place in the\r\nmunicipality of Molfetta (Italy), located on the Adriatic coast.

This is mainly due to the diversity of the adult learning sector and the diversity of the professional pathways to becoming an adult learning professional. The need for the safeguarding and improvement of the professional quality of Learning Facilitators in Adult and Continuing Education (ACE) is ongoing as the demands of the society change rapidly along with its demographics. Adult learning staff have a key role in facilitating lifelong learning experiences and thus, their professional development is one of the vital measures to improve quality of adult learning. As competences are context bound, it is therefore necessary to take the context in which professionals are working into account.The Lifelong learning at Open Air Museums: Improving Competences of Adult Learning Facilitators at European Open Air Museums (LOAM) project addresses adult learning and competences development for museum personnel at four Open Air museums in Sweden. It unfolds in a systematic attempt to explore how museums can become better adult learning providers and facilitators, and how can we ensure high quality provision? How to address better the diverse range of adults we receive nowadays? How to become and remain relevant to these adults?In collaboration with three receiving organisations in the UK and Norway, LOAM will give the opportunity to 24 participants from Sweden to meet staff who are involved in similar activities but in a different context. Through the collaboration and exchange of practices, knowledge and skills among the partners, LOAM aims at improving the competences of adult learning facilitators at six open air museums in three European countries. Each partner is carefully selected on the basis of the competences and services that they have developed through the years. All four Swedish museums are members of the Swedish Association of Open Air museums, and have longstanding commitment and collaboration with each other. Each organisation has specific competences that will benefit the work carried out by the rest of the partner organisations. The aim of the project is to initiate a process of continuous professional development for museum staff by joining up eight partners in three countries that contribute to lifelong and informal learning. The project will provide opportunities to share skills, approaches and expertise between these adult learning providers and thus, cement a truly joined-up lifelong learning movement. The key aim of the project is for staff members from all participating museums to improve competences on how to reach audiences based on the specific competences of the staff in for example crafts or farming.Colleagues from all partners together will hone their competences and develop their skills and knowledge. The insight and lessons learned will inform best practice guidelines for reaching and facilitating adult audiences. There could be a final course in Norway for two days during which the participants from Sweden will be instructed by NCK into using the Generic Learning Outcomes (GLOs) to assess their learning outcomes. The Generic Learning Outcomes are underpinned by a broad definition of learning which identifies benefits that people gain from interacting with arts and cultural organisations.The project develops within two years and includes both job shadowing, and a structured course in Trondheim, Norway.  During these 24 months, there will be two major mobilities at three different organisations in two countries. The partners (both sending and receiving) will identify the key areas of expertise and the members of staff responsible for carrying these out. The line manager together with the leader of the project will decide which employees will be selected after inviting them to express interest in mobilities. The selections will be in line with the area of expertise of the receiving organisations. Negotiations and practical arrangements will be finalised at least four months in advance of a proposed activity. All participants will compile a written report before, during and after their participation.   It would be essential that participants learn together and that for example the Swedish participants offer to disseminate the results to colleagues from other open air museums in Sweden.

These 8 are across wales and the collections cover earth and natural sciences, fine and applied art and the archaeology, industrial and social history of Wales. Our aim is to be a world class museum of learning. We have over 1.5 million visitors a year with 435,000 learners.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans National History Museum combines on one site functions which are generally delivered by separate institutions: the cultural learning experiences of a heritage site, an open-air museum of translocated historic buildings, gallery exhibitions, as well as the national archive of Welsh oral testimony. Over the next decade, the aim is to make St Fagans the most important centre for the enjoyment, understanding and study of the lives of peoples of Wales, from prehistory to the present day. The fundamental aim is to become a participatory museum which will allow us to get better the more people get involved.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans has established a partnership with Jamtli Foundation in Sweden, which similarly to St Fagans, is an open air museum with historic buildings and exhibitions as well as livestock. During the busy summer months Jamtli transform the site into a 'theme park' where 'actors' animate each building bringing them to life. St Fagans recognise that this process of operating in different modes is one from which we can learn. A Memorandum of Understanding has been drawn up between the two organisations and a  programme of job shadowing staff exchanges has been committed to.\r\n\r\nBoth organisations recognise that traditionally non learning focused roles can in fact provide a rich learning experience to the visitor. For example rather than closing an historic building for cleaning it may be possible to keep the building open so the visitor can observe the cleaning process. The member of staff can engage with the visitor explaining the task which they are undertaking. This is a learning experience which may be of interest and enriching to the visitor, but which at present is not available. Through the process of considering what staff roles may be able to interact with the public, to share their experiences in a coherent learning focused way,  it is imperative to consider the skills that the staff member may have. For example the cleaner, whilst confident in their abilities in the duties, may feel less confident relaying the importance of the task to the general public. \r\n\r\nThis process of understanding that all members of staff are able to engage with the visitor and increase their learning and awareness has lead to the Sharing and Learning project. Both organisations recognise that some staff will need to be upskilled to have the confidence to share their work duties and their importance with the visitors. The establishment of a job shadowing exchange project will boost the confidence of participants and enthuse them to consider how they can incorporate learning elements into various aspects of the work. This confidence and enthusiasm will cascade through the organisation as they consider potential development opportunities to provide excellent learner engagements.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans National History Museum and Jamtli Foundation are seeking funding for the Sharing and Learning project which will allow 15 staff members from Wales to visit Sweden, during 4 visits, over the course of 2 years. The project will allow staff to experience how a similar museum within Europe operates, giving them the opportunity to consider how to incorporate learning into all elements of the museum's work, and share best practice whilst contemplating the museums role within Europe and wider.", "http://www.museumwales.ac.uk", "National Museum Wales", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA104-013343_coordinator"], [2015, "Sharing and Learning", "National Museum Wales", 13790.0, 2, 2, "Jamtli Foundation in \u00d6stersund, Sweden, is a museum organisation that focuses on lifelong learning.  The main establishment is a museum that is also named Jamtli and has approx. 200 000 visits every year. There is an indoor museum with exhibitions and a big open air museum with old buildings, parks, and animals - for example horses, cows and sheep.  In the summer the outdoor museum is transformed into a successful theme park, where the old buildings are animated with actors who roleplay through first person interpretation the actual people who have lived in the houses.  The roleplay is Jamtli\u00b4s signature method for learning for  the school programmes and familiy activities throughout the year.  Jamtli also runs historical farming, has a large collection of historical items, arts and photographs. Jamtli  Foundation also provides the services of building curators and archaeologists  and is the general owner of three joint-stock companies based on cultural heritage in other parts of the Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen. The Foundation is also general owner of NCK, The Nordic Centre for Heritage Learning and Creativity, their remit is research on cultural heritage activities across Europe.\r\n\r\nFor about a decade, there has been contacts between Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen and Welsh Government and also between the museum organisations in the regions.  Through this relationship it became apparent that we could learn a lot from each organisation and this led to the idea of a mobility pilot project between the two regions.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed and National Museum Wales and Jamtli Foundation agreed to send staff on job shadowing and exchanges for five years.   With this project, Sharing and Learning, we are applying for funding support for the first two years of staff exchanges. Our focus is on increasing the number of learning experiences and opportunities within our two museums.\r\nIn both museum organisations, there are occupational groups that traditionally don\u00b4t work with learning. It\u00b4s groups like receptionists, janitors and household technicians, people who work with the collections, animal keepers, photographers and marketing staff.  However these groups do have contact with the visitors, and we would like to make better use of those contacts. Through job shadowing we want to make it possible for Jamtli staff to visit colleagues at National Museum Wales and identify a number of situations where they actually meet and interact with visitors. How can they transform these moments, that may be limited to a tender stroke of a horseneck or a brief question about where the nearest park bench is into a learning situation?\r\n\r\nDuring the project time of 24 months we want to perform 15 mobilities at four different occasions, with the occupational groups mentioned above.  We want the line manager closest to the employees , together with the leader of the project, to decide which employees could be most adequate for a staff exchange.  We would contact the National Museum Wales at least four months in advance of a proposed visit and they let Jamtli know if they can welcome colleauges at the proposed date. Then the employees make contact with eachother by e-mail or phone, and raise common questions. What kind of opportunities with visitors will be available?\r\n\r\nDuring the visit, the Jamtli staff write a diary and also follow up on the common questions. Together, the staff from Wales and J\u00e4mtland discuss how meetings with visitors can be transformed into learning situations. How can the tasks be communicated to different groups of visitors - children, old, disabled, people who speak another language? Can you invite visitors to take part in the work tasks? When the staff returns home, they go through the diaries with their line manager, a learning officer and the project leader. Together they agree upon a few learning activities that can be tested at Jamtli.  These test activities will be evaluated within 2-3 months and if the results are good, the activity will become a permanent learning activity and part of our programme.  The results of the exchange will also become a part of a report and a presentation given of the project. The presentation is published on Jamtli\u00b4s website and is also presented to Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen and the owners of NCK.\r\n\r\nThere are several impacts and long term benefits of the project. The most important effect is that learning become a vital part of other museum departments not only of the learning department. The visitor should not be forced to take a guided tour to come across new knowledge - the learning should be found all over the museum, and every employee should be able to feel self secure, proud and happy to share his or her knowledge with others. Another effect of the project is that the pedagogical focus of National Museum Wales and Jamtli Foundation will make the two institutions more well-known, which will lead to more visitors and through that - more learning.", "http://www.museumwales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA104-012003_1"]]}}, "3NQ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1441065600000, 1598832000000, "Strengthening International Research Capacity in Wales", "Welsh Assembly Government", "Scientists in Wales are efficient, productive, collaborative, impactful and in many cases world leading.

Concentrating initially on the Welsh Dyfi Biosphere Reserve, we will develop a citizens\u2019 observatory framework, and then validate the work within the context of the UK National Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and internationally, within the WNBR; specifically, within Greek and German Reserves. The infrastructure we develop will exploit technological developments in ubiquitous mobile devices, crowd-sourcing of geographic information and the operationalising of standards based SDI such as the UK Location Information Infrastructure. It will enable citizens living within Biosphere Reserves to collect environmental information on a range of parameters including species distribution, flooding and land cover/use. A main driver will be the opportunity to participate in environmental governance. Data quality issues will be addressed by using networks of \u201cpeople as sensors\u201d and by analysing observations and measurements in real-time combination with authoritative models and datasets. The citizen\u2019s observatory framework will integrate with evolving INSPIRE compliant national SDI\u2019s and allow the fusion of citizen sourced data with reference data from public authorities in support of policy objectives. To maximise impact, COBWEB will work within the processes of the standards defining organisations. Specifically, we will aim to improve the usability of Sensor Web Enablement standards with mobile devices, develop widespread acceptance of the data quality measures we develop and maximise the commercial appeal of COBWEB outputs. The end result we are aiming for is a toolkit and a set of models that demonstrably works in different European countries and which is accepted as a core information system component of the WNBR.

It could refer to anywhere in the care chain depending on the priorities as identified in a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) within this project. Conceptual, methodological and empirical advancement will be achieved through 4 meta-questions that will instruct research under the ERA-NET, linking to what counts as good models of care, what are the conditions required for transferability, what are the conditions for up-scaling, and how do they contribute to the performance of health care organisations and systems.\nB) We will build a platform for funding organizations that allows for collaboration and coordination in the project and projected ERA-NET. This will synchronize priorities and activities, hence improving the quality and applicability of research with a focus on the topic areas as described under A.\nTO-REACH will pursue five specific objectives: Mapping health system challenges and priorities by synthesizing different materials and stakeholder inputs; Developing a framework and providing a knowledge synthesis on the above-mentioned meta-questions; Establishing sustainable cooperation of research funding bodies and links with other initiatives; Developing a SRA through agenda setting at European and Member State level; Disseminating the results of TO-REACH.", 44469.0, 1780898.0, 19, 29, "TO-REACH", null, null, null, "h2020_207228_998043380"], [1220227200000, 1346371200000, "European Research NEtwork on Sustainable Tourism", "Welsh Assembly Government", "The ERNEST \u201cEuropean Research Network on Sustainable Tourism\u201d project will address the issue of sustainable development in tourism through coordination and collaboration among regional research programmes.

The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and water distribution network, then tested at an intermediate level in a full-scale experimental facility in France (AQUASIM) before being finally installed, monitored and evaluated in two pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK (Cardiff - Wales) and Italy (La Spezia).<br/>These demonstrators will be used to assess the societal, environmental and economic benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout all countries and differing European areas. The major resultant impact from WISDOM will be (a) increased user awareness and modified behaviours concerning the use of water, (b) quantifiable and significant reduction of water consumption, (c) peak-period reduction of water and energy distribution loads, (d) improved resource efficiency and business operations of water utilities due to ICT, and (e) contribute to the improvement of the environmental performance of buildings. In addition, WISDOM will promote the development of a complete value chain covering all stakeholders in the water usage cycle including the establishment of strategic partnerships between ICT equipment providers, software companies and water authorities to pave the way to a Europe wide, and beyond, exploitation of the WISDOM technology.", 132087.0, 3445150.0, 5, 13, "WISDOM", null, "http://www.cardiff.gov.uk", null, "fp7_189138_967094463"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Not in Education, Employment, or Training - a challenge for Europe", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", 380613.0, 4, 14, "The Strategic Framework for Education and Training (ET 2020) for Europe has at its core the important target of reducing the number of young people leaving school early that become Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).

Employment opportunities will change  as the use of digital skills increases with rapid developments in technology.Our project is based on the evidence that although students are overall improving their results in external tests, when students leave school many do not have the necessary skills to prepare them for future employment opportunities and life skills.  Many students also feel that while they are prepared for taking part in examinations they do not  have the skills to take responsibility for their own learning and become lifelong learners and that some lessons do not prepare them for post school experiences. Education & Training 2020 identifies that at school level there are still too many students that leave school early and/or do not have the competencies required for 21st century future employment. While overall standards of teaching in many schools is good there are still too many instances where the quality of teaching falls below the expected requirements.

The region (approx. 500.000 inhabitants) faces challenges concerning climate and energy, sustainable development, access to a skilled and competent labour force, innovation and development in the economic sector. As school owner HCC has committed to use the schools as local resource centres for economic and local development (Regional Development programme 2013). HCC is continuously working to adapt education and training to fit the needs of the region, and to prevent early school leaving (dropouts) (Action Plan for Internationalisation in Education 2014). These objectives are to a large extent in correspondence with the EU\u2019s 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. HCC is using participation in Erasmus+ Mobility as a strategic tool to reach these objectives, in close cooperation with priority partners: Vocational education and training, private sector, local authorities and civil society. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project are to strengthen the region with professional knowledge, skills and competences adapted to the needs in different sectors, develop prosperous local communities, and improve learning outcomes for pupils, increase recruitment, prevent early school leaving and raise awareness in VET schools for internationalisation \u201cat home\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants: 230 VET learners/staff, 56 accompanying persons and 138 adult education staff (professionals).\r\n\r\nHCC is the coordinator for the project and has extensive experience in project cooperation and management in different EU projects e.g. the Life Long Learning and Interreg programmes, and is well qualified to carry out this project.

There are increasing numbers of skilled workers who now face unemployment, at the same time there is a gap between skills and the needs on the labour market. These challenges require restructuring and flexible solutions that demand more relevant and competent professional expertise and competences, new and innovative methods as well as an increasing need for more relevant vocational education and training.International cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.HCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2016-18 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between VET and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.HCC has been an active user of mobility programmes, and has sent a large number of VET pupils on mobilities every year. This year we also aspired, and worked strategically to increase the number of participants within staff mobility.By including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long term competence development. Teachers from work committees for vocational specific programmes (FAU), working across several schools, have also been included in this application. This will strengthen professional skills and competences, as well as being an important contributor in the dissemination of results. This year we have also made an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Giving mentors the opportunity to take part in a work placement together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. Sustainable development requires international cooperation across sectors, administrative levels and disciplines. There is a need to gain knowledge and insight into the disciplines that future businesses will require. The project has therefore placed emphasis on developing interdisciplinary group mobilities. It will increase the expertise and networks across different sectors, enhance value creation and innovation, facilitate better use of regional advantages and enhance restructuring to greener jobs. An example involving technology is a group from Nordhordaland (vocational school, business and municipality) that intends to visit Denmark to further develop the industrial foundation in Mongstad in a greener and more progressive direction.In this, and future projects, HCC will work more systematically to increase the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force.

Participating teachers will receive comprehensive training on how they can embed creativity across the curriculum and how by improving their own skills in delivering creativity they can raise standards across all subjects but especially in literacy, numeracy and digital competences.   As part of our dissemination and sustainability plans we will train participating teachers to coach others in order to embed creativity across the curriculum in their own setting but also teachers from a wider group of schools, locally, nationally and internationally.  Creative Arts (overarching description of any activity such as drama, music, graphic arts, performing arts, film, visual arts etc.) is increasingly being recognized as an effective tool for working with young people and to give them a means to express themselves openly. Creative Arts is an effective tool to empower all  students including those with behavioural or mental health problems through creativity.  It is a form of expression that improves and enhances physical and emotional wellbeing through reconciling emotional conflicts and fostering self awareness.

In addition to promoting the mobility of teachers and the internationalization of schools, involving schools and teachers in European programs and deepening the strategic framework Education and Training 2020 and its document Rethinking Education to identify improvement policies in schools.\r\nWith this objective we have designed a training action that includes 28 teachers from the region with a profile of teachers motivated by innovation through the STEAM methodology and who have a command of the English language that allows them to follow this training in an international context.\r\nThe activities to be carried out are a one-week course in which they will experience the Welsh school reality and they will observe experiences of schools with STEAM combined with visits to schools in Cardiff to observe good practices.\r\nThe methodology that we have followed to design this project starts from the annual detection of needs that we carry out among the entire school community in which there is a demand for training in innovation with STEAM and in internationalization. An online survey has been carried out, taking into account the principles of previous experience, but also giving the opportunity to centers that have not internationalized their management to join programs such as Erasmus. In this selection, the domain of the language in which the training will be carried out has been taken into account, requiring a minimum level of B2.\r\nAmong the results we expect, the most important is the training of teachers in STEAM methodology to join the improvement of educational quality and contribute to the development of the skills and competencies needed for the 21st century (creativity, innovation, teamwork, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship and problem solving) in a very practical and fun way, creating an innovative culture and increasing the number of professionals in sectors of science and technology at the same time that we develop their European dimension.\r\nThe contents developed in the training in Wales will serve to increase the training possibilities in the training activities in the region and the experience will be disseminated in the annual Erasmus days and in the activities related to STEAM.\r\nWith this project we hope to advance the objectives of the 2020 Strategy on the promotion of scientific-technological vocations and achievement of learning thresholds.

Regarding the aspect of personal development, artistic methods are very powerful as they give an opportunity for self- discovery.

Participants are not only diverse from a geographical and cultural perspective, but also regarding their aims and target groups. \r\n\r\nThe project will take place from the 17th until the 23rd of September 2017 in Sale San Giovanni in Italy and will be facilitated by a team of experienced trainers in the field of PP. The course will offer the participants to experience and practice with PP and provide opportunities for youth workers to enhance their competencies (knowledge, skills and attitudes) to create stimulating circumstances that promote personal development of their youth through the use of elements of PP. There is a specific focus on the practical implementation of the acquired competences. During the course, participants will be encouraged and facilitated to develop their own customized programs within the PP framework which they can use in their daily youth work in their own organization and to develop new collaborations with other participating organizations on a European level. It also offers the participants an opportunity to improve the quality of their youth work by learning from the experiences of different European cultures in youth work and different ways to encourage the personal development and active participation of the youth they work with. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project are: \r\n- To develop participants' competences (knowledge, skills and attitudes) and methodologies to improve the quality of their youth work; \r\n- To provide participants with tools and exercises to implement the elements of positive psychology in their youth work; \r\n- To increase a broader understanding among participants on the practices of youth work across Europe and increase the level of understanding of intercultural differences in this sector.\r\n- To establish and provide participants with a network opportunity to increase the internationalization of their youth work (within the framework of Erasmus+).  \r\n\r\nParticipants will be prepared through e-learning, to ensure a common basic level at the start of the course. During the course the participants will be facilitated in their experiential learning process through the use of non-formal educational methods such as discussions, simulations, work in small groups, world cafe. The participants will always first experience the topics through exercises, to ensure an understanding of the topic on an intuitive level. Next participants will be taught how to implement the elements of PP and learn to design high quality PP-projects that will stimulate personal growth of youth. There is a specific attention for after care. Participants will receive feedback on the implementation of their designed PP-projects by the facilitators at one and three months after the course through Skype conversations. We envisage that this will ensure that participants will be successful in applying the acquired competences into the practice of their youth work. \r\n\r\nWe expect the course to empower the youth workers and to give them the self-esteem to be able to implement the elements of PP into the youth work of their organizations. By means of following this course, the participants, and their organizations will be able to design good quality projects to promote personal development that will enhance the well-being of their target groups. The course will also increase the level of internationalization of youth work of the organizations by designing new cooperations for the future.", "http://www.cwvys.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-NL02-KA105-001774_4"], [2016, "Democracy in Europe: Patterns of Inclusion and Exclusion", "The Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services", 14190.0, 10, 10, "The Training Course \"Democracy in Europe: Patterns of Inclusion and Exclusion\" raises awareness of our own behaviors that are exclusive and inclusive, within the context of societal issues based on these values, namely the Refugee crisis in Europe.  The project takes the refugee situation in Europe as the context for which such values could be discussed, based on the policies of differing countries in Europe on how to handle the incoming refugees, as well as attitudes of the local population.  In addition to an examination of the current situation, the experiential and interactive activities in this training course shed light on our own practices of inclusion and exclusion within a small group.  Perhaps it is easier to hold up our values when speaking in theory, but in actuality, there are far deeper and more complex dilemmas in ourselves to discover.  This discovery allows for a greater empathy, as it no longer puts a conflicting line between our moral positions.  It allows for an examination of needs, especially in a conflict, so as to realize that my need in one situation might be yours in another.The objectives of this project are as follows:- To become aware of the mechanism of exclusion in ourselves- To see how this mechanism of exclusion is projected in society today, especially in Europe- To explore what we can do to make conditions more inclusive in our own communities- To become aware of the minorities of Europe and the relationship between majorities and minorities.- To use interactive activities to learn non-formally through the experience.There will be 22 participants and 3 trainers for this project, and they will come from 10 countries across Europe.  The training course will take place in Aghveran, Armenia, in a training facility outside of Yerevan, allowing for a focused discussion into these topics.  Participants will be diverse in age, and will include those with fewer opportunities, either who have never left their countries, or have what would be considered a lower socio-economic status.  There will also be a conscious effort to make the training gender balanced.The activities taking place will run over 6 days, with 2 travel days before and after.  The methodology will primarily be interactive, task-based activities, where the participants explore a certain topic, or engage in a task (in small groups), and then come back to plenary to reflect together.  The role of the trainers is to ask questions which might bring up some dilemmas, to encourage them to open up questions, rather than hold onto answers and opinions.  As the week goes on, participants become more open and free to express themselves, and this also means that conflict may occur.  There will also be a conflict resolution methodology used to allow them to connect to their needs and increase their empathy.  The result is a greater awareness of themselves and how they affect others, as well as an ability to see beyond arguments and into the each other's needs. They also compare this to the greater societal issues now relevant (i.e. the Refugee crisis) and can understand more about society and their role in it.The long term benefits include an ability to contribute to society through each person's grown sense of responsibility that they access through this training course.

Because of that, it presents a genuine base for a long-term strategic partnership which will ensure exchange of practices among youth, research organisations and institutions involved in the project.\r\nThe aim of the project is to initiate and develop an advocacy agenda on necessity of developing quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth. Youth organisations gathered in this partnership, with the support of the research partner tend to advocate together on the EU level, within a large platform of youth organisations (YFJ). This way they will encourage creation of Europe-wide quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth, which will, finally, contribute to more effective youth policies at the European and national level, as an overall idea behind the proposed project. By engaging NYCs from several EU countries in this advocacy process on the EU level, as organisations representing thousands of young people all over the EU, this strategic partnership will directly influence on stimulating the active\r\nparticipation of young people in EU policy making.\r\nProject will be implemented through following activities: (1) Mapping of key issues in developing and implementing youth policy strategic documents from perspective of NYCs in order to prepare adequate module for the (2) NYC capacity building training, which will give project partners necessary skills and knowledge for (3) development of advocacy tool which will be communicated with relevant stakeholders through (4) consultations with national bodies in charge of youth, to collect their opinions on the recommendations stated in the advocacy paper and to secure their support in the later stage of the process where concrete recommendations should be implemented. After this (5) advocacy process towards the YFJ will be initiated through presentation the project on the thematic square during the YFJ\u2019s General Assembly and through advocacy on official adoption of the created advocacy paper. After the presentation of the advocacy paper to the YFJ membership, (6) Follow-up meeting on planning future actions will be organized as last official activity of the project. Depending on the outcome of the advocacy process, project partners\r\nwill discuss and suggest follow up steps.\r\nTwo major results are to be achieved by implementing this activities: (R1) advocacy agenda on quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth will be developed by and accepted within a large platform of youth organisations (YFJ) and (R2) capacities of national youth councils from the EU countries will be strengthened to create and monitor concrete national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth.\r\n \r\nResults applied on member organisations of the YFJ, representatives of the national bodies in charge of youth policy within the states from which NYCs involved in project are coming and representatives of the EU and Council of Europe bodies in charge of youth as three target groups which are to be addressed by this activity plan will achieve following impacts:\r\n(1)  It will strengthened and empower the representatives of the project partner organisations\r\n(2)  It will raise awareness of other YFJ member organisation on the necessity of youth advocacy within the area of policy development\r\n(3)  It will raise the awareness of the representatives of bodies in charge of youth policy development on both levels (those on national and those on EU) on the necessity to secure better monitoring of the effects of youth policies on national and EU level  \r\n(4)  The implementation of a unique quality assurance standards for strategic and programme documents in the field of youth will start in different European countries\r\n(5)  Easier monitoring of the effects of youth policy will be possible and thus will give clearer insight into what are the real perspectives of the currently implementing policy solutions in this field.\r\nThe sustainability of this action has great potential, especially in the institutional sense, because of the fact that its results will have strong effect on easier and more quality work of different national, EU and CoE responsible bodies.

The exchange will last eight days. Ten youths from each country will participate, five girls and five boys, aged 13-17 years. In addition there will be a male and female leader from each country.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase understanding and awareness around\r\n-\thow we communicate and how we can communicate to open up for constructive dialogue and to not create conflict\r\n-\thow the way we communicate on can help to raise others and give others a better self-understanding and safety on them selves and their own value.\r\n-\tHow communication responds to health and well-being/self-esteem.\r\n-\tThe worth of knowing other cultures\r\n-\tMake contacts and friendships across borders in Europe\r\n-\tOwn culture\r\n-\tTo be Europeans\r\n\r\nAlso we obviously want to dare to speak more English and experience that we get better in language. And grow in ourselves, get safer, dare to speak in meetings, support others and to be better role models. \r\n\r\nWe are going to work with theatre as a method and learn about nonviolent communication. We will learn from a theatre instructor and from each other. The participants must be active through concrete participation, observation, listening, dialogue and reflection. The idea is that though a common experience we will build a bigger understanding for whom we are, for what and how we communicate and what this does with ourselves and others.\r\n\r\nThrough this exchange, participants should ascuire a greater understanding of what juvenile life is like in another part of Europe and in this process become more aware of their own culture.

We aim to increase understanding, build pride and aliminate fear of other peoples through knowledge and hands-on understanding of nonviolent communication. \r\n\r\nOur goal: Bringing youths from Spain, Wales and Norway together allows them to get first-hand knowledge as well as getting to know each other. This creates a great understanding for culture and haritage as well as promoting democratic thought, independent of political borders, in Europe.

However, some disadvantaged groups of young people face exclusion in the longer term for reasons beyond the current crisis. Remaining outside the global labor market has far-reaching consequences \u2013 not solely economic. These include a loss of confidence, an undermining of trust and expectations, and an increasing risk of social exclusion and disengagement from society. \r\n\r\nApart from the economical crisis there are other issues and dangers that affect youth generation and lead to political crisis. Global threats such as terroristic attacks and armed conflicts caused a huge refugee and migration wave in Europe. These and many other factors stipulate increasing of intolerance, xenophobia, violence, conflicts oriented by cultural fears, numerous stereotypes and prejudices, intercultural misunderstanding, inability to think critically and lack of intercultural competence in general. Young people are more than others affected by those issues, especially being in a situation of current economic crisis.  They feel afraid, they are frustrated, they don\u2019t know what to feel and how to react, as a result they became either inactive or join the extremist movements, and they definitely need to be supported in this hard situation by adults, by peers, by educational institution, by NGOs and by policy makers.\r\n\r\nTackling youth unemployment, social exclusion, intercultural communication and youth participation continues to be a policy priority for European and national governments, but the need to empower young people are increasingly recognized in this process.

The internet has given us the possibility, in theory, to communicate with almost any other person in the world; it has even made it possible, in theory, for one thought in a back room in a small and unknown corner of the world to be picked up by every other person! Everyone with access to the internet is now both publisher and public speaker. Few, it seems, can interfere with what we want to say. This is a novelty that few would want reversed, but it should not surprise us that the ever-expanding world of online interaction has also come to reflect and feed back into many of the difficulties that human beings have historically encountered in their \u2018real\u2019 existence. Intolerance and \u2018hate\u2019 have been a feature of human society almost since time began. A number of studies have identify an increase in these attitudes over recent years. The problem is that if there is less tolerance of differences, and if the constraints on that intolerance are not watched, then intolerance \u2013 and hate \u2013 will find expression, both in the things that people do and in the things they say. The internet has opened up new ways of saying things, and it has opened up new avenues to say them to more people. The constraints, however, on what we can say online are far fewer than those which exist off-line: we can say things over the Internet that we would not dare to say in public in the \u2018real\u2019 world. If hate speech offline is a problem that societies have recognised, and found the need to address, is online hate speech something that we can ignore? Of course not.\r\nYoung people are already suffering from online hate speech:\r\n \u2022 Across Europe, 6% of 9 to 16-year-old Internet users reported having been bullied online, and 3% confessed to having bullied others.\r\n\u2022 16% of young Internet users in Europe say they have posted comments on the Internet that were hateful towards a person or group of people.\r\n \u2022 78% of the respondents of an online survey stated they had encountered hate speech online on a regular basis.

In fact, more than a million migrants and refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, sparking a crisis as countries struggled to cope with the influx and with integration issues. By now, the \u201cEU response to the refugee crisis has been chaotic and divisive, characterized by squabbling over sharing responsibility, cascading border closures and finger-pointing. (\u2026) And recent events in Paris and Brussels have interjected fear of terrorism into the mix.\u201d (J. Sunderland, Associate Director, Europe and Central Asia Division - Human Rights Watch). Historically, however, the EU has a long record of migrations and European societies have been dealing with increasing diversity for years, in such a way that we may all consider ourselves as \u201cmigrants\u201d. Yet, with the last year trends in migration flows, opinion and political debates all over Europe have been increasingly shaped by concerns about cultural identity, social cohesion, security, access to public services, crime and employment, always largely focusing on the immigrant population as a stereotyped and generalized \u201cwhole\u201d. To make things worst, the European Union does not require any particular integration approach. The EU Common Basic Principles (2004) define integration as \u201ca dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States\u201d. But actual national and regional policies have too often tended toward coercive integration (such as discriminatory measures such as religious-dress bans in France, Belgium and parts of Italy and Spain). As J. Sunderland underlines, \u201cmany of those who have risked their lives to reach Europe this year will have strong motivation to do what they can to rebuild their lives in their new homes. But integration policies that require people to shed fundamental aspects of their identity are unlikely to succeed. Sustainable integration should aim at giving migrants a real stake in their new home, encouraging participation rather than exclusion, while requiring full adherence to laws and respect for the rights of others.\u201d This perspective is included not only in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.In this sense, guided by its principles and values, PROJECT2020 and its partners believe that the starting point of any sustainable integration policy should be the respect for migrants and refugees as individuals, with their own stories, dreams and competences. We feel that youth organizations and European youth can have a great role in addressing this gap. By meeting the refugees/migrants and collecting their stories (needs, dreams, fears, personal stories, journeys, expectations, goals, hopes, competences, skills, contributions), they can provide the host population with accurate and fair information about who refugees are and what are the benefits of welcoming them in the local community, promoting therefore an inclusive and tolerant society, able to recognize and value personal talents and to empower and integrate them. Aims and general objectives will be, therefore, to develop and promote a new positive narrative of inclusion, giving the chance to young europeans and young migrants to meet and share their stories (their journeys) in order to match them with the needs of the communities they live in. Specific objectives will be: - To contribute to migrants and refugees integration- To promote intercultural dialogue and learning- To promote inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding / fight generalization, racism and stereotypes- To promote a change of perception towards migration and refugees- To analyze the migrants\u2019 background, the migration flows and reasons behind it- To avoid generalization and promote \u201creal life encounters\u201d / to meet refugees and collect their stories - To raise awareness on the feelings, hopes, needs, fears, dreams, expectations, competences and skills of migrants/refugees and on their positive contribution to local communities- To develop strategies to match community needs and migrants\u2019 storiesThe project also foresees the following expected results: - A final publication/book in which thoughts, reflections stories of migrations developed as \u201cmodern fairy-tales\u201d will be presented- Promotion of the concept of \u201ccommunity match\u201d, defined as the opportunity to match the stories, skills and knowledge of the migrants with the needs and opportunities of the community they live in- A social campaign aiming at changing the perception and view of local communities towards migrants and refugeesThe project will involve 28 young people and 7 youth workers/facilitators from 7 countries in one APV (to be held in september 2016), a youth exchange in Cardiff - UK (to be held at the end of september/beginning of october 2016) and a youth exchange in Thessaloniki - Greece (november 2016).", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024694_coordinator"], [2017, "T4T - Intercultural learning and beyond!

And it is soon becoming a fundamental feature of modern societies. Intercultural learning was tentatively defined in different studies and conclusions during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) as a process \"that comprises an open and respectful exchange or interaction between individuals, groups and organizations with different cultural backgrounds or world views; whereas among its aims are: to develop a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and practices; to increase participation and the freedom and ability to make choices; to foster equality; and to enhance creative processes\" (European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2016 on the role of intercultural dialogue, cultural diversity and education in promoting EU fundamental values - 2015/2139(INI)).\r\nICL helps youth to better comprehend cultures in modern societies and respect them. It reinforces the communication between people from different cultures and stimulates social interaction. It also helps young people recognize the cultural diversity and recognize the common heritage of humanity. It is therefore a key competence in order to read and adapt to the challenges that Europe is now facing, referring in particular to a generic crisis of values and references and to the continuous influx of migrants and refugees. \r\nHowever, as educators, youth workers and organizers of youth events and activities at the local and at the european level, we feel that this dimension, so important and fundamental, is often given for granted in these projects or it's diminished in what is usually called \"the intercultural night\". We fear this is not how true ICL can be fostered and promoted, we see instead the risk that these practices of competing to present our own countries as touristic offices could be counterproductive, nourishing young people nationalism and radicalism. Therefore, we think it's the moment to act and to go beyond intercultural learning, by experimenting new tools and approaches (I-LAB)!! \r\nWe want, together, to renew our educational approach to ICL: we live in the first globalized society, where everything and everyone is interconnected and where stereotypes are everywhere... but to understand and internalize true ICL we need explanations, debriefings, debates and what we call a \"human touch\". We are all (all our members, educators, trainers, youth workers, volunteers) feeling this need and we are all eager to contribute to the innovation process. The aim of our project is therefore to develop a new innovative approach to ICL and to consequently equip youth trainers, youth workers, organizers and volunteers with the necessary competences, knwoledge and practical tools to foster a human and true intercultural dimension in all the projects they deliver (especially the ones under the E+ framework and especially those addressing refugees and migrants). \r\nThe specific objectives of the course are:\r\nto start a shared and dynamic lab aimed at creating innovative methodologies and tools for intercultural dialogue and learning, with a specific attention to the inclusion and integration processes of young refugees and migrants in the local communities and in the youth organizations\r\nto contribute to the professional and personal development and to improve the competences of the youth workers and educators of partner organizations, providing tools, knowledge and skills useful to face the need for intercultural dialogue among young people and their communities\r\nto contribute to improve quality in youth work, at the local and european level, keeping into consideration the changes and challenges of today\u2019s society as for the inclusion and integration of young people with different cultural backgrounds\r\nto contribute to fight radicalization and xenophobia among young europeans and local communities, providing with opportunities of intercultural dialogue and real and true encounters\r\nIn this way, we will train active multipliers able to intervene at the local level and to develop new events, raising social awareness towards true interculturalism in society and above all in the youth sector.\r\nThe project will involve 2 activities: \r\n- a prep meeting with 10 experts from 7 different countries who will meet in Tortona (Italy) in november 2017 in order to analyze and discuss the theoretical and methodological background and who will develop a draft of the innovative approach in the following two months\r\n- a training course (Tortona, february 2018) for 30 educators/youth workers/junior trainers/organizers and representatives of youth organizations from 16 different countries, who will work together to finalize and test new practical tools for intercultural learning and dialogue, based on the theoretical and methodological inputs given by the experts", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT03-KA105-010691_3"], [2017, "Are You Lost Yet?", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 27021.0, 4, 4, "Freedom of  expression is of crucial importance for Europe, being it currently shaping its whole history. In fact, the media is more biased and untrustworthy that ever. For a bright and democratic future young people need to be able to express themselves in an honest manner.

It will be held in Kumanovo, Macedonia and Cardiff, Wales, UK and bring together two different partners from distinct different countries; 20 participants will take part support by 4 staff / team members. The youth exchanges will use non-formal methods and activities to help participants connect the use of creative online journalism with inter-cultural learning, breaking down barriers to inclusion, experiential learning, development of critical thinking, developing teamwork and citizenship. The participants will take part in a huge amount of experiential learning themselves through the use of different activities such as research, design, investigative journalism, art, etc..    \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the youth exchanges will be developing an online magazine as a learning tool and form of self development. The educational programme will aim to develop young peoples abilities to use online journalism, artistic pursuits and creativity as a learning tool, formally, informally and non-formally as well as a method of pushing their comfort levels and developing their confidence. Using these methods to raise awareness about youth issues, human separation from the natural world and explore the possibilities to act toward sustainable culture as well as tools for breaking cultural, social and geographical barriers. \r\n\r\nBy exchanging their own experiences on this project, participants will get first-hand practice in inter-cultural learning.

The project involves more than 100 youngsters from Belgium, Austria, Italy, Turkey, FYRoM, Portugal, Greece,  Poland, UK, Lithuania and Cyprus. Activities will take place between May and December 2016. YEU is an international network born in 1986 with the aim of bringing young people together from all over Europe and to build peace, understanding, European citizenship and a common sense of belonging. These ideas and values, however, seem to strike with today's feelings and situation in Europe. Current social changes brought both more opportunities and more risks and constraints for all European citizens, above all for young people. In this unique period in Europe, young people (and society in general) have to face a great number of issues: youth unemployment rates in EU are generally twice as high as those for adults, with the current risk of becoming permanently unemployed; young people throughout Europe are distanced from and disillusioned with the channels of representative democracy, whose institutions and methods are neither willing nor capable of listening and responding positively to their needs and demands; many young people are skeptical of the political and administrative machineries that go along with it; problematic access to education and rising unemployment have obliged young people to rely more and more on family support and therefore curtailing their independence. The basic result of all this is the lack of confidence in European institutions and policies and an increasingly scattered continent (due to inequalities, different access to education and mobility, etc.). That\u2019s why, nowadays, young people, wherever they live and perhaps more than ever before, need to gain and be able to use life management skills and the capacity for critical judgment, in order to be able to answer a set of questions they will have to face in future scenarios of EU: are some Europeans at risk of becoming permanently unemployable? how can Europe better integrate migrants? is people becoming more racist? why should young people bother voting in elections? is the EU still only an economic bloc that countries join (only) for economic reasons? will countries ever decide to join or stay in the Union because of the common good (if such thing exists) instead of their national interests? Moreover, all these factors also translate in the lack of \u201cbelonging\u201d: young people do not feel as European citizens. YEU believes that the development of European identity is an unfinished business which risks jeopardizing the concept of Europe itself and that has to be addressed: is a common European identity possible? what are the values and ideals that bring us together as European citizenship and how can we awake and embed them in us? \"Europe from Scratch\" actually aims at bringing participants on a journey through the roots and values of Europe and of YEU (dignity,social inclusion,solidarity,tolerance,human rights,dialogue) and to give them the opportunity to reflect and think about the birth of Europe and the concepts of European identity and citizenship, in order to \"re-create\" European society/community from scratch, overcoming cultural differences and setting common goals and values. Through 2 youth exchanges, young people will: investigate current trends and issues; learn about European roots and history; gather different perspective on Europe and European identity; identify and create small practical tools that will help youth workers, trainers and youth organizations to deal with a changing Europe and its future scenarios; have the opportunity to recreate Europe from scratch, and therefore reflect on values/ideals,objectives, frameworks, institutions, relationships at the base of it; spread the information and increase awareness on the future of EU by creating and disseminating a set of guidelines and a shared \u201cAgenda for future of Europe\u201d. The job shadowing period, involving 1 youth worker from partner organizations, will be fundamental in order to create continuity among the exchanges, to better develop and shape the guidelines and the agenda, to collect additional data among YEU members. This activity will also help to boost quality in partner organizations that will want to keep on working on this topics, since the participant will share his/her experiences through online blogs and platforms. All activities will be carried out through flexible, variable and innovative NFE methodologies. Finally, the project objective is to give young people, youth workers and youth organizations the opportunity to reflect on the origins and roots of Europe, what values and ideals keep it together and how these values can be \"adapted\" and used to build a common and passionate feeling of belonging and of European identity in the world of today.", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE05-KA105-001867_1"], [2018, "Brave New You!", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 24810.0, 10, 13, "In the last few years we seem to have built a world in which xenophobia, nationalism, hate speech, homophobia and misogyny are on the rise and equity and solidarity are too often forgotten.Still, according to a study recently conducted by YEU network and its partners (https://wyredproject.eu/2017/07/27/wyred-delphi-study-highlights/) the great majority of YP believes that society in 2030 will be better if their voice is heard by decision makers\r\nFor this reason, MOJU decided to propose a project that will be challenging the existing narratives, deconstructing them and supporting YP to make their voices HEARD to create new positive narratives for a more inclusive and equal Europe. To do so, we will take inspiration by the approaches and methodologies suggested by  the CoE \"WE CAN!\" Manual and we'll understand a narrative as \u201ca logical, internally coherent report and interpretation of connected events. Narratives are present cultures transcending a particular moment and space. They are rather stable and collectively shared interpretations and explanations of social reality in which emotions and meaning play an important role.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is where the project \"Brave New You\" was born. BNY is a training course aimed at empowering youth workers to support social cohesion and creation of equal opportunities for young people of different backgrounds on local level by questioning current harmful and extremist narratives and creating new positive ones for a more inclusive Europe. The specific objectives of the project are:\r\n- To build capacities of youth workers to reach out and empower disadvantaged young people of different backgrounds (ethnic, religious, cultural, gender) to be more engaged in societies and voice up their realities\r\n- To enhance social cohesion in communities by bringing closer realities of disadvantaged young people to majority population\r\n- To challenge and deconstruct current narratives related to position of disadvantaged groups in societies (newcomers, women, LGBT+ youth), create new ones and implement them in local communities by using We Can! Manual of Council of Europe and putting it in practice\r\n- To strengthen the impact of youth work on local and european level by engaging disadvantaged youth and majority population (youth) to work together for better and more inclusive societies by celebrating instead of being afraid of differences between them\r\n\r\nThe expected results are:\r\n- 22 youth workers from 9 countries empowered to reach out and engage disadvantaged youth to voice up their realities\r\n- current harming, hateful and divisive narratives identified,  deconstructed and challenged\r\n- new and inclusive narratives created based on reality of communities involved, but still up-scalable in similar realities in Europe\r\n- org. and communities involved are safer and more inclusive for disadvantaged young people and are examples of how Europe can be - inclusive, supportive and celebrating varieties that enrich us\r\n- online campaign (website and social media) with videos, testimonials, challenged and new/alternative narratives\r\n- publication with examples of good practices and user friendly methods/approaches to engage YP in creating counter and alternative narratives\r\n\r\nTo achieve the foreseen objectives and to produce the expected results, we will engage 22 youth workers and 4 group leaders from 10 different countries (Portugal, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, FYROM, Turkey and UK) in a 9 days training (with 2 additional travel dates) that will take place in 3 different locations in Portugal, a small country whose inclusive policies made society more cohesive and open minded (Olhao, Evora, Lisbon/Cascais). The TC will be focused on empowering and equipping youth workers with knowledge, skills and information related to narratives - what are they, how to identify them, challenge them and design the counter ones including educational and human rights based approaches; reaching out strategies - how to identify target groups and allies in this process; preparing for action - how to plan well, mitigate the risks and stay safe and dedicated; how to develop and implement new/counter narratives in local communities, and how to multiply them in other external communities. Part of the TC, in fact, will also support YW to plan local activities in communities and to prepare the online campaign - videos, testimonials, information regarding the choice of narratives to challenge and how to answer to them (new/counter narratives). Follow up activities will mean putting new narratives in practice and creating local action groups (2 youth workers plus at least 10 young people from disadvantaged backgrounds that reflect the diversity of the community), in order to engage them in identifying other existing narratives that are harmful to them and to challenge these narratives together, empowering the YP (and those who work with them - the YW) to become key drivers of policy and social change in their communities", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT02-KA105-005005_10"], [2017, "THE HERO'S JOURNEY", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 22966.0, 15, 15, "The Project \"The Hero's Journey\" is a KA1 Training Course targeting youth leaders, youth workers, educators, active volunteers and staff members of our partner organizations. The training will take place in Brussels (Belgium) in November 2017 and will involve a total of 15 different partners from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Egypt, Portugal, Kosovo*, FYROM/Macedonia, UK and Ukraine. The project will involve 30 youth workers/facilitators from 15 different countries. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop and promote a new positive narrative of inclusion, giving the chance to young europeans and young migrants to meet and share their stories (their journeys) in order to match them with the needs of the communities they live in. To do so, we plan to train youth workers (and educators, staff members, volunteers, etc.) on two complementary methodologies and approaches: on one side, participants will  learn how to use storytelling as a tool that can foster unique encounters and create inclusion (sharing a story is like sharing a bit of ourselves with the people around us: this is the perfect cure to any form of intolerance and radicalization!) ... while on the other side, they will explore and further develop the concept of \"community matching\". This consists in observing local communities and realities in order to find inclusion opportunities that would match with the dreams, hopes and competences of the asylum seekers/migrants/refugees previously met. Participants will therefore transform themselves in storytellers and sociologists, and they will be mentored, in their search for new inclusive methodologies and tools, by interns and volunteers (all migrants and refugees with granted asylum) from the Brussels-based refugees project/network \"Tandem\". Through the TC, we will build the personal and professional capacities of youth workers and educators to deal with the needs and claims for inclusion in the local communities we live in. The specific objectives will be: \r\n- To contribute to migrants and refugees integration by promoting intercultural dialogue, inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding\r\n- To promote a change of perception towards migration and refugees, within young people and communities\r\n- To avoid generalization and promote \u201creal life encounters\u201d / to meet refugees and collect their stories\r\n- To raise awareness on the feelings, hopes, needs, fears, dreams, expectations, competences and skills of migrants/refugees \r\n- To explore and develop the concept of \"Community matching\"\r\n- To foster the role of youth organizations in creating sustainable integration and bridges among young refugees and young Europeans\r\n- To increase the quality of youth work by providing youth workers and youth organisations with additional tools to address inclusion and integration needs in local communities and in Europe\r\n\r\nThe project also foresees the following expected results: \r\n- A final publication, developed as an online interactive platform, in which thoughts, reflections stories of migrations developed as \u201cmodern fairy-tales\u201d will be presented - each \"fairytale\" (story) will have different open finales among which users will be able to choose: in this way, the platform will show them different opportunities (already existing in their communities) and actions (something that they can also initiate, from daily behaviors to voluntarism) that would allow to reach the \"inlucsion happy ending\". \r\n- Promotion of the concept of \u201ccommunity match\u201d, defined as the opportunity to match the stories, skills and knowledge of the migrants with the needs and opportunities of the community they live in. This will be partially addressed in the final publication and web platform. However we believe the approach should be further developed and tested: for this reason, partners already committed to develop some topic-related local activity, that will allow to test different tools and to better observe the local community (and the possibility to have ... a match!) \r\n- A social campaign aiming at changing the perception and view of local communities towards migrants and refugees: the campaign will play on empathy and strong-impact data that could move citizens and young people to take action in some way. We will develop the campaign thanks to the practical labs that are included in the training course (as tests of Storytelling methodologies)\r\n\r\nThe starting point of any sustainable integration policy should be the respect for migrants and refugees as individuals, with their own stories, dreams and competences.

The visit will allow 1 leader from each partner to meet and to discuss on the educational, logistics and organizational aspects of the project. During the APV, facilitators will have the chance to visit venues and to better define and develop the contents of the daily program of the youth exchanges. Partners will be able to suggest workshops and to actively contribute with their expertise to the final draft of the program, which will also take into account participants\u2019 needs and expectations, thanks to group leaders\u2019 presence and mediation.\r\n\r\nA2 (YE) \"Born 2 Run: Plus\" - The exchange will take place in Kavadarci and Kumanovo  in September 2017. The aim of the action is to help participants to get a complete overview on the skills required to run community sporting events with an inclusive perspective. Participants will have the chance to share perspectives and inputs from their own countries, but above all they will be able to meet young people and locals and get to know their experiences, applying an exchange of experience approach in order to gather and \"explore\" the different perspectives. The experience and the gained knowledge and competences will allow participants to develop their action plans for local activities in future..\r\n\r\nThe aim of the exchange is to gather 30 people including leaders and young people from across Wales, Italy, Greece, Turkey & Macedonia to develop what they do in their free time into a healthier lifestyle. These will consist of trail runs, road runs, track runs, short and long runs as well as walks and routes that double up as bike tracks also.  The participants will create and essential Runs map of Kavadarci and Kumanovo municipalities while searching for, developing and commenting these routes of a 3 week period. The exchange will conclude with Kumanovo's first 10km race as well as a small street festival to promote healthy lifestyles. Alongside the 10km race will be a 5 & 3km race as well as a choice of walks for inclusion of all no matter there ability. This the reason the exchange is in September as it is the best time of year for such an event, Kavadarci and Kumanovo are too hot in June, July and August and will be too cold in December. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will use non-formal and informal educations methods to combat the cultural barriers that may occur during the exchange, promote team work and critical thinking, develop a sense of European citizenship and highlight the need for a healthy lifestyle. The project will aim at develop ways of inclusion in such sports such as inclusion of those with disabilities, from socially vulnerable backgrounds, ethnic minorities and combating gender discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe project achieves the four pillars of youth work as stated in the Youth Work Curriculum Statement for Wales (2007).\r\n- The project is Educative about healthy living through sporting activities.. \r\n- The project is Expressive through creativity and choice.\r\n- The project is Participative as the participants not only volunteer, but choose and 'handrail' the direction of the project.\r\n- The project is empowering the youth workers knowledge and skills in how to control, adapt, use and change sporting activities for young people.\r\nThe Youth Work Curriculum Statement for Wales (2007) can be viewed here: http://tiny.cc/8roclw \r\n\r\nA vision for a new national youth work strategy for Wales 2013\u20132018 states that 'Research has demonstrated that youth work practice can improve young people\u2019s school attendance, behaviour motivation, and relationships.

The participants that the project will gather are all members of the youth partner organisations, interested to develop their competences and to multiply the effects of the project within their local communities. The target group is composed of youth workers, trainers, motivated youth on the subject or project managers all actively involved in the youth sector. The program of the course will be based on non formal educational methods which combine theoretical and practical components and conducted using a highly participatory approach in order to cover all the aspects of the theme. Special attention will be paid to the fact that the competences and the knowledge gained and transmitted during the course remain sustainable and transferable.  This will be achieved by setting up enough space and time for reflection and evaluation, by providing comprehensive documentation, handouts and guidance from the trainers\u2019 team.

Amongst the partners (Ireland, Wales, Portugal, Austria, Greece), these learners comprise both young and mature adults who are early school-leavers, as well immigrants. The opportunity presented by Erasmus+ will enable partners to share best practice, drawn from our considerable collective experience in the delivery of second-chance education for adults and young people.  The Project will explore the area of career guidance and how to identify practical learner progression pathways, including the obstacles (both personal and structural) that they must realistically overcome.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four practical dimensions to the EDGE Project: (1) A comparative examination of the unemployment and activation contexts within the partner countries, each of which has experienced the global economic downturn in different ways.  (2) The sharing of best practice with regard to the ways in which our respective organisations have responded to meet the skill needs of vulnerable adults and young people (e.g. access, engagement, retention, career guidance and employability provision).  (3) An examination of the potential of the Mozilla \u2018Open Badges\u2019 system.

The e-portfolio will record evidence and illustrate learning gained across modules, programs or different institutions.

There have been reports about vandalism in refugee centres in the very beginning they were established. Several neo-nazi groupings have got wind under their wings and right-wing parties have got more supporters. \r\n\r\nOn personal level a lot of local people believe that refugees represent a threat to host countries, that there is a lot of terrorists among refugees, that they want to spread islam and steal jobs from the local. In addition local people are afraid of losing their own identity, nationality, culture, religion, jobs etc. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the core of the problem lies in dehumanization of refugees, dividing people into \u201eus\u201d and \u201ethem\u201d. What is needed most by both refugees and people living in countries who host them is a sense of connectedness: a connection to common humanity. In our opinion, drama methods are best to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nSLT provides this connectedness for those who engage with it. From this connection to common humanity, which transcends cultural and even linguistic differences, compassion emerges naturally. SLT harnesses this emerging compassion and supports participants to channel it in useful ways to support and guide each other through uncertain and precarious times.\r\n\r\n18 youth workers from 5 European countries will meet on 25.09.-04.10.2017 in Tartu, Estonia in a training to learn SLT methods. 8 days long training includes morning and afternoon SLT workshops lead by creator of SLT method, Iwan Brioc, evaluation sessions in the end of every day, SLT performances in the end of the training to try out and share the results of the training, socializing time etc. All this serves the aim to equip the participating youth workers with competence and methods for addressing personal- and local level challenges associated with refugees.\r\n\r\nTo deepen understanding of refugees' situation every group prepares a research of the current refugees crisis as a homework \u2013 what are the main personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees in their countries. The researches are presented in the beginning of the training session. During training Skype interview with Syrian refugees in Turkey and a meeting with refugees in Estonia take place to provoke intercultural dialogue and search for similarities in differences. \r\n\r\nDuring this training the youth workers have chance to experience the method themselves through exercises. Then they work in groups and create for each other improvisational sensory journeys. Also they can try the method out with the adults. After acquiring the essence of the method they create sensory portals and form a structure of the SLT production for the youth. They learn to use and tune this method on a very specific topic - refugees, which is very relevant in nowadays' world. \r\n\r\nAfter the training 18 youth workers are ready to use SLT in their every day youth work. To test it partner organisations will arrange 4-6 dissemination events after the training course. So the participants/ participating organisations can try out their competence to use SLT as a method to address personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees, share their multi-pointed overview of the current refugee crisis and disseminate European common values. \r\n\r\nCapacity to use SLT methods in addressing personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees/ migrants or other socially sensitive topics will be available in youth work field of 6 different countries.
