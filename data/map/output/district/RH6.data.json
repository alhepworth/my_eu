For this, a real-time decision making tool and a real-time visualization tool of freight transport will be developed, with the purpose of delivering information and services to the various agents involved in the logistic supply chain, i.e. freight transport operators, their clients, industries and other stakeholders such as warehouse or infrastructure managers.\n\nLOGISTAR will address several advances beyond the State of the Art in the interdisciplinary field of the smart algorithms for data processing: Artificial Intelligence focussed onr prediction, parallel hybrid metaheuristics for optimization, automated negotiation techniques, and constraint satisfaction problem solving techniques.

Tempering is a highly complex process, affected by many raw material and processing factors, whereby the specific tempering conditions required will depend on the cocoa butter used, the type of product being made and the subsequent processing. Few solutions exist for controlling the tempering process of chocolate.\nSolid Fat Content (SFC), the generally accepted analysis of fats and oils in the food industry, is crucial to the texture of chocolate. As SFC may change during manufacturing and storage, it is important to be able to measure this parameter to control the ingredients and manufacturing conditions for achieving optimum product quality. Traditional methods of SFC determination are slow, irreproducible, require additional chemicals and are based on sampling. An in-line sensor capable of measuring the SFC in the chocolate melt would allow automated control of the tempering process and would be of great value to manufacturers.\nUltrasonics is a popular technique for understanding phase transitions as the acoustic properties of solids and liquids are so different that changes are easy to measure. Two possible methods for controlling the tempering process will be explored based on the use of ultrasound: a novel technology to control the crystal size distribution during tempering, and development of an in-line sensor capable of measuring the SFC, crystal size distribution and polymorph distribution in the melt.
