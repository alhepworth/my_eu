Over three million cases are currently diagnosed each year across the continent. Forecasts show that by 2020 almost half of the population will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. The cost of cancer for the EU is \u20ac126 billion per year and rising. The health and economic implications of cancer therefore provide a compelling business opportunity for technologies that can improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs. \n\nSurgery remains one of the primary treatments for cancer, yet surgeons lack the tools to identify accurately and remove cancer during an operation, resulting in costly re-operations and negative health ramifications. Lightpoint Medical has developed a molecular imaging camera (LightPath\u2122) based on a breakthrough imaging modality, Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI). The technology can provide surgeons with real time intraoperative analysis of cancerous tissue to ensure the complete removal of cancer in a single operation. The device provides the potential for a dramatic reduction in costly re-operations and adjuvant therapies across a wide range of major cancer indications, proving not only an innovative solution for healthcare providers, but also a tool to substantially reduce cancer care costs.\n\nCerISMA is proposed as a multi-centre clinical trial to confirm the clinical efficacy of LightPath\u2122 in a lead cancer indication and to evidence the health economic impact of the technology.

The most effective treatment strategy for most forms of cancer is early detection followed by surgery. However, cancers frequently recur following surgery. For example, nearly 1 in 4 breast cancer patients will see their tumour recur after surgery. The consequences of cancer recurrence include repeat operations, delayed adjuvant treatment, increased likelihood of distant recurrence, poorer cosmetic and functional outcomes, emotional distress, and financial cost. The financial costs are staggering. Europe spends \u20ac125 billion annually on cancer care, approximately 5% of which is managing post-surgical recurrence.\n\nTumours recur after surgery primarily due to incomplete excision of the tumour or inadequate clearance of surgical margins. Tumours fail to be completely excised because the surgeon only has the visual appearance of the tumor and palpation to differentiate malignant from benign tissue. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical and market need for improved tools to detect cancerous tissue during surgery.\n\nReal-time imaging during surgery would enable the surgeon to more accurately resect tumors and thereby reduce the likelihood of post-surgical recurrence. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is a ground-breaking imaging modality that can provide real-time molecular imaging during surgery\n\nThe CLIO consortium will develop a Cerenkov luminescence imaging device and a handheld intraoperative beta particle imaging device for image-guided surgery as well as imaging services for the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors.
