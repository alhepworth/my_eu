Nowadays, novel digital technologies (particularly Social, Cloud, Mobile and Big Data) are transforming the way companies operate across all markets and creating new business opportunities for digital entrepreneurship.Large and medium companies are equipping themselves to cope with the digital transformation. In contrast, Micro Enterprises (MEs), have less opportunities to access training they need to concentrate key competences and abilities in very small teams.DiTEM will contribute to the development of Digital Entrepreneurship across the EU by facilitating the development and acquisition of e-leadership skills in Micro Enterprises (MEs), by providing an innovative learning path for entrepreneurs and managers of MEs to embrace and implement the Digital Transformation. The project will focus on Micro Enterprises because they are less prepared and able to face the challenges related to embracing digital technologies. DiTEM will help to minimise the risks faced by MEs as they seek to implement new digital tools and processes.DiTEM will also positively impact on a secondary indirect target group: organisations that provide training in business and enterprise development (VET trainers-business coaches). They will be able exploit DiTEM Training Tool to enrich their training offer and to support the digital transformation of European MEs.In total 200 MEs managers and business executives will be involved in the project: first in the initial training needs analysis and then they will benefit from doing the online training and being supported by online coaches.Target group VET trainers and business coaches: in total about 40 VET trainers and business coaches will benefit from project results. They will participate in VET training and then gain experience in delivering on-line coaching support to MEs. Via the mainstream dissemination activities (e.g. social media, website visitors, e-newsletters) and the multiplier events, the number of people and organisations reached is expected to be considerable (5000).The work-plan is organized on a 36 months\u2019 basis: - The 1st phase will serve to conduct a training needs analysis. - In the 2nd phase the training course and the online learning environment will be developed and tested internally by the consortium;- During the 3rd phase, a set of training activities will be held in each participating country: partners\u2019 staff trained to be DiTEM coaches and train the trainers, blended train the trainers activities (VET trainers to be DiTEM coaches), blended training for end-users (MEs\u2019 business leaders). This phase will also serve to pilot test the developed products;- Based on the results of the pilot test and studies conducted in each project country, policy recommendation will be issued in the 4th phase. During the last months, dissemination activities (which will start from the beginning of the project) will be given a boost and an exploitation plan will be launched to promote the DiTEM training system and coaching.The project methodology is based on three principles:1. Develop products that are the best suited to the needs of the target group identified;2. Make the products of the project sustainable and usable for a large number of stakeholders after the end of the eligible period. The train the trainers activities and the involvement of VET providers is aimed to reach this goal;3. Promote a work-based learning approach for micro enterprises, based on a blended training course supported by online coaching. The focus of the training will be mainly on 4 digital technologies, such as: mobile solutions, social media, cloud computing and big data. Participants are expected to become able to:- understand and recognise the full potential of the proposed technologies for their activity and market; - set out a strategy to invest time and resources on the improvement of the digital performance of their company;- select the best solution available in the market;- Involve the relevant consultants or experts to make use of the technologies available.In short, they are expected to become e-leaders. Besides single MEs, the project intends to impact the entire European business Community, which will benefit from an open educational resource available online, supported by a network of coaches around Europe.  A particularly important expected impact of the project is to influence policy-makers. The project will raise the awareness and understanding of VET and SME stakeholders regarding the potential and value of a more strategic and integrated use of ICT and open educational resources to drive SME growth and performance.", "http://www.exponentialtraining.com", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024362_2"], [2015, "Project-IPEC", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 301336.0, 8, 8, "Private enterprises make substantial use of projects to manage internal innovation, development projects and external work for clients. Established, larger companies often use a formal project management methodology. In contrast, SMEs are rarely able to employ dedicated project managers, find formal project methodologies, such as Prince2, too sophisticated, too costly and too time intensive for their needs. Cost, time overruns and the ineffective execution of projects have a significant impact on the performance of SMEs. A PricewaterhouseCoopers study of 10,640 projects from 200 companies found that only 2.5% of the companies successfully completed 100% of their projects. With micro and small enterprises accounting for 98.8% of all enterprises and employing 50% of the workforce in the EU28, the ineffective execution of projects is impacting negatively not only the performance of their company, but also on national and European economic performance. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to contribute to improving the performance of micro and small enterprises at both a national and European level. Partners will bring together two different bodies of knowledge (i.e. Project Management and gamification) synthesise a new micro-lite Project Management methodology using the IPEC project cycle: Initiate, Plan, Execute and Close. By adopting best Project Management practices, \u2018state of the art\u2019 gamification technology and the latest blended learning techniques and practices, partners aim to \u2018exemplar\u2019 project that will act as a \u2018demonstrator\u2019 project for future VET products utilising gamification. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve 200 participants from the target group: new business start-ups and small enterprises trading for less than three years and set up by Generation Y individuals. They will implement the micro-lite Project Management methodology in their business. They will be supported by 40 IPEC Coaches trained to deliver on-line business coaching and to facilitate execution of results-driven business projects. \r\n\r\nProject-IPEC will result in measurable improvements in the performance of enterprises. This impact will be captured and used to stimulate a national and European debate with VET and SME policy makers regarding the wider use of gamification, on-line business coaching and the micro-lite Project Management methodology as a mechanism for improving the performance of Europe\u2019s SME. Partners will publish a policy paper called, \u2018The Wider Use of ICT, Gamification and Micro-lite Project Management within VET\u2019. The paper will be presented at a series of national seminars and a European conference, entitled, is \u2018Transforming European Economic Performance: Releasing the Potential of SMEs\u2019.

Some ePortfolios were developed as \u2018add-ons\u2019 to learning management systems and others as a simple repository for students to store digital artifacts. Recent developments have seen the emergence of Massive On-line Open Courses (MOOCs), gamification and serious games, mobile use of web-based tools and the increased use of products such as Blackboard and Moodle. Other than making ePortfolios responsive for use on tablets, there has been relatively little advancement of ePortfolios in VET in this decade. \r\n\r\nThe LEAP ePortfolio project aims to create a \u2018step change\u2019 in the use of ePortfolios. It will result in a learner-centred, process-based pedagogical tool to improve learner and VET provider performance and VET processes. This will be achieved through the development of a responsive and versatile ePortfolio developed around a four-step pedagogical model: Learn, Engage, Apply and Perform (LEAP). The LEAP ePortfolio will integrate the use of open digital badges and elements of gamification and will be suitable for use with formal and non-formal VET courses. It will enable VET teachers and trainers to develop and deliver rich, personalised and adaptive learning experiences leading to improved learner achievements, increased retention and completion rates, potentially requiring less time and resources.\r\n\r\nThe six partners from the UK, Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal will develop and deliver a series of VET courses. These will be designed for use in their own national context and delivered using the LEAP ePortfolio. Some partners will engage part and full-time students and others learners from employment. The VET courses will include a mix of short and longer term courses in IT, management and coaching, health and safety, languages and IT, thereby demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the LEAP ePortfolio. In total, 200 learners and 30 teachers and trainers will be engaged in the project.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of the LEAP ePortfolio, the project will deliver two additional outputs: the LEAP ePortfolio and Good Practice Handbook and a policy report called, 'ePortfolios: Taking the LEAP'. The Handbook will provide a comprehensive guide to best practice and how to maximize the value of the LEAP ePortfolio specifically and ePortfolios per se. The policy report will present the pedagogical and economic case for the widespread use of ePortfolios within VET - it will be the centre-piece of a series of multiplier events at the end of the project. \r\n\r\nThe LEAP ePortfolio project will raise the awareness of VET stakeholders, policy-makers, VET, further and higher education institutes and employers of the potential of ePortfolios as VET tool.

In one hand there are increasing number of support programs/financial aids to promote innovation, on the other hand social innovation is still in its infancy, nevertheless there is much need for such initiatives in the fast changing social and economic environment of the digital era. \r\n\r\nThere is much need for such initiatives in the fast changing social and economic environment of the digital era. With Coop-in project our partnership aims to raise awareness about the advantages of implementing social innovation at work by developing a complex Social Innovation Training kit for the most important potential actors of the field, primarily focusing on corporate VET trainers and mentors.\r\n\r\nSocial innovation is often seen as a privilege of charity based organisations, and not as a skill/knowledge/know-how that has its well deserved place in a company's knowledge portfolio. However, social innovation can make an important impact on the world of work, reduce costs or lead to higher revenue (e.g. by creating a work conditions where employees are more satisfied and produce better; where diversity can bring an added value and new ideas, products, processes). As a topic it is still in its infancy in the partner countries and in Europe. There is a need for VET teacher/trainers and business coaches and advisors to better understand how to facilitate and support enterprises to exploit social innovation. \r\n\r\nCoop-in will encourage individuals, groups and organisations that would otherwise not participate in social innovation. In this sense, Coop-in partnership addresses all those actors whose cooperation would accelerate social innovation in the societies.  The project partnership believes that collaboration is a key, not only for the successful realization of the present project but also for the systematic promotion and sustainable management of social innovation. The target audience of Coop-in project therefore is fairly wide.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on the latest educational trends, applying gamification and micro learning approaches; enhances commitment, learning motivation by game elements; and micro-learning  and scenario-based learning approach to ensure learning efficacy.\r\n\r\nCoop-in Social Innovation Training kit includes a game based learning platform enhancing practical approach on social innovation and collaboration, b-learning course book, self-assessment tool for social innovation scrutiny, an offline toolkit comprising co-working exercises and group dynamics with major attention on the recent CEN/TS 16555-5 innovation management standard.\r\n\r\nBased on our background research in the partner countries, currently there is no such a multi-lingual open learning portal in Europe that enables a complex methodological, theoretical and practical training on social innovation like the one described in Coop-in project. Furthermore, the application of the European Innovation Management Standard on Collaboration Management in VET is a novelty as well. The standard ensures a systematic approach for VET training and enables the development of strategic business partnership between corporate sector, VET providers and educational institutions.", "http://www.exponentialtraining.com", "Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036640_2"], [2017, "Disruptive change agents: the new breed of leaders in Europe", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 221896.0, 7, 9, "The recent economic crisis has surfaced problems related to Europe\u2019s economic model. On one hand, the EU has lifted a non-negotiable banner through its Europe 2020 strategy calling for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and on the other hand, there is a questionable economic model to base it on. Drastic action must be taken to change the current situation. \r\nA popular proverb says \u201cA fish rots from the head down\u201d, meaning that when a state fails, it is the leadership that is the root cause. Leadership seems to be a possible cause of Europe\u2019s ill faded economy. Education is called to establish the foundation for the development of a new type of leadership to take the responsibility of the new European economies. But effective leaders do not grow on trees. We need to look into our education systems to draw some pure talents.\r\nGifted education has been the source for prominent and valuable human resources. The idea is still good; the only difference is that Europe is in need of a new recipe in order to hatch the right leaders of tomorrow.\r\nBreed2Lead is a project focused on a new breed of leaders found in gifted education. The need for a new generation of leaders who will satisfy a new set of criteria and have specific leadership characteristics will result to the formation of a methodology that will assist primary education teachers identify, assess and develop such talents. \r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- establish a new definition for leadership which will give European economy back its lost competitiveness\r\n- form a specialised methodology to identify, assess and develop gifted leaders in primary education and create a nurturing environment for them to reach their full potential \r\n- enrich any existing gifted education practices \r\n- develop a specialised training plan and didactic material to train teachers giving them a holistic approach to develop the gift of leadership of pupils with some natural leadership charisma \r\n\r\nEducation authorities and stakeholders, primary schools, teachers, gifted students and their families as well as the business community and business stakeholders are the direct beneficiaries of this project and therefore represent the target groups of the project.\r\nThe project will commence by scoping for all the cognitive abilities a Disruptive Change Agent (DCA) must possess. The source of such information is gathered from the business community through a survey and interviews. The identified DCA cognitive abilities will lead to the skills required to support them. Focus groups will allow all target groups to voice their opinion of the format of a skills development strategy. \r\nThe set of cognitive abilities supported by a set of skills will allow the formal definition of a DCA which will regulate their extent and the correlation between them. Having the DCA definition in place, the consortium will prepare set of tools which will enable trained teachers to identify, assess and develop the new generation of leaders. The skills development plan will rely on the agreed development strategy, giving teachers all necessary educational ammunition. \r\nThe DCA definition and the tools for identifying, assessing and developing skills, as well as a set of quality assurance measures  will form the DCA methodology.\r\nThe DCA methodology will set the ground for a training plan and didactic materials in order to train the teaching staff on the three distinct stages: identify, assess and develop. The training curriculum and materials developed for this purpose will be used during a train-the-trainer training activity in Cyprus. The partners will designate two participants with minimum prerequisites to attend and taste all intellectual outputs produced by the consortium. To secure sustainability of the project, the trained participants will commit to give two training events each within one year.\r\nThe partnership will organise a final conference in Budapest to dissiminate the project outputs. The final conference will not be the only dissemination activity of the project. Each partner will perform various dissemination activities individually and collectively.\r\nThe project will give to the European primary education a complete system to use for the development of the new breed of leaders.

Closing the loop-the Action Plan for the Circular Economy of the EU states:\"the transition to a more circular economy, where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste minimized, is an essential contribution to the EU's efforts to develop a sustainable, low carbon, resource efficient and competitive economy.\" \r\nCircular economy is a solution to increase EU's competitiveness by protecting businesses against scarcity of resources and unstable prices, helping to initiate new business opportunities and more sustainable ways of producing and consuming, as well as to create local jobs at all skills levels and opportunities for social integration.\r\nTransition to circular economy implies a complex process as it requires system-redesign on all levels of the society, creating the necessity for new thinking and competencies. Therefore, there is an eminent need for conveying the right knowledge and understanding about principles and benefits of circular economy to its actors on all levels.\r\nEducation about circular economy needs to permeate all levels of entrepreneurial training. Current training programs are just a few and oriented to equip only high-level graduates with knowledge so that can help their company to \u2018become circular\u2019. However, entrepreneurship (opening a small manufacturing business, etc.) is an option for people with lower educational level as well. This is quite often an opportunity also for migrants/refugees regardless their educational level.  Therefore appears the need for preparation to \u2018become circular\u2019 at all levels.\r\nThe need for SKILL- CIRCLE project also comes from the fact that our time is characterized by high immigration and we need to improve the effectiveness of policies aiming at integration of migrants (Global approach on Migration and Mobility: EC, 2011) by fostering their entrance to the labour market.\r\nTo address these issues, and supporting the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan, the project aims at development of skills for circular economy thinking of VET learners - those with lower educational level and with migrant/refugee background - to become adequately skilled and active players of the future.\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will contribute to innovative entrepreneurial skills development of VET learners and to integration of circular economy thinking skills training into European curricula by the following activities: \r\n\u2022 Analysing the specific training needs in circular economy of VET learners \r\n\u2022 Exploring current practices of circular economy thinking and acting in Europe\r\n\u2022 Developing and testing a training program for driving a change of mind-set and develop circular skills for the future\r\n\u2022 Developing online training materials, tailored to low-educated learners and suitable for those with migrant/refugee background, which will educate about circular economy thinking\r\n\u2022 Developing high quality OERs for VET learners, thus promoting equality and inclusion in the learning process\r\n\r\nThe core target groups of the project are:\r\n- VET learners with lower educational level and with migrant/refugee background (direct)\r\n- VET trainers, VET education and training providers (indirect)\r\n\r\nIntellectual outputs:\r\n1. \"Circular skills for the future\" - Specific training needs of VET learners in relation to circular economy\r\n2. \"What makes your micro business circular?\" - Digital stories of circular thinking and acting from different sectors of industry in Europe\r\n3.
