SASMAP will take holistic- and process- based approaches to investigate underwater environments and the archaeological sites contained therein.\nSASMAP will benefit the management of underwater cultural heritage in Europe and in the rest of the world by providing valuable tools to plan the preservation of offshore archaeological sites and their contents in accordance with both the Treaty of Valletta (1992) and research driven investigations. The need for SASMAP is based on the results from previous and current EU initiatives, the networks resulting from these projects and on-going research at the consortium\u2019s institutions. Within SASMAP a holistic approach will be taken to locating, assessing, monitoring and safeguarding underwater cultural heritage. This will involve developing and utilising tools and technologies to allow \u201cdown-scaling\u201d from the large scale regional level, moving on to the local site level and finally to the individual components of a site. Results obtained from the down-scaling approach at the proposed study areas will show the effectiveness of such an approach for locating and detailed mapping of archaeological sites and their preservation potential. The end results of this approach will be used to develop a plan for assessing archaeological sites in European waters. From a management point of view this is an up-scaling approach to planning (bottom up).

This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system. Resulting from these visits, networks, partnerships and two-way exchanges of staff and learners have already been established. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobilities project will contribute to both individual continuous professional development (CPD) plans as well as continuing to develop long term strategic partnerships between Est of England Colleges and EU VET providers. Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.  All participants will engage in learning the basic language of the host country. Participants are concentrating on the organisation of and preparation for Apprenticeships and Entrepreneurship and Learner guidance and support during the visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically focus on arranging mobilities for 60  East of England college staff- providing them with the opportunity to explore the organisation and management of:\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes, \r\n\r\ninnovative mathematics teaching, \r\n\r\nuse of skills competitions\r\n\r\nworking with young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the host countries.

More strategic/longer term  impacts will be as colleges continue and develop the visits and relationships to form longer term strategic partnerships with their European hosts through which further collaborative working/projects can be developed.

It has already been shown that nutritional modulation of lipid homeostasis via direct supplementation, e.g., n-3 fatty acids, or via indirect mechanisms, e.g., dietary polyphenols, has beneficial effects on human health. There is growing evidence that ether phospholipids such as plasmalogens play a central role in mediating the beneficial effects, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood.   ETHERPATHS will develop systems biology tools that will facilitate studies of dietary interventions aiming to modulate lipid homeostasis. Specifically, we will develop (1) models that enable studies of gut microbiota and its effect on host cell metabolism, (2) dynamic models of systemic lipid metabolism, and (3) pathway reconstruction methods to study tissue-specific effects of dietary interventions. All models will be optimized in the context of studies of dietary interventions and will be integrated into a sophisticated software platform. In silico strategies will be complemented by multiple experimental approaches, including (1) dietary interventions involving n-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, combined with tracer studies in vitro and in vivo (2) in vitro colon model (3) in vivo germ-free and conventional models of altered lipid metabolism, specifically of plasmalogen deficiency.  ETHERPATHS includes academic and industrial partners with combined unique expertise in information technology, bioinformatics, metabolic and physiological modelling, systems engineering, biochemistry, microbiology, lipid metabolism, metabolomics, obesity and metabolic syndrome, and clinical nutrition.
