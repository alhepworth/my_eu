The platform is to be developed in at least 4 EU languages including english, french, italian and serbian.In the first part of the project, the partner institutions will share their expertise and best practices in order to draw a methodological didactical concept. On the basis of this methodological framework the platform and its content will be designed. The platform designed will be then technically realised by professional providers. The second part of the project is dedicated to testing: the platform will be tested by partners on students and teachers involved. Offline knowledge transfer activities will be held with teachers and students aimed to share the platform with them and to explain how it works and how it can be used for pedagogical purposes in class.
