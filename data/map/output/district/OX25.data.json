For a new machine, operation and maintenance costs might easily have an average share over the lifetime of a turbine of more than 30% of the total levellised cost per kWh produced. Therefore, operation and maintenance costs are increasingly attracting the attention of manufacturers seeking to develop new designs requiring fewer regular service visits and less out-time. In order for the wind energy industry to achieve the growth targets set by the EU for the forthcoming years, wind turbine numbers have to increase substantially, while at the same time their operation and maintenance costs will need to be reduced by a noticeable factor to permit the European wind energy industry to retain its advantage over growing overseas competition. Therefore, one of the highest priorities for the European wind energy industry is currently the significant improvement of the reliability of wind turbines, involving a solid reduction in current inspection and maintenance costs mainly associated with unpredicted failures of critical rotating components.\n\nINTELWIND seeks to largely decrease the number of failures of critical rotating components in wind turbines and minimise the need for corrective maintenance by developing and successfully implementing an intelligent condition monitoring system based on the integration of acoustic emission, vibration analysis, torque sensing and oil analysis techniques.

These materials can present customers with a number of challenges including:\n\n- In the absence of heat, the product cannot be discharged quickly enough from the IBC into the manufacturing process, even at room temperature.\n- As the IBC empties, the static head falls, further reducing the flow rate.\n- To keep production flowing, it is often necessary to replace the IBC before it is completely empty, meaning that product is either wasted or returned to the supplier at an inherent cost to the user.\n- Increased energy consumption and costs associated with cleaning such containers.\n\nExisting heating solutions are typically slow and energy inefficient and rely on heating the exterior surface of the drum or IBC. Currently, there is no single product on the market which utilises internal heating of an intermediate bulk container. There is, therefore, a very real need for the development of a heating solution that can heat quickly, efficiently and at a lower cost.

While municipal water quality has always been a concern in some parts of the world, it is now becoming an issue in North America as well. As recent outbreaks of waterborne disease in carries Canada and the US illustrate, dependence on any municipal water supply carries an inherent risk.

However, these materials are also relatively expensive and it is unlikely that component costs will decrease in the future. Moreover, supply of these materials is limited and not large enough to cope with expected increases in demand. Alternative materials such as polymers have been investigated and can theoretically offer significant cost savings due to potential weight reductions, mass production techniques and increased freedom of functional design.
