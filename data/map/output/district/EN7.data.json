Young people are a huge resource for the European society, but they have to create new jobs for themselves using innovative new visions and ideas to fight unemployment.  It is no longer enough just to look at existing jobs and young people need to think creatively to fight unemployment. \r\n\r\nTo help young people with this growing need, InterStep and its partnering organizations wish to create a Contact making Event \"Start Up!\" which bring together organisations who are promoting entrepreneurship among young people. \r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Aalborg in Northen Jutland between April 13.-20., 2015, and have participation of 46 youth leaders from 23 program and partner countries. The youth leaders will primarily be 20-30 years old. \r\n\r\nThe event will give the youth leaders inspiration for promoting entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial thinking which they will use to help young unemplouyd people to participate in society and improve their own lives by creating new job opportunities for themselves and thereby fight unemployment. The youth leaders will get inspiration for entrepreneurship through workshops, networking, creating new projects, and getting inspirations from local stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThis inspiration will help the youth leaders actively engage in the future of the young people an inspire them with their new-found knowledge to become entrepreneurs.  By gathering new knowledge about implementing and promoting entrepreneurship, the youth leaders' future work will be expected to increase financial growth and competitiveness, while developing and improving the future European society and its social cohesion by empowering the young people to be entreprenuers.", "http://www.thegifted.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DK01-KA105-004019_16"]]}}}}
