The project will support school development to raise attainment and to close the poverty related attainment gap. We hope to raise the expectations and aspirations of our learners, staff and families through the provision of high quality teaching and learning, which is supported in school, at home and in the community. From our youngest learners at Early Level to our Second Level learners who will move on to Forfar Academy, it is important that they all have more confidence in their languages ability. To achieve this, the two participants will deliver languages training for teaching and non-teaching staff, and for families. The number of school staff exceeds 30, plus the families of our 329 learners so the project is wide reaching, with long-term benefits. \r\n\r\nThis project offers an unprecedented opportunity for the school to gain learning and teaching resources which make languages learning both engaging and achievable for our learners, as we need teaching staff who are confident in their abilities to deliver quality learning to other members of our school community. Participants will gain an improved understanding of modern French culture and the French education system which cannot be achieved without being in France and interacting with French teaching professionals. This will be shared with school and authority colleagues, enabling learners to have a greater understanding of Europe and their role and responsibilities as global citizens. The use of IT will support both teaching and learning, but also provide opportunities to engage with learners in other countries which has not been undertaken before. \r\n\r\nThe two participants have a varying expertise in delivery of modern languages. They are both full time members of staff, who are committed not only to their own professional learning, but to the learning of their colleagues. The training in language and methodology through the immersion courses will help the participants, and subsequently school staff to embed French into the daily life of the school. Subsequently, the school will be in  a much improved position to implement L3 into the school curriculum. \r\n\r\nActivities to engage our families and local community will provide opportunities for staff and learners to share their learning, and enthusiasm for languages. To have the intended impact, we will engage with our whole school community, not just our learners and staff. We intend to do this through family learning events, and community engagement through events and inter-generational learning. To raise the expectations and aspirations of our learners and families, we will raise the importance of learning a modern language through engagement with local businesses who use languages. This will have the impact of making meaningful links with the world of work (DYW national priority) and skills for learning, life and work. \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of this project include achievement of the national 1+2 strategy, closing the poverty related attainment gap which is very pertinent to Strathmore where more than a third of our learners are in areas of multiple socio-economic deprivation (as measured by SIMD data), and raising the aspirations of our learners and families in a global society. Learning and teaching of modern languages will become embedded into the curriculum, with progression evident throughout the school. Confidence in teaching languages will be higher with all staff recognising the benefits of languages learning for all, not just some. This will help us to achieve equity, not just equality in our provision. By learning languages, our learners will be supported in developing a resilient attitude to learning. This in turn will help to raise attainment.", "http://www.strathmoreschool.co.uk", "Strathmore Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047316_coordinator"], [2014, "Language Training", "Strathmore Primary school", 1409.0, 1, 1, "The project will allow the school to have two teachers training in language and methodology to embed French into everyday teaching and learning at the school.\r\nIt will help the school follow the ethos of a Curriculum for Excellence, find partners abroad to work closely with to deliver this and allow pupils to use ICT to communicate with other schools in UK and abroad.\r\nThe project will  improve the competencies of the staff member by assisting him to acquire and learn new vocabulary, improve and develop new teaching practices and gain confidence and competence at delivering French within a Curriculum for Excellence. It will enhance understanding, awareness and appreciation of the culture of modern France.\r\nThe immersion training offers opportunities to develop new teaching methods and tools. It will develop the confidence of the participant to establish formal links with French schools and allow children from both Scotland and France to develop friendships and bonds and understand similarities and differences in school life and their wider culture.\r\nThe staff member identified is a primary school teacher currently working in the second level. He has demonstrated a keen passion for integrating French into his teaching through participation in the  Scottish Government 1 + 2 initiative and other modern language CPD activities. The training offers opportunities for the participant to improve his language competency and enhance his teaching skills to deliver engaging French lessons to primary school aged children.\r\nThis will be achieved through assisting the participant to:\r\n\u2022 Improve methodological expertise in the teaching of French to young learners\r\n\u2022 Acquire materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of the French at primary level\r\n\u2022 Develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France, including the education system \r\n\u2022 Improve his competence and performance in speaking and teaching French\r\n\u2022 Use relevant, engaging internet and other ICT resources in his class.\r\nThe course will provide the participant with greater confidence and ability to teach Modern Foreign Languages and a greater cultural awareness which can be transferred to pupils. It will improve his teaching methodology for languages within the school and embed French on a cross curriculum level. This will allow staff to start teaching French in a more ad hoc way, several times a week rather than just 1 session per week.\r\nAll new resources will be placed on a shared drive within the school, to help learning and teaching throughout the school.\r\nThe activities will rase awareness of the importance of languages and Europe within the school to pupils, staff, parents and other stakeholders.\r\nThere will be ongoing dissemination activities related to mobility to raise awareness.  It is anticipated that new CPD opportunities training materials will be created within school and the cluster. \r\nSocial media, brochures, blogs, press articles in the local newspapers, exhibitions and open events in school will all be used to promote greater awareness of French language learning in the school.

At present, following the introduction of the PLPlatform, we are teaching French throughout all stages of the school. As a result, pupils will be learning French from Nursery to Primary 7 and progressing further with their spoken language skills and vocabulary knowledge than ever before. This requires the need for more skilled, knowledgeable,competent and trained staff members to implement this long term strategy effectively. Spanish has also been identified as our third language and is planned to be taught from summer 2017. Presently, there are no Spanish speaking staff members at Whitehills Primary School and this identified as a development need. The upper stages (P5-P7) require a trained and knowledgeable staff member to help plan and cascade learning and teaching opportunities. \r\n  The opportunity to attend these courses will enable our school to continue to create close ties to both local and international schools and facilitate networking opportunities between native French and Spanish teachers and ourselves. We aim to achieve this goal through use of E-twinning. The school has currently been working alongside our local language staff tutor to help set up links with primary schools in France and this will be similar to the links created with schools in Spain. Through the immersion experience, staff members will have a deeper and broader understanding of the cultures in both countries, which in turn can be passed on to the pupils in our school. This will develop their curiosity and appreciation of what are the similarities between France / Spain and Scotland. \r\n  Following attendance on the immersion courses, training CPD events will be held both within our school as well as the opportunity to share and cascade the learning with other colleagues within the area. Parents will benefit as pupils will share their learning through close home-school links in addition to on-going class assemblies, open afternoons and parents evenings.

These skills will be essential in the successful deliverance of the recommendations of the 1+2 Modern Language policy that is being actively implemented within Angus schools. Knowledge and skills gained will further deepen and enhance the learning experience of the pupils with the future aim of raising the awareness of the importance of Modern Languages in the field of potential future employment of our pupils.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to improve the confidence and competence of the participants in order that they can take forward and support the 1+2 initiative across the staff team and with cluster colleagues:\r\n\r\n* to enhance our own conversational French and to gain new ideas for the classroom\r\n* to develop and maintain a bank of resources to use in the classroom - ICT/Internet, books, songs and films, etc\r\n* to develop cultural awareness and an understanding of modern day living in France\r\n* to improve pedagogy\r\n\r\nThe school is applying for places for four members of staff. As a small rural school we are intending that the staff will cascade knowledge gained and be vital in the development of language skills and knowledge within the school and associated cluster schools. One member of staff will use her knowledge gained to direct the development of the school aims in her role as Head Teacher, she has Higher French and is keen to develop her existing cultural knowledge. The three other members of staff applying will have responsibility within their nursery/teaching stage to oversee progression and use skills gained to effectively and progressively deliver the curriculum within both their own classes and those of their colleagues.  The three members of staff have studied languages at secondary school level and have previous experiences of  Modern life in European countries through their travels to the continent.  One member of staff has lived and worked abroad in the past.\r\n\r\nThe week long Immersion trip will provide daily opportunities to gain further skills in Languages and cultural knowledge through studies of a range of pedagogical techniques, experiences as both teacher and pupil and complete immersion in the language and culture through visits to a range of sites. All of these will greatly improve the individual's skills in the effective teaching of a modern language.\r\n\r\nThe intensive, week long professional learning experience will provide the practical/interactive model of how to teach modern foreign language effectively.  Therefore, it would be expected that the group of participants from Tannadice come back and put together a series of workshops for staff to bolster the planned improvement work which will be supported by Richard Talleron,  Power Platform. \r\n\r\nThe experience will provide us with strong links with practitioners in France and will increase our capacity to 'deliver' French well through better pedagogy, access to resources and materials, ICT and knowledge of modern day France.  It will allow us to work with our children in ways which will motivate them to learn and we will use assessment is for learning (AifL) approaches to check ongoing progress and to set and fulfil next step targets with our children so that our decisions about children's competencies are well placed and the pace of learning suited to ongoing achievements.\r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefits are extremely positive given that one member of staff is currently seconded to development services within the authority and funded by the Scottish Government as a Staff Tutor for Modern Foreign Languages.
