An international experience is part of the career planning that is central to ROCMN's philososphy. Students are at the start of their career and while studying for a vocation need to plan ahead as a worker and citizen of the future. For a number of students an international experience is part of this equasion as it offers them new opportunities to acquire skills such as:\r\n\r\n- personal skills (independence, flexibility, problem-solving)\r\n\r\n- intercultural skills\r\n\r\n- language skills.\r\n\r\nROCMN promotes these international activities and supports students who would like to participate. Promotion is organised in several different manners of which the most important are: presentations to students by the coordinators, special page per college on e-learning system, Facebook and special attention to international opportunities at open days. Furthermore it is a regular topic during mentoring as part of career development. \r\n\r\nMost students go on a long-term placement (12 weeks or more) on an individual bases and in period that is set by the vocational department. Therefore the system is very flexible and individual. Each student receives personal attention by the coordinator who will discuss the students needs and requirements extensively with the partner institution. These are complementary to the standard requirements of the qualification that have to be met as with any other placement in the Netherlands as  accreditation of the host company and an agreement (POK). The student uses an online step by step approach to prepare for the placement and to fulfil all the requirements of the ERASMUS+ programme. There is also a preparatory programme on Blackboard with helps the students to be better prepared for the circumstances in a different country and in a different company.\r\n\r\nDuring the placement the student is supported by the placement coordinator (through telephone, e-mail and Skype) and by the partner institution. This network of experienced support around students is working very well and much is due to the long standing relations theROC Midden Nederland has with the partners of this project. Of course ROCC Midden Nederland also provides these services to students of partner institutions. \r\n\r\nAfter their return students have to provide documentation to proof that they have met requirements of the qualification as well as the requirements of European funding.

The characteristics mentioned above are developed during an international mobility in a way that would not happen if they did their placements in Finland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll hosting organizations, representing 11 different countries, are familiar with Axxell since before. This makes the cooperation and communication easier. LearnMob offers mobilities for youth and adult learners at the basic, further vocational and specialist vocational qualification (109  mobilities) and staff working in VET (53 mobilities) in the academic years 2014-2015 & 2015-2016 .\r\n\r\nAxxell strives for equality in international mobilities. Until now, only students of basic VET participated in international mobilities at Axxell . Through LearnMob Axxell wants to improve the equality in regards to international mobilities by including students at further vocational and specialist vocational qualification in the mobilities. In order to increase the equality of learner and staff mobilities, each unit/sector will be encouraged to send participants on mobilities. When selecting the participants focus is on who has the most to gain by taking part in a LearnMob mobility. Of the 102 mobilities reserved for students, 18 will be reserved for students who have fewer opportunities to participate in international mobilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready at the application stage, the objectives, expected results, dissemination etc. have been discussed by Axxell and the hosting partners. A Letter of Intent has been signed by Axxell and the hosting partners. The project has a cost account/project number for costs arriving during and by the project. The international coordinator is responsible for project management and the international contact persons are responsible for the practical arrangements and the preparations done before, during and after a mobility.\r\n\r\nLearnMob offeres the following possibilities for mobilities for staff: 1 ) Teaching at a vocational school and 2 ) Studyvisits with a focus on developing international exchanges and deepening the professional skills within VET. Through LearnMob learners can participate in international mobilities by working in an appropriate workplace arranged by the host organization. The length of the mobility varies from 3 to 16 weeks (students) and 3 - 10 days (staff).

The main WELVET results and impact can be summarised as follows:- for VET trainers: increased knowledge as to wellness skills development process and especially the wellness instructor job specifics; improved training skills to deliver high quality VET through new content (wellness instructor) and digital tools (WELVET mobile app); improved self-esteem and self-belief as VET trainers; greater understanding of interconnections between vocational training and labour market demand. - for VET learners (current and future staff of the wellness industry): increased knowledge and skills to perform effectively as wellness instructors on national and European level; wellness mindset to ensure maintaining high-quality customer service; better employability in the tourism sector and more specifically the wellness segment. - for WELVET partners: increased volume of transnational cooperation and exchange of good practices; integration of the know-how exchanged and synthesized during the project lifecycle into their daily activities related to preparing trainers and learners for the wellness industry;  positioning of partner organisations as a pioneers on European level in the provision of innovative and labour market-driven solutions in the field.- for other stakeholders: raised awareness as to the benefits of introducing VET courses to match growing staff and skills demand of expanding wellness industry; raised awareness of the need to ensure investments for equipping VET trainers with the respective set of skills and knowledge in the field; increased evidence base for policy making in the field of introducing new wellness occupations for VET provision; increased quality of VET provision for the wellness sector; increased synergies and links between education and business. The long-term impact of introducing more VET learning opportunities for the wellness industry is related to increased relevance of VET as a whole to the realities of current and future tendencies in development of European and international economy and tourism sector in particular.", "http://www.stevensassoc.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BG01-KA202-023690_3"]]}}, "9FA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Activating Innovative Learners", "Pontlliw Primary School", 71438.0, 6, 6, "There have been a great number of changes in education systems worldwide recently. Typically schools had an isolated control over pupils' education, preparing learners for exams before continuing onto further education or work. Thus, teaching was mostly exam preparation or exam training, especially in the final years of the secondary schools.  The learners of the 21st century need innovative methods integrated into the teaching process. Students are motivated by solving real-world problems and express a preference for doing rather than listening.Good pedagogy encourages the following:- development of critical thinking to find solutions- learners are given the opportunity to reflect on their learning, both individually and as a team - active engagement with concepts, facts, models and procedures linked to real-life context- creative use of emerging technologies to promote learning, prepare for a working life- collaboration as an integral part of the school curriculum within the school and with external agents- interdisciplinary perspective has entered education with ICT being a key skill used across the curriculum  - students must get accustomed to integrated assessment that reflects real-world evaluation processesWe have created a project which is centered around a series of 5 activities using recently available technologies and their respective software / hardware requirements. Our activities have the broad titles:EntrepreneurshipJournalismLanguage SkillsBroadcastingAnimationWe  intend to use these as the vehicle for delivering different aspects of the curriculum.  Our target groups of teachers, student teachers and pupils will hopefully see an improvement in attainment whilst developing many Key Action 2 competences (School avoiders, entrepreneurship, linguistic skills, cross-sector cooperation, active citizenship, innovation)", "http://www.pontlliwprimary.co.uk", "Pontlliw Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024367_coordinator"]]}}}}
