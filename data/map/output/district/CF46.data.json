The increasing variability of both supply and consumption will also require more sophisticated and optimized decision making.<br/>To achieve a step change in water and energy savings we propose to apply and test an intelligent ICT system for 'real time abstraction & discharge monitoring'. This will create an open, scalable, marketable and user-friendly system to optimise water resource management and replace the current licensing system. An innovative 'just-in time' ability will be applied to create substantial water savings, whilst also enhancing delivery on EU Water Framework Directive obligations.  The WISDOM approach will combine different innovative technologies (including smart ICT components and decision support system) to integrate water distribution, real time sensor monitoring and high power computing networks to (a) improve household, business and societal awareness, (b) induce changes in consumer behaviour, (c) enable the introduction of innovative resource and demand management schemes, (d) pave the way to adaptive pricing incentives, and (e) develop and demonstrate widely applicable concepts for energy recovery from water use, enhancing the water-energy nexus.<br/>The WISDOM project strategy fundamentally relies on a comprehensive R&D and demonstration approach. The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and water distribution network, then tested at an intermediate level in a full-scale experimental facility in France (AQUASIM) before being finally installed, monitored and evaluated in two pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK (Cardiff - Wales) and Italy (La Spezia).<br/>These demonstrators will be used to assess the societal, environmental and economic benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout all countries and differing European areas. The major resultant impact from WISDOM will be (a) increased user awareness and modified behaviours concerning the use of water, (b) quantifiable and significant reduction of water consumption, (c) peak-period reduction of water and energy distribution loads, (d) improved resource efficiency and business operations of water utilities due to ICT, and (e) contribute to the improvement of the environmental performance of buildings. In addition, WISDOM will promote the development of a complete value chain covering all stakeholders in the water usage cycle including the establishment of strategic partnerships between ICT equipment providers, software companies and water authorities to pave the way to a Europe wide, and beyond, exploitation of the WISDOM technology.", 174299.0, 3445150.0, 5, 13, "WISDOM", null, null, null, "fp7_189138_997217910"], [1264982400000, 1391126400000, "PREPARED \u201cENABLING CHANGE\u201d", "Dwr Cymru Cyfyngedig", "IPCC climate change scenarios have a global perspective and need to be scaled down to the local level, where decision makers have to balance risks and investment costs. Very high investments might be a waste of money and too little investment could result in unacceptable risk for the local community. PREPARED is industry driven, 12 city utilities are involved in the project and the RDT carried out is based on the impacts of climate change the water supply and sanitation industry has identifed as a challenge for the years to come. The result of PREPARED will be an infrastructure for waste water, drinking water and storm water management that will not only be able better cope with new scenarios on climate change but that is also managed in a optimal way. We will have complexes monitoring and sensor systems, better integration and handling of complex data, better exploitation of existing infrastructures through improved real time control, new design concepts and guidelines for more flexible and more robust infrastructures. PREPARED will involve the local community in problem identification and in jointly finding acceptable system solutions, that are supported by all, through active learning processes. Activities and solutions in PREPARED will be based on a risk assessment and risk management approach for the whole urban water cycle, through the development of innovative Water Cycle Safety Plans. Other innovations are sensors and models that will enable faster and better actions on changes and new design rules for more resilient design. We will combine European knowledge with valuable knowledge from Australia and the USA, to make the European Water sector more competitive. This to enable our industrial partners to export the products developed in PREPARED to other regions of the world, thus contributing to the Lisbon Goals but also to the MDGs. To ensure this exploitation the PREPARED consortium consist of more than 50% industrial partners and is demand driven.", 14476.0, 9023107.0, 15, 37, "PREPARED", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725905.jpg", "fp7_93955_997217910"]]}}}}
