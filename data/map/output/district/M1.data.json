The historically accurate stories of Tamura, Ardala and Nanisca are supported by dramatic re-enactments, CG animation and interviews with historians, archaeologists and modern-day women soldiers.  Other historic examples of female warriors from a diverse range of cultures and centuries shed light on the military achievements and lessons learned by our heroines.Episode 1 \u2013 THE REAL AMAZONS drama section features Tamura, an outstanding horse warrior of the Sauro-Sarmatians, first encountered in 5th century BC by the ancient Greek army in modern-day Ukraine.Episode 2 \u2013 GLADIATRIX features the life of Ardala, a Gaul warrior captive, recruited into a gladiator school in a Mediterranean outpost of the Roman Empire in 1st century AD.Episode 3 \u2013 MINO \u2018VIRGIN\u2019 WARRIORS features 10-year old Nanisca who is forcefully recruited into an all-female army that expanded the West-African Kingdom of Dahomey to protect its slave trade in the 19th century.", "http://www.urbancanyons.tv", "URBAN CANYONS LIMITED", "creative_572297-CREA-1-2016-1-UK-MED-TV_coordinator"], [1386806400000, 1465603200000, "Samurai Warrior Queens", "URBAN CANYONS LIMITED", 41870.0, 1, 1, "The legends of the heroic Samurai seem to be an all-male affair; but for over 800 years, Samurai women stood their ground in one-on-one fights, open battles and castle sieges.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

Therefore, we don\u2019t actually know which teaching and learning methods are effective. Also companies are lacking tools and knowledge to assess these competencies in various settings: in recruitment processes and internal development activities. Unawareness of innovation competencies causes great economic losses for employers annually. The FINCODA project, with a significant number of universities and innovation-intensive companies from 5 countries, aims at providing solutions for a solid path for forthcoming innovators from university to companies. We shall test new forms of enhancing innovation competencies in university-company cooperation. Real-life learning environments bring added value for all stakeholders and lower the students\u2019 threshold to enter the working life. As a main tangible output of the project we are creating and validating a Software Application tool for innovation competencies assessment. It will be available as an OER. We shall also illustrate that - especially when speaking about innovation competencies \u2013 well-organized and structured behaviour assessment can be at the same time cost-effective, reliable, valid and value adding, compared to traditional written tests. European-wide challenges demand multinational solutions. Investments to innovation competencies development gain positive impacts to the competitiveness of European companies.
