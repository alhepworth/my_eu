Currently osteoporosis is commonly known as a \u201csilent killer\u201d disease. Usually osteoporosis manifests itself in a drastic manner, i.e. through fracture of the osteoporotic bone in the affected individual. Until now little or no measures for prevention or early detection of this disease are taken, because no simple, yet sufficiently precise or sensitive tools for early detection of individuals at risk of osteoporosis are available. The overall objective of the currently proposed PoCOsteo project therefore is the development, clinical validation and preparation for commercialisation of a Point-of-Care tool for bone disease (a.o. osteoporisis) prevention, detection and treatment. To realize this objective a balanced consortium of 5 research partners and 3 SME\u2019s has been brought together, and a well considered workplan devised. Two TRL3 technologies for individual proteomic and genomic electrochemical sensors, available from 2 consortium partners will form the base of the developments. The sensors will be further optimised, combined in a single microfluidic cartridge and integrated in a complete and  independent point-of-care bone health assessment tool. The tool will consequently be clinically validated in 2 hospitals (Graz and Tehran), and a business plan for a commercial start-up company wil be prepared for the intended valorisation of the technical and medical activities. The aim is to reach a TRL6 / TRL7 for the complete tool and for the combined microfluidci cartridges. The project will be supported and advised by the IOF, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, which is the main global alliance of patient societies, research organizations, healthcare professionals and international companies working to promote bone, muscle and joint health.", 694428.0, 3493364.0, 6, 8, "PoCOsteo", null, "http://www.labman.co.uk", null, "h2020_211288_989875980"], [1283299200000, 1433030400000, "Magnetic Isolation and moleculaR Analysis of single CircuLating and disseminated tumor cElls on chip", "Labman Automation Ltd", "Cancer remains a prominent health concern afflicting modern societies. Continuous innovations and introduction of new technologies are essential to level or even reduce current healthcare spending. As the analysis of occult tumour cells (OTC) in blood or bone marrow is most promising in this respect, MIRACLE aims to develop a low-cost, fully automated, integrated lab-on-a-chip (LOC) system for the isolation, counting and characterization of OTCs starting from clinical samples.A major challenge for OTC detection is their extremely low concentration (below a single cell per mL) in clinical samples. Current detection methods are often based on enrichment techniques followed by cumbersome microscopic analysis of the cell phenotype. Some of these procedure steps have been semi-automated (Cellsearch\u00ae, J&amp;J), but the interpretation of the cell morphology requires expertise and remains partially subjective. In contrary to standard phenotyping tests, MIRACLE aims to determine the genotype by integrating all sample processing and detection steps in a miniaturized system. This envisaged, fully-automated MIRACLE test would yield decisive results within half a day for less than 50 EUR, as compared with contemporary diagnostics tests that may take days.With the essential individual modules recently demonstrated on automated chips in a joint project by some of the partners involved (MASCOT FP6 027652), the MIRACLE's consortium is uniquely positioned to lead the project's main objectives to a successful outcome, well ahead of the current state-of-the-art. Combining the team's multidisciplinary and unique expertise avoids unnecessary overlap. Integrating all components into a fully operational LOC platform will represent an immense advance for Europe to cope with interfacing and integration problems generic to microfluidic and smart miniaturized systems.

The huge market demand is currently met almost exclusively by synthetic, mainly petroleum-based, chemical products, which are usually non-biodegradable and mostly toxic or GM plant based products (used in foods), which are undesirable by some end-users. Their biologically produced counterparts (i.e. bio-surfactants and bio-emulsifiers) offer more green sustainable alternatives.
