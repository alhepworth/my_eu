Horses and ponies are principally identified by a paper based \u2018passport\u2019, and/or micro-chip, or branding.  Passports are hand written and therefore prone to error, falsification and fraud. They can easily be \u2018recycled\u2019 from dead animals allowing contaminated horsemeat to enter the human food chain. Likewise, micro-chips can easily be removed or cloned. Purchasers of equidae have little assurance that \u2018their animal\u2019 is the one in the passport.\n\nEquine Register Ltd. are developing an exciting new equine identification method for vets, government agencies, welfare organisations and horse owners - EQR-Equid. Our solution uses an inclusive secure, remote-access data system underpinned by smart behavioural pattern recognition algorithms, that can automatically identify disease spread, criminal activity, missing animals and compliance issues. Via an intuitive interface, EQR-Equid allows equine sector stakeholders to identify and track an animal securely from anywhere, at any time, whilst enabling enforcement agencies to target their resources. EQR-Equid\u2019s accuracy, connectivity and immediacy will deliver increases in animal welfare, animal value, compliance and data confidence whilst reducing the opportunity for fraudulent activity.\n\nThe objective of our overall innovation project is to develop EQR-Equid for sale to those involved in the trade, enforcement, and welfare of equidae. The specific objectives of our Phase I project are to carry out a feasibility study to enable us to create a clear path for market replication.

The current method of linking these parts together is by mechanical coupling. Effective decontamination of such instruments is challenging but is critical to avoid cross infection between patients. The geometry of the instrument assembly (particularly bone reamers and similar tools used in joint implants) have crevices at the joints which are difficult and expensive to clean and fully sterilise. Welded instruments would eliminate this problem.\n\nApproximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. The CleanTools project aims to develop technology which will reduce this issue by making surgical instruments easier to clean and disinfect. The crevice between stainless steel cutting heads and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) flexible shafts currently makes decontamination challenging, time consuming and chemically intensive. Additionally there have been instances of cutting heads becoming detached from the flexible drive shaft during use, causing undue implications in theatre and potential long term impacts on patient quality of life.\n\nThe desirable materials for these tools, such as SMAs and stainless steels, are challenging to weld and their properties are severely degraded when they are melted in conventional welding. CleanTools will provide a method for the manufacture of surgical instruments containing SMA materials though the use of rotary friction welding (RFW).

This has led to an increased awareness about the importance and specific management of veteran trees. As defined in the VETree project, there is now an increased number of training possibilities on the subject: now that the project has ended, both partner organisations and others continue organising the VETree basic course or have included veteran tree management in arboricultural and forestry training. In addition translations to additional languages are being produced. Nevertheless, there is no formal recognition of skills and knowledge in veteran tree management. When contracting an arboricultural professional, regardless of  any previous training, it is impossible to assess whether he or she has reached the required minimum level of skills and knowledge to complete the assignment. When dealing with invaluable and irreplaceable veteran and ancient trees with high cultural, landscape and ecological values, owners and site managers are reluctant to delegate work to unfamiliar contractors, leading to non-transparent tender procedures and market foreclosure. This project aims at harmonising skills recognition in veteran tree management, which will increase mobility of tree workers across Europe and raise standards in veteran tree care across Europe. This goal will be pursued by defining a common European minimum level of skills and knowledge for arboricultural and forestry professionals and defining a clear and objective certification procedure to test the skills and knowledge level in veteran tree management of arborists and foresters. To optimise the design of the VETcert certification procedure, the project will start with a survey of existing certification and assessment schemes, both within arboriculture and forestry and beyond. The combined network of all project partners allows for an almost complete coverage of certification initiatives on a global, European, national and regional level. Starting from this survey will assure that we include best practices in certification and that we avoid common pitfalls in the setup of a certification scheme.Parallel to the survey of certification schemes, national/regional/informal standards in veteran tree management will be collected and reviewed. For this, we can partially rely on work already done during the VETree project (survey of training material). Based on this input a common European minimum standard in veteran tree management skills and knowledge level will be developed. This will be done at 2 operational levels: a European minimum standard for practicing arborists/foresters and a European minimum standard for consulting arborists/foresters. Since arboriculture and forestry are generally not  an 'exact science', different approaches exist to veteran tree management. The wide geographic distribution and diverse background of the partnership, along with thorough testing and extensive feedback loops with all stakeholders, will ensure that different approaches to veteran tree management are taken into account while developing the standards and thus that the project's products will have a wide acceptance.Once the standards have been developed, comparison with existing training material (mainly as a result of the VETree project) will allow the  detection of possible gaps. The project will aim to fill key gaps, which we anticipate may largely relate to the need for very practical based training which may be best fulfilled by using visual media such as videos and still photographs, and case studies.Once the common standards have been agreed upon, the VETcert certification and examination procedure will be designed for each operational level (practicing/consulting), as an add-on to existing certification schemes. A key certification scheme to take into account will be the European Tree Worker/European Tree Technician certification, Europe's major arboricultural certification scheme, administered by the European Arboricultural Council (included in the partnership). Additional test case certification schemes will be national certification schemes in the UK, France and Czech Republic, countries where ETW/ETT is not (yet) widespread. This approach and the broad partnership with several key organisations will ensure an easy adoption of the VETCert certification products by the industry (both contracting parties and contractors) and a cost effective, low maintenance but secure future of the project's output.
