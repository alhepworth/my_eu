This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension.

Biosurfactants produced by fermentation offer a worthy alternative to traditional surfactants, which are typically derived from non-renewable petrochemical resources and may cause environmental problems due to their ecotoxicity and poor biodegradability. Despite the clear advantages of biosurfactants, their overall use is hampered by the lack of structural variation. This is in sharp contrast to chemically produced surfactants where one can introduce variation by simply changing the building blocks. Structural variation is essential as (bio)surfactants find application in a very broad range of sectors. This project aims to alleviate this fundamental limitation by developing a generic biotechnological production technology for glycolipid biosurfactants. This will in turn significantly broaden the range of commercial biosurfactants, satisfying the need for structural diversity in the market. It is expected that this technology will result in a breakthrough penetration of glycolipid biosurfactants in the overall surfactant market, in this way helping to build the bio-based economy.\nIndeed, biosurfactants are a promising target for the biobased economy as the world surfactant production exceeds 13 Mton/year and is meanly based on petrochemical raw materials.\n\nThe very efficient biosurfactant producing yeast C. bombicola will be metabolically engineered such that all structural parts of the glycolipid biosurfactant molecule can be controlled: fatty acid tail, sugar moiety, acetylation and lactonization.

This is particularly true for older adults in working age and employed in sedentary and arduous/strenuous jobs, whose work conditions may influence negatively this health problem and lead to severe chronic low back pain condition (Wong et al. 2017). Other reported risk factors include low educational status, stress, anxiety, depression, job dissatisfaction, low levels of social support in the workplace and whole-body vibration. Pain management is one of the most neglected aspects of healthcare and people suffering from chronic low back pain are often left without specific information, guidance and care from healthcare systems. Alternative treatments for managing or decreasing the pain include physical therapy and exercises, but awareness and adherence by patients is quite low.\r\n\r\nPROJECT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES\r\nThe main goal of the MY-RELIEF project is to enhance awareness of mature workers (55+ years) about the ways to monitor, limit and cope with chronic low back pain in all personal spheres (work, family, leisure etc.). We will develop an innovative health education to older adults working in sedentary or arduous/strenuous jobs for improving their knowledge and transversal skills about correct ergonomics, pain self-management and healthy behaviours to adopt for addressing the low back pain.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY \r\nWe will develop an innovative and motivating adult education package, which address current barriers to learning opportunities among our primary target group, including the following intellectual outputs (IOs):\r\n- MULTIMEDIAL TRAINING VIDEOS WITH WORKERS AND EXPERTS, to be created with mature workers with low back pain, their families and ergonomics experts in the five participating countries (Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, Lithuania and Portugal), explaining workers' needs, coping strategies and recommendations for daily life activities (IO1);\r\n - HEALTH EDUCATION HANDBOOK FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, which will offer tips, advice and recommendations to mature workers with low back pain on recommended physical exercises to perform for improving the health status, as well as relaxation techniques for improving mental well-being (IO2);\r\n- MOBILE-BASED SERIOUS GAME FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT, a mobile application which could enable mature workers with low back pain to manage virtually a series of cases and daily problems, leading to a learning experience through problem-solving tasks (IO3);\r\n- MASSIVE ONLINE OPEN COURSE (MOOC), which will include textual and multimedia training contents (also from previous outputs). It will be accessible to a broad audience also via mobile devices and will allow the certification of specific transversal skills acquired in a Coursera-like approach and released by Lund University (IO4).\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF TARGETED BENEFICIARIES\r\nWe will involve, in an interactive co-design, testing and dissemination process, over 2,500 participants, including mature workers with low back pain (primary target group), employers, employers' associations, unions, patients' associations, clinical units for chronic pain and other stakeholders (secondary target groups).\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT \r\nThe MY-RELIEF project will create a comprehensive adult education package, publicly available and usable also by mobile devices, at disposal of mature workers with low back pain for free in five official languages of the European Union (English, Italian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Swedish). The training package characteristics are expected to provide a motivating and enjoyable learning experience for a group of workers usually excluded by lifelong learning activities.

Additionally, the emerging legislation (Local Government Bill, 2013) in Northern Ireland will place a statutory duty on all new local authorities (\u2018Distinct Council\u2019) to facilitate a process of community planning to prepare \u2018community plans\u2019 for promoting the social, economic and environmental well-being of their area through identifying long-term objectives for achieving sustainable development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese developments are not exclusive to the United Kingdom, with other countries like Portugal and Italy going through a shift of the local and regional policy landscape, towards a stronger participation of the local communities and residents in the planning and delivery of public services, as well as in the development of spatial plans. This change has consequences for the Planning practice, on one side, and for the local communities themselves, in the other. Planners will need new skills and competencies in order to effectively engage with local communities, while the latter must also be provided with new capacities and skills to improve the quality and objectivity of their participation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Universities of Ulster (NI) and Aveiro (PT), the Politecnico di Milano (IT) and Community Places (NI) are the proponents of this project, aiming to tackle these needs through an integrated approach that prepares current and upcoming Planning practitioners and simultaneously local communities.  The partners in each country will be responsible for the local organisation and development of two main types of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first type, project partners will involve local communities and staff from the local authorities in a series of workshops to discuss and share experiences and ideas about Community Participation in Planning This will constitute the base work for a second series of workshops and taskforce meetings with the objective of developing a local model for Community Participation in Planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the second type, the Higher Education partners will design and test new teaching modules of Community Participation in Planning. These activities will also be informed by the ongoing developments taking place the first type of activity, in order to infuse the teaching with the knowledge and experience collected there. The curricula and teaching materials developed here will be available after the project is finished to allow other organisations to adopt or adapt them to their own teaching or training activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities of Blended Mobility will bring together members of the local communities (including both adult and young people), staff from local authorities involved and Higher Education students from all of the participating countries to receive further training for capacity building, network and share the progress done at each country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning and experiences developed over the project will be reflected on a publication titled \"Community Participation in Planning: Learning and Skills Framework\". This will be a policy document with guidelines on the processes, resources, skills and methodologies applied to realise the link between Community Participation and the diverse dimensions of Planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the project, it is expected that:\r\n\r\n- participants from each of the local communities (Belfast, Aveiro and Milan) will have new skills and capacities to engage in processes of community participation in the planning and delivery of public services, as well as in spatial planning;\r\n\r\n- Staff from local authorities will have an upgraded set of skills and methodologies to be able to better communicate and engage local communities in processes of community participation;\r\n\r\n- Higher Education students involved in the project will have new skills, capacities and access to methodologies which will allow them to answer the challenges posed to the Planning practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims to have an impact on both the curriculum of Planning degrees and the practice of Community Participation in Planning at all geographic levels. More specifically, it is ambitioned that further Higher Education organisations in the U.K., Italy, Portugal and other E.U. countries will adopt or adapt some of the new teaching modules developed over the project. It is equally ambitioned that local and regional statutory organisations, in the same range of countries, will take interest in the practices and framework of Community Participation in Planning developed over the project, and consider their adoption and development in their regions/municipalities.", "http://www.ulster.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA200-001803_coordinator"], [2017, "VET, BETTER SKILLS, BETTER JOBS", "UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER", 175893.0, 6, 21, "The  \"Vet,better,skills,better jobs\" project was created in response to the need of vocational schools to provide their students the opportunity to expand and improve the quality of their training practices in European companies.

This project will address the different aspects mentioned in the following way:\r\n-  Creating a reference point where all aspects of job search in any countries in Europe are collected.\r\nThe main points in this part of the project are: a list of companies where students can direct their job applications, guidelines for the development and creation of the Europass CV, methods to deal with different types of job interviews, both in their mother tongue and in other languages.\r\nThe tasks developed are: information and documentation, creation of web space, search and creation of a list of companies, conducting Europass CV, collecting information on job interviews and simulation and, finally, the presentation of these results.\r\nThese tasks are intended to provide students with the tools and necessary information to conduct a successful first job search and encourage their employment in the partner countries of the project.\r\n- Highlighting the differences and similarities of the legislation on labour and social security matters among European countries. This is an important issue of concern to workers when considering a European mobility for employment purposes. We will create different teams that will be made up of students from several European academic institutions and they should exchange information regarding contracts, trading systems, payslips, wage and non-wage concepts and payment of contributions.\r\nConducting training practices in Germany will reveal the aspects worked and transmit them to other students as the key part of the project.\r\nTeachers will explain the project and its goals in two introductory sessions. Several groups are made by members of all participating schools and we schedule the activities, including videoconferencing. Finally, the project findings will be published in eTwinning.\r\nThe eTwinning project will culminate with students performing the FCT (workplace training). Their experiences will be transmitted to other students using IT skills or throughout meetings on their return.\r\nThe aim of the results of this project has 5 main goals:\r\n- Increasing the number of students in vocational training courses.\r\n- Improving the quality of vocational training courses.\r\n- Improving the International Cooperation and the sense of belonging to the European Union.\r\n- Encouraging students to continue their studies with other vocational training courses (CFGS).\r\nIn addition, we will promote the increase of employment opportunities with elements such as mobility, the use of Europass CV or by improving the language skills.", "http://www.ulster.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037070_4"], [2018, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER", 36106.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
