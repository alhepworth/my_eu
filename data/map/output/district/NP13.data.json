CH4 is the second most important greenhouse gas, after CO2. At a global scale, livestock farming contributes up to 18% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The inhibition of CH4 formation by ruminants has long been an objective of ruminant nutritionists, but a number of barriers to the development of novel dietary additives have been identified. SMEthane is designed to remove the restriction that SME\u2019s face in successfully developing and marketing novel compounds, in particular plant extracts. We will establish research and development platforms to allow SME\u2019s to determine: the means of delivery of such compounds in the diet, knowledge of the dose response curve for such compounds under different production systems, the persistence of the inhibitory effect of such compounds on CH4 production over long periods of time and the potential \u2018side effects\u2019 such as change in flavour of the final animal product. SMEthane Research Consortium combines the capabilities of five major research and educational organizations from 4 European countries plus 6 enterprises with long experience in developing nutritional additives. The governance structure of the project has been established to ensure effective direction and management that maximizes the expertise and facilities available at each RTD to better meet SMEs\u2019 needs. Training and dissemination plan considered within SMEthane aim to provide training for the SME sector and its customer through different workshops based in key areas relevant to the development and usage of novel dietary additives to decrease CH4 emissions. An Exploitation and Dissemination Team will be responsible for decisions on knowledge management issues such as patenting, licensing and other exploitations of the project results.", 124907.0, 882591.0, 5, 10, "SMETHANE", null, "http://www.neembiotech.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-10/56383.jpg", "fp7_97038_988272085"], [1477958400000, 1604102400000, "Valorisation of mushroom agrowastes to obtain high value products", "Neem Biotech Ltd", "The project aims at the valorization of agricultural residues coming from mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) farming residues as a case to set up new cascading possibilities using innovative procedures to extract high value bio-based additives (antioxidants, antimicrobials, proteins), convert lipids into bioplasticizers and polysaccharides (glucans and fermentable sugars) into biopolymers using remaining side streams in substrates to close the agricultural cycle by composting and/or biogas synthesis. The funguschain project will demonstrate its industrial viability by building a new biorefinery that will use cost-effective extraction technologies (MAE and HWPE) revalorizing more than 65% of waste into valuable additives.\n\nThese additives will be incorporated into high added value products and industrially validated towards 3 key value chains in the European economy (food, cleaning and plastic sectors). Industrial lines from end-users will be modified and adapted to the developed products. These products are: food supplements for elderlies, cleaning products, novel biobased thermoplastic masterbatches, bioplasticizers and industrial film products (thin bags and gloves <15 microns, partially recycled thick bags >50 microns and mulching).\n\nA business strategy to valorise the products in a collaborative manner will be designed, leading to safe, sustainable, economically viable and attractive products acceptable to consumers. Partners will ensure that products meet legal and market requirements. The project will forge and propel industries growing within the frame of the European bioeconomy, boosting the community network.\n\nThe consortium involves 16 partners (4 RTDs, 4 Large industry and 8 SMEs) accounting with 5 BBI full members and 3 associate members. Funguschain project has a duration of 48 months and a total estimated budget of 8,143,661 M\u20ac plus 3,500,000M\u20ac in additional activities dedicated to the construction of the DEMO biorefinery plant.", 103283.0, 7104815.0, 10, 16, "FUNGUSCHAIN", null, "http://www.neembiotech.com", null, "h2020_205557_988272085"], [1341100800000, 1451520000000, "Innovative biological products for soil pest control", "Neem Biotech Ltd", "INBIOSOIL is a timely project that proposes novel eco-efficient environmentally friendly technologies substantially contributing to the reduced input of conventional chemical pesticides for the control of subterranean crop pests of global economic importance.  This would be accomplished through the generation of new formulations of biological control agents (BCAs) based on entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes within integrated pest management strategies. The strategies exploit synergies between BCAs which result in higher pest mortality. The proposed strategies: (1) contribute to reduced pesticide inputs in sustainable agricultural-horticultural systems, (2) offer potential savings for growers, (3) promote biodiversity and (4) offer solutions for both organic and conventional growers, thus ensuring the competitiveness of European growers. INBIOSOIL also includes risk assessment studies which should accelerate registration of new BCA products. The goals will be accomplished through 5 complementary work packages carried out by 15 European partners. The experienced, multidisciplinary team includes researchers from academia and SMEs. The project meets the challenges of globalization, climate change, and new plant protection policies leading to the production of high-quality and safer crops; it is in accordance with the scope of the Eco-Innovation call FP7-ENV-2011-3.1.9.-1.  INBIOSOIL contributes to implementation of EC regulation 1107/2009 and Directive 2009/128/EC which make it obligatory for EU Member States to implement principles of IPM with priority being given to non-chemical methods of integrated pest management.
