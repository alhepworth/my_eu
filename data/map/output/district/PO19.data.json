ROCWB has approximately 26000 students and 2600 staff members  on many different locations in the region. \r\nROCWB regards internationalisation as an integral part of vocational education and its operational business, meeting the core values of its strategic policy 2020: learning, developing and cooperating. Main goal is to offer our students every possibility to strengthen themselves in their future careers in higher education and/or on the labour market. They will be able to get grip on their future by focussing on skills and developing competences. And that\u2019s what we consider to be our core business. \r\n \r\n\r\nImportant themes are:\r\n\u2022  live long learning, career orientation and international career perspective  \r\n\u2022  decreasing early school leaving, inclusive learning and international mobility for underprivileged target groups. \r\n\u2022  implementation of ECVET instruments by using the learning agreement, learning outcomes and work based learning. \r\nIn ROCWB there is a growing interest in specific  vocational  learning- and working mobility\u2019s. Therefore, ROC West-Brabant  strives for sustainable international partnerships in learning- and working mobility\u2019s. It intensives the cooperation in international networks as a consequence of which more students, staff and alumni can have an international learning- and working experience. \r\nROC West-Brabant uses the PDCA-cycle in all its activities and ensures the quality of its mobility\u2019s by using the EVCET instruments, such as the Memorandum of Understanding, the Learning Agreement and the Europass documents in the E-portfolio environment of RocAbroad. \r\nThe long-lasting and sustainable cooperation with ECVET partners as Eucvet/Euriac, Eurocom, Stinfash and Inmain, will be prolonged by means of working-and learning mobility\u2019s (Euroclasses), resulting in mobility flows of 2 weeks up to and including 6 months in these target regions. \r\nROCWB invests extra in short vocational training courses of 3 weeks, which will be offered in cooperation with our European partners and our partners of the Global College Network. These are work based training courses in the UK in the framework of career orientation for school-based and work-based students.  In 2017, 75 students have done a learning mobility at our partner schools in the UK within the scope of vocational language training courses and intercultural sensitivity. For 2018 we see an increasement  of up to 120 students. As a result of the excellent feedback from the participants, with regards to learning outcomes and expected impact as preparation for working on an international labour market or for a follow-up study in higher vocational education, we plan to extend the programme to other countries such as Germany, Spain and Sweden and to focus in the future even more on target groups with regards to social inclusion.  \r\nThe international training   is a good preparation for working in a international labour market and / or for a continuation course in  vocational education.\r\nIn 2017-2018, minors in international learning were introduced and offered to the students of vocational education in the Netherlands. This mend an immediate increasing of numbers of trainee places abroad. The minor \u201cInternationalisation 2: working abroad\u201d is one of the minors that has been enthusiastically embraced by a significant amount of students. This has led to an increase of 85 students who made the decision to go abroad for the further development of their skills and competences. We also expect in the years to come, an significant increasing number of minors for  trainee places abroad.  \r\nIn October 2017 the Executive Board announced a significant change in direction.\r\nThe most important points of the change in direction for internationalisation are:\r\n1. Our vocational education will be reorganised and divided into different sectors and a separate a Start College will be formed for special target groups. \r\n2. We will close those units that do not directly contribute to our  primary goal: educating the youth in the region for future proof skilled labour / workmanship.  \r\n3.

These groups of learners face barriers to learning and accessing work which their peers do not and these learners often fall behind in their work and in attainment. They require an additional intervention in order to succeed and improve their future career and learning prospects. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nWe worked with learners with fewer opportunities who are underachieving on their courses who would benefit most from an intervention to broaden their opportunities. The objectives of the project addressed their issues and needs through:\r\n-Providing additional assessment and support opportunities to validate skills for learners to succeed in their qualifications\r\n-Boosting employability and mobility in the wider EU labour market through practical work experience\r\n-Raising participant's awareness and understanding of other cultures, countries and language to broaden their life perspective\r\n-Increasing self-esteem, confidence and motivation and social skills\r\nAccompanying adults had opportunities for continued professional development, increasing their motivation in working with groups with fewer opportunities and developed their teaching to include transnational perspectives.\r\nThe partners also worked together to modernise education and training in working with these groups by sharing best practice and utilizing innovative techniques in supporting learners with fewer opportunities to improve their learning performance and enhance the employability and mobility prospects. The project also reinforced and further developed the transnational scope of the partner organisations in working at an international level.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nParticipants consisted of learners with fewer opportunities studying on entry level and level 1 introductory vocational qualifications at Care Co-ops,  Chichester College and Aspire Sussex in the vocational areas of horticulture, catering and construction.  Most learners also had additional needs including mental health issues, learning disabilities, disadvantage, offending and drug and alcohol issues. The total number of learners who participated in the project is 192 with 64 accompanying adults. This was carried out over 16 mobility flows with an average of 12 learners and 4 accompanying adults per group.\r\n\r\nDescription of project activities\r\nTwo week work placements took place at Eco Chateau Training Hotel in the vocational areas of catering, horticulture and construction. The placement itinerary was jointly designed by course tutors from sending partner organisations and the host partner to build in opportunities for assessment where learner evidence is lacking for specific qualification units and a range of individual learning objectives specific to the participants. ECVET arrangements were developed to increase recognition of achievement. Outside of the working day, visits were organised to places relevant to their vocational areas such as to local food producers and visits to building projects. Participants also took part in cultural visits to places of interest, socialising with French people and sharing a meal in the local French community. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in carrying out the project\r\nThe project was managed within the Care Co-ops Quality and Project Management Framework. For mobility projects, this included the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nThe impact of the project on the learners was that they had increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. Participants also demonstrated increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad. Partner organisations have shared good practice through established networks and this will contribute to a larger dialogue about creative ways to engage learners with additional needs through mobility projects. Accompanying staff developed their professional skills in sharing practice with partner organisations on supporting learners with additional needs and experience increased motivation as a result. \r\n\r\nPotential long term benefits\r\nIn the long term we expect the project to have a significant impact on the learners' attitude towards work, learning and European work to increase their future prospects. Through further developing this model, we hope to share our learning more widely so that it can be adopted by other organisations for inclusion in future European mobility experiences.", "http://info@chichester.ac.uk", "The Platform Social Enterprise Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012228_2"], [2015, "Sustainable Transfer in West Brabant 2", "Chichester College", 176857.0, 12, 29, "ROC West-Brabant (ROCWB) is a regional centre of 8 colleges of vocational education and training, 10 Schools of pre-vocational education and a centre for Adult Education in the South of the Netherlands.

By becoming \"active citizens\" youngsters will interact with different European cultures, valuing the European identity itself and their sense of belonging to the Union. To accomplish these goals, the partners identified sport to be a language and a common tool of dialogue among all participants in the exchange.

It will  also substantiate the value and enhance their impact on the creative industries and even beyond.  In recent years there has been a rich reconsideration of the place of creative arts practice in research, addressing how practice can be understood as a method of research and how embodied arts and material thinking produces knowledge.  There has also been a growing number of doctorates completed through creative practice (which is variously called 'Artistic Research', 'Arts-based Research', 'Practice led Research'). However, dance and somatically informed performance, as a minority subject in many Universities, has received little direct attention in these discourses and frameworks and researchers in this field often work in isolating contexts with somewhat meagre infrastructure, networks, resources and channels to disseminate and support the work done.      ADiE seeks to address this gap by investigating practices and developing resources to support the significant developments in dance research that have the potential to reach beyond university frameworks to impact artistic innovation and the creative economy.The principal aim is to develop productive and meaningful provisions for PaR Doctorates that are suitable to the fluid, increasingly interdisciplinary and global, creative/research environments with which they intersect. Addressing the needs of research candidates, supervisors, universities and the creative industry the aim is to develop resources and guidelines that are directly relevant to the mobile nature of the creative industry and recognise the changing needs of the professional dance and performing arts sector. ADiE will therefore ensure that the rising number of artists entering into, and being nurtured by,  university environments receive the best possible support for their artistic/scholarly endeavors and are also well prepared to become our future leaders in the arts. ADiE asks: What are the expectations, perceptions and experiences of the Artistic Doctorate?What are the methodological tools and other training needs of artistic researchers in Dance and Performance?How are doctoral dissertations in artistic research best supervised and supported?How do doctoral studies through artistic research respond to, and prepare candidates for, the future?How might universities and creative partners better support artistic research doctorates and reflect the future needs of the creative industry and higher  education environments?  To address these questions ADiE will undertake four strands of work:1. Review the experiences/expectations of artistic doctoral candidates in different national contexts to identify best practices and gaps/ issues.2. Devise open educational resources / research training materials focusing in depth upon methodologies for artistic research in the public realm. 3. Develop guidelines that enable university & collaborative partners to better supervise and support the life cycle of Artistic Doctorates4. Dissemination & advocacy, including;  conferences and a 'virtual network' for doctoral candidates and supervisors.This is a collaboration across four high-ranking research/teaching institutions - Middlesex and Chichester Universities (UK),  Stockholm University of the Arts (Sweden) and University of the Arts, Helsinki (Finland), in partnership with four leading professional arts organisations - Dance4 (UK),  Kiasma Theatre - Museum of Contemporary Arts and Zodiak Centre for New Dance (Finland) and WELD (Sweden). This partnership will collaborate to undertake this comprehensive and in depth project that will bring wide ranging benefits. The partnership will in its first year investigate current provision and industry needs for creative practice doctorates in dance and performance in, and beyond, the partner countries. This assessment will enable the identification of common issues in provision and the relevance to creative industry.   In the second year we will develop much needed and innovative training materials, offer guidelines on effective support and supervision practices for PaR Doctorates and establish a rigorous shared support mechanism which will enable the dissemination of this good practice.
