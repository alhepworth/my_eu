We have no language specialist in our teaching team and staff have limited foreign language skills and expertise. The decision to choose French was therefore informed by the fact that our local high school teaches this subject to GCSE and there is also a wide range of commercial resources available to support our staff. \r\n\r\nAs headteacher, my vision for my pupils is for them to experience the positive aspects of European Culture and encourage diversity. \r\nWe want to provide our staff and children with more life opportunities as well as raising the profile of French and languages across school. We need to ensure every child has the opportunity to hear, speak, read and write in our French lessons and provide our infant children with more language opportunities. \r\n\r\nWe also want to provide our hearing impaired pupils with activities and techniques adapted to their needs, as they can find French lessons overwhelming. We need to find ways to support their learning and make sure they are included and engaed in all our French lessons. These courses will allow us to find new strategies and resources to help us meet every objective.\r\n\r\nWe plan to send 8 participants to Carcassonne in France, to take part in PQ France 8-day structured training courses. There will be 4 courses in total, spread out at intervals during the project duration of 2 years and participants will attend in pairs. \r\n\r\n- Participants will experience first-hand cultural experiences.\r\n- Improve their language proficiency and develop confidence.\r\n- Develop resources \r\n- Discover a range of learning techniques (including Makaton to support our HI children) \r\n\r\nThe project will impact the participants, the school, every member of staff, the children, parents and our local cluster schools.\r\n\r\nThe project will:\r\n\r\n\u2022 ensure improved confidence in the speaking, listening, reading and writing of French by both staff and pupils (including our Hearing Impaired children)\r\n\u2022 change both pupil and parent attitudes to European culture i.e. France, celebrating diversity and similarities\r\n\u2022 improve the subject knowledge of the French language and influence their teaching in other areas across the curriculum. \r\n\u2022 provide new, inspiring resources and activities in the teaching of French and French culture\r\n\u2022 ensure more awareness of the European culture for pupils, parents and school staff and an understanding of how this works in a post-Brexit world\r\n\u2022 promote professional development by providing staff with a unique first-hand training experience\r\n\u2022 ensure the school has \u2018language ambassadors\u2019 who can use their skills to provide support and expertise for other colleagues and schools in our cluster. \r\n\r\nOur long term aim is to develop a sustainable model to ensure every teacher in our school (and future teachers) can teach the French language to a high standard to every pupil.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we aim to ensure that our children learn French from KS1 onwards and  leave at the end of  year 6 with a love of the French language and culture, attainment above age expectation and are well prepared for high school and beyond.", "http://www.lowerdarwenprimary.co.uk", "Lower Darwen Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047022_coordinator"]]}}, "2RW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Freedom from Insularity", "Holy Trinity CE Primary School", 11165.0, 1, 1, "Holy Trinity is a \"Good school\" that serves a deprived community- deprived financially  and inspirationally.  Many parents myopically view school as a stage in a child's life one to be endured.  We however have offer the years engaged with parents and opened them to the burgeoning of new thoughts, hopes and aspirations for their children.  We hold the passionate belief that all our children can succeed and do all to make that a reality.\r\n\r\nThe project will use real experiences (links with real European peers) to motivate and sustain interest in the subject among children  of a very deprived area who have very little knowledge of any culture but their own.During the course participants will collect everyday items to be used as prompts for lessons as well as a wealth of ideas tried and tested by skilled  French language teachers.We will therefore be able to give pupils the opportunity to :\r\n\"Understand and respond to spoken and written language from a variety of authentic sources\"(DFE 2014 statutaary guidance).\r\n\r\nStaff expertise in language skills is low in the school, therefor the main focus is to develop skills of our Key stage 2 teaching staff so that all will eventually be able to deliver quality lessons in French at the appropriate level for their pupils.\r\n\r\nWe plan to send 6 staff to France over 2 years to develop their language skills\r\n\r\nThe objectives are, through the immersion course to create lead members of staff who will guide other teachers and sustain a collective enthusiasm for language teaching throughout school.\r\n\r\nWe aim to send 3 teachers each year on an 8 day immersion course during which they will receive tailor-made ,expert tuition on teaching French as a foreign language.\r\nMethodology will follow that outlined in the guidance from the Department For Education :including learning through very practical communication activities,songs,rhymes,drama and games.\r\n\r\nInitially the first participant will use this as a kick start to setting up a team teaching approach to introduce language lessons to the pupils of Key stage 2.\r\n\r\nProgress and impact will be monitored at regular planned points during the year of the project and decisions about participants and courses will be made in response to this.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated and disseminated; we expect the impact to be sustained and long term leading to better life choices for our children.\r\n\r\nAt Holy Trinity we face many challenges due to the high percentage of children with complex educational and emotional needs. We are excited by this project and are confident that when it takes flight it will ensure a high level of provision, giving many pupils a solid foundation for future engagement in the subject.\r\n\r\nDue to the challenges we face in terms of a high percentage of children with complex educational and emotional needs our staff have to be very hardworking and dedicated.
