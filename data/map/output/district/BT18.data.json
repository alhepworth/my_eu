Not only will they be able to further develop their language skills and technical abilities, but they will also acquire competences with respect to intercultural relations, entrepreneurship and communication.

Possible areas of performance and related LO, have already been identified by hosting partners as mentioned in section C of the application.This action will respond to the strategy of improving the quality of academic programs and adequately prepare students for the job market or university education; strengthening and enlarging the certification of non-formal skills (see internship); improve personal growth of individuals.B) 7 days international internship  (+ 2 days travel) for 5 teachers, tutors, carreer guidance counsellor in international training centres in United Kingdom, Spain, France and Czech Republic.This action will respond to the strategy of allowing a different way of \"doing school\" through continuous training of teachers and ATA; raise the quality level of international student mobility experiences and their skills certification.Both macro-actions will contribute towards achieving the objective of strengthening local, regional and international networking between training/education and job market. It should be unerlined that, in 2015-2016, the Institute has consolidated, in the preparatory phase of the actual proposal, relationships with training centres and international companies, already mentioned in its internationalization plan (e.g. Vuste Envis, Cap Ulysse), and created new contacts with companies able to identify and implement quality training in accordance with the participants\u2019 profile.In addition to the international mobility project, The Institute - in 2015 - has consolidated the relationship with local companies that declared their availability to participate in the selection process of candidates and to the final evaluation of the project and its impact. They have also identified apprentiship paths at local level to increase students occupability and training courses about tutoring an counseling for teachers to complement mobility experieneces in 2016-2017.Operational actions specifically for project management of the actual proposal are; -signing MOU for single professional profile;-Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the Vet card request.

Objectives of the course include enhancing participants\u2019 discursive skills, updating their vocabulary and allowing them to gain new ideas and materials for use in the classroom as well as enhancing methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish and French to teenagers.\r\nThis course would provide invaluable benefits to both participants, one of whom (Judith Connolly) has identified increasing her confidence in Spanish as a professional development need, as she teaches Spanish as her third Modern Foreign Language in school. The other member of staff (Jennifer Orr) has a strong desire and interest in maintaining a high level of French in order to teach it at A Level in future. There would be a clear impact on the pupils they will teach in the future and on the school as a whole, as each teacher passes on the material from the courses and the ideas acquired to their colleagues in the Modern Languages department and to others interested in the Spanish and French cultures. \r\nThrough participation in the project, the school will have the opportunity to establish and develop links with schools around Europe for collaboration in the future.", "http://www.sullivanupper.co.uk", "Sullivan Upper School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013174_coordinator"]]}}, "9HW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "YOUTH EXCHANGE PORTUGALETE \u2013 NORTHERN IRELAND 2018", "Holywood Family Trust", 27852.0, 2, 2, "Our entity has an extensive experience in working with Children and Youth at local level and we see in this call an opportunity to expand this work in the range of 16-18 years and thus, to continue contributing to the educational processes, projects and services we develope in our groups ranging from 4 years, Also as a background, the Municipal Youth Service has developed different proposals for training around European issues that have aroused interest in the local youth in particular:\r\n* Conference on Youth Employment and Mobility in the European Union (7-9 November 2013)\r\n* Meet Europe: European mobility training (June 22, 2016)\r\n\r\nThe project aims to offer young people from Portugalete aged between 16 and 18 an opportunity to coexist with other young people from Northern Ireland, learn about the opportunities offered by the European Union to this age group and exchange opinions, ideas, ... on social participation and democracy as a tool for change.\r\n\r\nThese are the objectives that our entity intends to cover with the project:\r\n- Promote knowledge of the countries of the European Union through the relationship between young people from different backgrounds.\r\n- Encourage the use of other languages.\r\n- To share experiences on issues shared between young people in the two countries, namely conflict resolution and citizen participation.\r\n- To facilitate the exchange of ideas on other topics of common interest with other young people from other countries.\r\n- To promote knowledge of Euskadi and our culture, ways of life, local customs, etc ...\r\n\r\nAltogether, 28 young people (14 for each participating entity) will participate directly between 16 and 18 years of age, accompanied by 4 group leaders (2 for each participating entity) with great experience in youth promotion and European programs.\r\n\r\nThe program will have different types of activities:\r\nA1.

Increasing the uptake of RES is crucial if Europe is to achieve ambitious energy and emission reduction targets. However, despite steep increases in energy prices the uptake of domestic RES is still very limited. The initial investment required means that the payback period frequently exceeds 20 years, which is a clear disincentive to homeowners. This is mainly due to the cost associated with integration of RES within domestic heating and hot water systems, and is especially relevant if a combination of RES are deployed. The efficiency of these technologies is also often limited due to the inherent mismatch between energy supply and consumption. This can be overcome by deploying a suitably sized thermal store. However, this is often difficult due to space constraints in existing homes. Furthermore, effective combination and use of multiple RES is complicated by the lack of standardised intelligent controls and the sheer number and types of systems available. These factors limit the appeal of RES and virtually prevent customers from adding capacity over time. The main objective of SmartHeat is to develop a platform technology for domestic heating and hot water that enables easy and cost effective integration and use of multiple RES. The key enabling technologies include: i) a common, intelligent control system capable of effectively utilising a combination of RES and thermal stores; ii) a modular phase change material store that enables increased thermal storage within existing buildings. We will be able to a) demonstrate up to 50% reduction in installation costs for a combination of RES; b) a 20% performance improvement for an air source heat pump and up to 25% for a solar thermal system. As a result we will be able to reduce payback by up to 50% for a wide range of RES, heating and hot water system combinations", 29070.0, 2271765.0, 7, 14, "SMARTHEAT", null, "http://www.hothousetechnologies.co.uk", null, "fp7_97982_992540085"]]}}}}
