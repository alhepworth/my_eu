By this our project will have benefit for 40% of the General High school students of Styria. \r\nThe autonomy of schools is one of the central reform themes of the current education reform in Austria. This changes the role and task assignments at all levels. School inspectors, as \"regional education managers\", should contribute more to a regional education planning. Autonomy requires new leadership skills from the head teachers. The mobility project is to be supported by internationalization, European opening and cooperation in the implementation of these objectives. Schools are given the opportunity to accentuate their own priorities. Due to international cooperation, the project participants can get to know successful models and take them into consideration for their work or school development. Training courses and conferences will give them new impetus and input on innovative methods. In order to promote international co-operation, it is important to develop further the knowledge as well as the competences of the participating educational staff by means of courses. Job shadowing is intended to help develop new learning and teaching methods, personnel development, quality assurance, new management and management processes and structures.\r\nThe project aims to strengthen the international network of both the participating schools as well as the authorities and institutions, the introduction of new measures in school development and improved professional competences, which will ultimately support the development and achievements of our pupils.", "http://www.anglolang.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034958_21"], [2017, "Towards Improved language Production Through Ongoing Pedagogic training  \r\nTIP TOP", "ANGLOLANG (SCARBOROUGH) LTD", 222066.0, 9, 22, "In spite of initiatives to foster the communicative approach of ELT in Austrian schools, ELT at primary schools has not really met the goals defined in the Austrian curriculum and in CEFR. On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language. As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria.

At the moment the Learn and Lead for Parents is being developed in the learning partnership programme funded by the Grundtvig agencies with the expected outcome to work out the \"Parent as a Leader\" program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResulting from this the organisational need is to strengthen staff training in order to be ready and qualified to deliver the Learn and Lead professional language programs (e.g. Parent as a Leader, Multiple Intelligencies, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeading by example seems to be a very important and highly desired way in our adult-training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of the BeLLL project are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR HARMONY: \r\n\r\n-to internationalize, modernize and professionalize\r\n\r\n-build networks of international contacts\r\n\r\n-actively participate in society and develop a sense of European citizenship and identity\r\n\r\n-increase the capacities, attractiveness and international dimension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STAFF\r\n\r\n- to develop new competencies, to be able to adopt to change within the organisation and grow as a professional\r\n\r\n- support the staff in the acquisition of competences with a view to improving their personal development\r\n\r\n- support the professional development of the staff\r\n\r\n- enhance notably language competences\r\n\r\n- raise awareness of other cultures and countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the number and profile of the participants, there are expected to be 20 participants (15 trainers, 3 managers and 2 admin staff) with mobilities in three countries (France, UK, Germany) participating in structured courses, coaching and job shadowing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will foster the development of each participant in the key areas defined prior to the mobility, be evaluated after the arrival and as well as 3 months after the arrival. This will help us monitor and evaluate the impact of the training. The project will be led by a project team (Project Manager, Project Support) who will be held responsible for the smooth running of the project (practical arrangements, mentoring, evaluation, communication with partners, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefit of this project will be in its great contribution to establishing the Learn and Lead Career Path of a Trainer. Harmony as a catalyst of the Learn and Lead strategy as well as a member of the international canSPEAK network has got a very good positon and reputation gained among the members. Based on this there is a very high probability that the Learn and Lead Training Career Path of a Trainers will be adopted and possibly developed by the members of network. \r\n\r\nThe Learn and Lead Career Path of a Trainer will be fully adopted by Harmony by 31st July 2016 and its associated schools within the USH network. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarmony as a coordinator of the strategic partnership aiming at establishing the Learn and Lead Training Academy which is going to  be developed during 2014-2017 with five more partner-organisations (Germand, Poland, Turkey, Czech Republic, France) will adopt this Learn and Lead Training Career Path of a Harmony Trainer into its training scheme and build upon it further on.", "http://www.anglolang.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA104-000115_1"], [2014, "Dezvoltarea competentelor profesorilor in vederea consilierii elevilor in problematica devenirii personale", "ANGLOLANG (SCARBOROUGH) LTD", 25185.0, 9, 13, "The project \u201cPersonal Development\u201d appeared out of the need to strengthen a weak link not only in our school \u2013 CNPR- but also in the whole Romanian school system.\r\n\r\nTeachers do not have the necessary skills and competences to counsel students on the path of \u201cliving together\u201d or \u201cbecoming\u201d, to help young people integrate in a permanently changing world, in a very flexible work market, to develop their ability of acknowledging their own potential, of developing their creative thinking, interacting with others and with oneself, of communicating and behaving pro-actively in view of a fulfilling future evolution.\r\n\r\nThe project intends to optimize the efficiency of the education process by finding solutions to organize the skills, experience, ideals, etc in a coherent personal development plan which will offer students the chance to have a continuously evolving satisfaction regarding their personal evolution. 15 teachers will take part in various courses in view of implementing the following project objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n\r\n1.

The teachers of our school will take part in 11 mobilities. Its primary purpose is to improve the skills of teaching by our teachers with the help of the latest technology. Because in our school we have already had a few tables and interactive whiteboards we would like to carry out more interesting classroom lessons during which students would learn with pleasure. We believe that the effective use of intuitive-to-use devices with touch screens, so tablets and interactive whiteboards will help our students develop their skills. In this way we not only improve the quality of education in our school, but also we meet the expectations of today's youth. As teachers we often observe that young people are so accustomed to the use of digital technology at every step of their lives that they acquire knowledge passed on a flat screen much faster than the one from the old fashioned books. We are sure the project will give us the opportunity to create and develop a more modern school, improve the linguistic competence of the employees, and above all, implement new technological tools.\r\nThere are three groups of teachers in the project:\r\n1. Two teachers of English, who in our previous project took part in the general course of the usage of the computers to conduct lessons. This time they will be taking a secialized training on which they will learn to use tablets and appropriate applications for conducting modern educational classes.\r\n2. Six teachers from our school will raise their skills during the course that connects the usage of modern technology in the classroom with improving language skills.

They are between 35 and 51 and they all hold a University degree.  5 of them have basic or no English language skills and no certificate to prove their English level and 2 of them have good enough English language skills. All of them have been very active implementing innovative projects in the school and are willing to develop and implement new projects. However, 5 of them realized that the lack of English language skills acted many times as a barrier in searching for information and resources on Internet, translating useful documents and liaising with teachers from eTwinning platform. The 7 teachers felt that they need more opportunities in order to meet teachers from abroad in order to develop their English competences and to initiate and implement new projects together with other teachers from the European Union. The 7 teachers use partially ICT tools in their teaching but they all feel that they need a qualitative training able to offer an overview regarding the best ICT tools, to help them to understand how they can use the ICT tools in teaching and to strengthen their confidence in using ICT tools. \r\n\r\nWe carefully selected the activities and the methods in order to achieve the proposed objectives.

Furthermore, the 7 teachers English language and ICT competences will be improved during their training in the United Kingdom, entitled \"Effective Use of Technology in Teaching\". The dissemination process will be complex and will include various activities at the local, national and international level in order to share the experience, to stimulate other teachers to improve their practice and to offer examples of the use of modern methods of teaching and the ICT tools in the daily practice. The implementation plan will be carefully monitored and evaluated in order to identify the progress in achieving the objectives, the potential obstacles and the most appropriate solutions.\r\n\r\nThe project's impact will become visible at the local, national and international level. The participants to this project will improve considerably their English language competences and this will increase significantly the quality of their work as they will be able to access different resources on Internet and to communicate with other teachers from the European Union. The participants will gain qualitative knowledge regarding the use of ICT tools and will become more confident in using ICT tools in their daily practice. The parents will have the chance to understand why is important to use modern methods and ICT tools in teaching as they will be invited to participate to different workshops organized in our school.  As a result, the parents will acknowledge that our organization is determined to promote qualitative educational services and to improve constantly the teaching practice. The pupils from our school will become more interested in learning and participating to the school's activities as teaching will become more attractive and stimulating. This will decrease considerably the abandon rate in our school. Furthermore, our organization will internationalize our mission as the 7 teachers will talk to other teachers from the European Union about our activities and experiences and two projects will be developed and implemented during the dissemination process together with other teachers from abroad. This will help other teachers from the European Union to learn from our experience and to improve their daily teaching. Furthermore, our organization will become more visible at the local, national and international level and more pupils will be willing to learn in our school.

Two other teachers joined them since they had the same thoughts. All four teachers saw a need in developing the school towards working in projects in the European dimension as well as developing their interdisciplinary work. Thus, there is a need to meet in understanding the use of new pedagogical approaches and tools as well as there is a need to understand how to implement these in the school. Moreover, the teachers also saw a need in further linguistic development in the English language since there is a need at the school to develop the education towards an international market that also contains young people working \"on the floor\u201d. Even more, the teachers saw possibilities of a more international transparency when working towards a more modern education with expanded pedagogical approaches and tools. In addition, they saw a need targeted towards an understanding between the education and an internationalisation. In this case networking and creating international contacts personally would be a focal point.The teachers found that to be able to develop and to acquire a new pedagogical foundation they need to develop the linguistic knowledge in the English language. They also need to acquire pedagogical approaches and tools to be able to work interdisciplinary as well as to work within the European dimension. This would improve their teaching qualities, benefit the value of attractiveness of their school and other schools. Furthermore, acquiring new competences will also lead to a more qualified work for a higher learning ability amongst the students. All this can be seen as a wish to develop the teachers' teaching competences, which can be achieved through a continuing professional development in another European country. The teachers agreed on that such development would occur when participating in international courses. Therefore the teachers found an experienced language school, which provides courses that would help them fulfilling their needs. Anglolang provides courses in LMT (Language & Methodology for Teachers in English) and CLIL (Content & Language Integrated Learning) courses, which would help the teachers to reach new objectives in which the European dimension would be a part.The objectives in the project are:- to develop the participants' professional competences through a linguistic development of the English language- to acquire new pedagogical approaches and tools and how to work with these interdisciplinary and internationally..- to develop the teachers' teaching qualifications, which will benefit the value of attraction of an education, primarily at the school and in the municipality but also to affect other schools in the country and internationally.- to find new ways of working within the European dimension, which will result in a more international perception.-  to construct a mainstay for new perspectives of how to work interdisciplinary and internationally amongst all the teachers at Tegelbruksskolan.- to find partners from other European countries to work in international projects. - to encourage a higher learning ability amongst the students and to serve as a tool to prepare them for the international labour market.The project will be divided into three phases. 1) attendance at an interactive 4 weeks' pre-course, which Anglolang provides. 2) attending the courses in LMT and CLIL. During the two phases, colleagues and other stakeholders will be able to follow the teachers work via a blog and Facebook. 3) post-work with evaluating the courses and compiling all the material and information about new pedagogical approaches and tools. This will be disseminated to colleagues at the school during work-based meetings as a work placement training as well as to schools in the municipality. Finally, there will other teachers in Sweden and internationally, who will receive information via the blog and in EST.

If somebody teaches a foreign language the best way how to improve teaching and speaking English is to be educated by English-speaking trainers, to be in a touch with native speakers and also to see and feel the atmosphere of the country.  Then your  teaching becomes more interesting, more enjoyable and more effective for both \u2013 students and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are as follows:\r\n- improved learning performance;\r\n- increased self-empowerment and self-esteem;\r\n- improved foreign language competences;\r\n- enhanced intercultural awareness;\r\n- better awareness of the EU values;\r\n- increased motivation for taking part in European projects in the future \r\n\r\nThe participants involved in the project are teachers who are originally teachers of other subjects.\r\nThus they do not feel confident and competent enough in the role of language teachers which reflects in their lessons and the lack of confidence in  their abilities and skills.\r\nThe retraining programme was very short and not intensive enough to give them enough experience and develop all necessary skills to perform their job to the highest standard.\r\n\r\nMain activities are structured courses aimed at the improvement of language competence as well as methodological skills.\r\nThe main activities will be carried our by Anglolang School, Scarborough which acts as a partner in this project.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact is on the institution, on the participants as well as on the target group of learners, mainly:\r\n\u2022 enriching  personal and professional competence\r\n\u2022 improvement of  language and communicative competence\r\n\u2022 the ability to create positive atmosphere in the classroom\r\n\u2022 growing professionally and personally, bringing new ideas and experience to the school\r\n\u2022 huge language benefit\r\n\u2022 adapting teaching to different learning styles & learning needs\r\n\u2022 adapting activities & tasks for different purposes and levels\r\n\u2022 update  knowledge and deepen experience of state of the art language teaching methodologies.\r\n\u2022 reinforcement of  good quality teaching\r\n\u2022 humanizing the teaching  process\r\n\u2022 training of other colleagues thus having a qualified and motivated staff\r\n\u2022 higher credit of the school among parents and pupils\r\n\u2022 possible international cooperation with other schools in the future\r\n\u2022 cooperation with other schools in the region sharing the best practises \r\n \u2022 learning which will be more enjoyable and memorable\r\n\u2022  students\u00b4deeper interest in learning \r\n\u2022 humour and vitality in lessons\r\n\u2022 relaxing and motivating learning environment\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will have long-term impact on the school as a whole, its teachers and students and will help it  gain better credit among parents as well as students and will be able to better prepare the pupils for their future life in the European Union and for their future studies within Slovakia and potentially abroad.\r\n\r\nThe school will be able to implement newly gained knowledge and skills into its curriculum and develop the other members of the staff on a regular basis.\r\nThe school is also planning to cooperate with other partners from abroad on international projects and exchange programmes within K2 of Erasmus plus.", "http://www.anglolang.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA101-000107_1"], [2016, "My w Europie - szkolenie nauczycieli", "ANGLOLANG (SCARBOROUGH) LTD", 4697.0, 2, 2, "The aim of the project \"We in Europe - the training  for teachers\" is to increase  the school staff competences in teaching and motivating students to learn English, involvement of the school community and town inhabitants to international activities.

The aim of the course is to learn teachers how to motivate students in learning English and help them to obtain good results and consequently develop their personality, key competences and raise their chances on the European labour market. The added value of the course is the significant opportunity to meet new teachers and get to know different educational systems and learning methods and exchange these knowledge and experience.The course enables teachers deeply penetrate the Great Britain culture and enlarges intercultural awareness.Teachers will be exposed to immediate contact with different culture, traditions, cultural heritage, language and various approaches to education therefore they will be able to understand and break down the prejudices and stereotypes and finally implement tolerance, frankness, communication and mutual understanding into the value system and subsequently transform these values to their students in the process of education. Of course, a space will be provided for evaluation of the course and feedback of the participants.The course will consist of theoretical and practical activities and provides:- new and practical teaching techniques, - a wide variety of communicative activities to develop students\u00b4 language competence, - using modern technology in teaching,- using authentic materials,- new approaches to vocabulary learning and using literature in the language classroom,- acquiring new ideas for motivating students to speak and express their ideas- increased awareness of how learning styles affect teaching- increased awareness of how cultural backgrounds can affect classroom dynamics- Increased knowledge of British culture, how to tolerate different cultures and how to eliminate prejudice,- created a network of teaching contacts within Europe due to information and skills exchange and also to be opened for further cooperation.The main aim of our participation in this project is, first of all, to emphasize the students\u00b4 motivation to learn English, to develop language competence, to motivate them to obtain better results and help them to be a successful member of society. This course also enlarges the teachers\u00b4 language competence and provides new perspective on English language teaching and strengthen their professionalism. At the same time teachers improve their competences in using new modern technologies and liven up their teaching methods and styles using interesting, creative and inspiring activities.The school management decided to send an English teacher for this course. The extended school management led short interviews and decided according to the results and personal interest of the individual applicants.The reason for choosing this teacher was not only her personal and professional enthusiasm to enhance the quality of education but also her effort to increase the students\u00b4 motivation in English language learning.Teachers\u00b4 selection was also influenced by the course dates. The time of summer school holidays restricted overall applicants\u00b4 interest. On the other hand our participant is also a teacher of civics and therefore she is the most competent person to transform and bring not only new approaches in teaching English but also values such as religious or culture tolerance, and cooperation into both teaching subjects and also to colleagues. Her intention is to enrich English lessons and make them more attractive, overcome the stereotype in English education and she wants students to face reality and not only made-up situations in the classroom.The methodology will be based on integration of theory and practice as well as sharing expertise and analyzing case studies. The following methods will be applied: - plenary, - discussions in pairs and small groups, - role plays, - interactive sessions, - workshops,- using interactive teaching aids, modern technologies and authentic materials.Participation of our teacher in this training course and in particular seminar activities makes English learning and teaching modern,  efficient and moreover positively influences the work with students in our school.Gained benefit for our school and participants as well is the significant opportunity to meet new teachers from different schools from abroad and initiate a new cooperation in another Erasmus+ project in the near future.In the long term this course helps participant to be more flexible, to obtain \"know-how\" in her work with students and last but not least to get a new motivation for teaching and to pay more attention to individual approach in teaching different students.

While the previous project provided school with IT equipment, literature, teachers\u00b4created pedagogical materials for students the objective of this project -\"Implementation CLIL method in the school curriculum\"  is to disseminate and enforce CLIL method,  not only at the local (our school, school magazine Preklepy, school radio), regional ( secondary  grammar schools in our region \"Open Day for public \" event)but even international level (EU schools via e-twinning cooperation). Our target is to promote and imply  learning and linguistic diversity in order to improve learning performance by CLIL method ( content langauge learning , teaching the subject via foreign langauge). Our aim is to reach the target group of  650  secondary students and 15 teachers, learning various subjects such as Geography, Social studies, Maths , Mother tongue ( Slovak language - literature) in foreign language (English, German, Russian) - in fact to reach the fact that each student will learn at least one subject via foreign language. Our institution will run a number of student-based activities, projects in different subjects in foreign languages (e.g. Famous composers - the one I admire Music lesson, Famous writers - the one I admire - Slovak , English, German, Russian langauges, Our town - Our country Geography ). We will organize the dissemination activities - OPEN DAY with CLIL lessons for parents, public representatives, public, other schools\u00b4staff and students.

The challenges of the Webquest will be shown in vouchers which will include QR codes with additional information and translations and/or recordings. The main goal of the gamification is to motivate and influence the users so that they reach goals and acquire habits, encouraging the player/student to participate, share and interact with different activities individually or with the community.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, we had to look for other schools who would like to join our adventure. Fortunately, this has been the easiest task thanks to the long history of Comenius projects of IES Sierra de G\u00e1dor. The school has links with other European schools that have developed into friendships. Also, we have  created new links through e-Twinning. This is the way in which we established contact with Giovanna Cannavaro, a Spanish teacher at I.C Vitaliano Brancati.  Mrs. Cannavaro has vast experience in e-Twinning projects and who has been awarded with  the European Quality label. Our associate in England is Graham School,  a school in which we had two Comenius projects focusing on performing arts and geography. The contact with the German school, Gesamteschule Battenberg, was established through the headmistress of Ortenbergschule in Frankenberg (an old Comenius partner). \r\n\r\nThanks to the services offered by social networking sites such as Skype and Whatsapp, we agreed on our objectives and the tasks to fulfill them: \r\n* To develop awareness in our students of the importantance of their origin and culture \r\n* To improve linguistic competences and to promote a plurilingual society \r\n* To promote intercultural societies and collaborative work between students and teachers both at school and outside school \r\n* To drive the development of key abilities using Etwinning and TIC tools \r\n\r\nIn order to implement these objectives we will carry out the following activities: \r\nA1:Project Logo Contest in e-Twinning.\r\nA2: Individual and group presentations in e-Twinning.\r\nA3: Video presentation of each town in e-Twinning.\r\nA4: Multilingual Pictionary in e-Twinning.\r\nA5: Guide of local sport activities in e-Twinning\r\nA6: Compilation of a list of typical products with their certificate of origin attached to them, a register of accommodation and restaurants available in each town.\r\nA7: Hiking trails and compilation of sports activites with the idea of promoting Geotourism. \r\nA8: Photography contest.\r\nA9: Webquest  de cada localidad\r\n\r\nTo disseminate our work and to make it useful for others, our  Webquest will be used by our own students in different subjects. The fact that all materials will be ellaborated by fellow students and teachers will be an incentive for students to use it. Our work  will also be published and offered to anybody interested in finding about our towns from a different perspective and to research tourist information.  We will also approach local groups related to education, the arts, charities, non-governamental groups, sport teams, or other community projects to use our website to showcase their work. \r\nWe will publish our Webquests in the Twinspace (public site of e-Twinning) but we will search for the support of the local autorities to spread it more widely through the local tourist offices, official tourists websites, local libraries, public places and exhibition events. \r\n\r\nFinally, we wish to twin our towns to ensure the sustainability of the Project after its conclusion. Twinning is an official and funded project by the European Union that will deepen our friendships, make public the beauty of our  communities through tourism and cultural exchanges as well as develop the exchange of experiences at economical, political and social levels.", "http://www.grahamschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA219-038009_2"]]}}}}
