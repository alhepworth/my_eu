The Astroparticle Roadmap of ApPEC/ASPERA strongly supports this, recommending that: \u201ca new large European infrastructure of 100'000-500'000 ton for proton decay and low-energy neutrinos be evaluated as a common design study together with the underground infrastructure and eventual detection of accelerator neutrino beams\u201d.  The latest CERN roadmap also states: \u201ca range of very important non-accelerator experiments takes place at the overlap of particle and astroparticle physics exploring otherwise inaccessible phenomena; Council will seek with ApPEC a coordinated strategy in these areas of mutual interest.\u201d\nReacting to this, uniting scientists across Europe with industrial support to produce a very strong collaboration, the LAGUNA FP7 design study has had a very positive effect.  It enabled, via study of seven pre-selected locations (Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain and UK), a detailed geo-technical assessment of the giant underground cavern needed, concluding finally that no geo-technical show-stoppers to cavern construction exist.  Building on this, the present design study will address two challenges vital to making a final detector and site choice: (i) to determine the full cost of construction underground, commissioning and long-term operation of the infrastructure, and (ii) to determine the full impact of including long baseline neutrino physics with beams from CERN.", 158090.0, 8465422.0, 12, 39, "LAGUNA-LBNO", "http://laguna.ethz.ch/LAGUNA/Welcome.html", "http://www.rhyalengineering.com", null, "fp7_100270_966590451"]]}}}}
