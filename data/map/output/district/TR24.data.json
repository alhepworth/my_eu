The archipelago is home to the following habitats and species: sandbanks that are slightly covered by seawater all of the time; mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide reefs; shore dock (<i>Rumex rupestris</i>), grey seal (<i>Halichoerus grypus</i>) and the project\u2019s main target bird species, the storm petrel (<i>Hydrobates pelagicus</i>) and Manx shearwater (<i>Puffinus puffinus</i>). In addition, the Isles of Scilly contains SSSIs of national importance for vascular plant species, vascular plant associations, breeding shorebirds and lichens. \nProject actions will take place mainly on the islands of St Agnes and Gugh in the southern part of the Scilly SPA. These are two separate islands that are connected by a rock and sand bar at low tide. St Agnes (105 ha) has cultivated farmland at its centre, surrounded by heathland, maritime heath, a few wooded areas and sandy and rocky shores. Gugh (37 ha) has regenerating heathland, maritime heath, marram dunes, a small wooded area and a rocky shoreline. The brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) is widespread and abundant on both islands, and was probably introduced as a result of shipwrecks in the 18th century. The presence of brown rats (estimated at 3 300 individuals) is responsible for the loss of adults, young and eggs of both the main target bird species within the Isles of Scilly site, and is therefore affecting the population sizes and distributions of these species.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4320", "http://www.ios-seabirds.org.uk/,", "life_266"]]}}}}
