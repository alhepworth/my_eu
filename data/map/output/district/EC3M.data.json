The first objective of STREAMLINE is to demonstrate radically new propulsion concepts delivering an increase in efficiency of at least 15% over current state-of-the-art. The concepts will be designed for maximisation of energy conversion combined with low levels of cavitation, noise and vibration. The research will look at novel applications of large area propulsion, a biomechanical system and distributed thrust (via multiple propulsors). As its second objective, STREAMLINE will investigate methods to fully optimise current SoA systems including conventional screw propeller systems, pods and waterjets. The key here is exploitation of new CFD methods to pursue improvements without dramatic vessel configuration changes. The third objective of STREAMLINE is to develop advanced CFD tools and methods to optimise the hydrodynamic performance of the new propulsion concepts, particularly by analysis of integrated hull and propulsor. Finally, STREAMLINE will characterise the operational, economic and classification aspects of each of the new propulsion concepts. STREAMLINE will demonstrate solutions for a wide range of applications.

Finally, the project will ensure that its products will impact target groups through a dissemination strategy, developed in close collaboration with members of an external advisory board.", 25530.0, 6132975.0, 11, 24, "ENHANCE", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015/156089.jpg", "fp7_106592_993570031"], [1257033600000, 1364688000000, "Systemic Seismic Vulnerability and Risk Analysis for Buildings, Lifeline Networks and Infrastructures Safety Gain", "Willis Limited", "SYNER-G is research project which has the following main goals: (1) To elaborate appropriate, in the European context, fragility relationships for the vulnerability analysis and loss estimation of all elements at risk, for buildings, building aggregates, utility networks (water, waste water, energy, gas), transportation systems (road, railways, harbors) as well as complex medical care facilities (hospitals) and fire-fighting systems. (2) To develop social and economic vulnerability relationships for quantifying the impact of earthquakes. (3) To develop a unified methodology, and tools, for systemic vulnerability assessment accounting for all components (structural and socio-economic) exposed to seismic hazard, considering interdependencies within a system unit and between systems, in order to capture the increased loss impact due to the interdependencies and the interactions among systems and systems of systems. The methodology and the proposed fragility functions will be validated in selected sites (urban scale) and systems and it will implemented in an appropriate open source and unrestricted access software tool. Guidelines will be prepared and the results and outputs will be disseminated in Europe and world wide with appropriate dissemination schemes. SYNER-G is integrated across different disciplines with an internationally recognized partnership from Europe, USA and Japan. The objectives and the deliverables are focused to the needs of the administration and local authorities, which are responsible for the management of seismic risk, as well as the needs of the construction and insurance industry.

The insurance industry must start adapting in response to weather and climate risks. Climate and weather forecasting hosts a wide range of scientific and mathematical methods with a heavy computational base. Insurance mathematics is a rich field, developing advanced stochastic and statistical methods within risk theory. The main objective is to bring statisticians, insurance and climate experts together to build a methodological basis for the emerging field of climate change insurance risk. Statistics is a critical part of the project. We will access insurance data from partners and agencies as well as the huge amount of actual and simulated weather and climate data. This gives us the potential to build models and methods of real relevance to decision making in the insurance industry and help inform government and regulators. Work packages include: (i) early warning of losses, (ii) interpretation of climate modelling for risk analysis, (iii) rain and wind losses, (iv) sea temperature risk  (v) concurrent causes for increased loss. A range of mathematical and statistical methods will form the bedrock for the project. They include methods from probabilistic risk theory such as extreme events, methods from climate simulation, especially ensemble simulations, statistical methods such as time series and space-time models and methods from structural and system reliability. The project will attach special importance to training and dissemination. Training is critical in a multidisciplinary project as this. Dissemination is a duty imposed by the urgency of the subject and the newness of the climate change insurance risk field.
