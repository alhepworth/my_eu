These four Secondary Schools train technicians with a professional competence in the forest sector, skilled in monitoring, preserving and managing the forest and agricultural resources of the mountain region.The School of forestry of Ormea and the other 3 partner Schools are becoming more and more important as a point of reference for the forestry know-how and its related activities and competencies. The school course is meant to provide knowledge and skills with the purpose of training technicians who will enter the world of work bound to their own territory, but with openness to Europe. With this proposal the four Schools have granted the requests coming from the forest sector, various regional and national partners and the world of work. The data about the hydrogeological instability in Italy are alarming; therefore it is urgent to train experts able to prevent environmental disasters due to the soil fragility. The project offers traineeship to 50 students from the 4 Schools, who will join in it at the end of the fourth and fifth school years. The project aim is to give the participants the opportunity to improve their ability and take back new ideas and experiences, acquiring a modern and analytic approach to face the problems related with this sector. To point out topics such as sustainable farming practices, renewable resources, forest certification and forest association means to invest in a basic sector for the safeguard of the country and the development of the Green Economy as a chance of economic growth.The main idea is that only the active management of the wood allows the development of its different functions (related to the environment, the landscape, the biodiversity preservation)and, as a consequence, the production of environmental goods and services to support the active permanence, the generation turnover, the social inclusion, the reduction of poverty and the economic development in rural areas. Moreover, the trainees will improve effectively their language skills and thanks to this experience they will be allowed to get in touch with the culture and civilization of the host countries, encouraging cultural exchanges. The project provides 4 weeks traineeship, starting from May 2015, in companies and boards dealing with the field of forestry and a range of concerns business including processing and services. The traineeships will take place in the UK, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Spain. These countries are carefully protecting their heritage of forests and are sensitive to this topic, giving their contribution in the current debate on the next EU common policy.

These infrastructures are exposed to high loads and harsh environmental conditions through their lifetime in operation and materials failures lead to down time having vast negative effects on productivity and well-being in society in terms of lost time, shortened life cycles and increased service costs. So engineers face the challenge to develop durable materials compatible with industrial standards in an economically viable way. Composites represent attractive materials and are increasingly used for such applications since they demonstrate low weight, high strength and stiffness and high environmental resistance. However composites suffer from sudden brittle failure mainly due to production defects and handling damages; this is currently handled by strict quality and process control from manufacturers, resulting in high production costs which can represent a barrier to introduction and development of composites in a wide range of applications. The general objective of DACOMAT is to develop more damage tolerant and damage predictable low cost composite materials in particular aimed for used in large load carrying constructions like bridges, buildings, wind-turbine blades and off shore structures. The developed materials and condition monitoring solutions will enable composite structures to be designed and manufactured as large parts allowing for more and larger manufacturing defects and the need for manual inspection to be dramatically reduced.

In the marine habitat, stressors appear to strongly affect the larval stages. Most aquatic animals develop through dispersive larval stages, highly vulnerable, that must survive and recruit to the adult stocks in order to ensure population persistence; failures in recruitment lead to population extinction. However, organisms differ in their life history strategy and habitat use, even if they are closely related; these differences may have profound effects on responses to stress. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the combined role of climate driven variables (salinity, temperature) and anthropogenic compounds (pharmaceuticals) on aquatic animals with different life history strategy. Both salinity and temperature are forced by climate; concentrations of pharmaceuticals have been determined in coastal waters only recently and constitute an \u201cunknown\u201d as a source of larval mortality.

In metal mineral mines, microbial activities have both positive and negative consequences. Microorganisms reside on minerals, including sulfide ores such as pyrite and chalcopyrite, abundant mine ores in the UK and worldwide. Through microbial metabolism of the iron contained within these ores, sulphuric acid is produced, resulting in an acidic mine environment. Drainage from such mines enter watercourses and wetlands, producing acid mine drainage (AMD). In addition, toxic heavy metals such as lead, are more soluble at a lower pH and are thus usually present in AMD, adding to the environmental concern. While some of the common microbial species found in such mines have been well characterised, there remains significant questions regarding microbial communities as a unit, and their functioning, such as: i) are communities established quickly and do the species within those communities change over time, ii) which species are active and what are they doing, and iii) what effect does mineral chemistry (mineralogy), have on the structure and functioning of the communities.

Recent investigations show that survival and fecundity are strongly affected by environmental conditions experienced during early life.. In particular, the conditions experienced by mothers and embryonic stages, can affect traits of individuals such as lipid reserves, or the latent ability to cope with thermal and osmotic stress. Therefore, important changes in survival, fecundity and population dynamics could be caused by changes in environmental conditions of the natal habitat, i.e. where the individuals are born as free-living organisms, but also, where adults mate and eggs/embryos develop associated to the mothers. In the marine habitat, climate change is provoking profound modifications of temperature and salinity, thereby affecting habitat conditions. Most marine animals develop through larval stages that disperse away from the natal habitat, but it is vital for the maintenance of populations that these individuals survive and recruit to the juvenile/adult stock. Maternal and embryonic effects on larval traits can be a source of variability in recruitment, thus acting as a conduit for local and global effects on populations.

This example of Social Inclusion will be developed together with host North West Regional College (NWRC) in Londonderry. Keypoint will be the workingmethod with tandems of UK and Dutch students while working on Orientation on the professional field of Social care, visit Social care-institutes and follow classes. In the preparation and organisation special attention will be set on an extended preparation program including language and solic guidance during the mobility.\r\n\u2022 The workingmethod of the so-called Language-internship (Taalstage), in which the learning of the language is applied directly to assignments in companies, is successful. It is now applied to programs in the English, Spanish and German language.\r\n\u2022 Rijn IJssel aims to connect staff mobility to support innovation-topics.

The lag between the generation of evidence from research to underpin both health and social care services, and the complexities of accelerating its implementation at scale are well documented. The consequences of failures in implementation are financial inefficiencies, reductions in the quality of health and social care, and concern for service users and citizens. \r\n\r\nThere are few opportunities for health and social care professionals to gain advanced knowledge and skills in implementation science (also referred to as knowledge translation). Implementation is a growing discipline in these fields that investigates how to close the gap between evidence of \u2018what works\u2019 from research, and the services that are provided for citizens (Eccles, 2009). Growing professionals\u2019 capability in implementation science will ensure they will be equipped to support innovation in health and social care, to engage in public policy discussions about health and social care systems, as well as ensuring citizens\u2019 access to effective services.

We are specialized in the training of people who are going to work in laboratories (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Pharmacy, Micro Technology).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince more than 20 years the school is conducting EU projects (Leonardo da Vinci Mobilities, Pilot Projects and Innovation Transfer Projects as well as Comenius-Grundtvig training courses) and has thereby established a large network of partners, i.e. laboratories in universities, research institutes and companies in EU regions from Troms\u00f6 to Sevilla, from Galway to Budapest and from French Guyane to New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor academics trainings in foreign countries are a common thing to do whereas for technical staff going abroad is still unusual and due to the different educational systems generally difficult to arrange. The network of Lise Meitner School allows lab technicians to participate in individual educational trainings in a wide range of subject areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities / Procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUMobil will allow up to 50 young graduates in natural-scientific and technical professions to take part in individual mobilites. The participants will stay for 14 weeks in a research lab or in a company. Usually they are part of an ongoing research project in international research groups. Thereby the participants can extend their professional qualification as well as their language skills and intercultural competences. They learn to cope with an unfamiliar environment and become more self-reliant. This results in a great leap forward in their personality development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving partners are research institutes, companies and laboratories in the natural-scientific departments of universities. They work in a global context and in international teams which make is easy for our participants to fit in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants can apply for a grant via our school website. After individual mentoring in the EU office of the school they are placed according to their qualification and their career plans. The actual period of the stay is being negotiated individually. Travel plans and arrangements with the receiving partner and the mentor are being done by the participants. Still the EU office provides advice face-to-face, via email or telephone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning agreement and quality commitment between the participant, the sending and the receiving organisation describes the individual tasks of the participant and the supporting measures during the training placement. During their stay the participants report on a regular basis to the EU office of Lise-Meitner-Schule. On request most sending organisations provide the participants with a job reference. The europass Mobility however is an integral part of the project and will be handed out after all paper work is completed (including the participants report). The participants usually come the the EU office for a personal evaluation interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations are being visited every few years to guarantee the quality of the placements and intensify the contacts to the local mentors and researchers. During the project two such visits are  budgeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Aims / Results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants\u2026\r\n\r\n- acquire and consolidate professional and methodical competences\r\n\r\n- gain and extend intercultural competences and language skills\r\n\r\n- strengthen their self-confidence and abilities to work in a team \r\n\r\n- increase their chances on the labour market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lise-Meitner-Schule\u2026\r\n\r\n- consolidates and expands its European network of research groups and laboratories\r\n\r\n- intensifies its insight into international research and methodology in order to adjust the local curricula according to present needs within the respective occupational area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations\u2026\r\n\r\n- get the chance to engage well qualified staff which can contribute on a comparably high level to research projects\r\n\r\n- intensify their insight into vocational education in Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLongterm Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides of the individual support of young graduates from German vocational schools the project fosters the cooperation between educational institutions of related professional areas between the participating partner countries.

For young children with different cultural backgrounds and social disadvantages, this transition can be a challenging one. As such, it is important that programs are in place in early education institutions to facilitate the integration of such special needs children with their peers and thereby promote social development across the board. Evidence indicates that such programs, if executed properly and at an early age, help to negate pre-existing obstacles for young children with special needs and have a positive long-term impact on their social and emotional development, as well as academic capabilities. \r\n\r\nThere is a great emphasis on improving the basic academic skills of kindergarten and pre-school students because such improvements are easy to quantify and mean that a country's schools will compare favorably to those of other countries when analyzed statistically. However, while an emphasis on skills such as reading and writing is crucial, it fails to address the important social and emotional growth that occurs in ECEC.  In particular, many of the current educational systems do not do enough to address the needs of children who find the early school environment challenging as a result of learning disabilities or difficult backgrounds. Instead of being included, these children are often directed to separate schools or simply treated in a way that will only deepen their problems. This occurs largely as a result of an inability on the part of teachers to adequately handle the difficulties that come with taking responsibility for the special needs of children  who might require additional attention in order to become included and supported at a young age. \r\n\r\nIn this spirit, this strategic partnership aims at the development and implementation of innovative methodologies for the inclusion and adjustment of the children with special needs, especially those coming from socially disadvantaged or culturally different environments. Instead of considering disadvantaged children to be an insurmountable challenge, ECEC practitioners must be familiar with effective and proper ways to integrate and address the individual needs of such children. This includes familiarity with techniques for dealing with the many different kinds of behavioral difficulties children may have. For example, ideally, teachers would be comfortable addressing the needs of children from socially challenged families as well as those whose backgrounds may lead them to have trouble with linguistic and cultural issues (i.e., Roma children).
