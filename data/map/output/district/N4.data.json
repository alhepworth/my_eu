In this direction, the  necessary steps that we are going to take at school to prevent dropout and ESL are the following: SCHOOL GUIDANCE SERVICE identifies the students under the risk of dropout. These students are observed during the education year by the responsible teachers and the guidance service. During the project period, at the beginning of the education year, TRAININGS are organised to identify the profiles of parents and students and to cooperate the parents easily. We aim to gain the PARENTS CONFIDENCE, because one who trusts to school will easily provide the students attendance. During the project period, the continuity and discontinuity of students are controlled daily. The vision of our schools is \u201cHAPPY STUDENTS, A HAPPY SCHOOL\u201d. All necessary steps are going to be taken to make be students happy and self confident. To obtain this goal, \u201cMOVIE DAYS\u201d will be organised periodically at school to stimulate students\u2019 attendance. Creation of a location for a WEB RADIO, a station that connects the network of schools with exclusion places, wherever they are. A \u2018VIDEO BOX\u2019 for young people (THE SOUL DRESSING ROOM) will be created. The students, identified at the beginning of the year as under risk of dropout, will be oriented to the CHOIR or the DANCE GROUP of the school to feel confidents and happy with the social activities. Also \u201cTHE COLOURING DAYS\u201d will be organised at school. On these days students colour the place/parts of the school as they want. This activity helps students to feel relax and they can feel the school as a place where they belong to. THEATRE AT SCHOOL: students that have learning problems will be oriented to theatre room and the responsible teachers help them to teach the topics by using drama techniques. CONFERENCES and SEMINARS will be organised and some authorities will be invited to these seminars as samples to the students. They will tell their life stories to students: school lives, problems, obstacles. Students could understand that everyone can face some problems during life but this is not a reason of dropout.  FAIRS are organised in spring and the money of the fairs is spent for the students (TRIPS to museums, circus, picnic and so on).These trips help students to socialize and to cooperate with other students and try to make the students relief and high motivated. OUR GENERAL AIM IS TO PREVENT DROPOUTS AND CREATE SUPPORTIVE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL STIMULATE STUDENTS TO DISCOVER THEIR OWN ABILITIES AND CHANGE THEIR NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF SCHOOL INTO A POSITIVE IMAGE OF IT. FROM A CONSTRAINT TO SUFFER TO A PLACE WHERE TO INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR OWN POTENTIAL, WHERE TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY AND CONSCIOUSLY TO THEIR PATH OF GROWTH, WHERE TO ACQUIRE AND/OR VALORIZE THEIR SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS, WHERE TO ESTABLISH OR IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH PEERS, TEACHERS, PARENTS. At the end of the project period  there will be the following expected results: public Twin space, website with materials, semi-annual Erasmus newspaper, leaflets to inform the educative community about the project, brochure regarding early school leaving and its first signals, e-Book with good practices for preventing dropouts  (digital book \u201cDrop by drop\u2026stop dropout!\u201d), slogans and video diaries, short films or comics strips and posters on prevention of early school leaving, final school show. To carry out the project, teachers will develop their relationship with the students basing it on the DIALOGUE, on the MUTUAL EXCHANGE and on the enhancement of the peculiarities and diversity of each, adopting methodologies that put each student, with his needs and his resources, in the centre of the  teaching-learning process and preferring the METHODOLOGY BASED ON RESEARCH/ACTION (problem posing, problem solving; brainstorming; guided conversations). The main  techniques of work that will be used are those deemed more appropriate for developing the CRITICAL THINKING, the AUTHONOMY, the  SELF-ORIENTATION,  the practice of co-operation and  the acquisition of diversified communication techniques. About 1000 participants will be involved in the project and at least twice will benefit of it, if we consider teachers and students, parents, other schools, training centres, experts, decision-takers at local, regional, national and transnational levels, pupil guidance centres, local and national education authorities, public reached by press and social media. The importance to carry out transnationally the project lies in exchanging  information, sharing and analyzing best-practice models, comparing them and adapting practices to each own environment.

Basically, the main activity will be the exchange of languages among partners. Every year two languages will be proposed and taught by the students themselves through video-tutorials. Students will plan the way to record them, the structures to teach and the topics. They will practically record the videos and assess the partners' progresses. New materials will be producted and used to practise the studied languages. A new method to teach foreign language to kids will take life. Teachers will strenghten their professionality working in collaboration and discussing and elaborating a new original teaching method about languages for kids. Many publications will be  available for those who need them: a methodology book, languages manual, online resouces, paper resources ready to print, interactive games for smart boards. In the project, partners will teach each other their languages. Students will be the main actors of the teaching process after having reflected on the linguistic structures of their own language. Students will always be in touch, in this way communication will be real. They will increase their metacognition skills and their comptetences that will be easily transferred to other contexts. While creating materials for partners peers, students will use their creativity. Teachers will better their professionality as they will be trained about methodologies, the use of ICT in teaching, the methods used to write and publish books and manuals, the ability to create new teaching materials and interactive games. The participant organizations will be six schools chosen for their languages and for the competences and profiles of the teachers involved. . \r\n\r\nThe project will have a longer-term multiple effect and sustainable impact both within and outside the participating school (in other schools or in the community). For pupils, these activities will be integrated into the curriculum in the long-term perspective. In that way, the project will benefit all the learners of the participating schools. In the project students from 6 till 14 years old, teaching staff, parents and local society will be involved in many different activities. All the participants will improve communication skills, develope digital knowlegde, use open educational resources and create new original ones.

We see a need for a major methodological change in schools encouraging cooperative learning activities that promote mutual support, peer support, heterogeneity between members within groups and the inclusion of everybody, where each student starts off with the same possibilities. We believe that an Erasmus + project which promotes these aspects will help strengthen and encourage the sharing of active methodology experiences and knowledge with the other European schools. To do this, we will use linguistic, mathematical and scientific concepts to help us apply these methodologies and gradually be able to carry them out routinely.We aim to achieve the following objectives:- To improve linguistic, mathematical and scientific literacy of students, in addition to an improvement in autonomy and personal initiative whilst not forgetting the development of social and civic competence since, in the use of these methodologies, teamwork is encouraged.- To share the methodologies of cooperative learning and multiple intelligences with other European schools, research new cooperative learning structures for the classroom and in this way get to know other European schools whilst adding value to our school.- To learn and compare how students from other countries learn the curriculum content we learn using these methodologies and others that are yet to be discovered in lots of schools (Flipped Classroom, ...) and thus provide us with real context.- To provide a real context to develop innovative use of new technologies for communication between schools and as a tool in the use of new methodologies.- To promote professional development through international cooperation by sharing best practices and acquiring new approaches to enrich our curriculum.The project will be divided into 4 sections: \"A Little Bit of Me\" (group cohesion), \"Numbers and Letters\", \"Sciences and Arts\" and\"A Little Bit of You.\"Each section of the project will tackle 5 or 6 issues. Each school will select some of these issues to be resolved. These issues will be addressed through proposals to develop active methodologies (Cooperative Learning, project-based learning PBL, Flipped Classroom, Multiple Intelligences, ...). The findings and conclusions will be posted on the etwinning project site and on the project website to compare and use them as a starting point in discussions and other investigations.  This will subsequently be shared in transnational meetings.The activities to be carried out throughout the four sections are summarized as: the joint cooperative creation of a project logo, a mathematical  team competition, the preparation of a video presentation by schools through an invented structure called \"School Chest \" - the collection of material on group cohesion and new methodologies, the design and realisation of dynamic and cooperative activities, the comparison of educational models, the collection and viewing of short films on emotions and teamwork, an approach and implementation Challenge Day : a day without paper at school.Participants in this project will be both students and teachers from the four participating countries (Spain, Romania, England, Belgium), 1253 people in total.Students and teachers communicate with partner schools via the etwinning site, video conference, e-mail and face-to-face meetings through mobilities planned using English as the common language.The results expected throughout the project through questionnaires, videos, meetings, resolution of issues, graphs and so on will allow us to research and reflect on the use of active learning methodologies.The impact generated by this project will be reflected in each of the members of the educational community through their participation, understanding and development tas well as language level, participation, peer conflict resolution and improved teacher training .The benefits it will bring to students and teachers will emphasize the European added value of this programme. It also promotes the use of English as a communication tool between peers.

The problems identified in these projects allowed us to build this project with the hope to help more young people learn more about the European System, the European democratic system and the importance of active citizenship and active participation of youth in policy and society.We discovered that young people don\u2019t really understand how the EU works, what their place and role in the EU is or should be and what their obligations are or how they can facilitate change in their communities and in the EU.  We want to help young people understand the concept of the EU, how it works and how important their role is in the EU.  We have chosen sports as a medium to help them understand this concept better.  The EU is currently made up of 28 countries, some are major players, but the majority are minorities within the EU and sometimes feel insignificant, with a feeling that they are too weak as countries, either economically or in numbers to have any impact or effect on EU policy.  We need to show that every country regardless of how big or small, is a contributor to the EU and plays a vital role in the EU.  The objective is to allow the youth to better understand that by being active members of a society and by working together and also contributing to the growth of the EU they can be key players in the EU.  The idea is to allow all youth to feel equally important in the EU and in their countries.   The project will adopt sports as the medium to simulate the workings of the EU allowing participants to work together in international groups to utilise individual strength to make the groups stronger and also to understand weaknesses so that we can help each other be stronger as a whole.By taking this approach we will understand how the EU works and how we as youth can make a difference by working together for a greater unified EU.  Many aspects need to be analysed during the project including cultural differences, local resources and strengths of each country and also the knowledge available in each community.  We believe this project is a great way to show young people how to work together and take advantage of the different strengths of each country and person to help them work together just like the EU does.In order to achieve these goals, the activities foreseen for the project are important.  As the topic is significant to all the participants we anticipate that all the participants will be extremely active in the project offering as much as they can but also taking back as much as possible. Workshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops. Workshops are designed around the various subjects allowing the participants to discuss the issues and work together to solve problems and share experiences.Role playing will also be used to allow the participants to get another perspective of different problems.

During the simulations the participants will take on roles to re-enact a real situation based on events and problems in the real world.  The participants will work together in their different roles to solve problems and to find solutions to these problems.  Important here is that the participants take on random roles which add additional learning tools as they need to think and act as the person they are simulating. Using all the above tools and methodologies the participants learn through informal and non-formal methodologies which are real and based on past experiences.  As a result we hope to give our participants and our youth a better understanding of the EU system and their importance as citizens of the EU and the importance of their countries in EU family as member states.In addition to learning about the problems the youth will also exchange cultures and traditions and learn about the different cultures from the different countries allowing for better understanding of each other and therefore creating a more unified EU, fighting xenophobia and also discrimination.", "http://www.otinternational.org", "One Terrene International", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024757_coordinator"], [2016, "Entrepreneur's Manual", "OTI EDUCATION UK", 27212.0, 11, 11, "This project was developed by the partners of the project when seeing that a lot of emphasis is given to entrepreneurial skills and assisting young people in gained these skills and competences.  We identified a great needs for young people and organisations to obtain these skills and knowledge but as organisations we needed to develop new methods to teach these skills to young people.  The combination of experience with young people from 12 countries, especially in identifying the common problems that young people face and the gaps in their knowledge about entrepreneurialism and also taking the experience of other organisations in the business fields the idea was created to develop a training course that would bring together  youth workers, trainers and specialist in the field of business to develop new methodologies and activities that can be used in all the partner countries and other countries to help young people develop their entrepreneurial skills and help them start their own business.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project is to identify common problems and lack in the knowledge of young people in each of the partner countries regarding business and especially starting their own business and then to develop a variety of training courses and workshops that will help young people gained the needed skills to start their own business.\r\n\r\nBy doing this we will be able to help young people in all the partner countries to gain the needed skills to start their own business and simultaneously help combat unemployment in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project will address youth unemployment and methods to help young people overcome these problems by creating their own jobs based on their skills and education allowing them to properly measure the risks of starting a business and also evaluating their ability to be self-employed.  There is a great need for projects like this within the EU an especially so in countries that have high youth unemployment and we believe the outcomes of the project will positively affect many young people in making the correct choices and assist them in starting their own careers and therefore overcoming unemployment.\r\n\r\nTaking into account how the EU is a common market, we will explore, through intercultural dialogue, the trends and needs of a unified yet distinct EU.  We will see how one market influences the other, and more specifically how culture can influence the success or failure of a business.  We will see elements of active citizenship and how these affect our rights as citizens of the EU.  We will see how inclusion, or exclusion affects the chances of young people to succeed in a very demanding labour market.  We will give focus on EU tools available to young entrepreneurs to give them the push needed to start their own business or to give them the skills and competences to make the right decisions regarding their careers and their future. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the training course is to develop a manual as a final result with tips and guides on how to start a business that can be used by all young people interested in starting their own business.\r\n\r\nWe will exchange good and bad practices from each country and put all the good practices together for formulate workshops and activities so that each of the partner organisations and other organisation can help more young people in these important and desperately needed areas. \r\nVital tools will be used to learn about EU opportunities, this will include EVS, EURES, internships and placements to mention only a few.  National incentives will also be reviewed.\r\n \r\nThe objective of the project is to allow youth to discuss problems about youth unemployment and increasing employability.  As the group is made up of many young people who are unemployed, the issues and the outcomes are vital to the participants.\r\n\r\nThe profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital.  As the topic is vital to all the participants we anticipate that all the participants will be extremely active in the project offering as much as they can but also taking back as much as possible.

Most young people follow fashionable career paths through education without planning their future or even knowing what the future, in terms of employment, can offer them and as a result we see very high number in youth unemployment all over the world.  This is a serious concern and although a lot is done on National and European levels to combat youth unemployment, the source of the problem still lies in the choices of young people.\r\n\r\nWe will examine the factors which influence the choices young people make about their futures, the educational systems in place, trying to identify problems, and help young people understand the importance of planning for their careers based on the real needs of the labour markets.  Our aim is to build a bridge between the young people and their abilities, and then pave the roads between youth and the labour markets.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the key to success starts with understanding ourselves, who we are and what we are capable of doing.  When we can identify these key elements, we can start to work on building our careers, we can choose our education based on our skills and abilities, and combines these to meet the needs of the labour market, securing a future with employment being long term and allowing us to grow in this career rather than jumping from job to job simply to gain experience and then jump to the next.\r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will bring young people from several countries together to share their concerns and to work on finding solutions to overcome youth unemployment in all EU countries, working together to share best practices and share knowledge and ideas so that we can help all young people in the EU build careers in an attempt to combat the excessively high youth unemployment numbers in the EU.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the options in education, the options in employment, taking advantage of the freedoms of mobility, and learn to understand and even predict the labour market trends and needs so that we can make young people more employable. \r\n\r\nDiscussions are used to allow participants to share knowledge, ideas and experiences with each other.

What happened and what will happen?  How does this affect us?  Is there a weakness in the EU?  We will examine the meaning of the common market and how this affects all of us.  So many countries want access to this common market and even the UK who voted to leave the EU, still wants access to the common market.  What is the price of being part of the common market and why is the UK voting to leaving the EU when leaving it would be a disadvantage?  We will see the relationship that Norway has with the EU, and how different this is from a normal member of the EU.  Is there an advantage to this?  Rumour has it that the UK will follow this path, what will the impact of this be on the UK and the EU?  \r\n\r\nWe will look at mobility, one the major factors, believed to give the leave vote its majority.  We will examine the Mobility Treaty and see if this has disadvantages to member states.  We will also examine how Switzerland tried to abandon the freedom of mobility treaty with the EU, which was never realised.  All of these factors have to do with democracy and how it works and how it affects us.  Is democracy failing?\r\n\r\nWe saw that the results of the UK referendum showed a very small margin of difference in the results, showing how democracy works, but also showing that democracy can leave almost half the voting population dissatisfied with the results.  We also saw how youth felt cheated by this referendum because they could not vote for such an important issue.  Is this yet another statistic showing how young people have no say in their future?\r\n\r\nAs a result of the UK referendum we also saw, in the media, that some other countries want a EU exit.  Is this propaganda or is the EU truly starting to fail?  The question boils down to how we measure success and failure.  If it was a question of economics only, the EU is a world power economically speaking.  If it\u2019s a question of influence on policy, every EU country has a say on EU policy, and even has some liberty to create specific laws for their country, education being one of these.   These are only some of the questions we will ask to try to understand why many feel that the EU is not working or failing.  Perhaps we will discover some problems that are not in the media, or perhaps the media is sharing different version of reality in different countries.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to understand the working of the EU, how it works, why it works and what role we as youth play in it and how we can change the future of our EU, so that we are truly living in a Union.      \r\n\r\n\r\nWith such a diverse partnership we will see a European impact from our project.

We expect that all communities will learn that simply saying you are an EU citizen does not change any laws or make our country bigger, they will learn that they pave the path to their future and the future of their children and the future of the EU.\r\n\r\nJust like a home protects us and gives us comfort and protection, if we do not care for it and maintain it, it could land up becoming unsafe and harm us instead of protecting us.  The EU is our home, the policies and treaties are the walls and roof we build to keep us safe, if we don\u2019t build these walls together as Europeans, how can we live in harmony together.  If we don\u2019t plan the building of our homes for future generations, how will be protect them?\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge shared and gained from this project will allow both the youth and the partner organisations to share good practices within their countries and on a European level allowing others to understand the importance of active citizenship and the ideology of the EU, and democratic life in the EU.", "http://www.otinternational.org", "One Terrene International", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035048_coordinator"], [2017, "Finding You", "OTI CULTURE UK", 25578.0, 9, 9, "In our modern society, young people are encouraged to get university degrees regardless of their dreams or future employment desires.

We don\u2019t want to devalue a university degree, but it is really enough to secure a job?  Research and statistics have shown us that it is not enough, young people need to understand and develop their skills in order to meet the demands and needs of the labour market and this youth exchange will focus on exactly that, the development and enhancement of skills, soft skills and combine education in order to make young people more employable.

Most young people complain that they have what they need to be employed, and yet the labour market tells them that they don\u2019t have the experience and the skills for the job.

Is it the duty of the schools to prepare us for the labour market, and if so, for which market?\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on identifying skills needed for the different jobs out there and helping young people determine just how skilled they are for the jobs they are applying for and even helping them to identify sources of employment based on their skill sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will look at the different fields of education that our young people have chosen and also look at their life skills, their soft skills, their practical skills and other skills they might have and see how we can use these skills to make them more attractive to employers and also give them a more diverse spectrum of employment opportunities.  The project will also focus on helping young people to develop and enhance these skills in order to make them more employable.\r\n\r\nThis youth exchange will focus on the different skills young have or can obtain through various methods allowing them to utilise their strength and enhance the areas of their weaknesses, to give them confidence and faith that their efforts are not lost and that even in difficult times, employment opportunities are out there for those that know how to use what they already have.  \r\n\r\nWe will explore ourselves, finding our best talents and skills allowing us to face a challenging labour market with the tools and knowledge to become an active part of the labour market and leave youth unemployment behind us, by knowing who we are and what we can do.

When we look at all these events, the common factor is food.  Food is the one element of life that has so many aspects, it bring us together, it makes up sympathise with those who don\u2019t have it, it makes us feel like we have an identity, it makes us feel unique.  But how unique is our food?  If we took a traditional plate of food from every European country, how different would these plates be?  How similar would they be?  \r\n\r\nFood is an integral part of our culture but it\u2019s not the only element, and just like food other aspects of our culture, art, customs, traditions and many more, are influenced by others over time.  We see globalisation as a negative thing, but it is existed long before the word was conceived.  So how unique are our cultures?     \r\n\r\nCultures, traditions and customs have often been the bases of stereotype being created and even conflicts.  We often hear discriminating comments based on cultural differences or because of some customs or traditions we saw in another country.  \r\n\r\nOur project will explore the roots of our different cultures, the cultures of our neighbours, and the cultures of Europe. We will learn from each other and we will share our culture with our friends in every form possible from food to art and through this sharing we will discover just how much we have in common and how understanding and sharing can result in a more unified EU.  \r\n\r\nThe project will look at the effects of globalisation on our cultures and how we as youth are influenced by different cultural aspects.  How young people preserve their culture and we will question why our culture is important to us and why it is important for Europe to respect the individual cultures of its member states and its people.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to allow young people to identify their cultures and also to examine the roots of these cultural elements to discover who and how these element affected our culture.  We will look at food as the building block that will bring us together, looking at how our plates (traditional dishes) of Europe can bring us together and try to create a common European dish (cooperation and understanding) to allow us to live as one Europe. \r\n\r\nWe believe that by researching our cultures and the historical significance of our cultures we will learn how our cultures were influenced by each other and although we have differences, our similarities are much greater than our differences.  As a result we will allow our youth to unite the people of Europe for a great, stronger Europe. \r\nThe profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen non-formal and informal methodologies are used to ensure the learning outcomes of the project.  \r\n\r\nA variety of ice breakers and energisers are used to help the particpants familiarise themselves with each other allowing for a more comfortable atmosphere for cooperation and collaboration.  Open discussions are used to allow participants to share their views and also to identify common problems in the different countries. Discussions will give the youth more confidence, especially when seeing that youth from other countries are facing the same problems.  \r\n\r\nDebates will allow the youth to express their personal viewpoints of different matters and to justify them through discussions.

We are planning a training course which will help develop methods and approaching which will allow youth workers to take advantage of social media in order to help youth with the serious unemployment problems which they face during the current crisis.  The training course will address the various problems in each country and try to find European based solutions for these problems.  We will look at the negative impact of social media, especially with regard to how it affects chances of employment and give the tools to youth workers and organisations to help youth in each of the communities to take advantage of social media.  We will also develop strategies to turn social media into more of a learning experience rather than a platform to waste time.  Our hope is to be able to take social media, a tool enjoyed by all youth, and turn it into a platform which will allow them to learn and also create jobs, find jobs and even develop business skills.\r\nThe objective of the project is to help youth workers help young people to turn social media and technology into a tool which can help them find employment, promote themselves, their ideas, even their business ideas, and also to enhance and enrich their skills and knowledge.  To help overcome common problems seen regarding the incorrect and irresponsible usage of social media and allow young people to understand the risks and dangers and at the same time reap the benefits of such technology for their benefit.\r\nWe will explore the different types of social media and see how we can use each of these for the benefit of young people and especially to help them increase their employability.  \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

Employment doors are constantly closing for our youth.  Our project will look at the labour market problems and help youth find ways to explore new avenues of employment and to know exactly where they should be looking for employment.  We will explore a variety of competences and methods to increase these skills in order to increase the employability of youth.  The project is designed for youth from all four corners of Europe to allow for greater diversity in learning and sharing or best practices.  The majority of the participants are disadvantages young people who are unemployed and desperately seeking methods to find employment in their countries or within Europe.  The participants will exchange good and bad practices from their countries and we will explore all the opportunities available for youth in the EU and on national levels to help them maximise their skills and increase their employability.  The partners of this project have worked together to develop this project as we have identified two main concerns in most of the partner countries, namely that young people are unaware of how and where to look for employment and secondly don\u2019t realise the skills that they have and often underestimate their capabilities.  With this project we hope to allow young people to understand their potential and give them the confidence to understand and acknowledge their skills and competences and give them the tools to be able to explore more employment opportunities so that they know where to find employment.We will look at the advantages of the freedom of mobility that we all have as EU citizen but will shed light on the difficulties that might be encountered allowing the young people to make more informed choices when considering mobility as an option.We will promote enlargement and sustainability in our home countries and in the EU but helping young people to first explore all their options in their home country before considering moving abroad.  A very important element that we will need to address in the project is information, access to information and how young people find information.  Why do young people not find information (about employment or opportunities) when we live in an age when information is at our fingertips?We believe that this project will give young people the needed understanding of labour market needs and of their own skills to overcome the problems of youth unemployment in their countries and in the EU.

During the SALTO training issues such as unemployment, and especially youth unemployment that are a major concern all over the EU also self-development of soft skills to present themselves during job interviews and developing abilities to raise their chances of employment.   Universities and schools are not being updated about the market trends and as a result the employability of youth is decreasing, even though their education is increasing.  Employers are asking for experience and most young people lack this, but also lack the understanding of the skills and experiences they actually have from their various life learning activities.  Young people need to have more self-esteem to handle better situations that arise in the workplace. This youth exchange will look at the concept of employability and look at the various tools available to help youth to increase their employability. This includes developing soft skills and self-presentation techniques to better their self-esteem and quality for chances of employment.  We hope that with the various workshops and activities the youth will gain the knowledge and the tools for them to understand the markets better and to increase their employability.  We will look at issues like education, EVS, EURES, Europass and other EU tools and discuss these in details, sharing experiences with each other and giving a better understanding of how these work.  Many young people have an attitude that there is no employment opportunities left and as a result they sit back waiting for an opportunity to come to them, and as a result we blame the system for this and in the long run the youth are getting depressed and giving up hope.  We hope to give the understanding that there are many employment opportunities out there and it is our responsibility to go out and find the jobs.  It is our responsibility to find the various incentives and tools available to us, in order to increase our employability and to create the employment opportunities we need.The project participants are young people that face these issues above, living in countries that have a very high youth unemployment rate and the idea of the project is to give the participants the tools and knowledge to develop each of these abilities and talents and share them in their communities to increase their employability, to make the correct educational choices based on the market needs and help young people prepare better for different employment opportunities.  We will exchange good and bad practices from each country and put all the good practices together for formulate workshops and activities so that each of the partner organisations and other organisations can help more young people in these important and desperately needed areas.The objective of the project is to allow youth to acknowledge their talents to better their soft skills and self-promotion techniques and to discuss problems about youth unemployment and increasing employability.

However having a degree does not guarantee employment.  As a matter of fact on of the factors that create large amounts of unemployment is that fact that so many people have degrees in the same fields.  Another issue of concern is that not all universities are recognised with the same respect in different countries.  Some universities are so well known that simply having a degree from that university cold secure employment but then we realise that these universities also happen to be the most expensive thus not accessible to all.Our projects aims to look at education and the value of education, meaning the value of when we come back to our country and the value associated with the chances of finding employment with that degree or diploma.  We have seen that young people follow fashionable educational choices and we want to evaluate this to help young people make more informed choices regarding education so that they are more employable after their education.

It is our responsibility to find the various incentives and tools available to us, in order to increase our employability and to create the employment opportunities we need.\r\nThe project participants are youth workers working with youth from countries that a very high youth unemployment rate and the idea of the project is to give the youth workers the tools and knowledge to help young people in each of these communities to increase their employability, to make the correct educational choices based on the market needs and help young people prepare better for different employment opportunities.  Additionally we will also look at cross boarder employment and create workshops that will help young people make the correct choices before they take on the move to another country.    \r\nWe will exchange good and bad practices from each country and put all the good practices together for formulate workshops and activities so that each of the partner organisations and other organisation can help more young people in these important and desperately needed areas. \r\nVital tools will be used to learn about EU opportunities, this will include EVS, EURES, internships and placements to mention only a few.  National incentives will also be reviewed.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to allow youth to discuss problems about youth unemployment and increasing employability.  As the group is made up of many young people who are unemployed, the issues and the outcomes are vital to the participants.\r\n\r\nThe profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital.  As the topic is vital to all the participants we anticipate that all the participants will be extremely active in the project offering as much as they can but also taking back as much as possible.  Discussions and debates will give the youth a different perspective of the problems and perhaps even new methods of addressing these problems.  \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

Those countries like the UK and Spain were members long before our youth were even born.  Our Eastern European partners were part of the Soviet Union so the idea of the EU seems like an unreachable paradise.  Sadly though these differences create barriers between our people.  These differences and the lack of understanding of each other is what hinder cooperation between our youth in Europe.  This project will include participants from the four corners of Europe and see how we cooperate as Europeans.  We will discuss the differences of Europe and the EU and how we affect each other, and in which ways we influence each other.  How different are we and how do we cooperate.  How are youth influenced by these differences and how do these differences enhance cooperation or tension.  We will see how the EU helps its European neighbours when they suffer difficult times.  What do we expect from the EU and what it gives us.  We will analyse what it means to be an EU citizen and what it means to be a European citizen.  We will look at the different democratic systems in place and how these affect youth, their cooperation and how we as youth can bring Europe closer together. \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

Yet, when you ask about who controls the EU chances are you will hear answers like Germany or the 3 or 4 of the major countries of the EU.  So are they saying or feeling that the largest economic countries are also the ones controlling the EU?\r\n\r\nThe partnership believes that young people lack the understanding of the idea of the EU, being born into a system they don\u2019t truly understand, and yet too young to be able to compare the differences of life inside and outside the EU.  Are our schools not educating our youth on the meaning of the EU and the role each country plays in the EU.  Is the media affecting the understanding of what is truly happening in the EU?

What is the real idea of the EU and how do each of our countries play a role in this EU?  Looking deeply into how each of us play a role in the EU.  What does the EU expect from us as people and countries, and what do we expect from the EU?  What does it mean to be an EU citizen, what are the responsibilities and what are the rewards?  What rights come with being an EU citizens and how do we treat these rights?  Do we enjoy all these rights or are they simply another empty promise?  \r\n\r\nWe will look at EU enlargement and the democratic process of the EU and see how we can be more involved in the EU, making it a better place for all of us.

This youth exchange will look at sports from three perspectives; making sports accessible to everyone, keeping active to maintain a healthy lifestyle and allowing people to find employment in the field of sports.  The youth exchange is made up of young people from various areas of each of the partner countries with more emphasis on young people who don\u2019t have easy or free access to sport, and also including young people who have an interest in turning sports into a career.   Young disadvantages people will also participate in this exchange to offer their insight on the subject to allow us to examine and develop new approaching to helping more young people to access sports and also for young people to follow careers in sports.The main issues to be covered in this exchange are access to sport by young people and evaluating the quality and quantity, the support offered to young people from school levels and the continued obstacles they face as they grow up.  The second issue to be explored is the use of illegal substances in sports, evaluating why people feel the need to resort to such action and how we can overcome these problems.

This perception is built upon the knowledge of what the economical, social and democratic situation is Europe in today. Also perception derives from the personal logic and experiences of the young today. This is because many youngsters leave school either by their choice or not. Other youngsters study without researching the availability of jobs for that  field for the years after graduating.

We find people from all corners of the world living and working in almost all of the EU countries but is this really that simple?  We have seen all these different people and in many cases we have worked or studied with them in our countries and we have very often experienced some problems with them.  Why are we not living in harmony all the time?\r\n\r\nThis training course focuses on communication, and especially the miscommunication as a result of cultural differences and the impact this has on the harmonious or discriminatory effect on behaviour.\r\n\r\nEnglish is considered an international language and people in most countries aspire to have English as a second language.  Many countries offer English as a compulsory subject at schools and others offer it as an option to students.  However we also see that in some countries grammar is given more emphasis and the result; people knowing the rules of the language but are unable to speak it.\r\n\r\nThere are few countries in the world that use English predominantly as the main language of the country and of these we can see that four of these countries are truly multicultural countries allowing for people from different backgrounds and groups to coexist in one community in harmony, these countries are The United Kingdom, the United States of America and South Africa and Australia. \r\n\r\nWe can see from these countries that the different cultural backgrounds of the citizens are incorporated into the culture of the country.  We can see this in the UK where curry is one of the most popular dishes, yet its origin is from India.  We see pizza being a popular fast food but its origins are from Italy.  So the question poses is \u201cIs it language which causes the foundation for discrimination?\u201d \r\n\r\nThere is a story of a president from Cyprus directly translating a common Greek saying to the Prime Minister of Great Britain, almost resulting in an international incident.  We cannot confirm the truth of this story but it is an excellent example of how the lack of communication skills and also the lack of tolerance to understand others can result in serious problems.  This story true or fictitious sets a perfect example for our project showing how two sides of a situation need to be understood for the truth to be uncovered.\r\n\r\nThis training course will evaluate communication and the approach people adopt with regard to communication and see who this can either be grounds for discrimination or reasons for cooperation.  We will work with youth workers from a variety of EU countries to example these problems and try to discover how we can develop our communications skills and also our tolerance of different cultures to allow us to communicate and understand each other better in order to allow for a more peaceful and harmonious approach to our rights to freely move within the EU.  \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital, non-formal and informal methodologies are used to achieve these goals.  \r\n\r\nDiscussions are used to allow participants to share knowledge, ideas and experiences with each other. \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for inter-cultural learning during the workshops.  \r\n\r\nRole playing will also be used to allow the participants to get another perspective of different problems.  \r\n\r\nSimulations are also done during the project, allowing people to take on roles which are often opposite to their real roles.  \r\nUsing all the above tools and methodologies the participants learn through non-formal and informal activities which are real, but are within a safe environment allowing them to learn from each other, make mistakes which can be corrected through discussions and not put themselves at risk.

Our project will simulate athletic aspects of the European world cup and also the knowledge of our youth to demonstrate that cooperation is a vital part of growth.  Firstly we will break into groups consisting of one person from each country making up European groups.  Throughout the project we will have to overcome various obstacles either being of an athletic (sport) nature or an academic (knowledge) nature with particular emphasis on the European System in Place. Each group will need to select the member who would be best suited for each task to increase their chance of winning the gold. \r\nThe idea of the project is to stimulate the cooperation between Europeans from different countries so that they can achieve one common goal.  Through these activities and challenges we will better understand the EU system in place and how important it is to work together in order to progress as nations and as one Europe.  We will see how we can utilise the strengths of some people for certain tasks and how to assist others with their weaknesses so that unified we are stronger.  We will test our knowledge about each other as people and as countries and understand the importance of cultural diversity and understanding in our growth.

Not only do young people of these countries feel powerless when it comes to their lives are affected by different policies but the crisis in the EU has affected their employment options and again they feel there is no solution for the problems, at least not from their hands. \r\n\r\nThe project will identify specific problems related to youth in the partner countries and will look at methods to overcome these problems in a uniform way that can be used across the EU.  We will look at different solutions for problems like youth unemployment, education and methods to enhance skills and help young people become more employable and at the same time allow young people to be more active in their community and in the EU.\r\n\r\nEach partner in the project will identify problems specific to their country and also work on solutions in helping young people and also in finding methods to bring the EU closer together to work together to be more unified to build a stronger more unified EU.

Sadly though many young people from different countries are feeling the effects of the crisis and many are beginning to lose hope in the EU system because they feel that they are excluded from the EU support system.  Young people are unable to find employment, and mobility options are growing less and less and young people are losing hope in a unified Europe.  \r\nOur project will look at the crisis and the problems that young people are experiencing, we will look at the various tools the EU offers youth to overcome these difficult times.

Statistically this might be correct but realistically speaking most people living and working in other countries are perceived as intruders or foreigners in other countries and they continue to feel this, so are we truly European countries?We have become social groups within our society and too often we are excluded from society, we need to bring people together to understand each other in order to end discrimination.Our project will look at discrimination in all forms, starting with the principals of the fundamental EU rights including mobility and seeing the impact this has on discrimination and then extending our views of the problems of discrimination to all forms of discrimination including gender equality and racism.  Our project hopes to give our young people the opportunity to learn from each other and from their own mistakes so that we can understand each other better and respect each other, so that we can truly be European countries living in harmony.  When we can learn to live together as European we will also learn that all people are equal regardless of gender or race, religion and preferences.Tolerance will allow us to accept each other\u2019s differences and embrace our similarities and accept people for who they are so that as young people we can set the example of overcoming xenophobia and discrimination. The profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantaged.In order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital.  Very importantly we will need to establish a trust between the participants so that they can openly discuss the issues and problems in each of their communities.  These discussions will give the youth more confidence, especially when seeing that youth from other countries are facing the same problems.  Open debates will allow the youth to express their personal viewpoints of different matters and to justify them through discussions.  This will also allow for others to gain knowledge based on the experiences of others.Workshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.  Workshop are designed around the various subjects allowing the different youth to discuss the issues and work together to solve problems and share experiences.Role playing will also be used to allow the participants to get another perspective of different problems.  This has proven to be very successful as it allows for the youth to see common problems from the viewer\u2019s point of view rather than the actor.  This also allows for innovative ways of showing problems.Simulations are also done during the project, allowing people to take on roles which are often opposite to their real roles.  During the simulations the participants will take on roles to re-enact a real situation based on events and problems in the real world.

In real life when making these choices the results could be dangerous but these activities simulate reality and allow for learning in a safe and secure environment.As a result we hope to give our youth the tools and knowledge to understand and be able to identify discrimination and act in ways to stop it.

Transgender people in Lithuania face many challenging situations due to the legal and social environment in the country. Regarding this, Lithuania has a lot of room for improvement in the case of legal gender recognition, gender reassignment treatment, etc. The fact that Lithuanian legislative system does not recognize the legal category of \u201cgender identity\u201d, cause discrimination of transgender people, which is often not punished.

Apart from creating empowered LGB and transgender community this project\u2019s objective is to increase the visibility of transgender people in LGBT* movement in Lithuania and at the same time raise awareness about diversity in the community. Having in mind that the sustainable change reacting directly to the needs of the target group is coming from the members of this group, this project intend to focus on empowering community from bottom-up approach. \r\n\r\nThroughout the years of implementing EVS project LGL observed that presence of an international volunteers is essential in LGBT* community for the purpose of building and empowering young people to be more active. This project envisions two volunteers, one from United Kingdom and one from Slovenia, that are passionate about human rights and interested in LGBT* topics. Ideally, one of the volunteers identifying as a transgender. In that case, they can be considered as a participant with fewer opportunities, since transgender people face a lot of discrimination in their daily life.

Accessing services and resources in the cloud on-demand and in a flexible and elastic way could result in significant cost savings due to more efficient and convenient resource utilization that also replaces large investment costs with long term operational costs. On the other hand, the take up of cloud computing by SMEs and the public sector is still relatively low due to limited application-level flexibility and also security concerns. The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application (COLA) project aims to increase the adoption of cloud computing services by the above mentioned two strategic target communities. Typical industry and public sector applications require resource scalability and efficient resource utilization in order to serve a variable number of customers with dynamic resource demands, and to suitably optimize resource consumption and costs. However, the dynamic and intelligent utilization of cloud infrastructure resources from the perspective of cloud applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the intelligent and coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent also the run-time orchestration of cloud applications, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that could be applied in large scale near operational level industry trials. The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications. COLA will demonstrate the applicability and impact of the solution via large scale near operational level SME and public sector pilots and demonstrators, and will also define a clear pathway how the innovation can be delivered to the market.", 172691.0, 3658885.0, 6, 15, "COLA", null, null, null, "h2020_206078_937778153"], [1372636800000, 1459382400000, "Cloud based Simulation platform for Manufacturing and Engineering", "Outlandish Llp", "Simulation can significantly improve the competitive position of manufacturing and engineering companies by reducing their costs and resulting in more efficient development, production, procurement, logistics or financial processes. However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 36705.0, 4193116.0, 8, 29, "CloudSME", null, null, null, "fp7_109223_937778153"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "KHULISA", 8808.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_26820"], [2017, "KHULISA", 3356.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_37004"]]}}, "4JR": {"creative": {"data": [[1412121600000, 1454025600000, "European film club pilots", "FILM LITERACY EUROPE LIMITED", 125601.0, 4, 4, "Structure: Film Literacy Europe is the coordinating organisation and will oversee the programme and provide European coordination and support.
