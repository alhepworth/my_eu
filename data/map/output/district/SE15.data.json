In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?  How can schools encourage positive attitudes in all pupils and set them on a path to fitness for life and a healthier, more productive future?  \r\n\r\nThe task begins with up-skilling current and future teachers to lead the attitudinal change we require from all educational sectors.  This project seeks to do that by bringing together a number of high achieving schools, aware of this need to 'educate for life', as well as Universities with a Teacher Training remit--including a focus on training Physical Education teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership consists primarily of a University and 2 schools in each of three countries--the UK,  Spain and Greece.  (An additional partner of a University based fitness facility adds additional expertise and resources to complement the other UK partners and  bring the total number in the partnership to 10.)  \r\n\r\nThe group have agreed a 2 year work-plan of collaboration in order to exchange knowledge, bring more focus to the Pupil Health & Well - Being agenda and develop joint resources.   4  joint,  transnational meetings  and a program of on-going  local activities to strengthen education are planned.  Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.  They will also form the foundation of our final year training event  following our last transnational meeting\u2014a trial run for an ongoing in-service course offer for school staff across Europe, to be offered year on year following the project's end.  This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.  This will initially be within the organizations in the partnership, but over the life of this project, should spread locally via local dissemination activities and finally, across a wider European area as the end products are disseminated via our ongoing delivery of our  European in-service course for school staff.  \r\n\r\nMethodology  will be scientific and rigorously tested.   Meanwhile, the results of our project will be apparent early on in the practice of  the institutions collaborating.  Curriculum changes in our partner Universities and a whole school focus on Pupil Health in our partner schools will  develop rapidly.  Longer term change in other institutions and regions will cascade for many years as future (and current) teachers benefit from the training developed and the innovative and inclusive approach to whole school engagement with Health and Well - Being which we believe our focus and our end product outcomes will support.", "http://www.johndonne.southwark.sch.uk", "John Donne Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013732_coordinator"], [2014, "Language Professional Development", "John Donne Primary School", 45739.0, 1, 1, "John Donne Primary School is an outstanding school with a children and staff from diverse backgrounds.

We have made language learning in Key Stage 2 a compulsory subject.  This means our teachers are required to teach Spanish (our school\u2019s chosen language) to an acceptable standard.  With a large number of Spanish speaking families and children attending our school, this is sometimes intimidating for those members of staff required to teach a subject that they are not fluent in.   \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives, we will send 12 teachers and teaching assistants across Key Stage 1 and 2 on week long Spanish training in Gran Canaria, delivered by MBA Business School, Las Palmas. \r\n\r\nWe will send 6 members of staff in the first year. They will disseminate their experience back in school and in the following year, we will choose 3 of those 6 participants to train further in Spain to advance their proficiency, along with 3 other members of staff that leaders judge would also benefit and boost language learning learning impact back in school.   \r\n\r\nAdditionally, our school was recently awarded silver in the 'Primary Science Quality Mark'.  We have also been appointed STEM Ambassadors for encouraging and inspiring young people in STEM subjects through the use of STEM teaching.   It is a school objective to continue prioritizing Science excellence, so experiencing different approaches and STEM school practice in other EU settings will further this focus too.  \r\n\r\nIn year 1, we will therefore send 6 teachers and teaching assistants from Key Stage 1 and 2 on a course in Cyprus, (hosted by Grammar School, Nicosia) designed to teach us how to better  motivate STEM students.

This has become a focus for the EYFS in continuing to raise attainment and on the journey from good to 'outstanding'.  The setting is now considered an example of best practice within the borough.  As part of this, I have been asked by the local authority to become an EYFS champion and have given presentations to EYFS coordinators, staff and leaders on boys in the early years, supporting same-sex families and deconstructing gender.  I have also undertaken moderation for the local authority and have been part of establishing an EYFS diversity group within the borough.  The group has 5 school members and provides an opportunity to discuss, plan and engage with current debates and research on gender equality and supporting LGBTQ parent families.  The school also has a curriculum focus on raising children's self-esteem and PSHE is a high priority across the school.  In particular, the school is committed to challenging stereotypes for both adults and children.  The school is at the beginning of the journey of embedding equality for all stakeholders and addressing inequalities in gender and for same sex parent families. \r\n\r\nAs the school has identified the gap in attainment between boys and girls as a significant need, the project objective is to upskill practitioner knowledge and pedagogy in relation to gender in the EYFS by  attending two one week courses and training during the Spring half-terms (2019 and 2020) on gender neutrality in early years education.  Another local school, Nell Gwynn nursery school, are also applying for funding to attend the same courses.  Both Rye Oak and Nell Gwynn are members of the EYFS diversity group in Southwark and have both identified approaches to teaching in a gender neutral way as the next steps in their development.    In Sweden, Lotta Rajalin of Egalia and Monica Soderberg-Forslund, from Stockholm University, will deliver the training.  The gender officer officer from Jarvalla Local Authority will also be involved. In Latvia, our course provider will be Inese Liepina of the Bernu videa Skolas.    Both courses will focus on the way gender neutral language, provision and practice support children and help to raise attainment for both boys and girls.  We will send 14 participants on both courses. This will include 1 senior leader (assistant head teacher and EYFS coordinator), 5 EYFS teachers, 1 HLTA and 8 early years practitioners.  \r\n\r\nBy attending both courses participants will be able to share their learning and embed their learning across the phase.  By sending the EYFS team as a group, new approaches to tackling gender equality across the EYFS and the school can become embedded at a deeper level and ensure that both boys and girls achieve to their full potential.   We aim to develop all of our EYFS staff within our setting to ensure that the improved practices and provision will be embedded throughout the phase.  Sending all staff ensures that gender neutral approaches to learning is not a 'top-down' pedagogical approach.  Information will be disseminated across the school through staff meetings and INSET training. and by various participants.   The team will support other local nurseries and disseminate learning through the EYFS coordinators briefings (termly), Southwark EYFS Champions work (half-termly) and the Southwark EYFS conference (April 2019 and 2020).   We aim to collaborate closely with another local nursery, Nell Gwynn. Preparing for the course,  evaluation and dissemination will be shared with staff from Nell Gwynn.

For the past six years, children in KS2 (7 to 11 year olds) have received 45 minutes of Spanish each week, led by a specialist teacher.  Children in KS1 and Early Years receive 30 minutes of Spanish each week.  As well as this, class teachers led a 15 minute consolidation session during the week.   Understanding of Spanish speaking cultures is also embedded in the curriculum, for example, in Reception, children learn about Spanish food in the topic 'Viva Espa\u00f1a'.  Each year, in the summer term, the whole school learns about a different aspect of Hispanic culture, as part of, 'Spanish Day'; children dress up and eat a special Spanish lunch!\r\n\r\nWe have found that our children have benefitted enormously from the opportunity to learn a foreign language and enhance their understanding of different cultures around the world.

After conducting a staff audit, we have found that five of the class teachers lack the confidence to teach Spanish and as a result have not effectively taught the fifteen minute consolidation session.  To continue to develop the Spanish and international curriculum it is vital that these class teachers receive specialist training in MFL pedagogy, Spanish language and Spanish culture.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry. This validation of our technology will be undertaken by our end user partners CEPA and Gadmon.", 240919.0, 1918353.0, 6, 13, "EZ-LINE", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_989192033"]]}}}}
