On a deeper level, the central principle of volunteering\u2014that labour is offered free of a monetary evaluation of its worth\u2014is understood to be inherently ennobling and an ideal of the human relationship to work.\r\n\r\nThis will be the 3rd edition of our \u201cCamphill Life Sharing EVS project\u201d. It will be a 10-months volunteering placement for 12 volunteers from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nVolunteers at CVT provide support to vulnerable adults in working with them in our gardens and craft workshops, while developing knowledge and practical skills that will be useful to them for the rest of their lives. They also participate in artistic and cultural events, including concerts, theatre performances, and festival celebrations and are supported to initiate their own projects, in line with their personal aspirations. \r\n\r\nThe presence of young, international volunteers contributes immeasurably to the cultural enrichment of the Villagers, and helps them to realise their full potential in workshop activities. The volunteers, meanwhile, benefit from. developing meaningful friendships with people with learning difficulties, which opens the minds and hearts of young people to an understanding of true human worth.

Volunteers\u2019 personal development is also enhanced with the maturation of their self-worth, happiness, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing.

From their response to this experience and their desires for their future, each participant will be individually supported to identify and pursue opportunities for further study in formal and non-formal education, biodynamic apprenticeships, craft apprenticeships, short or long-term volunteer placements and employment within the Camphill movement in twenty-three countries in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia.
