The Giraff\\ project aims at developing a system that addresses such a challenge. The system consists of a network of home sensors that measure e.g. blood pressure or temperature, or detect e.g. whether somebody occupies a chair, falls down or moves inside a room. The data from these sensors are interpreted by an intelligent system in terms of activities, e.g. the person is going to bed, and health and wellbeing, e.g. the person is tired or well rested. These activities can then trigger alarms or reminders to the person or his/her caregivers, or be analysed over time by a health professional. The system should automatically adapt to perform specific services such as checking the person's sleeping patterns. There is also a telepresence robot, the Giraff, which can be moved around in the home by somebody connected to it over internet, e.g. a caregiver. The Giraff is effectively a mobile communication platform, equipped with video camera and display, and microphone and speakers, and it helps the user to maintain his/her social contacts. Particular emphasis is put on user evaluation outside the laboratories.  The Giraff\\ system will be installed and evaluated in at least 15 homes of elderly people distributed in three European countries (Sweden, Italy and Spain). These evaluations will drive the development of the system. The concept of 'useworthiness' will be central in order to assure that the Giraff\\ system provides services that are easy and worth using.
