This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners. The methodological framework of the project builds on existing methods and practices which are already in use in the partners\u2019 countries or developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and other partner organisations are involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. The project proposal will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES and FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities. The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved.

In this framework, the QUALITY-W 2014 project, in which \u2018W\u2019 stands for \u2018Welcoming\u2019, takes into account the quality of welcoming guests as an issue to be investigated, in which to insert the learning programme that will be developed during the work experience.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018quality of welcoming\u2019 concerns the way one deals with guests and involves the ability to meet their requirements and understand their problems and cultural background. Moreover, it also concerns the guests\u2019 feelings towards the management of the environment as a system, and therefore towards the appearance of the territory and the impact that structures and economic activities have on it. \r\n\r\nMany skills involved in this field are based on personal gifts that the school, despite its educational efforts, cannot always develop and evaluate properly.

In fact, recent research showed that, despite the numerous advancement of the modern school system, newly graduated high school students are often not prepared to approach the job market because they:\r\n\r\n- possess basic skills and competencies but lack technical and operative skills usable in the job market;\r\n\r\n- show a natural  incline towards  digital and web technology, but  they are not \u201cdigital competent\u201d, that is their knowledge of digital technology is not adequate to a work context;  \r\n\r\n- show a general lack of confidence in their possibilities and dissatisfaction with the work  environment, which is felt more acutely in this period of crisis;\r\n\r\n- have transversal competences (team work, communication skills, problem solving attitude),  but only tried in the school environment;\r\n\r\n- have a limited knowledge of the local production system due to the absence of a true contact with the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe mobility experience will be preceded by a thorough linguistic, cultural, pedagogical and sectorial preparation (25 hour distance language training, propaedeutic seminars, orientation to job market or university, 1 module on labour law and work safety, 1 open day with local companies). This preparation will sustain future choices and encourage participation in innovative training experiences, open to a European context.

One of the SOC (Employment Service of Catalonia) priorities is to foster and ensure people\u2019s professional qualification. In order to achieve this priority, the SOC has a high value tool: the Professional Training and Innovation Centres (CIFO). The training activity of the CIFOs is based on imparting specific and quality training actions for employment matching the needs of people, companies and territories. They provide the necessary theoretical and practical training to achieve or improve skills in order to contribute to the employability of their pupils, which are unemployed registered as job seekers in the Job Centre.

In the moment of their registration they will have to show interest in taking part in this project.\r\n\r\nThose who succeed in their training courses, will be given the opportunity to enter a selection process for 16 weeks traineeship in a European company within the next year after obtaining their CP. Specialities will be such as \"ICT\" = Information and Communications Technology, Renewable Energy, Industrial Mechanics, Electrical Installation, Industrial Automation Systems, Welder, Chemistry, Logistics, Management, Finances, Comercial Management, etc... \r\n\r\nOur project starts from a new concept which consists in complementing the value of the CP with a traineeship in a foreign labour environment, which is real but strange, and they will have the chance to use their recently acquired knowledge and skills in a different language. Therefore, the CIFO will provide language courses in order to improve adaptation in the host country. \r\n\r\nCandidates will have to prepare a CV in the Europass format and a motivation letter in the language of the host country or in English as common language. We have a network of intermediary partners which are experts in mobility management in different European countries.

Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles.
