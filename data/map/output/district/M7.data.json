The school was newly built in 2011, when two smaller schools merged.\r\n\r\nThe catchment area for River View is among the highest levels of social and economic deprivation in the country and we have a higher than average number of children eligible for pupil premium funding. \r\n\r\nAt River View our philosophy is based on the fact that we live in the 21st Century. Preparing children for their lifelong learning journey is central to teaching and learning and we aim to support our learners through a creative, flexible and innovative curriculum which encourages both collaborative working and independent thinkers.\r\n\r\nSpanish is taught as the compulsory element of the MFL curriculum. It is taught to all pupils from year 3 to year 6, including those children in the language resource provision. Presently, all Spanish is taught by one member of staff who is a non-specialist teacher.\r\n\r\nWhile we know that the teaching of languages at River View is good (as assessed by Ofsted and our school improvement partners) we know that there are key elements to our practice that would be enhanced through the participation in a European mobility project. \r\n\r\nOur vision for the next 3 years is that we will be able to deliver outstanding MFL provision for all children, using the elements of our current practice that we know are working well and building in the range of skills, competencies, methodologies and experiences that we feel can only be gained from our involvement in an immersion course.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the most effective way to improve our level of Spanish is through immersion courses where we will communicate daily with native speakers. We plan to send 8 members of staff twice on structured immersion courses in Spain. We have carefully researched options and have a clear understanding of how we would use the courses to improve teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of our project is to: \r\n\r\n To develop a more sustainable model for our language teaching, where all staff feel confident in teaching MFL across the school with the support of key team members.\r\n\r\nTo begin to make links with schools in Spain so that children can use their language for a real life purpose; communication with peers in our partner school.\r\n\r\nWe will involve candidates with a range of different roles within the school. i.e; not all class teachers. Within the teaching staff, we will also include some members of the management team (with a greater capacity for dissemination across the school) as well as a mixture of experienced staff, RQT\u2019s and NQT\u2019s.  \r\n\r\nIt is also important that the age specialisms for staff was varied. One of our key aims is to increase our capacity to deliver MFL to our youngest children as well as the using the compulsory element of the national curriculum. Having a member of the leadership team who is also an early year\u2019s specialist will enable us to do this more effectively.\r\n\r\nParticipating staff will gain a variety of ways; language skills, pedagogy, expanded knowledge of Spanish culture, and will  bring these skills back into the school. They will be able to teach in more innovative ways with improved competence and confidence in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThey will be able to observe and assess best practice in other countries and exchange teaching ideas, increasing their own skillset and that of another European school and teaching staff.\r\n\r\nBeing able to speak a language from a young age will increase the chances of our pupils continuing language learning in to adult life and increasing their employability as adults. This will give them greater opportunities both here in the UK or in Europe.\r\n\r\nOther staff, our SLT, parents, broader school,  and cluster schools will also benefit.\r\n\r\nWe will disseminate what we\u2019ve learnt and experienced widely, and evaluate our achievements carefully. Overall, we would hope to see an improvement in our MFL delivery, results and consequently OFSTED rating to Outstanding.", "http://www.riverviewprimary.co.uk", "River View Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035432_coordinator"]]}}}}
