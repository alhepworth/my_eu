How can we open up discussion of these tensions beyond politicians and academics and move our societies forward in ways that enable our individuality and local distinctiveness to flourish? TIPP will seek to understand and document the influence of human territoriality in the modern world, and propose methodologies that can support unity across the EU and beyond. Through a conceptually led, inter-disciplinary and cross-sectorial approach that encompasses artistic research, audience engagement, organisational cooperation and wide-ranging discussion, TIPP aims to open up questions of identity and promote greater awareness of territoriality to the cultural sector and also to non-arts audiences and underrepresented groups - including young people, refugees and social entrepreneurs. By exploring the concept of territoriality through a programme of cultural activity TIPP will reinforce the need for transnational cooperation and unity. TIPP brings together partners from the UK, Belgium, Italy and the Republic of Macedonia, who have expertise in the visual arts and design sectors, and whose programmes already use visual culture as a starting point to discuss broader social and political themes. TIPP will create new opportunities for artists to work internationally, via residency programmes and exhibitions. It will strengthen the partners\u2019 capacity to work transnationally by expanding their international networks, developing new skills and testing innovative audience development models. A dedicated online platform will be created to communicate TIPP activities and results, including an online publication.

These students\u2019 curricula are related to the professional profiles that this projects aims to develop:\r\n \r\n- Digital Interactive Experience Developer\r\n- Social Media Specialist of Cultural Heritage\r\n- Lighting Designer\r\n\r\nThe decision to reinforce the application of new technologies in creativity and in the enhancement and use of cultural heritage, stems from the European, national and local need to train dynamic young people with increasingly higher skills matching the new market needs and in line with the Action Plan for Digital Education (European Year of Cultural Heritage and POR Marche 2014-2020 and development of the Creative Cultural District). \r\nThese professions, being able to combine innovation and creativity, are those that best perform in terms of recruitment and therefore demonstrate strong employment potential at local, national and European level.\r\n\r\nPromoted by the Liceo Classico of  Macerata, \"BRIGHT\" presents a transnational training experience that provides an innovative offer of training, that integrates the path of institutional studies with a four-week professional experience. Mobilities, over a period of two years, will take place in young, dynamic and avant-garde companies operating in FR, DE, ES, DK, UK, S, FI, SLO, IE and LT. The work experience will be implemented with on-the-job training methods and through the direct practice of tasks relating to the relevant professional profiles.\r\n\r\nThe high potential of the initiative appears even more substantial if we look at the target to which it refers, in fact the surveys conducted by the Consortium on the condition of the students that are about to take further education or try to find a job, outline an updated picture showing that they: \r\n-  possess limited awareness of their knowledge and inadequate ability to apply this knowledge; \r\n-  complain of a general lack of operational skills and a lack of familiarity with the professional world;\r\n-  show a general lack of trust in future employment prospects;\r\n-  tend to postpone further education in order to have a first investigate the work market;\r\n-  require guidance on how to make best use of their informal and non-formal training. \r\n\r\nThe realization of 4 week internships in companies, as well as the pilot experimentation of the ERAMUS PRO mobility, will offer the participants the opportunity to develop their skills, in an attempt to reduce the negative aspects above listed. The experience abroad will be carefully prepared by a linguistic, cultural, pedagogical and sectorial reinforcement program (OLS, digital skills for the professional world, health and safety in the workplace, specific technical seminars). The qualitative management of all the planned activities, the recognition, certification and validation of skills will be guaranteed by the application of ECVET tools.\r\nThe expected results, with regard to the identified needs and objectives, are:\r\n- development of communicative-linguistic and technical-professional skills in the participants with respect to the project sectors;\r\n- strengthening of technical and professional skills and consequent improvement of the professional curriculum through a certified, recognized and validated path;\r\n- acquisition of increasingly qualitative mobility experiences to be transferred, through the testimony of the beneficiaries themselves, into the local, cultural and professional reality, families, social partners and companies;\r\n- training experience designed to promote employability, thanks to the inclusion of the 10 new graduates (who will experience the Erasmus PRO measure), in one of the world's leading companies in the field related to this initiative;\r\n- strengthening of the project\u2019s synergies with other initiatives, to promote the creation of a stable network and the realization of successful projects.\r\n\r\nThe capitalization of the experience will be achieved through the active participation of beneficiaries in national and European initiatives (meetings with companies and social partners, week of Digital Cultures and Crowddreaming Competition), supported by the use of the e-CF and ECVET.

Moreover, the EUGES motivates the VET colleges to develop a concept of Europeanisation/ internationalization respectively to strengthen the existing ones. Altogether there are 58 state-run Vet colleges in the Cologne region.  The teachers' mobilities help to get to know future partners for students' exchange personally, to agree on their framework (memorandum of understanding) and to exchange and improve ideas of learning and teaching methods.

As our college is only about 3 km away from the Dutch border, the focus of our school programme has always been on internationalisation.\r\n\r\nOur aim is not only to prepare students to be able to live and work in the Euregio region, but also to pave their way for an increasingly global job market. Preparing them for the job market, however, is not our only goal. With the work placements we want to give them the chance to gain positive experiences with people from other countries and cultures. In our opinion, an understanding between people from different nations can grow best if people actually meet. Also, having yourself experienced what it is like to be a \u201cforeigner\u201d in another country, will help you approach people without prejudices in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cFirst vocational experiences in Europe\u201d is based on these considerations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at two target groups. On the one hand there is a group of 152 students from the full-time initial vocational training and on the other hand there are 18 trainees from the dual system (taught at college for 1 \u00bd days and at a company for 3 \u00bd days). In the next two years 140 of the participants of the full-time initial training at our college will take part in the additional vocational qualification \u201ceuregio competence\u201d. In 2004 this additional vocational qualification has been developed together with the 5 partner regions in the Euregio Maas - Rhine region and has been offered to the students with great success. It consists of 4 competencies: language competence (the students choose either French or Dutch as a second language), information competence (course: Living and working in the Euregio Maas- Rhine region), intercultural competences (one focus of the language courses) and a work experience in the region, the students are learning the language of. If the students have successfully passed all the segments and successfully passed an additional language test they will be rewarded with the Euregio competence certificate, which is accepted in all partner regions.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 students of the full-time vocational college will do their work placements in England, Spain or France apart from the above mentioned additional qualification.\r\n\r\nFurthermore there will be 18 participants from the dual system (trainees). They will do work placements in England.\r\n\r\nAll these activities are aiming at consolidating and extending their language skills, at acquiring a larger intercultural competence, as well as getting insights into the world of work and the social structure of their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe work placements of our college in the Euregio region will be organized by our school. We will find accommodation for the students. Our partners in Belgium and the Netherlands will help us find work placements and together with the students we will choose the most suitable for them. We will also take care of the students during their work placements. Our colleagues will meet the students during their time abroad. Usually at the end of their work placements they will see them in their companies.\r\n\r\nApart from that they can be reached by email or telephone any time. The vicinity of the work placements and the commitment of the teachers involved have enabled us to take good care of the students so far.\r\n\r\nTo implement and supervise the work experience in countries which are further away needs more support by our local partners. They provide vacancies for work placements, accommodation and are contact persons for the students and companies. The teachers involved in the project at our school are in contact with the students via email or telephone in the same way as described above with the other projects.\r\n\r\nIf time permits they will also visit the students.\r\n\r\nOur long-term experience with the Euregio competence work placements has shown us that the participants feel more at home in the foreign languages after their time abroad and they are more ready to use their language skills. First and foremost we have seen more self-confidence as they have coped with the demands of their work experience on their own. For many of them it is the first time that they have to organize their daily routine by themselves and in foreign surroundings. After successfully coping with this they are rightfully proud of themselves. They have gained this experience for their future and this effect we can immediately notice at our school.\r\n\r\nWhen the students are coming back from their work experience and are talking about their experiences they are the best advertisements for the project.

To prepare jong people for this special job market, the additional vocational qualification \u201eEuregio-Competence\u201c has been developed in 2004.

They are more self-imployed and more self-confident and that has a positiv effect on their social environment.The internships in the Euregio Maas-Rine are organised and handled by the teachers themselves because the workplacements are very clos tot he Colleges. They are in close contact with the companies in the Netherlands and Belgium as well. The internships in other European countries are organised by reliable partners.The contact between students and companies then is kept via mail.In this project we also plan mobilities from teachers.

In addition, the project will be helpful for the students in the process of establishing a career or in increasing their chances for professional applications.\r\nThe choice of a new partner in Bulgaria shows that the LEB does not shy away from countries whose languages are not taught at our school. The continuation of the successful cooperation with our Turkish partners gives us the courage to do that. 44 participants in total, with the help of the partners abroad, will do internships in a variety of businesses, which have been carefully selected according to their training.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics.

After the development of a first project in Dublin of 31 mobilities, a second one with more destinations, sending institutions and mobilities and a third one that strengthens all the lessons learnt in the previous one, the new project consolidates the work done and the cooperation with the General Directorate of Vocational Training in the region of Madrid (DG FP). \r\nThe new figure ErasmusPRO has been added and the number of destinations has grown on to recently-acceded to the EU countries as Slovenia, which also allows the increase of the number of ordinary mobilities (84, including 4 of long-term mode) and of special needs (8), as well as the educational centers/sending institutions members of the consortium (18) which find it difficult managing mobilities on their own.\r\nThe project\u2019s objectives for the students are, therefore: improve their employability with the acquirement of new technical skills, improvement of social and language skills and self-confidence and matureness gaining because of the unique experience that staying abroad means. And for the sending institutions: facilitate their participation in European mobility projects with the corresponding internationalization of their work, as well as amplify and diversify their educational offer. \r\nThe new project keeps growing in terms of number of mobilities and destination countries. It consists of 90 mobilities for students to make an internship period in companies based in United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy,  Slovenia, Czech Republic and Portugal (without a training period): 50 of Intermediate Vocational Training students to make their module of Training in Working Centers, 30 more and shorter for students of Intermediate Vocational Training on their 1st or 2nd year of study, 4 for long-term mobilities of the type of ErasmusPRO and 8 more for students of Intermediate Vocational Training and Professional Programs with special needs. Students will be given preference but recent graduates will be allowed to take part in the project as well. It consists as well in 14 vacancies for accompanying people for each travel flow during the first days of stay, and, of course, for the 8 students with special needs, considering the previously acquired experience and the fact that most of the students have never been abroad and/or come from deprived areas. \r\nActivities.

The participation in the selection process will be open to all students that meet the criteria stablished in the Call Bases that will be agreed, approved, and published by the Comitee. At least 86 participants will receive language training from the OLS and pedagogical and cultural talks are also foreseen. The educational plan will be agreed between the sending and hosting mentors and stablished in the Learning Agreement document. The internship monitoring will be made in a direct and periodic way by the two mentors, the partner institutions, and the Foundation itself.

This partnership was gradually enlarged and now consists of 6 schools with a focus on trade matters. These schools send interns to and host interns from their partner schools.\r\nThis cooperation was consolidated in particular by an additional Comenius-Project from 2012-2014 led by our friends from Luxembourg. In this project a website was created by a group of students from all our partner schools. This website (ajni-comenius.com) serves as the basis for the preparation and implementation of mutual internships, according to the project name \u201cApplying for a Job \u2013 Network Internship\u201d.\r\nIn the next two years we would like to enable 50 students each year from both our full-time school courses and dual VET-courses to do a four-week internship abroad in order to promote their competences for a successful vocational life in Europe. The target group consists of students from the vocational training fields of trade and commerce and the clothing industry. For the first time we would also like to include students being trained in the cosmetic sector. European mobility projects constitute an important part of our school image as a certified European School in North-Rhine Westphalia.\r\nThe internships take place in companies found with the help our partner schools (Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Finland, Slovakia) but also through European partner agencies (Great Britain, Ireland, Malta). We depend on the cooperation with these agencies due to the fact that many of our interns want to do an internship in an English-speaking country. We have called on these partner agencies several times and the companies they provide for the interns have also been visited. Some of the internships take place in companies the interns have found on their own, partly in the foreign subsidiaries of our VET-partners from industry and commerce.\r\nThe Leonardo-Team of BK Halle consists of six experienced teachers who organize the implementation of the project.

Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 41 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 weeks and 7 months. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project. After personal interviews, feedback and agreement by the responsible person for the practical training, the students contact the participating organisation on their own. In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily. All acquired skills are a personal gain for their future career. The stay abroad is recognized as an internship.

Educators and researchers have been talking about the role of making activities in learning; they highlight the potential for project-based and hands-on approach to boost youth interest for inquiry and learning, to re-activate them from a social, psychological, professional point of view.\r\nOne popular strand of making activities in the context of non formal education involve experimenting with computer\r\nprogramming, electronics, and robotics.\r\nTypically, girls are much less prone to participate in such initiatives than boys, mainly due to the negative stereotypes they nurture towards scientific and technical disciplines. Thus, the great promise of the maker movement to democratize access to making as well as to its progressive spirit and philosophy are to be reconsidered in the face of evidence.

Youth workers shall return from this training, with a strong awareness of existing tools in VR/AR and how these can be deployed in a youth work context at an affordable cost, so that participants may replicate or inspire themselves from the solutions we will have introduced during the training. \r\n\r\nWhilst the effectiveness of VR/AR has tools for learning has been demonstrated by academic research and in particular has shown to not only have a positive impact on learning and mental health, It\u2019s usage in the field of youth organisations and non for profits has been lackluster. Lack of access to required equipment, and costs associated with VR/AR have been initial barriers of entry for many youth organisations. Yet rapidly falling costs of associated VR/AR equipment , and the emergence of existing VR / AR tools that work in conjunction with modern smartphones (e.g. Apple ARkit, Google\u2019s ARcore, Unity and Google Cardboard) now allow youth organisations and non for profits to consider using VR/AR in their fields. This creates the perfect opportunity for youth workers to adopt VR / AR solutions for their field of work, our training aims to assist youth workers in acquiring the theoretical knowledge required to deploy these solutions.\r\n\r\nAdditional objectives of the project and how they fit EU policy are the following:\r\n\r\nNew learning opportunities for NEETS\r\n\r\nStudents who aren\u2019t interested or aren\u2019t regularly immersed in the learning process tend not to understand the subject properly, may experience delayed learning or even refuse to study at all. Finding ways to motivate students and specifically students identified as NEETS remains a crucial determinant of the quality of the learning process. Modern or innovative learning materials, including digital ones, are rarely much different than traditional textbooks. Most so-called advanced materials (such as MOOCS) don\u2019t feature appealing visuals or truly interactive features, and are often perceived by students as boring. The usage of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality offer the opportunity to try novel teaching methods on NEETS who might have disengaged from traditional teaching methods, VR / AR allow students to interact with computers in a brand new way, enabling creativity and additional interactivity.\r\n\r\nEurope 2020 Objectives for smart growth\r\n\r\nAs part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the commission aims to bring economic growth within the EU partly by inciting innovation and fostering a digital society. Our project will be one of the means to help achieve these goals. Our program will empower youth workers with the skill set and knowledge necessary for them to collaborate with youths. The usage of VR / AR  in a youth work context, is likely to enhance creativity, innovation and leadership within youths themselves, as well as introduce youths to creative and productive usages of the VR / AR which could lead them to take an interest in a variety of related career fields including STEMS or media and arts related fields.\r\n\r\nIncreasing digital competencies \r\n\r\nVR / AR in particular offer particular avenues of growth for the economy, with estimate, research by IDC suggesting that the global market for VR and AR will be worth in excess of $162 billion by 2020. The scale and size of the market offers, employment opportunities for Europeans, yet current offers for training remains inadequate and limited to a niche number of individuals. Fostering digital competencies, remains one of the cornerstones of the commission's objective for 2020 and by offering training focussed on VR and AR to youth workers, we are offering training at the forefront of technological change, equipping youth workers with knowledge they can then transmit to youngsters themselves. \r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nWe have several activities planned so far. We aim to split our training into main activities which are designed to reflect the current main technological solutions of the VR/AR market today. These include:\r\n\r\n(1) Headset based VR activities\r\n(2) Smartphone based VR activities\r\n(3) Smartphone and tablet based AR activities\r\n(4) 360 Video filming\r\n\r\nIMPACT \r\n\r\nSome of the expected benefits of integrating VR/AR technology in youth work are\u00a0:\r\n\r\n- youth enjoy learning more, as they are actively involved, rather than passive listeners\r\n\r\n- by grounding learning activities in an authentic, real-world context, VR/AR based experiences stimulate and engage learners. They learn to question things and to apply their natural curiosity to the real world\r\n\r\n- VR/AR based learning methods promote social and communication skills by creating an environment that

As a result of these changes of diverse cultural clashes and economic upheavals with increased competitions. These changes are also driving both systemic and topical changes in our everyday life settings. We often experience conflict as a disruption in the natural flow of our relationships and engagements either within a team or communities. When there is a sudden brake-down of relationship in a team, community or groups. People do notice that something has changed and in some cases the episodic occurrences are glaring like open confrontations or violence. Some intuitively think it is not right but what to do with this changes or unpleasant development is what is missing. People more often than not jump to conclusions as to what is wrong by carrying out superficial assessment of what the problem is based on what they can see. But how to dissect the problem  and these unfolding changes are the critical challenges to a lot of young people.  A lot of times, everyone seems to be consumed by episodes and manifestation of conflicts rather than  understanding the root causes and factors predisposing the conflicts . By responding to the episodes of a conflict people miss the right approaches to conflict transformation because episodes and manifestations are smokescreens for the root causes and underlying problems that gave rise to the conflict in the first place. Conflict is a natural, normal and neutral occurrence but how to deal with that which is normal and neutral is a major challenge. Depressed economies , unemployment among young people , diversity , multiculturalism and migration creates  dislocations and conflict but a clear understanding  of how to analyze these conflicts  is what is  lacking which makes a lot of people to either resort to blame game or wrong approaches to conflict which in turn escalates the conflict. It is possible for people to take the right approaches in dealing with conflict provided they understand the root causes of the conflict.  If you find yourself in a diverse team who are constantly in mortal disagreements and everyone pulling in different directions or a relationship that suddenly turns sour or a stable community which suddenly are up in arms against each other. A superficial assessment of the situation based on what can be seen or associated emotional feeling will confuse and derail right approaches to transforming the situation but a clear understanding of CONFLICT ANALYSIS SKILL  will help in delving to the epi-centre of the problem  which will bring about right approaches and lead to stable and harmonious working relationships. This training seeks to help people get off the superficial and cosmetics approach to understand complex situation and give them the needed tools and skills to untangle situations and help teams to unstand themselves better for better performance and communities and groups to function harmoniously in a mutually reinforcing dimensions. This training will mitigate kneel jerk responses to unpleasant pressured situations but gives the participant the required skills to cut through distractions and get to the heart of the problem because lack of clear understanding of  any conflict creates room for escalation of conflict which could make it more difficult to transform . \r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders and youth in specific Conflict Analysis.  \r\n-Train youth workers and young people in Negotiation skills \r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders the fundamental principles of creators who takes the advantages of bad situations to   \r\n   create new and better opportunities\r\n- To train  youth workers and youth leaders in team building and team leading skills which will enable them to leverage diversity in a\r\n   multicultural workspace.\r\n- Build a pool of conflict analyst\r\n- Train youth worker and youth leaders on the cycle of conflicts\r\n- Train participants in local capacities for peace-building\r\n- Train participants in strategic peace-building\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Brighton in U.K for a Period of ten days  between 1st to 10th of July, 2017 with partners  which have been carefully selected, which includes Poland, Portugal, Italy ,Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and U.K, These are countries going through major uncertainties and  young people are in despair of diverse forms.

Early in the twenty first century, hundreds of conflicts continues across the globe and most recently the civil unrest in the Arab world tagged \"Arab spring\". This among other things has led to the Syrian civil war and the ethno-communal clashes in Libya that has displaced millions and causing millions to flee to Europe for safety has created a major cause for concern. Yet as our fractured continental and global family struggles to find the answers to this tetrhydra  problem. A major problem and link has been consistently overlooked by agencies and government. There is a direct link between trauma, security and violence.  Politicians , activist , human rights campaigners and general public tend to think that as soon as you are able to remove a victim of violence from the location of the conflict, the  problems are solved  without adequately considering the traumatic experiences these individuals have gone through and how to treat and heal these wounds because unhealed trauma will create another cycle of violence and security threats. Everyone who has gone through one form of violence or the other needs delicate support because trauma and violence are integrally linked. Violence often leads to trauma and untreated trauma in turn can lead to violence and further security threats. Trauma affects our very physiology, including our ability to be integrated fully in a society  and ability to do whole brain thinking.  Trauma related violence can come in diverse forms. Some  traumas are triggered by explosive situations like violent conflict , while others can be in the form of verbal assault, hate speech or psychological torture. This project is designed  to train young people and youth workers on how to transform trauma from a repressed form of denial into an opportunity to help the victims to discover another reality by seeking support and treatment. This project will target victims of violence both violent conflicts, domestic and society instigated violence and refugees.  Because of the fears and concerns already expressed against refugees in certain European cities, if this kinds of trainings are not undertaken by victims of violence especially refugees, the backlash of a potential lash out that may occur in communities.  This  project will be an opportunity to break the nexus between trauma and violence.

The current shifts of political powers, radicalization and refugee crises around the world cries for a need to equip youth workers and youth leaders with a new set of tools and methods for human rights education. Thankfully, in recent years the focus on human rights education and its quality standards is increasing due to the work of human rights and development organizations, however, human rights education as a concept and practice is relatively new to the non-formal education sector. The Council of Europe sees education as a defense against the rise of violence, racism, extremism, xenophobia, discrimination and intolerance and we couldn't agree more. During the 4th Coordination Meeting of the Council of Europe\u2019s No Hate Speech Movement campaign in Tirana, September 2016 we discussed creation of joined international actions to contribute to the further development of human rights education through youth work in Europe and Partner Countries. That was a starting point for this project development.  \r\n\r\nThe main aim of 'Education trumps hate: toolbox for human rights educators' training course is to equip youth workers and youth leaders with a new set of tools, methods, knowledges and skills to deliver human rights education activities in their 'day to day' work practices and to fight against the rise of violence, racism, extremism, xenophobia, discrimination and intolerance. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this training course includes defining human rights education for young people in local, national and European contexts; presenting overview of No Hate Speech Movement; introducing the \u2018Bookmarks\u2019, \u2018Compass\u2019 and \u2018We Can\u2019 manuals; 'hands on\u2019 practice with the manuals; sharing the best practice examples of human rights education with young people in participating countries; expending European network and developing future collaboration actions.  \r\n\r\nThis training course is based on the non-formal learning methodology: learning from 'hands-on' experiences, self reflection and self assessment, experiences and expertise shares, as well as theoretical inputs. As a result of taking part in this training course participants will gain the following knowledge about: democratic citizenship and human rights education on local, national and European levels; the human rights education terminology; the human rights education in the context of the Council of Europe; No Hate Speech Movement in European and Partner Countries; the tools that can be used in human rights education with young people; the Erasmus+ program and possibilities to access its funding to support human rights education in youth sector.\r\n\r\nBy participating in 'Education trumps hate: toolbox for human rights educators\u2019 training course participants will develop the following set of skills in: \r\no Designing and delivering human right education programs with young people; \r\no Using and adapting 'Bookmarks', 'Compass' and 'We Can' manuals for working with young people; \r\no Sharing good practices and learning from positive examples; \r\no Networking and developing international collaborations; \r\no Formulating counter narratives that fight the prevalence and tacit acceptance of hate speech; \r\no Critical thinking and reflective practices.\r\n\r\nThe expected impacts of this training course is a contribution to rising-up awareness and quality standards in relation to human rights education through youth work in European and Partner countries. This project reflects the values of the Council of Europe such as human rights, democracy, advocating for equality, inclusion and protection of minorities and these themes will be covered during this international collaboration. We expect to have a multiplier effect in participating countries, as new initiatives and activities will be developed and delivered on local, national  and international levels. Numbers of young people and youth work practitioners engaged in human rights educational activities will grow. NHSM will get stronger and become more united to stand for human rights, democracy and inclusion.

It will also increase the sense of belonging of african youth workers to the local societies where they will being providing support of social entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project: \r\n- To train youth workers, trainers, young leaders active in African organisations in social rights, to raise their knowledge of right.\r\n- Exchange of good practice and real cases of young immigrant groups, working together on solutions and social actions, with the knowledge of social rights\r\n- To work on recommendations to reduce social problems within disadvantaged neighborhoods and to exchange with stakeholders from Austria. \r\n- To train youth workers and trainers active in their local community in social entrepreneurship.\r\n- To develop and promote management skills of the participants for the optimization of human resources, financial and logistics.\r\n- To understand the importance of social entrepreneurship and social rights for creating value and enhancing the image of the organization.\r\n- To create and design a social program on social rights and social entrepreneurship.\r\n- To test social programs within the local communities and to create \u201clocal recommendation guides\u201d based on social entrepreneurship and social rights.\r\n- To exchange the experiences in a follow-up meeting to learn and mentoring each other and building a long-term and sustainable network between participating partner organisations.\r\n\r\n- Training Mobility: Strategic Training Mobility (7 working days in Vienna from 1st to 7th of June 2017).\r\nThe training mobility will be held in order to make sure that 38 youth worker participants from 16 partner countries will get more capacity to understanding well how the social entrepreneurship projects and social rights in each partner country and how it can be useful to support people that live in disadvantage neighborhoods.

Youth work should be able to respond to these needs accordingly by having skilled workers that are familiar with on-line tools, and who are also able to raise critical questions about technology. As the primary role of youth work is to assist young people through their transition into adulthood, we have to bring our focus on helping youth to find a balance between on-line and off-line worlds. Through our conversations with Partner Organisations, Youth Work Practitioners and Young People, and by taking into consideration the challenging context of Youth Work in Europe today we have identified an urgent need to contribute to developing digital youth work competences of youth work practitioners and young people, and also the need to put emphasis on critically analysing social media. As all Partner Organisations are using digital youth work approach in their practices and have years of experiences addressing hate speech online, we are keen to explore different digital tools and digital youth work approach and to challenge the issues such as cyber bullying, hate speech on-line, social exclusion etc. that digitisation have brought upon young people.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of 'Re-Naturing' project is to explore Digital Youth Work Approach and to bring focus on critical analysis of social media through the perspectives of youth work practitioners, young people and youth organisations.

They will know how young people communicate in digital environments and what supports they need to be able to react to hate speech, cyber bullying and other unwanted behaviour online. They will gain an ability to encourage young people to make informed decisions about on-line image and activities.Thus, will be able to asses and to understand digital literacy level of each young person that they work with in order to support him/her. Youth Work Practitioners will know how to challenge young people to think critically about social media and digital content. Practitioners will establish appropriate professional boundaries in their on-line relationships with young people, while reflecting on their personal youth worker's digital identity and will learn how to use different digital tools. As a result of these skills and knowledge gain they will feel more confident and 'up to speed' in the context of digital youth work.They will find easier to connect with young people as a result of better understand young peoples on-line relationships and on-line realities. \r\n\r\nThrough their learning experiences participants will be able to articulate personal position in terms of digitisation, and become actively involved in the process that is shaping our societies.Young People will be safer on-line, as they will know how to address the issues of cyber bullying and hate speech, how to protect their digital identity, and how to assess risks on-line. They will make an informed choices about the life they want to live on social media and the self-image they create on-line.

Successful communicative exchanges will create positive experience which can be transferred from one language to another if similarly familiar and authentic situations are to be handled through strategies of intercomprehension. The authentic texts and the strategic approach to language learning will encourage the development of metacognitive strategies that can be employed in other new languages to be learnt making use of translanguaging skills and mediation. Through making use of texts created in plurilingual settings, researchers, teachers and trainees will gain insight into the processes of language acquisition and develop a repertoire of methods they found successful to make use of in multilingual classrooms. Their insights and the methodological procedures they will develop in so doing will be published in a handbook for teachers in addition to the texts and materials on the project platform. This will encourage teachers and learners to make use of PALM.edu for language learning in plurilingual settings which will provide the first resource that allows a strategic approach based on materials produced by young and teenage learners for learners of the same age group in authentic situations. \r\nThe long term benefits for all participants, i.e. pupils, teachers, teacher trainees and trainers are seen in their learning and in the lifelong learning opportunities for many others brought about by the use of the plurilingual project outcomes.", "http://www.nile-elt.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA201-005060_3"], [2014, "Partnership per un Apprendimento eccellente nelle Lingue Straniere", "DELTA Language Training & Consultancy Ltd", 177612.0, 3, 4, "Multilingualism represents an overarching question of great importance, embracing as it does all areas of an individual\u2019s social, cultural and professional life. The literature reveals very close ties between multilingual literacy and socio-economic conditions:  the possession of adequate language competence is a prerequisite to guaranteeing employability, to enable the exercise of active citizenship in the context of economic and cultural internationalisation and to contribute to personal development and collective prosperity (ref. \u201cLanguage Competences for Employability and Growth\u201d, the European Commission).\r\n\r\nWithin the current \u2018Learning Society\u2019, mobility and the enhancement of linguistic diversity are central to the politics of education and training amongst the European member-states and the surrounding regions.\r\n\r\nBringing together organisations from different institutional backgrounds (IPRASE, NILE/DELTA Language Training & Consultancy Ltd, the Goethe Institute and Bell Educational Services Ltd) that are involved in the promotion of foreign language teaching and learning processes, this project proposal of \u2018Strategic Partnership\u2019 aims to promote innovation in the didactic planning of English and German as foreign languages with reference to the real needs expressed by specific learner targets. \r\n\r\nWith the above in mind, and with distinct differentiation with respect to the diverse scholastic pathways mentioned above, the Partnership aims to develop:\r\n\r\n\uf076 A complete didactic model, separated into innovative practices and approaches based on multimedia tools, to both favour English and German language learning and also to develop a greater understanding of the cultural, social and value dimensions of their respective linguistic contexts, the whole being differentiated according to the distinct secondary-school instructional pathways within the high school, technical school and professional school environments.\r\n\r\n- Approaches, methodologies and innovative didactic tools for the definition of \u2018best practice\u2019 models for the teaching and learning of the English and German languages, with a view to the continuous professional development of the teaching involved.\r\n\r\n- Efficacious responses to the needs of the young generation for the acquisition not only of the communicative competences necessary for \u201ceveryday social contexts\u201d (Basic interpersonal communication skills \u2013 BICS), but also for the more targeted competences in the field of \u201cacademic or school language: abstract and decontextualized\u201d (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency - CALP);\r\n\r\n- The extension of the learning environment within and beyond the classroom and of the modality and the content of learning through TIC (Information and Communication Technology).\r\n\r\nThe project will be developed over thirty-six months, a period that will see the Partners involved in various cooperative activities aimed towards three principal outputs and two multiplier events.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop the above-mentioned objectives, the following activities will be initiated:\r\n\r\n- An action-research activity to identify a compendium of the English and German language methodological-didactic practices within the Italian context referred to in the project, and the best quality teacher-training practices implemented by the overseas Partners. (O1/A1).\r\n\r\n- A planning activity involving the Partners leading towards the definition of guiding methodology frameworks for innovative didactic practices in the development of excellence in English and German language learning (O1/A1).\r\n\r\n- A formulation, projection and implementation activity leading to the creation of a complete instructional model for the teaching of English and German L2, consisting of a collection of modules and teaching tools aimed at the different instructional needs found in high-schools, technical schools and professional schools, with particular attention being paid to TIC (O3/A1).  This resulting didactic model will be carefully trialled in the four state-schools participating in the project under the supervision of IPRASE. \r\n\r\nTwo open events will be programmed in Italy respectively to launch the development process and to present the results obtained from the project (Project Outputs), both of which may in turn be presented in the organisational and regional contexts of the Participating Partners, leading to the possibility of the continuation and further development of the project\u2019s outputs.

Giving these students this extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in English language and culture in this way means that they will improve their language skills and gather experience in a member country of the European Union which enables them to gain knowledge and also share it using a common language. Furthermore the students not only learn more about the way of life in a foreign country but also more about the different conditions and processes at workplaces. The students learn how to cope with standard situation in daily life by communicating in a foreign language.

By showing slideshows, film clips and telling the pupils all kind of stories of  England and its people, the students might be  motivated to visit England. At this moment my pupils are already showing great interest in my  teaching experiences during the year in London. Especially the daily routines of pupils at their age seems to be very important for them. Background stories about a typical English schoolboy or schoolgirl are very appealing to them. Also the multi- cultural aspects in participating  in a course in England with course members from all over Europe are of additional  value  and reflect the idea of the European Union. The fact that pupils from many nations are taught together in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere is an important aspect of the European idea. For example, last year after the course visit , my students played baseball ( which is rather uncommon in Austria) while using English to communicate. A visit in England gives impulses to develop such new teaching methods which I can embed in my further teaching for many years. Another reason for visiting the course in Norwich is to get information about school exchange programmes and to get in contact with local people to organise such events for pupils of our school. During my teaching year in London as German and  French teacher a colleague organised a skiing holiday in St. Johann for 2 weeks. The contact to those English teachers still exists and offers plenty of possibilities to exchange experience, concerning pupils` exchange programmes; travelling; e-mail contacts and chatting platforms for young learners).On basis of individual contacts it is possible to create a common European cooperation. Follow-up activities at our school lead to a high transparency and offer these new methods, which are tested and rated by colleagues and the head teacher. In \"interscholastic\" dialogues the approached objectives are challenged and the appropriate methods are being adapted.", "http://www.nile-elt.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA101-000630_1"], [2014, "Promoting and Supporting CLIL teaching in Agios Antonios Primary School", "DELTA Language Training & Consultancy Ltd", 3084.0, 2, 2, "Our School is working towards modernisation.

Background and justification of the project:The area of activity of CEPA Buitrago del Lozoya corresponds to the North Mountain range in the Autonomous Region of Madrid. In general terms, we consider that our students show three main educational needs:- Development of digital competences -Acquisition of linguistic competences (English, to be more precise)- Improvement of their employability. Tools for an active search of employment.Regarding our needs in teaching, we think it would be necessary to improve our teachers\u2019 competences in new technologies so that these can be integrated in their teaching practice. The area of activity of our school is a rural one, so that there are difficulties in communication between the different towns. That\u2019s why, within the European Development Plan, we aim at developing a Moodle platform which will enable to us meet the needs of those students who find it difficult to come to school and also, those from the city areas who haven\u2019t had a vacancy in their schools nearby due to the excessive demand there. 2. Profile and number of participants:Only one teacher from our school will attend the course, and that must be an English teacher. Besides, the teacher must meet the greater number of requirements:  - be a estate teacher, preferably a steady one in our school. - be a Head of Department (to facilitate the coordination with other English teachers and the School management team.) - experience in teaching3. Description of the course:-Applications software for language teachers-The creation and use of multimedia materials using commercial software and freeware-Digital content for reference, language practice and as a source of authentic material-The use of concordances and text analysis software for both language analysis and classroom use-Core skills for the internet including creating, and evaluating web content; networking and communication using web 2.0 tools and integrating these into the classroom-Setting up and managing a CALL or e-learning facility-The impact of the technology on methodology and the long-term and short-term implications for teachers and learners-In the second week, participants will begin work on an agreed project, including, but not limited to, the preparation of one or more lesson plans; a set of electronic learning materials; and a small website4.

This project aims at facilitating youth employment by giving young people training and educational opportunities in order for them to improve professional and digital skills and learning about new production processes, managerial working processes, administration, commercial and marketing processes, district management ; the project aims at helping the young increase their communicative skills in European foreign languages focusing on the use of professional languages;  it also aims at increasing the essential relationship skills in different cultural and multiethnic environments, at improving self-learning self-evaluation, self-determination skills and all those soft skills that are universally recognized and needed. The mobility for the learners will last 5 weeks, during the first week the learners will go to a language course and during the remaining four weeks they will work as trainees in companies. The training period is organized according to procedures that will allow the recognition of the LO. The Certificate of competencies and the Europass Mobility Document will be awarded to the learners. When the learners leave most of them are not of age, so in order to guarantee their personal security and psychological  well-being and in order to facilitate the cultural impact, we provide for a tutor to go and stay with the learners for the first week abroad.

The four people of the staff have been teaching CLIL in technical, vocational subjects (electronics, maths and physics, law and ICT). They will spend two weeks in the UK, in the first week they will go to a language course, and the following week they will do shadowing activities either in schools or in companies whose work is pertinent to the staff. In so doing the staff will better understand how  the companies work, and at the same time they will improve their knowledge of the professional language. Each school will manage a greater number of mobility scholarships  than in the past. The beginning of VET  staff mobility for CLIL teachers, represents a real step forward towards the internationalization of the school, and a chance to compare its teaching and learning strategies with international training organizations.

In this framework, the QUALITY-W 2014 project, in which \u2018W\u2019 stands for \u2018Welcoming\u2019, takes into account the quality of welcoming guests as an issue to be investigated, in which to insert the learning programme that will be developed during the work experience.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018quality of welcoming\u2019 concerns the way one deals with guests and involves the ability to meet their requirements and understand their problems and cultural background. Moreover, it also concerns the guests\u2019 feelings towards the management of the environment as a system, and therefore towards the appearance of the territory and the impact that structures and economic activities have on it. \r\n\r\nMany skills involved in this field are based on personal gifts that the school, despite its educational efforts, cannot always develop and evaluate properly. Both the knowledge and the technical-operative skills need, through their application to the business reality, to be transformed into competences and to be constantly updated.\r\n\r\nThe school has been sensible to this formative issue for some time and has activated a path that, through the use of schemes such as school-work dual systems, tends to fill in these gaps.

The sporadic violent confrontation in Ukraine beats everyone imaginations of how civil protest can degenerate to a civil war with thousands already dead and counting. This and many more is why international Youth Training on Conflict Transformation and Negotiations through Turbulence is very crucial at this material time. Today\u2018s world is challenging for young people: the different and changing economic climate, skyrocketing youth unemployment, constant violent flash points across Europe with no clear end in sight. When there is despair, there is a natural attraction to use violence either to make a point or  to assert oneself. During this dire situations and circumstances, youth workers play an important role in supporting young people in coping with personal, economic,social and intercultural conflicts. They can facilitate constructive learning outcomes and stimulate reflective perspectives, supporting young people in recognizing conflicts as part of an important learning process. The project  seeks to train youth workers,youth leaders, and  managers of youth projects in a standardized conflict transformation and negotiation skills. This training is a departure from the usual conflict trainings rather it will use the John Paul Lederach model pioneered in 1980's which saw conflict as something that must not necessarily be resolved or managed but TRANSFORMED because conflict is natural and neutral. The project will redirect youth energy from reacting to  conflict but responding and engaging with conflict and give them skills to analyze the WHY of conflict and be able to follow the  right approaches to conflicts transformation but because you can not  transform any form of conflict without adequate knowledge of negotiation skills. The training will fuse these two important concepts and tools together. One of the aims of this training is to empower and equip young leaders and youth workers with negotiation skills. Everyone negotiates something every day. You negotiate with your family about where to spend the weekend. We have negotiated all these activities without having the skills or being conscious we were negotiating. But how does one become an effective negotiator? The project will seek to  make young people change agents and unarmed army of youth skilled in Conflict Transformation and Negotiation skills. Non-formal Experiential learning methods . Young people will be supported to be masters of their own learning. This approach will be combined with participatory methods which will allow role plays, story telling and new creative methods at responding to pressures and frustrations which will include Conflict Analyses.

Despite the removal of physical boundaries, nations have not fully succeeded in overcoming invincible barriers which are much stronger than difficult to cross than physical borders. There was an assumption that once borders are lifted, intercultural integration will happen on its own and peradventure people will see themselves as fellow Europeans rather nationals of European countries. These normative assumption of equal opportunities  has not panned out like that. The new wave of extreme nationalism and xenophobic attacks in European capitals are major cause for concerns.

This was achieved by the slimmest of margins splitting the country into two.

The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people working in the field of youth. Over the years, there has been a lot of assumptions made about youth workers and youth leaders which are not through in practical sense based on the research and the feedback got by African Centre for Development and Research from January 2014 till August 2014. There was the assumption youth workers and youth leaders who were able to write project proposals will automatically know how to manage human and financial resources in their projects and experience has proved otherwise. Also there was the assumption that youth workers and youth leaders will be good project managers. But we have discovered from our research and interview of youth workers that a lot is expected of them without adequate and professional trainings that could help them in the areas of resource governance and project management. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal can not replace competence.

In its various forms it relays information to the public, and helps communities keep up-to-date with current events from around the world. Additionally, the media serves as a link between the world's governments and its citizens, by informing the latter of the policies and practices of the former. This information helps the public participate in civil society and in the political process. Consequently the media not only has enormous potential to influence perceptions and to sway opinions, but arguably also to shape events. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the freedom to hold opinions, and the right to express them. Although mainstream media outlets may each have their own rules and ethical standards, it is possible today for almost anyone to become a media producer using the internet. Meanwhile, as technological advances progressively facilitate the transmission of ever greater amounts of information, and to increasingly larger numbers of people, the flow, nature or quality of information cannot be controlled. Consequently it becomes every citizen's responsibility to analyse whatever information that she or he receives before acting upon it.

The project encourages all participants to exercise some caution towards the information they receive, while at the same time providing them with the tools necessary to assess it impartially, thoroughly, and above all rationally.\r\nAim- The training course aims to support civil society in participants\u2019 countries by developing the competences of youth leaders from civil society organisations active in the field of non-formal learning. \r\nObjectives:\r\n-To train 28 youth leaders, from partners' country, in media literacy skills.\r\n-To provide tools for participants to recognise and quantify biases that appear in the media or in political discourse\r\n-To establish a platform for the exchange of ideas, opinions and experiences\r\n-To support participants\u2019 competences in democratic leadership and active citizenship, and intercultural communication\r\nExpected results:\r\n-Measurable increase in participants\u2019 critical thinking skills \r\n-Capacity building of participants\u2019 organisations \r\n\r\nMethodological approach provides the tools for participants to make their own analyses, and to reach their own conclusions. The project strives to present diverse (and often opposing) viewpoints on specific issues taken from the international media; participants are asked to assess each in turn, and then to contrast their conclusions with the others'. All analyses are supported by arguments and evidence.\r\n\r\nThe project's training courses are led by small teams of facilitators whose only role is to moderate discussions. The analyses themselves are always done by participants themselves, working individually or in small groups. The emphasis is on peer education, and on interaction between and among all participants. \r\nThe project is neither for nor against any media or journalist. The methodology merely analyses the information as it appears to the public and identifies whatever biases it may contain.\r\nThe project addresses one of the fundamental challenges of modern society: protecting the freedom of expression and promoting the free flow of information on the one hand, while at the same time trying to limit the dissemination of misconceptions, biases and prejudices on the other. The most effective way to deal with the possibility of prejudices appearing in the mass media is not through governmental regulations, but for (enough of) the public to have the capacity to detect these prejudices or biases when they appear\r\n\r\nThe countries involved are U.K, Spain, Poland, Bulgaria, Italy and Norway will converge in Brighton for seven days between 11th to 17th of May 2015.", "http://www.acdr.org.uk", "AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH LTD", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001587_coordinator"], [2015, "Advocacy and Facilitation Skills for in youth Work; Lead the Change", "AFRICAN CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH LTD", 15196.0, 7, 7, "According to the report of Council of Europe on 15th of December 1999, it was reiterated by the assembly that formal education alone cannot respond to the challenges of modern society and therefore welcomes its reinforcement by non formal educational practices and it was recommended that member states recognise non-formal education as a de facto partner in the lifelong process and make it accessible to all. The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people to work in the field of youth. Impactful youth work and sustainable youth organizations needs two key skills domiciled within the organization which are Advocacy and facilitation skills because youth activities revolves alot around training and advocacy of change for or against status-co or policies. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal can not replace competence. Youth organizations has conceptualized projects, but only to rely on only external professional trainers to carry out the training and facilitations. This process denies them the opportunity to develop their own skills and the motivation to effectively lead and advocate change. After a recent training project on overcoming barriers organized by African centre for Development and Research and seen that facilitations were carried out by officers of the organization. There has been overwhelming request from organizations and youth workers to African Centre for Development and research to put this project together with a view to helping organizations to develop crucial skills of facilitation and advocacy. These skills are so fundamental that not only does it help youth workers , young people and youth leaders in their works at developing internal pool of facilitators and advocates but it is also the foundational skills for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ability to effectively explain your ideas to others for comprehension which you get in facilitation and ability to knock on doors of barriers persistently without fear of rejection with passion which is a bedrock skill of advocacy. The project will give youth workers and leaders multifunctional  skills base to help young people to lead a better life in other spheres of life themselves. We believe there is no better time to address these skills problem than now when the new Erasmus+ project has been launched and taking root. Several youth workers has been brooding in the dark without these skills . If youth workers have achieved  any form of success in their projects without this fundamental skills it will not be sustainable but with this project, youth workers will achieve more and grant funding will do the needed good it was set out to achieve in the life of young people and such projects will be sustainable on the long run and the multiplied effects will speak volume\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders  in facilitation skills.  \r\n-Train  30 youth workers, youth leaders and young people in effective leadership.\r\n-To train 30 youth workers, youth leaders and young volunteers in advocacy skills\r\n-To train 30 youth workers and youth leaders the fundamental principles of running a sustainable project\r\n- To train  youth workers and youth leaders in team building and team leading skills which will enable them to manage diversities in the team to the benefit of the project and advancement of their works in community through advocacy.\r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders public speaking skills\r\n-To train youth workers and leaders in core leadership principles and task delegation using MBI principles\r\n-To train youth workers how to avoid common pitfalls in advocacy\r\n-To train youth workers and youth leaders foundational entrepreneurship principles of perseverance\r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Brighton in U.K for a Period of 8 days with partner countries which includes Poland, Norway,Italy ,Romania, Hungary,Ukraine, Portugal ,Spain , Azerbaijan and U.K. These are countries covered by the research survey of competencies of youth workers and youth leaders in Advocacy and facilitation and were preferentially selected for partnership because of their motivation.

Initiated by the department for education of the Berlin senate,we have lately been in contact with a group of teachers from colleges of social education in Turkey. These teachers were on an educational visit to Berlin, organized by the Turkish Ministry for Education. We had a presentation about our system of early childhood education at the college and organized visits to educational institutions of the PFH. Meanwhile, we have another request for a similar event. We aim at intensifying our existing contacts with Turkish institutions of professional qualification within the present application period. As we are regularly conducting seminars in preparation of study tours to Turkey for our students, we are well prepared for these activities and have qualified members of staff.Concerning the organizational development, we are at present involving our advisory office for students conducting practical terms.

In addition to a good educational background and language education, personality development and the promotion of social skills of our students are central. Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 32 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 and 9 weeks. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project.

In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily.

They will typically be learners working towards vocational qualifications in the field of community development and training and education. We anticipate they will be between the ages of 18 and 25 and come from various backgrounds, often with limited opportunities to gain relevant work experience in their chosen field.  The three month mobility will be formally recognised through Europass mobility documents and certificates from upon successful completion of their vocational course.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nOur main aim is to provide VET learners with relevant work experience in community engagement and education to enhance and develop their careers.

This will be complemented by linguistic support from qualified tutors and a programme of cultural and social activities, including organised language exchanges. The participants will be supported throughout the lifetime of the project with clearly defined stages, from mobility preparation to evaluation. Our mentoring and monitoring processes will aim to address the development and well-being of participants during their placement while informing project evaluation. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s methodology provides a framework to support VET learners in developing skills acquired in the workplace as they work alongside experienced professionals in their chosen sector. Through our experience with past European mobility projects and our employer partnerships, we have developed and applied appropriate processes and instruments to ensure the project can be effectively managed and evaluated while providing support to participants for their personal and professional progression. \r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that the project will make a positive impact on all its 72 participants by giving them the opportunity to develop professional and personal skills at a relevant work placement. Based on past projects, the experience will increase the participant's\u2019 employment prospects while also giving them confidence to apply for work across Europe. It is expected that at least two thirds of participants will move into suitable employment upon completion of the placement, with a further one fifth progressing into continued related training. \r\n\r\nThe three month placement in Seville and Faro, together with linguistic support, should increase the participants\u2019 language proficiency by one CEFR level. The project will also impact on our partners by building their capacity to participate in further Erasmus+ programmes and European projects. The focus on sustainable communities should encourage participants and partners to consider and continue building a sustainable future for European society, reflecting Europe 2020 objectives. \r\n\r\nSUSTAINABILITY\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will feed back into our own work as a training provider, our established partner relationships and employer networks, such as the Brighton Sustainable Business Network.

Our mentoring and monitoring processes will aim to address the development and well-being of participants during their placement while informing project evaluation. \r\n\r\nWhat is your project methodology?\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s methodology provides a framework to support VET learners in developing skills acquired in the workplace as they work alongside experienced professionals in their chosen sector. Through our experience with past European mobility projects and our employer partnerships, we have developed and applied appropriate processes and instruments to ensure the project can be effectively managed and evaluated while providing support to participants for their personal and professional progression. \r\n\r\nWhat are the anticipated impacts of the project?\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that the project will make a positive impact on all its 72 participants by giving them the opportunity to develop professional and personal skills at a relevant work placement. Based on past projects, the experience should increase the participants\u2019 employment prospects while also giving them confidence to apply for work across Europe. It is expected that at least two thirds of participants will move into suitable employment upon completion of the placement, with a further one fifth progressing into continued related training. \r\n\r\nThe three month placement in Seville, together with linguistic support, should increase the participants\u2019 Spanish language proficiency by one CEFR level. The project will also impact on our partners by building their capacity to participate in further Erasmus+ programmes and European projects. The focus on sustainable communities should encourage participants and partners to consider and continue building a sustainable future for European society, reflecting Europe 2020 objectives. \r\n\r\nHow do you expect project partners will benefit in the long term?\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will feed back into our own work as a VET college, our established partner relationships and employer networks, such as the Brighton Sustainable Business Network. It will benefit our development of European-centred vocational training and planned KA1 and KA2 projects in the field.

After the development of a first project in Dublin of 31 mobilities, a second one with more destinations, sending institutions and mobilities and a third one that strengthens all the lessons learnt in the previous one, the new project consolidates the work done and the cooperation with the General Directorate of Vocational Training in the region of Madrid (DG FP). \r\nThe new figure ErasmusPRO has been added and the number of destinations has grown on to recently-acceded to the EU countries as Slovenia, which also allows the increase of the number of ordinary mobilities (84, including 4 of long-term mode) and of special needs (8), as well as the educational centers/sending institutions members of the consortium (18) which find it difficult managing mobilities on their own.\r\nThe project\u2019s objectives for the students are, therefore: improve their employability with the acquirement of new technical skills, improvement of social and language skills and self-confidence and matureness gaining because of the unique experience that staying abroad means. And for the sending institutions: facilitate their participation in European mobility projects with the corresponding internationalization of their work, as well as amplify and diversify their educational offer. \r\nThe new project keeps growing in terms of number of mobilities and destination countries. It consists of 90 mobilities for students to make an internship period in companies based in United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy,  Slovenia, Czech Republic and Portugal (without a training period): 50 of Intermediate Vocational Training students to make their module of Training in Working Centers, 30 more and shorter for students of Intermediate Vocational Training on their 1st or 2nd year of study, 4 for long-term mobilities of the type of ErasmusPRO and 8 more for students of Intermediate Vocational Training and Professional Programs with special needs. Students will be given preference but recent graduates will be allowed to take part in the project as well. It consists as well in 14 vacancies for accompanying people for each travel flow during the first days of stay, and, of course, for the 8 students with special needs, considering the previously acquired experience and the fact that most of the students have never been abroad and/or come from deprived areas. \r\nActivities. The project has a clear intention of continuity and consolidation of the three previous ones. The DG FP and Foundation have agreed to maintain 15 of the sending institutions of the current project and to add 4 more in order to cover the placements offer. The Mobility Comitee will periodically meet and Foundation will draw up a record of the agreements reached. Informational and of the project\u2019s dissemination talks are foreseen (with previous participants) in each sending institution. The participation in the selection process will be open to all students that meet the criteria stablished in the Call Bases that will be agreed, approved, and published by the Comitee. At least 86 participants will receive language training from the OLS and pedagogical and cultural talks are also foreseen. The educational plan will be agreed between the sending and hosting mentors and stablished in the Learning Agreement document. The internship monitoring will be made in a direct and periodic way by the two mentors, the partner institutions, and the Foundation itself. Project management in each stage will be conducted by Foundation. At the end of the internship periods a final evaluation of each student will be made and supporting documents will be issued (Europass Mobility Document and Certificate of Attendance).\r\nMethology.

The training project \"Leveraging sport to tackle gender inequalities\" aims to train and sensitize youth and sport instructors and futures youth and sport instructors to gender equality by professionalising them to how deliver a non stereotyped sport activity. To support and make youth and sport organisations aware, especially directors and directors of pedagogy, of the significance to include a gender equality approach in their intern policies. To educate and make young people aware of the gender diversity in sports practices. The project contributes to reduce inequalities between men and women, boys and girls and to give both the same chances in working life by tackling gender stereotypes with unique European training tools.Understanding the problem at European level can enrich each national context by the experiences and good practices from all partner countries. Indeed gender equality maturities are different by countries. As family, labour, women's employment policies and cultural representations are different.Target groups:- Youth and sport instructors- Training organisations for youth and sport instructors (initial and continuing education)- Youth and sport organisations (sport clubs, out-of-school clubs, day camps, schools,...)- Young people (7 to 12 years)Structure of the project:- Designing of an E-learning Training on gender equality in sports activities for youth and sport instructors.

After the development of a first project in Dublin of 31 mobilities, a second one with more destinations, sending institutions and mobilities and a third one that strengthens all the lessons learnt in the previous one, the new project consolidates the work done and the cooperation with the General Directorate of Vocational Training in the region of Madrid (DG FP). \r\nThe new figure ErasmusPRO has been added and the number of destinations has grown on to recently-acceded to the EU countries as Slovenia, which also allows the increase of the number of ordinary mobilities (84, including 4 of long-term mode) and of special needs (8), as well as the educational centers/sending institutions members of the consortium (18) which find it difficult managing mobilities on their own.\r\nThe project\u2019s objectives for the students are, therefore: improve their employability with the acquirement of new technical skills, improvement of social and language skills and self-confidence and matureness gaining because of the unique experience that staying abroad means. And for the sending institutions: facilitate their participation in European mobility projects with the corresponding internationalization of their work, as well as amplify and diversify their educational offer. \r\nThe new project keeps growing in terms of number of mobilities and destination countries. It consists of 90 mobilities for students to make an internship period in companies based in United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy,  Slovenia, Czech Republic and Portugal (without a training period): 50 of Intermediate Vocational Training students to make their module of Training in Working Centers, 30 more and shorter for students of Intermediate Vocational Training on their 1st or 2nd year of study, 4 for long-term mobilities of the type of ErasmusPRO and 8 more for students of Intermediate Vocational Training and Professional Programs with special needs. Students will be given preference but recent graduates will be allowed to take part in the project as well. It consists as well in 14 vacancies for accompanying people for each travel flow during the first days of stay, and, of course, for the 8 students with special needs, considering the previously acquired experience and the fact that most of the students have never been abroad and/or come from deprived areas. \r\nActivities. The project has a clear intention of continuity and consolidation of the three previous ones. The DG FP and Foundation have agreed to maintain 15 of the sending institutions of the current project and to add 4 more in order to cover the placements offer. The Mobility Comitee will periodically meet and Foundation will draw up a record of the agreements reached. Informational and of the project\u2019s dissemination talks are foreseen (with previous participants) in each sending institution. The participation in the selection process will be open to all students that meet the criteria stablished in the Call Bases that will be agreed, approved, and published by the Comitee. At least 86 participants will receive language training from the OLS and pedagogical and cultural talks are also foreseen. The educational plan will be agreed between the sending and hosting mentors and stablished in the Learning Agreement document. The internship monitoring will be made in a direct and periodic way by the two mentors, the partner institutions, and the Foundation itself. Project management in each stage will be conducted by Foundation. At the end of the internship periods a final evaluation of each student will be made and supporting documents will be issued (Europass Mobility Document and Certificate of Attendance).\r\nMethology.

This project aims to enhance our knowledge in the field by contributing to the emerging topic of microeconomics of conflict notably by generating new data in India, a country regularly hit by outbreaks of low or moderate communal violence.

Ultimately, we suggest that SSBs might also be an etiological factor in normal human ageing.

Errors in this process may arise from spontaneous mistakes in normal cellular metabolism, or from exposure to external agents, such as chemical mutagens and radiation. To protect themselves from the consequences of DNA damage, cells have evolved a vast array of pathways DNA repair mechanisms, each optimised for the resolution of a particular problem. One method of DNA repair, called homologous recombination (HR), involves using intact undamaged DNA sequences as a template to repair the damaged copy. HR is used extensively in meiotic cells to repair DNA breaks that are purposely created by the cell. In this context, HR is not just a repair mechanism, but also a method to drive interaction and genetic exchange between maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes, creating haploid genomes which are chimeras of the parental genetic information. Thus, the study of DNA repair and recombination informs our understanding of mechanisms that maintain genome stability, but which also generate genetic diversity, topics that are as critical to the survival of an individual cell as they are for the evolution and survival of an entire ecosystem. In recent decades a great deal has been learned of the genetic and biochemical control of the DNA repair and recombination mechanism.

This is because, until recently, it has not been possible to investigate the genomic basis of evolution in most systems, limiting our understanding of the factors that facilitate or inhibit convergence and adaptation. To fully understand convergent evolution we need to query the genomic response to selection and determine genotype-phenotype links in systems where convergent adaptation is well established. The Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is a system that offers the opportunity to test the roles of multiple factors in convergent evolution: this species includes multiple natural and experimentally established populations that have repeatedly evolved similar phenotypes under similar predation environments. I propose to fully characterize the genomic-basis of repeated adaptive evolution in guppies. Aim 1 will identify regions that repeatedly show signatures of selection, and will contrast the nature of selection in natural and experimental populations that differ in age and levels of founding genetic diversity. Aim 2 will identify genomic regions associated with phenotypes that are known to play a significant role in local adaptation in the guppy using quantitative genetics approaches. I will then directly test the effects of candidate genes using novel functional genomic approaches, as detailed in Aim 3. Overall, this project will test whether repeated selection led to convergence at the genomic level, determine the genetic basis of convergent adaptations, and ultimately understand how convergent evolution has occurred in an important wild system.", 1297512.0, 1297512.0, 1, 1, "GUPPYCon", null, "http://www.sussex.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212095_999852721"], [1427846400000, 1585612800000, "Sensory Experiences for Interactive Technologies", "The University of Sussex", "The senses we call upon to interact with technology are still very limited relying mostly on visual and auditory senses.

The EU has long had decarbonisation ambitions, but there remains considerable uncertainty as to precisely how these ambitions will be achieved, or what the impacts of such achievement will be on the EU economy and society more generally. INNOPATHS will resolve this uncertainty to the extent possible, will characterise and provide a quantification of the uncertainty which remains, and will describe in great detail a number of possible low-carbon pathways for the EU, together with the economic, social and environmental impacts to which they are likely to lead. These pathways will be co-designed with the aid of 23 stakeholders from different sectors who have already provided letters of support to INNOPATHS. INNOPATHS will suggest through this analysis how the benefits of these pathways, such as new industries, jobs and competitiveness, may be maximized, and how any negative impacts, such as those on low-income households, or on carbon-intensive sectors, may be mitigated. INNOPATHS will communicate its insights through the normal scientific channels, and make substantial contributions to the scientific literature, but will go well beyond this in terms of interactions with stakeholders, building on the co-design processes in the project to reach out to stakeholder networks of businesses, NGOs, local and national policy makers. INNOPATHS will create four innovative online tools to explain its pathways, technological transitions and policies, to different constituencies.

Rational strategies for design and development of novel, evidence based therapies for alcohol addiction are still missing. Within this project, we will utilize a translational approach based on clinical studies and animal experiments to fill this gap. We will provide a novel discovery strategy based on systems biology concepts that uses mathematical and network theoretical models to identify brain sites and functional networks that can be targeted specifically by therapeutic interventions. To build predictive models of the \u2018relapse-prone\u2019 state of brain networks we will use magnetic resonance imaging and neurochemical data from patients and laboratory animals. The mathematical models will be rigorously tested through experimental procedures aimed to guide network dynamics towards increased resilience. We expect to identify hubs that promote \u2018relapse-proneness\u2019 and to predict how aberrant network states could be normalized. Proof of concept experiments in animal will need to demonstrate this possibility by showing directed remodeling of functional brain networks by targeted interventions prescribed by the theoretical framework. Thus, our translational goal will be achieved by a theoretical and experimental framework for making predictions based on fMRI and mathematical modeling, which is verified in animals, and which can be transferred to humans. To achieve this goal we have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium (eight European countries) of world-class expertise in all complementary skills required for the project.

Traditional molecular and cellular biology, combined with genetics and biochemistry, have led to an understanding of the architecture of the DDR in a variety of model organisms and in human cells.  These studies have employed populations of cells/molecules and their results are of necessity an average of the response. High sensitivity imaging technologies make it feasible to study events in single cells and to do experiments with small numbers of molecules in vitro. These can now be applied to the DDR. Project Objectives: To provide an interdisciplinary training in single cell and single molecule studies to graduate students in Physics, Chemistry, LS, Maths and Computer sciences. The focus of the research will be the study of the DDR and genome stability. The main technologies to be developed concern high resolution molecular imaging methodologies. Specific aims: To train eight early stage researchers to doctoral level to utilize an interdisciplinary approach to address specific scientific questions and to communicate between disciplines.  Study Design: We will achieve our objective by building a network comprising four \u201clocal\u201d groups, each a collaboration between an imaging specialist and a cell biologist / molecular geneticists engaged in research on genome stability. The collaborating scientists will serve as co-advisors and will develop a personalised interdisciplinary research training programme for each recruit.
