In today\u2019s society people and especially young people have to learn during and for the rest of their life in all areas of life meaning both personally and professionally. Very often people who do or did not well in school (the formal education system) feel they cannot learn or don\u2019t have the learning skills they need to learn what they would like or need to. They don\u2019t know what their talents and passions are, what their life mission is, what learning goals they want to set for themselves let alone how to achieve those goals. They let the failing in the formal system limit their passion for learning and their ability to move through the failing. This shows how strong the impact of 'failing to make the mark' is on people. It pushes people back in their comfort zone and  tells them to stay there because learning is not for them. Because of this coping mechanism towards failing, society misses out on a lot of learning potential and talents. More and more research shows that people who are able to see failing and making mistakes as part of a learning and moving forward are more successful in learning and in life in general. One of the conclusions of the previous strategic partnership on 'Failing forward' was that if people have so called 'fail-resilience', meaning the ability to deal with failing in a constructive way without denying it hurts or being pushed back in their safe comfort zone, they tend to go more for what they really want out of life and for developing their talents instead of playing small and staying comfortable.  During the trainings we observed how big the impact of 'permission to fail' and knowing that you are surrounded by a community of people who are failing forward is especially on young people. This strenghtens us, the partners in this partnership, in the conviction that there is a need  for tools and workshops that support the development of  'fail-resilience' for young people. Building resilience is like going to the gym, the more you train the muscle the stronger it gets.  This means that if the supporters of learning we plan to work with start early young people will grow up developing this skill and get stronger at it as they move through life. This will contribute to the climate of life long learning and to using all the potential we have in society.  During this 18 month long project on 'fail forward and building fail resilience''  we want to train educators (youth workers, trainers, coaches ect) in how to support the learners they work with in developing their 'fail resilience'. An essential part of 'fail resilience' is being part of a community of practice where you can admit that failing is not fun and hurts and get support from peers who are also  out there taking risks and playing big. So next to developing tools and workshops on 'fail resilience and how to train it' we also want to invest in further developing the 'fail forward movement' as a community of practice and support.  The objectives of this partnership are:- develop tools and workshops for educators working with young people on 'fail resilience and how to train it' that can be used both in the international trainings and in the local context of the 4 partner organisations - develop and implement an international learning activity to develop tools and workshops to train 'fail-resilience'. The participants of this learning activity will be educators  willing to develop tools and workshops, test them during the training and further implement them in the local context they work in to build the capacity of both the partner organisations and the fail forward movement.- further develop and facilitate the 'fail forward'-movement as a community of 'fail forward' practice and support for everyone who wants to train their 'fail-resilience'- build the capacity of the partner organisations by 1) translating the concept of 'fail-resilience' (one of the outcomes of previous partnership) in concrete tools and workshops that are usable in different learning contexts locally and European and 2)developing and facilitating the 'fail forward' movement as a community of practice and support that can grow and continue to exist beyond this partnership- share the outcomes and (intellectual) output (02) of this partnership with both the wider community of educators the partner organisations have direct access to and the general public and society by 1) offering the tools and workshops to all educators we work with in our local and international context and 2) using the website and facebookpages of both the partners and the 'fail forward movement' to share the resources developed within the partnership with people who believe failing is part of learning and moving forward.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-3-IS02-KA205-001606_2"], [2016, "Fail Forward job shadowing", "Inspirational Network ltd", 1039.0, 2, 2, "Take Initiative vzw and The Inspirational  Network are partners in the second 'Fail Forward partnership funded by the Icelandic NA that will run from March 2016 till September 2017 (18 months).

They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 213754.0, 2604557.0, 7, 14, "SAFEDRIVE", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112212.jpg", "fp7_95937_989199987"]]}}, "7PW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "MIND - Motywacja, Indywidualizacja Nauczania, Dostosowanie.

We also mean to make our students more open to the multicultural quality of today\u2019s world.\r\n \r\nWhat is more, our mobility project is strictly related to the eTwinning project we have been involved in for several years now with our two partner schools. We believe that thanks to meeting our eTwinning partners \u201cface to face\u201d we will be able to talk about what we have already achieved, to make detailed plans for the future, see the outcomes of the project and create real, not only virtual relationship with our partners. Our eTwinning project relates to the last main goal listed above, i.e. teaching values to children and improving their behaviour, as it is based on promoting moral values such as respect, kindness, honesty, friendship and family.\r\n \r\nThe project participants are a group of eight teachers who teach different age groups and different subjects but are also representatives of the management of the school and people who provide pastoral and special needs care for the students. They do not necessarily have to know English at a proficient level. The level enabling them to communicate is sufficient. All of them are characterized by the eagerness to learn and share their knowledge with others.\r\n \r\nWe plan to organize several mobilities to our partner schools, during which we plan to: outline the mobility objectives, observe the lessons and other forms of teaching as well as  breaktime in the host schools (bearing in mind the project aims), take part in staff briefing, less formal discussions with teachers, assemblies, students\u2019 performances, see the effects of the students\u2019 work, observe the eTwinning project outcomes and finally sum up and evaluate the mobility.\r\n \r\nWe will use a number of evaluation methods to monitor the participants\u2019 progress during their mobility, such as: attendance register, two kinds of observation sheets (to be filled in by the participant and to be filled in by the project coordinator) and two kinds of questionnaires (to be done by the participant and to be done by the host school teachers).\r\n \r\nWe are absolutely sure that taking part in the Erasmus + project will be a breakthrough experience for its participants and for the entire school.

Because of it, the foregoing groups will be more open to multiculturalism and able to see the links between our country and other European countries.\r\n \r\nWe believe that our project will also have numerous long term benefits. Thanks to it, our school will acquire the openness to change and improvement, and, hopefully, we will be more likely to take part in other European projects in the future. Also, through this experience we are bound to get more job satisfaction from our work as teachers.\r\n \r\nLast but not least, the project will be the only possibility for the students from disadvantaged families (unemployment, poverty, limited access to culture) to meet children from other countries through their teachers.
