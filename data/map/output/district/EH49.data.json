Teachers who are motivated and inspired by the subject are far more likely to deliver motivated and inspiring lessons.  There will be more opportunities for pupils to use languages out of the classroom, parents have an opportunity to become involved and transition from P7 to S1 will reflect the 1 + 2 initiative.\r\n\r\nLonger Term Benefits\r\nEquipping our children with skills for learning, life and work is a key focus of our Scottish curriculum and greater knowledge of language and culture will aid this process and increase in their future opportunities.

All three participants have a keen interest in French both personally and professionally, possess a good knowledge of the French language and regularly attend French training courses. They are keen to further upskill their knowledge of the French language and the French culture.The one week French language Immersion Course run by LFEE will enable the participants to:* improve methodological expertise in the teaching of French to 426 pupils and 30 nursery children.* access new materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French at primary level.* develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France.* improve their competence, performance and confidence in French* enhance their use the Internet and other ICT resources when delivering French language lessons.The Immersion Course will also enable the three staff participants to:* support 40 members of staff to embed French within the classroom and throughout the school.* share their new expertise and thereby improve the learning and teaching of French throughout the school. * further develop a European dimension within our school and wider community.* expand and update the school's French language resources.* feedback to 10 Lead Learners within the cluster who will report back to 7 different Primary Schools and our catchment Secondary School.On return the participants will liaise with management to organise opportunities to provide staff training in French language which will then address the issue of staff language competency and confidence.  The participants will also share the innovative and current teaching ideas and resources gained from the LFEE course with teaching colleagues which will enable them to develop their skills and confidence in the teaching of French.   Through increasing and updating the participants knowledge of French vocabulary and culture, the school will be in a better position to reflect on the current cultural events that the LPS organises and so expand, improve and bring them up-to-date.  This will benefit pupils, staff, parents and the wider community by providing them with more relevant and current opportunities to learn about the European community.LPS are currently implementing a plan that will ensure full 1 + 2 integration from Nursery to P7 by 2020 and this will be better facilitated by the cascading of the newly acquired methodological expertise from the LFEE course.  This strategic plan has been shared through Network Cluster 1 +2 meetings with the other Lead Learners within the local authority who will also benefit from the participants experience.  To inform and encourage parents and carers of  the increased focus on the teaching and learning of Modern Languages, the Lead Learners are keen to develop an information leaflet that will explain the rationale and strategies the school is employing in the teaching of Modern Languages. Further the European mobility will enthuse and motivate the participants who are keen to develop regular updates on our newly-introduced school blog.

This development of language learning is in line with the European, Scottish Government and West Lothian Council initiatives and guidelines. The teacher concerned  expressed a wish to improve her confidence in the teaching and learning of French within her classroom and her school by attending various local council training sessions . This increased confidence and enthusiasm for language learning resulted in more awareness of user friendly available resources and a development of her language teaching within her classroom. She subsequently attended further immersion courses and became aware of a learning opportunity within a European context, the French immersion course provided by LFEE. The chance to become more  aware of European, French culture directly and to learn through native speakers in a real environment was considered to be a possible next step in developing a more  international outlook within the school . It would not only provide excellent opportunities to explore possible European, French contacts and  liaisons , knowledge about cultural aspects of French life but also provide resources, active learning and training opportunities for the pupils and other teaching staff within the school. The teacher in question proposes to utilise her developed competences by directly embedding her learning into the everyday approach to language learning within her classroom and by using related ICT resources in a more effective way. She will share these resources within her whole school and will make these available within the wider context of local cluster school. A development of a French language club and a possible twinning or liaison with a French school within Lyon will develop a new more cultural and global aspect to the  children's experience of  language learning.", "http://www.lowport.org.uk/", "Low Port Primary", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023383_coordinator"]]}}, "7SN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Building Capacity to deliver 1+2 Modern Languages", "Springfield Primary School", 10188.0, 1, 1, "Context/Background : \r\nTeaching of L2 (French) and L3 (Spanish) is inconsistent and requires both training and consolidation for staff within the school. The children are engaged and keen to learn languages, and the staff are willing. Our key aim for this project is to build capacity and increase confidence, ability and resources for French and Spanish within our school. \r\n\r\nVision for the Future\r\nOur vision for the future includes: all children from nursery to P7 will learn French and children in P5-P7 Spanish. This will be embedded throughout the school, before the Scottish Government 2020 deadline. Teachers will feel more confident and able to deliver engaging and stimulating lessons in L2 and L3. Clear progression will be evident in jotters and through conversations, throughout the school.\r\n\r\nObjectives : \r\nIncrease confidence, knowledge and fluency of French and Spanish. Increase knowledge and and ability to teach engaging lessons on the culture of the target countries. Improve grammar and technicalities of the language. We also aim to gain resource ideas to help engagement and enthusiasm, and increase our network of contacts for professional dialogue opportunities. We also aim to set up the foundations for projects like eTwinning which will allow our children the opportunity to engage and communicate online with peers in France and Spain.\r\n\r\nParticipant Profile :\r\nWe are a diverse group of 5 individuals with varying experience levels in French and Spanish. We do however, have one common goal; to challenge ourselves,so that we can in turn, challenge and develop a love of languages and language learning in our children. 3 of us plan to visit Spain, and 3 to France. 4 of the 5 participants are currently within second level, we believe this to be beneficial as with the target of embedding L2 and L3 in second level before 2020 this will strengthen this area. One participant is the 1+2 lead learner and as a language graduate and keen linguist her own personal development plan is to lead the embedding of both target languages through the school as a whole.\r\n\r\nPost visit activities : \r\nParticipating staff will organise team knowledge building/learning experience sessions to share their learning and support all staff in school and nursery. Staff will also organise a parental engagement session to raise awareness. This will complement the school/Local Authority strategy for 1+2 by ensuring all staff and parents are included in the new learning experiences and can continue to implement across school, nursery and at home.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact Envisaged :\r\nThe immersion experience will allow our teachers to also improve the fluency and accuracy of their target language, and experience the cultural aspects which cannot be accessed to this level in Scotland. Positive feedback from our parent body and community. \r\nAddressing future workplace challenges for our pupils. In the UK there is still a distinct lack of language skills. One of the items on our school improvement plan this year is around our skills for learning, life and work. Equipping our children with additional languages is one step forwards on this important journey. The \u201ceveryone speaks English anyway\u201d methodology is no longer enough. 75% of people worldwide do not speak English, and only 6% speak it fluently.\r\n\r\nLonger Term Benefits :\r\nWe envisage the longer term benefits as creating a multi-cultural school where languages are taught, embeded and evident throughout. Our children will benefit from clear progression in their learning. Transition from P7/S1 will be far smoother and allow children to continue to be challenged based on their ability. A culture of communication with French and Spanish schools will be evident through eTwinning, with the possibility of exchange trips to be investigated. Our staff will feel confident and engaged when teaching French and Spanish, and not see them as areas we have to squeeze in.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/wl/springfieldbonn/", "Springfield Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047212_coordinator"], [2014, "Language Training", "Springfield Primary School and Bonnytoun Nursery", 1800.0, 1, 1, "Project Objective:\r\n\r\n1 classroom teacher will receive training in the target language and teaching methodologies to support the implementation of modern European languages across the school. \r\n\r\nAfter training, teachers will implement modern language lessons under the guidance of the Senior Management Team to allow the school to deliver core curriculum content in line with the changes in the modern languages curriculum. Good practice and resources will be shared with colleagues within the school.\r\n\r\nPotential Long Term Benefits:\r\n\r\nThe project's intended impact is to allow the school to develop pupils and teachers with a wider knowledge and understanding of the target European languages. Teachers and pupils will also develop  a greater awareness of the countries cultural traditions which will form an integral part of the language lesson contexts. \r\n\r\nThe project also aims to develop links between the school and other partner abroad in order to foster greater understanding and cultural exchange, and to promote communication between them.", "http://www.springfieldprimary.co.uk", "Springfield Primary School and Bonnytoun Nursery", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002027_coordinator"]]}}}}
