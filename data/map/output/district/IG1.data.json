The aim of the project is to increase the level of youth workers' digital and professional skills, related to using on-line resources to inspire young people for active citizenship and participation in the society. Short movies have a significant place in today's youth culture, as they grab the young person\u2019s attention and are  powerful means of communicating ideas in a user-friendly and comprehensive way.

Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. \nAt Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)\nTo exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from \u20ac0.5 billion at 2015 to \u20ac25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.", 43900.0, 62715.0, 1, 1, "ALBORA", null, null, null, "h2020_214025_910325407"]]}}, "1PR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "RE: INTEGRATIVE RE: ACTION", "ACT FOR GRANTS C.I.C.", 127419.0, 3, 5, "One of the most dramatic contemporary problems of the European social model is the pressure in industrial relations, which increasingly push aside the integration of social, civic and personal needs of \u201esmall\u201c participant in the general framework of interests.

We believe it is very important to be the teacher with 21st century skills in order to teach 21st century students. Since the school has been well known for creating inclusive environment for students with special needs, we believe that the school staff needs lifelong training. By self-assessment we have identified areas where, as the school, we should achieve even greater improvements. The improvement of basic competences and skills, as well as the quality of teaching (regarding especially the basic skills of the weaker students of our school), is necessary for the successful educational process. We also think that we need to encourage higher quality and excellence in innovation and internationalization of the school in terms of education and training (particularly the use of ICT in the digital classroom, especially in the STEM field). One of our goals is certainly to improve the international dimension of education and training in our school. Therefore, we have identified areas in which the school should achieve improvement in order to achieve the target set by this project.THE SCHOOL NEEDS:  1.To ncrease the skills that would help to create an inclusive and fair surroundings 2. Promotion and development of international cooperation  3. Distance learning (E-LEARNING)It is the education of teachers that we consider extremely important and, even though our teachers have experience, we believe that it is crucial to observe the process of teaching and teachers in schools outside Croatia. Since we have been working in a very old school building, which is not architecturally appropriate for the students with special needs, the improvement of teachers' skills is crucial to build an inclusive and appropriate environment.For many years, we have been the leading elementary school in the use of videoconferencing in  classroom as learning methods. With the current results we want to upgrade our existing skills, progress and actively observe the implementation of  videoconferences organized by world-renowned experts in distance learning, going on at schools that have already been awarded for their achievements in the application of videoconferencing in the classroom.So far, most school teachers have practiced \" the enhanced e-learning\" (anywhere where the teacher has the access to at least one computer and a connection to the Internet, or at least some educational materials on the computer or other media).Therefore, we have identified the need for switching to the right side of the continuum, ie. the implementation of the hybrid classes (eg. all the text materials for chemistry are on the internet, students take part in creating online tasks, and only the experiments  take place in the school laboratory) and online ( theclasses that are completely online) learning.As the international cooperation could be realized through distance learning, we  consider that the second and the third point are closely related.The achievement of 2 and 3 are closely related to the realization of the first point of the Plan.Objectives:1. Improvement of key competences and skills, and of quality of the teaching (especially regarding students with lower basic skills, due to Institution's speciality in that field). Innovative and better way of working which would help us create inclusive surroundings even in inadequate conditions and which would enable more active social involvement of students in unfavorable conditions. 2. TImprovement of the international dimension of education and qualification in School. Strengthening conscience about the European project and the values of the European Union. Increased cooperation with partners from other countries and especially taking videoconferences as a method of teaching to the next level.3. Increase competences in using e-learning in class, especially the one in the middle and on the right side of the continuum.   In order to fulfill our goals 11 school employees will be involved in job shadowing in 8 partner institutions, 6 of which will return their visit.Our school will have a quality team of experts who are motivated to use newely gained skills in class to improve the education system and make classes better.
