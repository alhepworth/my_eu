Therefore, this project aims at making students realize the importance of language and their own culture for shaping identity and gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage. Participants The project involves six secondary schools from Italy,  Wales, Scotland, Poland and Finland, Switzerland (silent partner). Each school is located in an area where a minority language is spoken. However, how big the minority language is, what political and cultural autonomy the minority enjoys and what current problems the minorities face differ greatly and will provide the participants with a good basis for comparison and building new knowledge together.MethodologyThe project is structured around three subtopics: - understanding your own identity and culture- understanding the historical and geographical significance- understanding the concept minority, what role the minority plays in society (now and in the future) and what the students themselves can do to maintain the minorityThe methodological approach to these topics will include activities which focus on reflection, analysis, creative and critical thinking and and it will integrate several different school subjects. Creativity has been an operative word when designing the project activities and planning the outcomes and it will integrate several different school subjects as well as work methods based on theatre pedagogyResultsThe three main results of the project will be: 1) A manual for how to use theatre pedagogy exercises to increase understanding of oneself and the other. The manual can be used in schools, but also in integration work with immigrants and asylum seekers. 2) Festivals held in each participating country celebrating minority culture and showcasing the students\u2019 work from all the project meetings3) A blog where all the project activities will remain accessible also after the completion of the projectImpact & long-term benefits Those who participate in the project are expected to gain a deeper understanding of their own language and cultural heritage. They will also learn about other minority cultures and the threats they are facing in today\u2019s society and thereby become better prepared for how to solve these issues in the future. In the long term, everyone involved in the project will become champions of languages and minorities. In other words, they will start to appreciate their minority culture and language more because they are aware of the relationship between their cultural heritage and their identity. Similarly, they will start to show more respect for other people\u2019s rights to do this too and thereby be less critical when it comes to immigrants and asylum seekers who want to promote their own cultural heritage and keep some of their own traditions and customs.

As this intensive course will be delivered entirely in Spanish, my own skills in the language will greatly improve, particularly with regard to confidence and correct pronunciation when speaking the language, which I will in turn pass on directly to the learners I teach.  The course also provides opportunity for professional dialogue amongst the participating teachers, allowing us to exchange experience and good practice and share resources, which we can then cascade to colleagues locally and nationally.  Our learners will benefit from the new resources we acquire and create using our new skills, and from connections that we make with representatives from other schools wishing to take part in e-twinning projects using the target language and ICT.  This will provide greater motivation for our students to learn a foreign language and reinforce the importance of being a global citizen.  The project also ties in with our school improvement plan to increase our provision of Spanish for all our students at all stages and of all abilities, giving a greater choice when choosing a foreign language to learn.  To implement this successfully, we need more fully qualified Spanish teachers in our department and this course allows teachers already qualified to teach other foreign languages to add Spanish to their repertoire.  The majority of our cluster primary schools have chosen to offer Spanish as their main language when implementing Scotland\u2019s \u201c1+2 languages\u201d initiative , which compounds our need for more Spanish teachers in the department, to ensure that primary learners have continuity and meaning in their foreign language learning experience.  Our long term goal is to ensure that our students have an enjoyable modern language learning experience, studying the language(s) of their choice from those that we offer - French, Gaelic, German, Mandarin, Spanish and Urdu to ensure that they choose to study foreign languages beyond the compulsory age and leave school with the skills they need to survive in an increasingly global working environment.", "http://jamesgillespies.co.uk/", "James Gillespie's High School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023527_coordinator"]]}}, "1LG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "1+2 Initiative at Sciennes", "Sciennes Primary", 10306.0, 1, 1, "Sciennes is an urban primary school with a roll of 640 pupils, located in south-central Edinburgh.

Lessons are delivered by internal and external specialists.  Other year groups do have some opportunities to experience languages but on an informal, ad hoc basis.  We are keen to broaden learning and teaching of languages and to move towards fulfilling the recommendations of the Scottish Government's Languages Working Group 1+2 Report.  In the first instance we aim to address the recommendations that:  we provide all learners with access to an additional language from P1; that we support teachers to develop a range of languages; that learning experiences include interdisciplinary and Content Led Integrated Learning; that learners have regular, planned exposure to language learning and that transition in language learning from P7 to secondary be more effective.  To achieve these aims we need to provide staff with  opportunities to develop and enhance their competence and confidence in French and Spanish and to explore motivating, innovative teaching strategies which will engage and challenge our learners from P1 to P7.

Recently, local family farms and community supported agriculture schemes (CSAs) are developing in Europe as they are gaining broader support from consumers, citizens, civic organizations and local authorities. Such farms have often many benefits: they provide local and healthy food\u037e they contribute to the environmental protection\u037e they often create new jobs opportunities\u037e and they are often multifunctional and pluriactive farms, which reinforces their economic sustainability and the vitality and viability of rural areas. It is therefore essential to support agricultural land use in connection with land tenure security in a comprehensive way. One obstacle to support local family farms and community supported agriculture (CSAs) is that such farms are often unable to compete successfully with bigger farms in gaining access to sufficient land. Small family farmers often struggling to find available agricultural land for affordable price and ensure the land tenancy security. The main objectives are:- To connect and to consolidate emerging organisations facilitating access to land (A2L) in the Czech Republic, Scotland and Greece with established organisations (France, Germany), as well as other European A2L initiatives and the informal European network on access to land; - Through the transfer of experience from French and German organizations towards the newer ones, to develop mutual knowledge cooperation, to reinforce networks, to increase the capacity to operate at transnational level and to share and confront new ideas; - To enlarge and enrich collective understanding and perspectives on access to land issues and solutions for established organizations by the experience from the Czech Republic, Scotland and Greece.The project \u201cLearning towards Access to Land\u201d is a strategic partnership for adult education of five partners to design a European core program for innovation and the exchange of good practices on local, national and European level. The partners are Asociace m\u00edstn\u00edch potravinov\u00fdch iniciativ (AMPI, Czech Republic), Terre de liens (France), Forschungsgesellschaft Die Agronauten (Germany), Nourish Scotland and Iliosporoi Network  (Greece). This partnership will revolve around a transfer of experience between the established access to land organisations (Terre de Liens, Die Agronauten) and the newer organisations (AMPI, Nourish Scotland, Iliosporoi Network). The benefits for the younger organisations will be to learn about the objectives, ways of doing, and tools of established organisations. The added value for the established organisations will be to support the development of new A2L organisations in more European countries, and to connect them with established organisations and network. Planned activities of this project are:- 3 transnational project meetings (kick-off, mid-term and final) in the Czech Republic, Scotland and Greece- 3 short-term joint staff training events for the Czech Republic, Scotland and Greece led by Germany and France- 12 Skype meetings of The Coordination Committee- internal activities, meetings or trainings within partner organizations.The implementation methodology in this project will consist of several phases that span the project lifecycle: preparation, realization and final evaluation. These phases are consistent across all our planned activities. Project management stretches over all phases to keep the project on schedule and to insure the quality of the project. The participant-based methodology will contribute to a deeper understanding of the concept of A2L in a longer term, to provide target groups with transversal skills and to facilitate the promotion of the training activities. This project is a knowledge-based project improving the cooperation for innovation and the exchange of good practices. It is aimed at producing, sharing and enriching resources (both general and technical) about the topic of access to land. The results will bring: a better understanding of the diversity of contexts, approaches and tools in both the newer and the established organisations via learning best practices as a way to consolidate their vision and practice; better skilled and better networked organisations supporting their employees with higher access to existing resources on access to land; better networked organisations working on access to land, and a clearer picture of the range of initiatives, approaches and country contexts. On all levels, the project is supposed to train staff, volunteers and supporters in participating countries in the topic of Access to Land (A2L).

It brings together 5 SMEs and 5 RTD performers with high expertise level in this area to reach the project objectives. Research activities will include screening of raspberry varieties for their AOM content and the development of new cultural practices involving the use of beneficial micro-organisms (biotisation) and of natural elicitors of plant defence reactions in order to drastically reduce chemical input and to increase AOM synthesis in raspberry. This will be associated with the development of a quality insurance scheme for raspberry plant production. Molecular markers will be designed for the specific identification of varieties together with a cryo-preservation protocol for germplasm long-term conservation. Molecular methods will also be developed for the identification of beneficial and pathogenic micro-organisms in order to assess plant sanitary status.

The participants in this consortium supported by the agricultural pedagogical authorities are the pupils aged 16 to 19 preparing a vocational secondary education diploma in the different options of the \u00ab\u00a0green sector\u00a0\u00bb or pupils registered  in the  4 options of  the technological diploma in Agronomy. All of them have to implement a 2 to 5 week  practical period which is compulsory in their curriculum. The consortium members wish to give them the possibility to have their placement at  a european company and  enable them to develop extra competences during their vocational training, giving  them the opportunity  to discover their future job in a european context instead of finding a host company in France or even in their home region. The consortium is also meant to allow staff members of the vocational schools to get trained at a company or a partner vocational training centre from other EU countries  where they can discover the education systems, other technical or pedagogical approaches and get more confident about  their language skills. Their aim is also to promote the values of democracy, citizenship and intercultural skills in accordance with the commitment of all EU education ministers in the framework of the Paris Declaration. \r\nThe ELANNA project  matches both assignments of international co-operation and  professional and social inclusion given to the schools in the 1999 orientation law of the Ministry of Agriculture. It will give pupils and staff members the opportunity to acquire extra professional, linguistic, cultural and transversal skills. The shared objective to increase mobility in vocational education promoted in the European Commission recommendations is especially meaningful in a region where employment is predominant in the sector of agriculture and rural activities. The aim is to enhance the adaptability and the open-mindedness of the pupils, to reinforce their interest in foreign languages and better understand the evolutions of the Common Agricultural Policy or make them more able to work in the fields of agricultural production and food-processing, environment, agro-tourism and other activities in rural areas, in which  exports and contacts with foreigners tend to become  common practice. Young pupils will also be encouraged to face the challenge of mobility and consider opportunities which might seem out of reach for them. \r\nThe 12 partner  EPLEFPA are more or less experienced in the implementation of work placements  abroad or the management of mobility projects.They all wish more pupils to experience a european mobility and to work jointly within a federating project for the benefit of both learners and staff.  \r\nConsidering the family background of the pupils and the fact that they live in remote rural places, this project is all the more meaningful.

Since 2004, this project has consecutively been the twelfth to be carried out and coordinated by the regional federation and is the most important further to a voluntarist policy to promote the european mobility that has been implemented for over ten years. In a context where the inward-looking attitude keeps increasing, the opening onto the world and towards others, interculturality, the strengthening of the professional, linguistic and personal skills constitute the aims of this project.\r\nAlthough every MFR has specifically defined its own aims, common objectives were upstream determined by the steering committee. They concern:\r\n-Significant improvements in language learning.\r\n-The strengthening of integration and adaptation capacities thanks to immersion work in a professional environment.\r\n-The development of professional skills specific to the enterprise, to the professional system of reference through carrying out activities determined beforehand by the partners.\r\n-The discovery of a country of the European Union and its culture.\r\n-The accession to autonomy and self-confidence, the capacity to take care of oneself and the development of adaptability.\r\n-Education in the opening-up to the world and towards others. Far from being innate, openness towards others requires a daily education that reaches its climax during the stay. Young people have a lot of prejudice, their judgment towards foreigners is often negative. Experience in immersion and meetings constitute an excellent means to perceive otherness that, despite differences, reveals more convergence and common grounds.\r\nThe ambition of this project is to enable 351 students in vocational or technical high school to enjoy a three-week stay in a European country selected by their MFR. They are in fifth, sixth or final year of high school with the following options: Services to people and territories, Business studies, Horticultural production, technicians , sale in pet shop, management, administration, landscaping, farm management. They are between 16 and 20 years old, most of them coming from a rural background, they think of living and working in a rural environment. They have little or no experience of mobility abroad, consequently we are convinced that this stay will benefit them and their future employability. In the sectors: Service and Business, the proportion of female students is very important, it is the opposite in the other sectors.\r\nIn methodological terms, project activities are managed by the promoter and the MFR involved and distributed between them. The promoter is in charge of promotion, of administrative and financial management, of the follow-up and technical support, of the quality control of the project and its dissemination.

The ISP has the objective to facilitate entry of graduate students into the European agro-food job market, and to close the gap between industry needs and the academic curriculum. \r\n\r\nMoreover, based on the curriculum developed for the ISPs, we will produce a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The MOOC, together with the related dissemination activities, will allow us to broaden the learning community and to attract more interest in the agro-food sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HE partners came together based on a shared interest to improve education for graduate students in agro-food economics and related disciplines. This group has the advantage of representing different geographical locations (North, South) and different institution sizes (small, medium and large). Each partner will bring its own (academic and private sector) expertise and knowledge with regard to the agro-food supply chain.  Our group is composed of seven partners: \r\n\r\nFive HEs representing five different EU Member States:\r\n\r\n   Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany)\r\n\r\n   University College Dublin (Ireland)\r\n\r\n   Wageningen University (The Netherlands)\r\n\r\n   Scotland\u2019s Rural College (Great Britain)\r\n\r\n   Universita degli Studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale (Italy)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand two private sector firms involved in the food supply chain:\r\n\r\n    BayWa AG from Germany, a large international corporation\r\n\r\n    Beikircher Gr\u00fcnland GmbH/S.r.l., an Italian SME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will support graduate students in their career development and attract interest in the agro-food sector. The project contributes to the EU\u2019s Education and Training 2020 strategic framework (ET 2020) objectives by increasing student and teacher mobility and by improving teaching quality. The MOOC to improve learning effectiveness and reach a wider audience thereby broadens the learning community. Moreover, the emphasis on international aspects (including cultural differences) of the ISP and the MOOC will raise participants\u2019 awareness of intercultural differences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropean universities\u2019 and companies\u2019 competitiveness at the international level will also be strengthened by the project. It contributes to attracting \u201cbright minds\u201d and mitigating the brain-drain away from Europe.

In addition to the technical aspects, the project aims to promote the personal development of learners and educational staff. The language competence in the project language English is promoted. This is especially true for a learning stay or training at Barony College, but also for stays in Finland, Sweden and Poland. The social competence as well as the own initiative and the entrepreneurial competence are promoted by the independent organization of the journeys to the partner devices in small groups.\r\nDuring the project period of 24 months, 24 forest forestry apprentices are expected to take part in a 3 or 4-week study stay, either in autumn or winter 2018, in spring and autumn 2019 and in spring 2010.

This association aims to promote cooperation between Danish and European educational institutions that implement agricultural programs.\r\n\r\nColleges within the agricultura (or \"green\") sector educate for professions that are important in the whole of Europe. They educate for a European rather than a national job market which is greatly affected by a changing global economy. The European Commission's New Skills Agenda aims to improve employability through better education and skills recognition. The European citizens must be guaranteed the right training, the right skills and the right support so that they can develop the advanced skills that foster competitiveness and innovation in Europe (European Commission Fact Sheet, June 10, 2016). If the \"green\" sector vocational collegs are to contribute for this agenda, they need to know and participate in a European reality and context - and this is true for students as well as teachers.\r\n\r\nMembers of EUROPEA Denmark feel that it is constantly a challenge for them on their own to create and operate activities that promote the internationalization of their educations. EUROPEA-Denmark, however, has experienced success with the implementation of the ERASMUS + project \"JOrdbrugsl\u00e6rere Rejser Ud\" [Agricultural teachers go abroad] (JORU, ) in the period 2015-17. After a slow start, schools have embraced the concept much to themselves and at the end of the project approx. 36 teachers from a broad range of member schools will have completed their mobility activity with specific learning objectives in a number of European countries. Therefore EUROPEA-Denmark now apply on behalf of the majority of its members for support under the ERASMUS+-program to fund a new version of the activity called \"JORU 2.0\". Lessons learned from the first project are underlying this activity. In JORU 2.0 36 teachers will travel 4-5 days in groups of 2-3 people in 12 European countries .\r\n\r\nSome member schools of EUROPEA-Denmark have been involved in various smaller national and international networks in recent years. Here they have developed and implemented ERASMUS +-supported activities for students in the form of internships for work based learning and schooling abroad. Especially international course modules of 3 weeks is a new offer in the sector, but for a single school on it's own is it difficult to attract enough students to continue operating. The same has proved difficult with a broad offer of internships abroad for students within a smaller network of EUROPEA Denmark's member schools (project \"Local Skills\", 2015-17). Therefore EUROPEA-Denmark is applying on behalf of 10 member schools for funding of two pilot tests with professionally targeted international student-activities: 1) The activity \"euXeu\": Long internships in Ireland, Scotland or Holland targeted 15 EUX-trainees after the first main course and 2) the activity \"AgriECVET DK\" that provides access to professional 3-week course modules offered by schools in NL, BE, AT and N for 16 students after the first main course. \r\n\r\nThe three activities are included in the project \"Jordbrugsl\u00e6rere Og Elever Rejser Ud\" (JOERU) - a project that will reach a very large part of the teachers and students of vocational agriculture education in Denmark. The JOERU-project as such aims to strengthen its members' capacity for internationalization work. The intenden capacity building is in particular concerning the following:\r\n\r\n- To deepen cooperative relations between schools in order to overcome challenges and barriers related to internationalization of agricultural education,\r\n- Ensure that school employees gain insight into the reality of Europe, including insight into the skills that it takes to strengthen the sector's competitiveness and innovation (in accordance with New Skills Agenda)\r\n- Ensure wide access to concrete, excellent and attractive international offers to students through internships and schooling in European countries\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project aims to develop EUROPEA-Denmark's ability as an effective player in efforts to provide concrete opportunities that promote internationalization of the green vocational education .\r\n\r\nThe project will strengthen the reputation of the individual schools and their contributions for provision of most highly qualified labor to agricultural industries. It is the aim that consortium members experience a high quality and efficiency of cooperation and therefore choose to expand and develop cooperation in the future.

The placement of our students is provided by our partner schools with cooperation with coordinator from our school. Suitable farms will be thoroughly choose according to branch of study and interest of trainees. Coordinators from our partner schools get to know receiving organisations with terms and aims of the practical training. Coordinators with cooperation of receiving organisation arrange suitable accommodation and meals, cultural programme, mentoring and tutoring of trainees. Coordinator will regularly and personally monitor trainees and check the quality, terms compliance and aims achieving of practical training.

The students will benefit from their practical training abroad: they can utilize all the innovative knowledge and experience in their job or in their own business. The acquiring of new social-cultural experience from a different region will contribute to a positive perception of European territory unification. We also expect them to use their knowledge, language and communicative skills in getting jobs, particularly in agriculture. The practical training abroad could help them to enter on the European job market. Their ability to make independent decisions and to be responsible is a great contribution too.

Manual work of unskilled staff has been replaced by modern computerised machinery . In the same time the demand for other services from the land based industires has increased  especially in equine, animal care and tourism This developement has increased the request for competent and well trained  staff who also have social skills, being service minded and communicative also in English.\r\nFor machine operators the increasing mobility is a partly a result of frequent storms throughout Europe causing large areas of storm felled forest in a random distribution between countries.  English is mostly used language in manuals, spare part catalogues and computers and it is necessary to have a basic level of english to operate a forest machine and work in another country. For people working with services in equine and animal care, social and communicative skills (including English) are necessary in tourism related activities.\r\n\r\nStora Segerstad has together wtih the German and the  Brittish partner developed  ECVET units primarily designed for forestry students.
