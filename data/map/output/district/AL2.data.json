Less toxic alternatives appear to be available already but comprehensive information on their possible toxicological effects are lacking. ENFIRO offers a prototypical case study on substitution options for BFRs resulting in a comprehensive dataset on viability of production and application, environmental safety, and a complete life cycle assessment. Dissemination will ensure the project results to arrive at policymakers' desks. The ENFIRO consortium is a unique collaboration between industries, SME's and universities with a wide variety of scientific disciplines. ENFIRO will contribute to the phasing out of BFRs as proposed in the European Water Framework Directive. The approach and the results of ENFIRO will be useful for similar substitution studies, e.g. in REACH.  Following a study on literature and industrial information, and prioritizing , three flame retardant (FR)/product combinations will be selected (e.g. metal-based FRs, phosphorous-based and nanoclay-based FRs in printed circuit boards, paints and foam). These will be studied for environmental and toxicological risks, and for viability of industrial implementation, i.e. production of the FR, fire safety and application of the FR into products (electronics, furniture, paints, foams, etc.). All information from these tests will be used for a risk assessment. The outcome of that assessment will, together with socio-economic information be used in a complete life cycle assessment. The project will follow a pragmatic approach, avoiding final recommendations on environment-compatible substitution options that would not be viable for implementation by industry. A Substitution Information Exchange Forum with members representing FR users (large industries) has been invited to guide this project.", 221949.0, 3398879.0, 5, 13, "ENFIRO", null, "http://www.itri.co.uk", null, "fp7_92068_998109437"], [1272672000000, 1351641600000, "INNOVATIVE FIRE PROTECTIVE COATINGS FOR STEEL STRUCTURES", "ITRI Ltd", "Current methods to provide fire protection of light steel structures include the nowadays most efficient approach of intumescent paints, which are typically applied on-site on a mounted structure using brushes or spray guns. Such treatments are generally achieved through the preparation of the surface by grit/shot blasting, followed by the application of a primer, and followed by the application of several layers of intumescent coatings. This methodology has a number of drawbacks for a large community of end users, including: a)Drying times of intumescent coatings are very long, resulting in high cost associated to labour, site disruption, and space required for painting; b) As a consequence of those significant costs and burdens, the reality is that many end users, particularly SMEs, end up applying fewer layers than required, uneven or irregular layers, or none at all, breaching therefore current legislation, facing serious penalties and fees and endangering the security of their own installations. The STEELPROST project aims to provide a solution to current surface treatment limitations, by developing a second generation of fire-protective coatings that are: easier to paint on, covering a larger area faster, having improved adhesion and quick drying properties. This will be achieved through 3 core innovations: 1)Development of low cost fire-retardant agents using novel tin-based technology, based on nontoxic halogen-free additives ; 2)Combination of the above fire retardant agents with further nanoparticle additives to confer the paint outstanding adhesion to the metal, and increase abrasion and wear resistance properties; 3)Design and optimisation of a procedure for fast curing of the coating using existing heating source technologies such as infra-red (IR). The proposed technology is expected to reduce steelwork treatment cost in constructional projects on a 25% for on-site applications and 50% for off-site application.", 14410.0, 2002379.0, 7, 11, "STEELPROST", null, "http://www.itri.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-11/57322.jpg", "fp7_96291_998109437"], [1285891200000, 1380499200000, "Advanced Surface Protection for Improved Reliability PCB Systems", "ITRI Ltd", "To investigate the scope, extent and factors causing black pad and related problems on printed circuit boards with an electroless nickel / immersion gold (ENIG) solderable finish .
