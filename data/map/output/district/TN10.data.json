This is despite 2 million job vacancies within the EU, suggesting mismatch in skills, as well as physical location.  Schools may deliver academic and vocational training but how effective are they in preparing children for future employment, or education?  This project, involving six European schools, will develop a unique program to provide pupils and teachers with a new view of how to improve their schools and their approaches to obtaining jobs or further education as well as increasing their mobility within Europe.  We will plan. co-ordinate and carry out \u201cstudent take-overs\u201d; experiences where students take on the role and responsibilities of staff employed within their school to better understand teaching and learning as well as how they successfully finish secondary education.  First, this will be carried out within partner schools.  Students will subsequently explore this internationally to understand how teaching and learning takes place within Europe and support school leaders in applying best practice in their own school.  Students will then have the opportunity to apply and be interviewed for and take part in \u201ctake over\u201d in other partner schools.  This will improve their understanding of job seeking and learning elsewhere as well as raise their aspirations of working in other EU countries.  In addition it will provide novel insight to schools of how they can improve their practice and raise achievement and standards.  This project also contributes to the EU 2020 targets of:  a) increasing levels of employment, b) reducing rates of children leaving education, c) increasing numbers of people completing third level education and it works towards enhancing mobility within Europe.", "http://www.hughchristie.kent.sch.uk", "Hugh Christie Technology College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013535_coordinator"]]}}}}
