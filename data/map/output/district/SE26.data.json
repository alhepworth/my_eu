He is the guide and the referent of this writing  and reflection process,  helped by the teatcher of literature. In February in each classroom, 5 dialogues are selected by the pupils and are translated. In March, each classroom  receives the 25 dialogues written by the others pupils in native and translated  language.\r\nWith the literature and foreign language teatchers, the pupils stage, text in hand, the dialogues. The author shares with them this work, wich is presented to the cultural venues all in the same scenic system : the public is set up in U and the dialogues are presented in the central space in french and english.\r\n\r\nBeyond a writing process, this work is a human experience, a confrontation of point of views and stakes pointed by european teenagers.\r\nThe different steps of the project lead the pupils to experiment and appropriate four social roles : the role of author privileging a cognitive and intimate engagement, the role of performer stimulating the physical and emotional engagement, the role of stage director provoking a critical engagement about the direction choices,  and the role of spectator allowing to identify, justify and appreciate.\r\nFor the operators, mediators and education specialists this project is a way to stimulate invidual expression of pupils with a work linked up to language, writing and all the semantics fields pupils cross in their every day way of life. \"What kind of world do I LIVE in ? Dialogues without borders\", is to understand the various methods professional authors set up to accompany and value the co-construction of dialogues from young people precupations.\r\nThink artistic and cultural education in terms of cultural rights lays the fondation of a recognition of reciprocal dignity of each, children and adults.

The plays, published or unpublished, are to be translated for this project.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the project is to explore bilingual theatre texts through aloud readings. The pupils share their performance, their understanding of the texts and the way they apprehend each writing. They carry out this work in the classroom and then share it with the others french, belgian and english pupils. The workshops are led by teachers (of literature and foreign languages) in collaboration with artists, writers, translators and cultural partners. These exchanges between pupils and authors make interculturality richer into a European citizenship perspective. The pupils present public readings of the plays to other pupils of their school and parents during the transnational meetings and multiplier events. \r\n\r\nThe cultural opening of the pupils increases thanks to the study of these bilingual plays and the cultural background of the different playwriters, but also by visiting theatres, seeing professional\r\nperformances and meeting artists. These meetings with professionals will take place during in and out school time in order to \r\nwelcome parents. \r\nA multiplier events will take place in Toulouse in june 2017 in partnership with Le Centre national des  Lettres of Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.
