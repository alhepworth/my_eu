Targeted at the large but often overlooked static power sector, the engine has huge market potential both within the EU and globally.

The 8 day immersion course in Salignac, near Sarlat-la-Caneda, France with LFEE Europe offers training which would enable us to work more effectively towards our aims for the teaching of French. The course will provide us with materials and ideas suitable for teaching French at primary level and develop expertise in the teaching of this subject. It will enable the course participant to improve competence and performance in French which can then be developed throughout school through training and support; as well as providing ICT resources to use in the classroom and links using the internet. A cross curricular approach is favoured on the course and as well as working towards improving expertise in the teaching of Modern languages to children of Primary School age, the course aims to develop cultural awareness and understanding of contempory France to the participant and then in turn to other school staff and pupils. \r\nThrough this project the school aims to :\r\n-Send one participant on the immersion course in Salignac to develop her spoken language and the teaching of the language, including through cross curricular links as well as in language lessons. \r\n-Use the training from the course and the resources provided to feed into our school action plan for the improvement of Modern language teaching through Key Stage 2.\r\n-Provide training through INSET for all teaching staff  and Teaching Assistants (including at Key Stage 1) in approaches to the dvelopment of the language.\r\n-Develop our own more creative whole school Scheme of Work  for Modern Languages to include immersion weeks and assemblies as well as weekly lessons. \r\n-Develop internet links with other course participants following the course and use this as a platform for mutual support and advice. \r\n-Share knowledge with local schools through our cluster groups and through the 'Aspire' group of schools as one of our targeted open evenings.\r\nWe intend to send one participant who is a Key Stage 2 teacher and our Modern languages subject leader. She is enthusiastic about teaching and learning French and developing the capabilities of other staff in school through INSET and individual support. We would hope that the impact of the course would be that all staff would become more confident in the teaching of French through cross curricular work as well as in designated French lessons on  an 'ad hoc' basis in order to embed French language and culture into our creative curriculum. The impact of the project will be measured against the objectives on our school action plan and this will be monitored by the subject leader, head, management team and governors through discussion, observation and a wide range of evidence. \r\nThe longer term benefits will be that it will be possible to perform staff training 'in house' so that all staff have access to the same training and can share ideas and ask for advice from the subject leader and also through contacts with practitioners in other schools. \r\nAs part of our contributions to local cluster groups and the local 'Aspire' project where schools share expertise and good practice we would look towards sharing some of the ideas we have tried successfully with other teachers in the local area.", null, "Slyne-with-Hest St Luke's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002261_coordinator"]]}}, "8EE": {"life": {"data": [[2002, "Limestone Country - Yorkshire Dales Limestone Country Project", "Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority", 1529307.0, 599944.0, "The Yorkshire Dales National Park is home to the most extensive range of limestone pavements and upland semi-natural calcareous grassland in the United Kingdom.

The Round Table will bring together representatives from the nanomedical sciences and technologies involved, industry, patient groups, regulatory bodies, health insurance and policy making, and experts on the ethical, regulatory, social, economic and public engagement and communication and issues.
