Based on the extrapolation of data relating to the UK, French and German railways [Ref 1], the 500,000 kms of rail [Ref. 2] on the European rail network has an average estimated 5000 rail breaks annually with about 1500 due to weld failure. Although the number of weld failures is relatively small compared to the estimated 11 million alumino-thermic welds on the European network, it still accounts for about 20% of the total 7000\\ rail failures each year [Ref. 3]. There is no current available NDT method for the economic and reliable volumetric examination of alumino-thermic welds. This proposal describes the development of a rapid ultrasonic method for the safe and reliable NDT examination of the entire volume of in-situ alumino-thermic welds. The proposed ultrasonic system could be quickly deployed on track using a clamp-on device. The inspection scans will be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, and then the results compared with defect acceptance criteria that will be generated in the project. To achieve this objective, a rigorous analysis of the material properties, the defect interaction with the ultrasonic beams and the design of optimum scanning procedures will first be carried out. It is expected that the scans will be implemented by means of electronic scanning using novel phased arrays and multiple probes.

The educational resources consist of 12 sets of content for dialogue, debate and discussion on contested issues (including the historical context, a description of the issues, a variety of viewpoints and questions that make students think), a teacher\u2019s guide on debate, dialogue and discussions (introducing a range of teaching methods), a teacher\u2019s guide on assessing social and civic competences (including a set of assessment tools), and a training package (to be used to train other teachers on how to use these resources in practice).

While \u2018traditional\u2019 history education in many countries continues to rely on the teacher and the textbook as the two focal points of every lesson, digital learning can put the student in an active role. It enables them to not only use but interact with all digitalized original sources (such as documentaries, music, interviews, paintings, political cartoons) or tailor-made learning activities prepared by the teacher with the specific curricula and desired learning outcomes in mind. Using ICT in the classroom makes it possible to strengthen collaborative learning, virtual inter-regional and cross-border exchange, and many other learner-centered and competence-based activities. It can make a most relevant and innovative contribution to school education and at the same time immerse students in a digital learning environment, vastly increasing their related key competences and skills with positive implications for their further educational careers, employability, and role as active citizens in an increasingly interconnected digital world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project targets several hundred history, heritage, and citizenship educators who want to use innovative approaches in their daily work, particularly through the utilization of ICT and OER. Educators in this sense can be curriculum developers, textbook authors and developers of other teaching materials and tools, teacher pre-service and in-service trainers, teachers in primary and secondary schools and in higher education, trainee teachers, and also assessment experts, educational advisors and inspectors, educational staff in museums and institutes, and board members of professional associations. The Consortium also invites academics, representatives of educational authorities, school and university students, parents, and the wider public interested in history to join its activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will give these educators access to a wide selection of high-quality materials and will support them to share teaching ideas and co-create content with their peers from around Europe. The exemplar learning activities envisaged will foster competence-based approaches to the subject based on critical thinking and the ability to analyse content in a balanced way, question and compare interpretations, assess evidence and make independent judgments. By providing easy-to-use services and hands-on training the project will support a large group of educators to become more digitally confident, to act as multipliers with their colleagues, and to transmit their skills to their students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Consortium will be composed of an international NGO, a web design company, a school, and two research institutes. Its areas of cooperation will include content sourcing, developing tools and applications, testing and piloting, peer- and expert-reviewing, and dissemination including training and awareness-raising of educators specifically in the field of digital learning and how to integrate ICT and OER in the daily work with their students. By way of bringing together practitioners and experts from a variety of backgrounds and countries, the project will further develop and improve the online educational platform Historiana by further enriching the content, strengthening the users\u2019 community, and stimulating the usage of the website. The project will further support the establishment of a pan-European community of education practitioners and experts who promote the use of ICT and OER and the role of digital competences in history, heritage, and citizenship education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure the project\u2019s lasting impact, it includes a strong focus on professionalization and capacity building of history, heritage, and citizenship educators in different countries and geographic settings.
