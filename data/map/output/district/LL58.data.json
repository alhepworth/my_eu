AquaMMS will be suitable for use primarily in land-based aquaculture industry, but other markets are also relevant including environmental monitoring sector and the water supply industry. This technology will provide the fish farmer with advance warning of a broad range of potential pollutants, like toxic metals, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, hydrogen sulphide and geosmins. These pollutants can otherwise inflict chronic stress on the farmed fish resulting in disease outbreaks and/or poor product quality, which means lost profit to the fish farms. Most of these parameters are at present technically challenging to measure accurately on a regular basis and may only be analysed when problems arise on the farm and samples are sent for more comprehensive analysis at external laboratories. Q-technologies (UK) has successfully developed miniature mass spectrometry (MMS) technology for the oil and gas industry, and has seen the need and potential in developing and marketing a similar system for the aquaculture industry. Therefore, they have taken the initiative to propose the AquaMMS project by combining forces with the  SMES, Faaltech (Ireland) and BAMO (Germany). Together, these SMEs will form the production and distribution chain of the product post project. Anglesey Aquaculture Ltd (UK) and Telemarks Roye as (Norway) will take part in the project representing the end user community and will act as a test sites for the developed technology. Anglsey Aquaculture and Telemarks Roye will benefit from improved production by using AquaMMS ahead of its competitors. The RTDs, University of Liverpool (UK), Teknologisk Institutt (Norway) and Cork Institute of Technology (Ireland) have been invited to perform the RTD work needed to reach the objectives.", 17079.0, 1173813.0, 4, 8, "AQUAMMS", "http://www.aquamms.com/", "http://www.angleseyaquaculture.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/161243.jpg", "fp7_111211_952927807"], [1354320000000, 1425081600000, "Development of sustainable and cost effective water quality management technology for the aquaculture industry", "Anglesey Aquaculture Limited", "The proposers of RAZone have identified a new market opportunity in enhancing the productivity of the aquaculture sector and minimizing risks associated with application of ozone for water quality management in hatchery and ongrow farms that use RAS technology. This will be achieved by developing improved ozoneflotation technology that is cost effective, user friendly and safe both for stock and farm staff.  The innovations of RAZone include novel ozone feeding system that ensures enhanced gas dispersion in water and maximizes contact between gas and water for separation of fine particles and dissolved organics in recirculated water. In addition, the development of RAZone includes innovative flotation chamber where fine particles that make up 70% of suspended substances and dissolved organics are efficiently removed. For optimum dosage of ozone and minimizing risk of stock mortality due to toxicity directly from inefficiently dispersed ozone or from generated by products, an intelligent process control unit will be created.\n\nDespite the recognized potential of ozone in RAS, there remains a significant lack of equipment and knowledge in the industry related to cost effective and safe use of the technology. Application of ozone via protein skimmers has become a costly component of RAS operation due to poorly designed equipment for ozone feeding, inefficient configuration of skimmers and lack of controlled ozone dosage combined with poor understanding of process. This may result in either avoidance of ozone technology altogether or inefficient application to achieve desired aims in addition to associated risks.  By redressing existing limitations in the application of ozone, the SME participants of RAZOne expect significant economic benefit from a superior technology that will improve management of water quality resulting in reduced stock mortality, improved produce quality and increased  production as well as increased employment in the industry.", 16754.0, 1208440.0, 5, 10, "RAZONE", "http://www.razone.no/", "http://www.angleseyaquaculture.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725552.jpg", "fp7_105966_952927807"], [1293840000000, 1367280000000, "The development of a deammonification treatment to remove nitrogen from recirculated water used in aquaculture", "Anglesey Aquaculture Limited", "The aquaculture industry has been very slow to adopt denitrification methods. Present practice is to convert the toxic metabolic waste product ammonia via nitrite to nitrate in a nitrifying bio-filter. This microbial process demands oxygen and reduces the pH, requiring expensive buffering treatment. The accumulating nitrate is generally flushed from the farm into recipient waters without pollutant removal. The DeammRecirc proposal is based on the recent experiences and success of using deammonification to convert ammonia to nitrogen gas in other waste water treatment applications. This method will in the proposed project be adapted for use in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) for fresh- and marine water species. By using a deammonification reactor within RAS, ammonia will be converted to nitrogen gas in one step. Deammonification bacteria enriched in granules will be adapted to RAS water qualities. The advances compared to current SoA include reduced oxygen use, reduced cost for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint, reduced levels of nitrate rich effluent released to the environment, reduced pumping cost and treatment need of new exchange water. The project includes 11 participants, of which four are industrial SMEPs, which will produce, develop and distribute the DeammRecirc system post project, one is a large enterprise end user, one participant is from S.
