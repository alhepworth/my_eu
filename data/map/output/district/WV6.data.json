As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results. But they also reflect the determination to pursue a process of continuous improvement, and to take decisive steps towards the effective implementation of the ECVET system in some of the curricula of the participating organisations, an ambitious aim we are determined to achieve.", "http://www.tlccollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA102-022405_3"], [2016, "Move to learn move to grow!", "TLC College", 193100.0, 5, 37, "\"Move to learn move to grow\" project will implement the strategic plan for the internationalization of the Sarrocchi IIS, in its version of January 2015 (see pag 76 PTOF), whereas transnational placements are one of the key tools to \"contribute to the promotion of a genuine European labour market\" (Council recommendation of 3/10/2014 on a quality framework for traineeships) where:-the skills (LO) of students meet the real needs of local and international companies;-the skills of its staff are constantly updated and permeated by a European and intercultural dimension.Through the project, the Sarrocchi Institute will develop the following two main actions for implementing its internationalization strategy: A) international internship lasting 35 days  (+2 days travel) for 75 students in classes IV and V of the mechanical and electrical sector, IT department, electronic and electrotechnical, chemical sectors in Spain, France, United Kingdom, Czech Republic's companies.

In the medium term, the project also aims to facilitate the integration of mobility into national training systems, and also to promote the recognition of the knowledge and skills acquired during mobility through the attribution of valid credits. In this way, the project will contribute towards lifelong learning in the truest sense of the term, by ensuring that the resulting competence and enhanced employability will serve to reduce the risk of social and professional exclusion and, on the contrary, improve awareness of active European citizenship.\r\nThe participants selected will have clearly followed a training path relevant to the achievement of these objectives, but are currently facing difficulties as far as breaking into the job market is concerned. In order to remove this obstacle the participants need to acquire some form of competitive advantage, especially given the fact that the current scenario of socio-economic crisis in Europe is leading employers to further reduce the number of employees and, at the same time, make higher demands in terms of required qualifications. As a result, young people without access to a chance to develop key skills, to gain professional experience and to prepare themselves for entry into the market, may risk long-term unemployment or find themselves obliged to accept survival work which has nothing to do with their chosen career. In either case, this inevitably leads to frustration, and sometimes even to social and professional exclusion.\r\nTransnational mobility, promoted by a high quality project, creates added value in terms of employability by means of better language skills, not just for social integration but also for professional development, and by means of a clearer understanding of the European dimension of life and work in the future. Mobility brings citizens together, increases mutual understanding and tolerance and boosts confidence to face a world of instability, uncertainty and insecurity in relation to the near future. By providing valid, transparent, clearly-certified qualification which can be easily recognised by employers, mobility also increases the participants\u2019 levels of competitiveness and employability. \r\nThis project will therefore deliver a 13-week mobility programme for 70 young Portuguese citizens who have concluded vocational training, including those from disadvantaged social backgrounds. The project will include language preparation for all participants, adapted to their real communication needs, and will provide specific socio-cultural preparation so as to help develop intercultural competence. The language preparation organised by CEL will be teacher-led and will include the use of our own materials, specifically created for this purpose. At the end of the experience, the participants will be evaluated and given a language competence certificate issued in accordance with the C.E.F.R. for Languages and stating the contexts in which skills have been acquired. Following this preparatory stage, the participants will begin a 13-week work placement experience, seamlessly connected to their existing training path, certified in accordance with national vocational training legislation and clearly indicating the skills acquired and the performance level of each participant. Finally, these several forms of certification will be linked by Europass Mobility certification, clearly indicating to potential employers the content of the work placement and the knowledge and skills acquired, and will therefore demonstrate the capacity of the participant to take initiative in the construction of his own future career.  \r\nThe mobility experiences to be carried out under the terms of this project will occur between Sep. 2015 and June 2016 and will involve 21 partners from 8 member states of the EU, chosen for their proven competence in guaranteeing excellence in mobility and for their specialised knowledge of the specific professional sectors in which the participants wish to pursue their careers.

The meeting will be from 3-13 September 2018 in 2 locations of C\u00e1diz: Campano and Jerez de la Fra, in Andalusia.\r\nThis project is the result of the Strategic Alliance KA2 'Experience EuroAsia & Empower' (2016-8), where our 5 young volunteers discovered sustainable development and took the initiative to create this project.\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n1 Reflect on sustainable development and the initiative \"Think globally, act locally\", why it worries young people.\r\nThe concept of sustainable development (SD) is unknown, but when you research a bit on the Internet, the ideas you defend seem good to us.\r\n2 Discuss EU priorities and directives on sustainable development in line with the Paris agreement on climate change and how we can contribute to everyday life.\r\n3 Promote responsible consumption regarding the consumption of clothing, electronic devices, food and plastic.\r\n4 Discover sustainable habits in European countries by showing examples.\r\n5 Carry out a pro sustainable development campaign with the local population and social networks to promote a more sustainable Europe.\r\n6 Discuss employment and entrepreneurship in relation to the UN's sustainable development objective and the EU's opportunities for youth.\r\n7 Promote cooperation and good relations between the participants.\r\nThe methodology is based on non-formal and informal education (games, group dynamics, debates, drama, role plays, recycling workshops, films under the stars, visits, gymkhana, awareness campaign, reflection groups, evaluations) to promote learning, which is based on cooperation between peers, working in small groups, fostering critical thinking and decision-making democratically, drawing conclusions together, and fostering creativity.\r\nExpected results:\r\n- Discover the concept of sustainable development, understand the priorities of the EU 2020, the Paris Agreement, set their own goals, plan what they want to do in the future.\r\n-Sensitize attitudes of responsible consumption (food, fashion, technology, energy, etc.) and initiate the change to sustainable habits.\r\n-Promote the long-term results of Erasmus + Youth with the exploitation of the results of the KA2 project \"Empower\".\r\n-Learn how to reuse and recycle t-shirts, cloth bags, grassman, seed pens.\r\n-Create a local campaign and social media to raise awareness, designing slogans on shirts and bags, creating videos to raise awareness of sustainable development and sustainable habits.\r\nIn addition, we will emphasize intercultural learning by cooking typical dishes, interactive national nights, analyzing traditions from a sustainable point of view.\r\nWe will promote contact with the local population: gymkhana, reception in the Town Hall, visits of 3 NGOs that will serve as examples of sustainable life; having lunch on campus, creating posters to hang them there and other places, creating activities involving local population during the campaign.\r\nParticipants will make new friends from different cultures and backgrounds, develop skills and reflect on learning, obtaining their Youthpass. They will feel an important and closer part of Europe, also improving the lives of other young people with their sustainable messages.\r\nThey will learn to work in national / international teams, be more entrepreneur in the face of challenges, be more tolerant and respectful; They will discover new skills such as creating / editing videos, drawing with chalk, creating bags, new languages.\r\nIn the dissemination phase, we will make presentations of the results and meetings, with the video and Prezi, the participants will talk about their learning experiences to members, volunteers, relatives ... The participants will spread their Erasmus + experience and if they have changed habits for be more sustainable.\r\nThe long-term benefits are in the change being more responsible citizens, more informed about their environment and Europe, respecting nature, consuming more responsibly. They will be healthier citizens when they become aware of better consumption habits (i.e. plastic products). Thus, they will know more about sustainable development, support initiatives for the protection of the environment, the economy (buying in local commerce, local products), fair employment, for future generations, involving family and friends.", "http://www.tlccollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES02-KA105-010986_5"]]}}, "7XW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1364774400000, 1490918400000, "Risk Management Software System for SMEs in the Construction Industry", "Computors Limited", "The construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries accounting for 10% of Gross Domestic Product  with approximately 92% of manufacturers being SMEs. This sector directly employs 12 million EU citizens and 26 million workers are dependent on the sector. However, due to the global economic crisis, the last few years have been full of uncertainty for many companies in the construction and engineering industry.  These companies are facing fierce competition and winning new contracts as well as delivering on schedule and on budget is fundamental to their survival. Core to these problems are, enterprises and more especially SMEs are operating in a dynamic business environment with constant exposure to risk leading to underperformance, low productivity and sometimes businesses could stop trading overnight. This project therefore, aims at developing a cost effective, user friendly risk management system, which evaluates, monitors, and reviews both imminent and impending risks with a view to completely eliminate or minimise their impact.  RiMaCon consortium wishes to challenge and overcome the current non trivial, interdisciplinary and intersectoral barriers currently preventing the development and implementation of efficient risk management systems in SMEs. It will therefore design and develop a robust, reliable, and sustainable risk management prototype system suitable and affordable for the construction SMEs, possibly in a software format or a portal. This risk management prototype will be dynamic, flexible to adapt to different construction contexts. RiMaCon has already carried out preliminary survey / investigation and confirmed this need especially for SMEs who are under resourced, vulnerable and also lack the technology to develop a robust risk management system.
