The beneficiaries and partner organisations are committed to the provision of innovative research and training for more cost effective and sustainable remediation of contaminated land. It is a multidisciplinary collaboration between internationally renowned research teams (from both the academic and non-academic sectors) each with complementary expertise in a wide range of site investigation and risk assessment technologies. 14 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) will be recruited into the network and will participate in a structured and integrated research and training programme that will provide them with a highly specific blend of personalised technical and transferable skills. Each research project is designed to benefit the contaminated land sector through development of techniques and tools across a range of disciplines relating to site investigation and risk assessment, to provide better informed solutions for remediation. The unique provision of joint supervision (from both the academic and non-academic sectors) and non-academic mentoring will significantly enhance the fellows\u2019 career prospects within the contaminated land sector. The REMEDIATE ETN will strengthen and enhance existing collaborations between the participating beneficiaries and partner organisations resulting in a cohesive and dynamic network. The output will be a new generation of highly mobile, creative and innovative entrepreneurs with the skills sets necessary to address the technical, economic and social challenges facing the contaminated land sector in Europe, both now and in the future.", null, 2751808.0, 8, 23, "Remediate", null, null, null, "h2020_193990_940830452"]]}}, "9UE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "European Learning Mobility on Energy Efficient Renovation of Old Buildings", "NIRBC LTD", 495042.0, 6, 35, "The key element of energy saving policy is energy efficient buildings. Buildings consume more energy than any other sector of the European economy. It is recognized that they account for around 40% of all energy consumption. The building sector, therefore, offers the largest potential for enerfy savings, which in return will reduce our negative impact on the environment. Based on these considerations, the project \"ETEROB Mobility\" aims, in line with the project LLP-LdV TOI \"ETEROB - European Training Programme on Energy Efficient Renovation of Old Buildings\", to lay the foundation, through the creation of specific paths of WORK-BASED LEARNING (WBL) for students in initial vocational training and recent graduates in CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE subjects, for a modernization of the construction sector in the belief that this may be the most immediate and cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption, and to create new jobs and promote economic recovery in the construction industry. Through \"ETEROB Mobility\" the VET School \"Caselli\", the other 9 sending VET Schools and all partners of the Consortium, are therefore intended to provide appropriate competencies in the building eco-friendly sector in order to identify appropriate solutions for energy saving, in compliance with regulations on environmental protection and improve, therefore, the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, to the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills curriculum: professionalism in their specific areas of VET (ENERGY, CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LAND), cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued by a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of one month for 100 students and of three months for 80 recent graduates of the 10 VET Schools involved (Construction, Environment and Landscape sector).\r\nIn summary, the project activities are:\r\n1. Transversal Activities: Management; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Communication and Cooperation Plan; Selection and preparation of participants; Planning of LOs;\r\n3. Mobility: Internship in the company; Monitoring; Internships and project evaluation; Evaluation, cerification, transfer and validation of LOs.\r\nFrom the methodological point of view the project includes:\r\n- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;\r\n- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;\r\n- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.\r\nFor the participants the main expected results from the ETEROB Mobility project affect not only its marketability in the job market, but also its positive influences on the development of human potential through its moments of formal, informal and non-formal learning.\r\nFinally, through ETEROB Mobility it is expected to consolidate a network of European actors bringing good practices and innovative training models in the areas of energy, construction, environment and landsacape and setting the stage for future collaborations.\r\nThe project is, therefore, an important starting point for the updating and exploitation of results on a larger scale.\r\nThese, therefore, the expected impacts:\r\nAT THE END OF THE PROJECT:\r\n- the development of specialized skills for the target group involved (180 young students and recent graduates);\r\n- realization of models and training tools of innovative value.\r\nIN THE MEDIUM TERM:\r\n- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training;\r\n- Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved;\r\nIN THE LONG TERM:\r\n- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;\r\n- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.nireedbeds.co.uk ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005693_27"]]}}}}
