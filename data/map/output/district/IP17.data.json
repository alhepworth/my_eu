Following the steps of the Homeric hero, their odyssey was an initiatory journey paving the way for future generations of young European artists. Today Europe\u2019s singularity is characterized by the rich diversity of artistic situations and sociological contexts. The Ulysses \u201cjourneys\u201d aim to exploit this singularity to the fullest. It is a conviction of the Ulysses project that this is the only really modern approach to education. Ulysses aims also to give the \u201cjourney\u201d a more metaphorical meaning as well.Firstly, the metaphor applies to the \u201cprofessional journey\u201d young talent must undertake in order to become mature artists. Ulysses aims to propose \u201cpaths\u201d that will enable young artists to find their way from the academies, through the journeys that ultimately will put them in a position to be offered commissions for creating new works to be premiered in world-class venues, thus serving as a \u201claunching pad\u201d for their careers. Secondly, the metaphor applies to potential young artists where the goal is to propose a \u201cjourney\u201d that will take them from the discovery of new art forms to a stage where they can become creative themselves in a variety of projects fitted to their needs thereby revealing their talent.Thirdly, the metaphor applies to audience building. Audiences today are confronted with a bewildering variety of musical aesthetics and practices. Therefore, audiences of all ages will be offered activities that will take them from a first encounter with an artist (or a work) to a deeper understanding of the work.Lastly, the metaphor will be deployed in the virtual world of the online Ulysses Platform by enabling music professionals and amateurs to follow the evolution and accomplishments of our young artists.", "http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk", null, "creative_570769-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_11"], [1462924800000, 1589068800000, "YOUNG OPERA MAKERS Programme by enoa", "SNAPE MALTINGS", 1733496.0, 11, 13, "YOUNG OPERA MAKERS PROGRAMME by enoaThe role of creation, development of new forms, exploration of innovative creative processes and audience renewal are all major challenges facing today\u2019s European opera world. Young artists must be the drivers of this change: their training and employability are crucial issues. In a globalized and competitive sector young artists should be fundamentally mobile and innovative. As existing training structures do not prepare for current challenges, the enoa network institutions have developed the YOUNG OPERA MAKERS Programme.This programme will give young creators (such as composers, writers and directors among others) and performers (singers, conductors, pianists and vocal coaches) the keys to develop their employability and international career in a constantly evolving field. It will offer them excellent training, with an interdisciplinary and contemporary approach to opera, enable them to perform and experience creative processes, and increase their visibility and access to international recruitment circuits.The programme therefore offers tailored training consisting of a wide variety of activities hosted by members of enoa throughout Europe along with a digital platform dedicated to the young artist community. Activities include: practical and theoretical workshops focused on technical development and the issues around creating opera, residences immerging young artists in the creative environment of cultural institutions, labs devoted to experimentation of innovative artistic projects, and new productions that will each lead to international tours.", "http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk", null, "creative_570767-CREA-1-2016-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_12"]]}}, "1WA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1296518400000, 1359590400000, "Intelligent combustion management of flue gases for solid fuel domestic heating systems", "Cico Chimney Linings Ltd", "Processed and poor quality solid fuels produce highly corrosive flue gases that significantly reduce the lifetime of flue liners.

Habitat loss and deterioration - especially the reduction in Phragmites reedbeds and similar marshlands which are favoured by this large but secretive bird - are among the chief reasons for its general demise, and for its inclusion in Annex I of the Birds Directive. The recent trend to abandon traditional reed management has contributed to the present situation where the haunting, low, booming call of territorial male bitterns is no longer heard, or is heard less frequently, in many lowland wetlands of north-west Europe.\n\nIn the UK, where the breeding population has dropped from a mid-1950s peak of around 80 booming males to 16 in 1994, the RSPB has prepared a recovery plan for bitterns. This project aimed to take key elements of this plan and put them into action so as to safeguard and enhance core areas of UK bittern habitat.\n\nTo improve the conservation status of this species in Britain, the project would expand the available breeding habitat and improve habitat quality at 13 sites, mostly in East Anglia - the species' current stronghold - and at one outlying site in north-west England. This would be done in partnership with wetland management agencies in both the public and private sectors.\n\nActivities would specifically protect and enhance reedbed habitats; restore degraded reedbed habitats; and create new reedbeds adjacent to existing areas of this habitat. The expected result would be to provide suitable habitat in Britain to support a bittern population that is 2-3 times higher than at present, although it might take longer than the life of the project before the birds take up residence in their improved habitats. Finally, lessons learnt from this project would be shared with other relevant organisations across the EU to assist the implementation of the European bittern action plan.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=119", "http://www.bitterns.org.uk,", "life_181"], [1999, "Living with the sea  - Living with the sea : Managing Natura 2000 sites on dynamic coastlines", "English Nature", 1814120.0, 907061.0, "There\u2019s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_223"]]}}}}
