Our school BELE is committed once more with the creation of a contact  network in which are included professionals and training centers of our sector, enabling us mutual growth in quality. We commit in the future projection of our students, through the synergies from whom we share the same interests.\r\nBELE (Bilboko Euskal Lutheria Eskola-Basque School of Violin Making) is integrated in the Conservatory of Music \u201cJuan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga\u201d of Bilbao and is the only school in Spain where violin making is imparted (Making and restoration of bowed instruments - violin, viola and cello-, level III of Professional Qualifications). This school is attended by students from all over Spain.\r\nIn 2013 we began the way to renewal. Our aim was to overcome the difficulties of labor insertion, through an ambitious plan which improves the quality of the students' training with a new Curriculum, the improvement of the competences of the teaching staff, the provision of human resources, as well as material and economic resources, practical training in qualified workshops, etc. On the other hand we carried out actions to achieve this quality recognition by sector professionals, both workshops and professional musicians. In short, it\u2019s a strategic plan to grow in quality and prestige, and thus improve the employability of our students.\r\nFor this purpose, in 2016 we carried out our first student and staff mobility project as well as another project of strategic partnerships for innovation. This is our second year in our internationalization path. The achieved progresses reaffirm us in the validity of the undertaken itinerary and are positively answering the detected needs of quality and prestige as reflected in our Strategic Plan 2015-2020. The link with schools, professionals and companies from other European countries is helping BELE to improve its quality and to have a greater and better presence in the sector.  As a result  up today, we can say that our students training and their recognition abroad is better improving their employability.\r\nWe are weaving a network of relationships between professionals, training centers and workshops, based on mutual trust. We all share the same improvement , growth, quality and efficiency interests for the sector, and the market demands. Sharing and connecting we are wiser, more creative, more skillful, more efficient. All this will provide a better response to the needs of the sector, musicians, training centers and, essentially, our students.\r\nWe request twelve mobilities in the current project in order to continue and enhance this dynamic. Six of them are students mobilities, four of them for staff job-shadowing and another  two for experts teaching. Our collaborating partners are companies, workshops, training centers and professionals from the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and France, with strong roots, long tradition and prestige in the sector. During the last year we have incorporated six new partners and nowadays we have fifteen companies and a training center in our directory.\r\nIn this current project we have made a strong commitment  to extend the stay of our students abroad through the new ErasmusPro mobility modality. We want to promote greater integration in the company, better training and also increase employment opportunities.\r\nWe are aware of the ambitious nature of our Project. That is why we have articulated all the necessary mechanisms to achieve the objectives, starting with the adequate selection and preparation of participants and partners, continuing with the correct programming of mobilities, effective monitoring and coordination, and with the evaluation and final dissemination.\r\nOur first mobilities have been and are being successful, well programed and coordinated, with very satisfactory results for all parties involved. They are achieving an improvement in the training of the participants and, what is more important, they are implying a decisive impulse to the employability of the students, with good results of labor insertion. With this third project we are determined to continue on the same path of growth and improvement of all people and entities taking part in it.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049227_2"], [2016, "VIOLIN NET MAKING", "Andrea Ortona", 23385.0, 6, 9, "This project has been promoted by the Department of Violin making of the Music Conservatory Juan Crisostomo Arriaga of Bilbao, the only shool in Spain which teaches Luthierie (Building and Restoration of bowed string instruments -violin, viola and violoncelo-, Professional Qualifications level III ). The Department of Education of the Basque Government has promoted the renewal and adaptation of these teachings to current needs and future challenges, which are the improvement of quality and standing, to achieve the quality standards of the best European schools, which will increase the chances of employability of our students, main aim of our activity. In order to overcome their difficulties in employability, in 2013 we started an ambitious plan to improve the training quality of our students with a new curriculum, the improvement of  the skills of teachers, the provision of sufficient human, material and financial resources, job training in qualified workshops, etc. Likewise,  for this employment  purpose we are developing another line of action: the recognition of such status by the professionals, both companies and professional musicians. In short, a strategic plan so that quality and standing are our hallmark for 2020. We have the support and encouragement of the Department of Education of the Basque Government and the full involvement of the headmistress team of the Conservatory. Together we have the resources and capacity to carry out the  requested KA102 actions. With a proactive attitude, we take this dynamic as of vital importance to the development and progress of our project, which will continue in the same line even if funding and coverage through the Erasmus + program is not achieved. This is the added value of our project: the human capital drivingit, that believes in what is doing, with great effort and enthusiasm. For that purpose, we request 9 mobilities -5 for students' job training in companies abroad, 1 for staff training and 3 for expert teaching staff. With all of them we hope to improve the professional skills of our students, and place it in the zone of influence of the companies in Europe which stand for quality and prestige, thus increasing their employability. We count on the collaboration of companies and self employed professionals of great quality and prestige in the area, with passion for the craft, vocation for improvement and innovation, to share knowledge and resources and to establish cooperation networks. They are a guarantee in terms of training quality for the participants in the mobilites. They provide both prestige and connections in the sector. We have established the selection mechanisms so the participants meet the adequate requirements for the mobilities to be successful for all parties involved. Also, we have designed the plan of preparation of the participants, communication between the different parties involved in the project, assessment of the processes and results as well as to carry out the diffusion of the actions and achievements, fundamental to ensure success, quality, recognition and prestige. We also have structured, the organization of resources, coordination and decision-making, and the distribution of roles and responsibilities. Leadership and project management will be in hands of the Mobility Commission, constituted by the headmistress team of the Conservatory , the head of the Violin Making Department and project coordinator. We expect an extraordinarily positive impact not only on the students but on all participants and agents involved in the project. In fact, we are already detecting it in the preliminary moves and contacts for mobility. The process of dialogue with partners has created a dynamic of cooperation, involvement in projects of improvement and innovation, sharing of knowledge, in short, a very desired synergy between schools, companies and self employed professionals that will generate interesting and rewarding new projects. All this wanted and wished impact will not happen after these first mobilities are finished but they will lead the way in that direction and in mid-term (2020) we will be in a place we can not even envision at the present moment, as each step is opening new and unexpected doors.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024500_7"], [2017, "VIOLIN NET DEVELOPING", "Andrea Ortona", 22961.0, 4, 9, "VIOLIN NET DEVELOPING is the  continuation of the Violin Net Making (KA102-2016) project.
