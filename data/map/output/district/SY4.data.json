For the employees of the future, for pupils and for teachers, influencer and trainer this subject and the social skills will be also most important. But we see that science mainly is teached to young people in schools using the methods of formal education. On the other hand pupils, trainers, influencers and teachers come to outdoor centres and looking for active-oriented methods. Companies are looking for workers with social skills and knowledge in natural science. Young people want to increase their knowledge of the culture of other European nations and want to travel and see pupils from other states. Because of this we will make a exchange program by using intercultural, outdoor, environmental and experience education and active-oriented methods. The innovative idea is that not only whole school classes will take part in this project, but 5-6 pupils from different schools from Germany, the U.K., Croatia (as a new member of the EU) and France. Germany and France are used in partnership activities for many years, the partnership with Croatia and the U.K. are new. First there is a teach the teacher program so that teachers from different schools and nations come together, learning active-oriented methods, use a common language (english) and get knowing a lot of the different cultures and of new teaching methods. They also get knowledge to improve their own competences. The second step are the student exchanges - two a year for three years - so there is a lot of sustainability. The network and partnership between the partners will be strengthened. The students increase their knowledge of the culture of other nations - so they can easily travel to other countries, also as an employee. The students increase their own competences for natural science and social skills, so they will be interesting for employers. The students and all participants will find out the European ideas and will be interested for the E.U. and for political activities and engagement. So there is a big value for Europe. Because more than 300 participants will take part in the project. \r\nTo realize this aims formal (school) and non-formal partners will work together for three years.

Recent research shows that start-up rates increase by as much as 20% when entrepreneurship lessons are provided in schools. \r\n\r\nThe GEE (Green Entrepreneurship Europe) project brings together the twin necessities of a green economy and increased entrepreneurship that provides meaningful jobs and restores our natural wealth. GEE will improve the capacity of schools to teach the competencies and skills for young people to take an active role in the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work. GEE has been identified by the partners as a response to the need for a pan-European response to building the green economy, a belief shared by our project schools that have identified entrepreneurship education as a priority.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of GEE is \u2018to improve the key competencies and skills of young people to take an active role in building the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work.\u2019 We will achieve this through linked specific objectives:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve the capacity of schools to connect learning with the world of work within the context of building a green economy.\r\n\u2022 Provide pupils with a range of meaningful real-world experiences linking the classroom with business and entrepreneurship.\r\n\u2022 Develop the skills and competencies of pupils to rethink business models in-line with the need to build a green economy.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the ability of teachers to teach entrepreneurship.\r\n\u2022 Increase the sharing of educational resources for schools across Europe.\r\n\u2022 This will result in new shared green entrepreneurship resources to support schools throughout the EU. \r\n\u2022 Share and enhance good practice in integrating sustainable development into business thinking.\r\n\r\nIn delivering the specific objectives listed above we will work with 15 associate secondary schools in five countries, 30 teachers and approximately 375 pupils. Through dissemination and exploitation activities we aim to reach a further 125 secondary schools, impacting 3125 pupils, and 250 teachers as well as education providers and local education departments. The project results will be freely available as open online resources during and beyond the project.\r\n\r\nThe overall impact of GEE will be to improve the competencies and skills of young people to take an active role in building the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work. Pupils will benefit from entrepreneurial learning, developing business knowledge, essential skills and attitudes including creativity, initiative, tenacity, teamwork, understanding of risk and a sense of responsibility. This is the entrepreneurial mind-set that helps entrepreneurs transform ideas into action and also significantly increases employability.\r\n\r\nGEE blends two learning approaches: learning outside the classroom and real world learning. Learning is embedded through student\u2019s direct contact with business and entrepreneurs. We will connect schools with local businesses and entrepreneurs so that they can work together to develop green business plans and ideas for new products based on reality rather than fantasy. \r\n\r\nGEE methods develop entrepreneurial solutions that support a green and sustainable economy. To achieve this it uses the natural world as a metaphor and measure for sustainability. Outdoor learning helps pupils understand how nature works and the key operating principles. For example in nature waste from one process is food for another creating a virtuous cycle rather than the linear take-make-dump found in traditional business models. GEE applies these principles from nature to business through creating entrepreneurship ideas. Pupils use natural principles to explore what some businesses are already achieving (GEE case studies), work with real businesses and entrepreneurs through our Coffee House Challenge Events, and finally develop their own business ideas and plans which are shared with local business.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the activities developed for pupils, we will offer online and face-to-face support for teachers and schools, and disseminate the results widely through teacher seminars, conferences and a project website.", "http://www.field-studies-council.org", "Field Studies Council", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013501_coordinator"], [2014, "Erziehung zur Eigenverantwortlichkeit zur V\u00f6lkerverst\u00e4ndigung unter Einbezug von outdoor science als M\u00f6glichkeit der Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsentwicklung", "Field Studies Council", 6077.0, 2, 3, "The Anton Fugger Realschule Babenhausen want to have five mobilitys for Teacher trainings in the next two years.

The\ntools will be applied to a new process for the recycling of coloured and layered PET into food contact applications that cannot be processed by current PET recycling facilities, a resource worth up to \u20ac700 million per annum. The project results will accelerate the development of new recycling processes for the wider food contact materials\nmarket and provide quality assurance for converters and end-users of recycled products applications for food contact thereby overcoming barriers and expanding this high value recycling market. There is an estimated 7.7 million tonnes of plastic that is not recycled in Europe, which is mostly packaging, that could be if technology and infrastructure were in place to do so. The value of this resource in food contact packaging could be up to \u20ac7.7 billion. The market demand is there as shown by the current price of recycled PET for food contact applications which is equal to that of virgin PET. This pricing is driven by the strong demand for food contact\nrecyclates from packaging end-users, especially the supermarkets, that are concerned about their corporate image and promoting their environmental responsibilities. The advancements over the state of the art are:\n\uf0b7 A post-market challenge test for validation of recycled food contact materials with 100% reliability\n\uf0b7 A post-process validation quality protocol for assuring the efficacy of plastics recycling processes for food contact applications with 100% reliability\n\uf0b7 Development of a process to recycle the 700,000 tonnes per year of currently unrecyclable coloured and layered PET that cannot be processed by existing PET recycling facilities for food contact packaging\n\uf0b7 In-line monitoring for process quality control to indentify contaminants from oxo-degradable additives, biodegradable plastics, bis-phenol A, and non-food contact compliant levels of chemical contamination\nTo meet the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/EC, and improve sustainability, Europe must reuse waste plastics in large high value applications. The largest and highest value market for recycled plastics is packaging, especially in food contact applications; EC 282/2008 makes this possible, SuperCleanQ will enable SMEs to take advantage of this market opportunity.", null, 1992833.0, 5, 12, "SUPERCLEANQ", "http://www.supercleanq.eu/", "http://www.rapra.net", null, "fp7_101014_998803569"]]}}, "5HE": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "PI-KEM LIMITED*", 1041.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2016_60478"], [2017, "PI-KEM LIMITED*", 341.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2017_50684"], [2016, "PI-KEM LIMITED*", 292.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2016_51282"]]}}}}
