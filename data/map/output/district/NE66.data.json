The school partners are secondary schools which are facing student dropout and motivation issues. The main aim of this project is to incite the students\u2019 interest in languages (foreign languages and their own national languages) through a creative and innovative approach, using the arts (music and performing arts) and new communication technologies. The idea is to have students from five different regions in Europe work side by side and then, most importantly, carry out a collective music show together, ultimately creating a music video which would be watched and promoted on a video sharing website. The project will be split up into different phases allowing the students to use their skills and explore the arts and humanities in an inclusive and interactive manner: choosing the melodies; writing lyrics and working on lyrics in one\u2019s language and in the partners\u2019 languages; composing; singing and playing instruments; creating a show and a choreography; working collaboratively, using information and technology each step of the way; having live performances and videos made by students from different countries, gathered for that purpose; video editing, creating music videos, working on subtitles; and, last but not least, sharing and promoting the final project representing the partners\u2019 schools and the European commission.This project has many goals and each one is propping up the others: (1) boosting the way foreign languages are taught by getting rid of classroom constraints and enjoying the use of languages while working on achieving a common project; (2) making the national language more appealing by working on texts the students can relate to more easily; (3) getting dropout students, or students lacking interest in school, involved in an project that can bring about excitement, enthusiasm and happiness \u2013 this project being more particularly aimed at students with such a profile; (4) encompassing the whole school community (including all options and vocational classes); (5) going beyond the boundaries of a local school community in order to contribute to the feeling of belonging to a European project community; (6) relying on teenagers\u2019 infatuation with social network sites in order to take into account what is needed to have a successful music video (editing, promotion).The expected results more or less match the goals set above and respectively include (1) improving language skills, learning more about our European counterparts, and creating a cross-border friendship network; (2) increasing the students\u2019 motivation to get a better grip of their national language; (3) reinvigorating the subjects of arts and languages \u2013 a result of the students\u2019 willingness to participate in the project (acquiring language skills will undoubtedly improve learning skills in general); helping students with learning difficulties/ behavioural problems build up their self-esteem by acknowledging their talents; (4) bringing down classroom boundaries within a school, promoting one\u2019s school and sharing one\u2019s pride with friends and family; (5) overcoming national prejudice related to people\u2019s misconceptions, and promoting the sense of a European identity; (6) acquiring the ability to use and understand the tools provided by NICT (New Information and Communication Technologies). This project started last September through a partnership on the eTwinning platform, which allowed us to test our concept, learn about our partners, and test our basic premises (its ability to incite enthusiasm among teachers and students). It is designed to make successful cooperation and mutual acquaintances among partners possible. This type of collaboration should thus give way to learning about and sharing partners\u2019 experiences and best practices. Having already been established, these contacts are built to last and will hopefully expand to include other subject areas or other projects. This project was not only designed to increase participants\u2019 cohesion, adults and students alike, but also to show that such a cross-national cultural and educational project can be implemented, thus encouraging others to come up with more innovative ideas for the future.", "http://www.lindisfarne.northumberland.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-024092_3"]]}}, "2NS": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTF", "Alnwick Infirmary", "nhs_RTFDJ"]]}}, "3TN": {"life": {"data": [[2012, "LIFE Little Terns - Improving the conservation status of the little tern in the UK through targeted action at the most important colonies", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 2668804.0, 1334402.0, "The decline in the population of the little tern (<i>Sterna albifrons</i>) in the UK since the 1990s is a cause for concern. The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs. The project will be the first nationally co-ordinated programme of action for the species, working with 29 colonies (about 65% of the total population) in 15 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the Natura 2000 network.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4755", "http://www.littleternproject.org.uk/,", "life_88"]]}}}}
