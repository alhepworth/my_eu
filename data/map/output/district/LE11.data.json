It is inclusive, differentiating by outcome  so that younger pupils, those with special needs, migrants  and those with different learning styles  will be able to take a full part in the project. It will also improve basic skills in pupils as they communicate with each other using a variety of multi media tools. Fairy stories has been chosen as a medium for language learning as all schools use stories as a part of normal teaching, ensuring the project will be easily and fully incorporated in each schools curriculum. There are nine partners,  from Sweden, Czech Republic, Turkey, Greece, England, Portugal, Germany, Croatia and Spain, All the partner schools involved in the project have expertise in different teaching and learning areas and have skills which will be shared with other teachers over the course of three years. The methodology that will be applied in the project is to combine 3 different methods that each in its own way will improve language learning and promote inclusion and integration. By implementing them in a rationale order the methods will interact and amplify the childrens learning process.All participating teachers will learn:1. \"Talk for writing\". This method helps children to internalise the pattern of language required and so develop and improve reading skills. The method enables children to imitate the key language they need for a particular topic orally before they try reading and analysing it. 2. Drama as a way to work with inclusion. \u201cWalking through a story\u201d. 3. \u201cThe reading class\u201d is a method to improve reading comprehension. Here 4 basic strategies are used to comprehend a text; RT (Reciprocal Teaching), TSI (Transactional Strategies Instruction) och QtA (Questioning the Author). To understand a text, the idea is that the reader predict, task questions, sort out uncertainties and to sum up. Each participating school will implement the first method in the classroom in their native language. Strategies and results will be discussed in the project group before moving on to the next method. The new method will build on the already implemented one and in so complement and develop it further. After the third method has been implemented and tried out, the same three methods will be used in the classroom but now in the schools second language. We plan to arrange a learning activity around ICT and the use of multi media in education as a tool for inclusion. ICT will play a big part in the project. Pupils will make cartoons /e books and videos of themselves drawing telling and performing stories and share them with students from other countries using Skype and  E Twinning. They will plan, share and compare their work with pupils from different countries. The project will use existing methods which are backed up by research to work with language learning and inclusion. By developing them further and incorporate them in a bigger system, we will develop a model for how to improve language learning in our schools for children with different needs. On top of that every country shares their expertise and teachers will also share current educational research from their country.As Samuel Johnson said: \u2018The same images, with very little variation, have served all the authors who have ever written.\u2019All pupils will first learn to tell a story orally, initially in their mother tongue, They will walk through the story, draw pictures and use actions and drama to tell a story. Pupils will get to know the structure of the story very well using actions in addition to words. They then begin to tell the story in a foreign language, using the same actions to help them.  Older pupils then transfer the story to print and film all to be shared on e twinning web site. Pupils share their work and perform with each other.After learning to retell many fairy stories, pupils will then innovate and write their own stories, sharing on film, in performances and in print,  with other pupils and parents. The project will finally produce a joint book of stories.  All outcomes will be shared on E-twinning,This project will improve language and second language skills acquisition, improve communication in mother tongue language and second language and equip pupils with the skills needed for them to realise their potential and to play a full part in the Europe of the future. Pupils will have increased fluency in their mother tongue and a foreign language, have improved basic skills in ICT, communication, music and writing. Teachers will all have increased confidence, have learned new language teaching skills and long term partnerships between pupils, teachers and families will have developed.Both pupils and teachers will gain an understanding and tolerance of other cultures and a deeper understanding of educational systems in Europe.", "http://www.cobden.leics.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA219-022146_3"]]}}, "1EU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Compass: Long-Term Human Rights Education Training", "Human Rights & Equalities Charnwood", 77696.0, 8, 8, "This is a long-term training programme, implemented by HREC and European partners, for youth workers and youth leaders from 8 countries (UK, Romania, Poland, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Italy, Lithuania and Finland), focusing on developing participants' competences in Human Rights Education, notably through the use of  Council of Europe's educational resources, mainly the Compass HRE Manual.

In this way, EILEEN project addresses some aspects considered as priorities by the EC, such as entrepreneurial education, and recognition/validation of competences acquired in informal settings. \r\n\r\nEILEEN project proposes a comprehensive approach which foresees the involvement of professionals working in European enterprises and young unemployed: both groups will be trained on how to cope with cultural diversity in the workplace. \r\n\r\nA European course will be organized for at least 18 multipliers in European enterprises who will subsequently apply their new competences and skills in terms of enhancing and validating intercultural competences in their enterprises in the pilot phase.\r\n\r\nTraining courses for a significant number of young unemployed (72-90 participants) will be also organized at national level in the countries involved in the project. Through this learning opportunities young can gain intercultural competencies and have access to information about the main opportunities to work abroad or do internships, also through some specific funding schemes made available by the EC (such as the EYE Platform and others).\r\n\r\nThe intercultural skills gained will be a common knowledge shared by both target groups that they will put into practice together during the piloting phase of the project, when the same enterprises involved in the training course will host a selected group of youth unemployed from abroad (trained on intercultural issues as well) for a period of traineeship. \r\n\r\nThe group of young job seekers that will be selected to do an internship abroad during the piloting phase will have also the opportunities to be directly involved in a business project, putting into practice their new intercultural skills and, at the same time, acquiring new entrepreneurial competences. \r\n\r\nFrom the side of enterprises, during the internships, the employees will also have the opportunity to gain mentoring competences, by guiding the trainees in the working activities. Finally, the employers will keep in contact with potential future skilled employees.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the traineeships, all the different competences acquired by both groups during the training and piloting stages (intercultural, entrepreneurial and mentoring competences) will be validated and documented through the innovative LEVEL5 methodology, developed by the network REVEAL with members from 22 European countries to promote, visualise and validate informal and non-formal learning. LEVEL5 will be interconnected via innovative ICT enhanced technologies with EQF and EUROPASS validation and certification systems.\r\n\r\nFinally, the EILEEN approach can become a comprehensive European concept to promote diversity and intercultural awareness in working places.

But these target groups often experience similar obstacles in joining training programmes, for instance they can find themselves denied access to training simply because they have crossed a particular age threshold. There are also similar personal barriers in the two groups, when these people internalize ageist myths believing, for instance, that retraining in unnecessary or that they are too old to retrain. The central assumption in the project is that these two target groups express the same needs in terms of age-sensitive VET and CPD programmes.\r\nThe project will start with a need analysis, to get a clear picture of the actual needs of the main SASSI stakeholders \u2013 senior learners, adult VET and CPD providers, HR managers, employers, and to explore the state of the art on age-responsive education.\r\nIn parallel, a community of interest (SASSI community) will be established, to generate a strong network of stakeholders, and create favorable conditions for a long life of SASSI concepts and products.\r\n\r\nThe community members will make use of a multilingual e-platform on age-responsive education (SASSI HUB). SASSI stakeholders/target groups, will \u201cmeet\u201d there and benefit from many different online features.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is the SASSI methodology and the validation system. In this context of activities, the first step will be the development of the SASSI concept, the theoretical backbone of the project. This means a precise identification of all the aspects that make a VET and CPD learning offer an age-sensitive one. The concept will present effective learning solutions that take into account different learning styles, needs and concerns of senior learners and particular psychological elements of the target group to take into consideration, like level of motivation, confidence, expectations, etc. Then a validation system will be designed, to recognize and certificate the new competences developed by the education providers and to identify the institutional/organisational changes in the enterprises\u2019 CPD system. To this end, the partners will  work on the adaptation of LEVEL5, a well proven methodology that has been set up to validate social and personal competences acquired in informal and non-formal learning.\r\n\r\nOnce the first draft products (methodology, training modules and validation system) have been developed, they will be tested during a well structured piloting phase. \r\nThe piloting will be preceded by a European five-day training course (C1) for VET and CPD providers, to get to know the SASSI methodology and to learn how to apply it in real training contests. At least 2-3 educational professionals will be trained per partner along the SASSI concept.\r\nDuring the course, the participants will be invited to scope out and start to design an educational project to be implemented in their professional practice.

Production of CLIL material: each partner will produce didactic materials in their own language using the CLIL methodology and addressing the topics selected in the previous activity. \r\nA.4. Technical implementation of the training platform prototype: implementation of the new section on the VGCLIL platform with the exercises and materials produced by the partners.\r\nA.5. Piloting: In each partner country, associated partners involved in migrants\u2019 inclusion will provide 20 volunteer participants for the platform testing. Their feedback will be analysed in five national reports and then compiled in one final transnational dossier.\r\nA.6. Production of definitive material: final version of the training platform VGCLIL for migrants, based on the results of the piloting phase.\r\n\r\nThe platform will be open, inclusive and usable, either with the support of a trainer or in complete autonomy, on any device (computer, smartphone and tablet).

The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services.

Two Resolutions of the Education Council (in 2004 and 2008) have highlighted the need for strong guidance services throughout the lifespan to equip citizens with the skills to manage their learning and careers and to lead the transitions between and within education/training and work.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions drew attention to four priority areas: 1. the development of career management skills (CMS); 2. accessibility of services; 3. quality assurance and evidence base for policy and systems development; 4. co-ordination of services. \r\n\r\nMember States were invited to take action to modernise and strengthen their guidance policies and systems, but in many countries CMS frameworks has not been yet developed. Also previous EU projects provided evidences of this differences of approaches and remarked a great need of a shared framework and related training materials and resources, to improve learning and decision making skills, but also entrepreneurship, at any age.\r\n\r\nThis project is named LEADER to underline the need of people to learn this strategic skills for managing and driving their own careers in a more and more changeable world. Following the report of ELGPN (2012) \u201cLifelong Guidance Policy Development: A European Resource Kit\u201d, is based on some crucial questions on CMS:\r\n\r\n1. What are the competences that citizens of all ages need in order to effectively manage their career in a lifelong perspective? 2. How can such competences be organised within a framework that is meaningful in their substance and in developmental terms? 3. How can such competences be taught in educational and other contexts, in ways that, while effectively catering for all citizens, are also sensitive to different life development challenges, and the specific concerns of groups and individuals with diverse social, economic, cultural and other needs? 4. How can different providers work together to offer CMS programmes more effectively, in ways that make the best use of their specialised knowledge of the worlds of education, training, and employment? 5. Which pedagogical strategies and resources are most effective in enabling the mastery of career management competences, and how can such mastery be assessed and accredited in ways that support career development across different life stages?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this projects aims at the following actions:\r\n\r\n1 - identify and develop teaching and learning approaches, methods and resources that effectively support the development of CMS as transversal key competences ;\r\n\r\n2 - develop assessment and evaluation methods and practices that improve the quality of learning of Career Management Skills\r\n\r\n3 - identify and develop the integration of the European dimension in teaching and learning CMS.\r\n\r\nThis project also aims at providing the whole professional comunity of career guidance practitioners with useful tools to implement CMS, even with a coherent and consistent use of mod\r\n\r\nStarting from some positive experiences already tested from the consortium, this project aims at improving the quality in the learning and guidance processes, developing key skills of practitioners and experimenting innovative tools and methodologies with the use of new technologies.

Evidence shows that students\u2019 learning is often of a procedural nature: students do not develop in-depth conceptual understandings through which they can relate mathematics to other disciplines and the world around them.  Traditional forms of teaching reinforce this status quo.  We seek to improve teaching through inquiry-based approaches that allow students to achieve a more conceptually-based understanding of mathematics, more appropriate for  solving problems in engineering, science, and in the labour market. \r\n\r\nThis should be achieved through\r\n\u2022 clear principles of inquiry-based teaching-learning and associated models of practice;\r\n\u2022 teaching innovation in which lecturers engage in inquiry into their teaching practice and learn from critical reflection and feedback;\r\n\u2022 observation and analysis of teaching events to provide evidence of outcomes for students;\r\n\u2022 design of mathematical units and inquiry-based tasks for use by lecturers and their students in face to face or blended learning settings;\r\n\u2022 induction workshops and other meetings to professionalize lecturers to apply and promote inquiry-based teaching and learning in face to face and blended learning settings;\r\n\u2022 synthesis of models of inquiry-based practice that can be used to promote students\u2019 conceptual of mathematics in STEM education.\r\n\r\nIn all partner universities, project participants teach mathematics or statistics and seek to innovate in their practice. The partners are members of national and international consortia, through which practices are shared and innovations discussed, analysed, challenged and critiqued. Some have experience of mathematical unit and task design and blended learning approaches using IT and digital media. Some have experience of providing workshops and seminars to induct new lecturers into effective teaching practices. Some are familiar with inquiry-based practices, having used them in their own developmental activity with their students.  All partners are passionately committed to innovation and creativity in enhancing teaching practices for the benefit of students who learn mathematics conceptually, relationally and applicably.\r\n \r\nWe will draw on our experiences and commitment to\r\na) Communicate sound inquiry-based principles of teaching and learning of mathematics;\r\nb) Develop our own teaching, and that of our colleagues, through communities of inquiry in local settings;\r\nc) Design inquiry-based tasks and mathematical units using digital media for blended learning in providing resources for mathematics teaching and learning;\r\nd) Design induction workshops and seminars introducing lecturers to inquiry-based practices in teaching and learning;\r\ne) Extend the model of inquiry-based learning to modelling activities which enable students to engage with real problems in industry and science.\r\nf) Design evaluator procedures and integrate evaluation into the activity itself, in order to gain a realistic view of what the project is achieving.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be developmental and inquiry-based.  We employ a model of inquiry in three layers:\r\n1)  Inquiry in mathematics between lecturers and students using specially designed inquiry-based tasks;\r\n2)  Inquiry into innovative approaches to teaching mathematics with reflective (critical) analyses of teaching practice and its impact on students\u2019 conceptual understanding.\r\n3)  Inquiry as a developmental approach to improving practice in the other two layers, taking an objective approach to gathering and analysing data from the observed activity as well as feeding back what is learned to the ongoing practices.\r\n\r\nWe expect \r\nto engage mathematics lecturers  in our institutions and countries in inquiry-based teaching ;\r\nto create a digital body of inquiry-based mathematics teaching materials for use across Europe, optimised for both advantaged and disadvantaged learners; \r\nto recognise issues and problems which challenge teaching and learning and address them through collaborative inquiry-based exploration;\r\nas more lecturers and students are engaged in inquiry-based teaching-learning, we expect to see, locally, a change in lecturers' and students' recognition of alternative ways of teaching and learning mathematics this change of learning culture will become transnational when outcomes are disseminated, practices shared and principles communicated.\r\n\r\nDisseminating our results and good practice, we contribute to the modernisation of education at universities and to the improvement of professional competences of university lecturers and students across Europe thus addressing the initiative of The European Commission to \u201cimprove the interaction between research and teaching ensuring that teaching is based on state-of-the art knowledge and adequately recognised and that graduates have strong analytical and problem-solving skills.\"", "http://www.lboro.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA203-038887_6"], [2017, "Graduate School Program for International Researchers and Interdisciplinary Training", "LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY", 346378.0, 8, 9, "Context and background\r\nThere are clear challenges in translating the Triple-I ideals of doctoral training as promoted by the Bologna Process and the EU Modernisation Agenda into practical operational models for graduate schools (GS). Graduate SPIRIT stems from a strong desire of the participating GS for Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) to have more adequate instruments for stimulating, organising and managing Triple-I training (understood as a \"international cross-fertilization between disciplines and sectors\") in the dimensions of 1) PhD researchers, 2) supervising teaching staff, 3) doctoral curricula and 4) organisational procedures. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe partners in Graduate SPIRIT have committed to developing innovative and sustainable solutions to these four sets of challenges posed by Triple-I training at the four dimensions mentioned: of PhD researchers, supervising and teaching staff, curriculum and organisation. They aim to:\r\n\u2022 Provide a systematic Inventory of current policies, procedures and practices to promote interdisciplinarity and diversity in the participating GS. \r\n\u2022 Identify a full range of best practices for more detailed description and analysis, and combine them into a \u2018Blueprint\u2019 for successful interdisciplinary and diverse GS.\r\n\u2022 Develop and test innovative instruments Triple-I training in course and curriculum design, leading to an \u2018Innovation menu\u2019 from which individual GS can pick and combine according to their needs.\r\n\u2022 Engagement of a wide range of GS and policy makers in and outside the EU by opening and sharing results, using dedicated interactive instruments for data- and knowledge sharing.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants;\r\nThe SPIRIT consortium consists of nine national GS of the SSH who together reflect the European diversity of these Graduate Schools; they comprise a mix of new and established GS varying in size from big to medium and small, and differing in terms of their funding and organisational structure. They cover a wide set of European countries, and bring in networks outside Europe as well, from both developing and developed countries. In addition, the SPIRIT consortium works with the US Council of Graduate Schools as a partner to source expertise from. \r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe activities undertaken to realize the goals of Graduate SPIRIT consist of collecting information through desk research, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups (Inventory); transforming this information into sustainable tools for managing Triple-I training ( Blueprint); developing, implementing and evaluating innovations with regards to the Triple-I training of and by PhD researchers, staff, curricula and organisation (Innovation Menu); sharing these tools and innovations with the project partners and a wider network of stakeholders through engagement activities and targeted dissemination (Engagement).  \r\n\r\nProject methodology\r\nErasmus University coordinates the project through a Critical Path Method, a step-by-step project management technique for which a detailed Gantt forms the backbone. Each individual project partner shares a coordinating role with another project partner for specific activities, thus dividing work and responsibility equally. The project leader monitors progress and quality of the different activities and reports every four months at a dedicated team meetings. A detailed strategy for handling project risks is in place. \r\n\r\nResults and impact \r\nThe project uses a Chain of Impact Model to realize maximum results and impact. The Blueprint and Innovation Menu constitute the key results of SPIRIT. They will be directly beneficial to: better training and supervision provisions for PhD researchers; a wider intellectual and skill set and a greater sensitivity of staff to the interdisciplinary and diverse classroom; to more consistent and comparable interdisciplinary curricula; to a better facilitation and organisational anchoring of these GS in the mother organisation. Through a detailed, systematic engagement and dissemination plan, the impact of the project will extend to other graduate schools in other countries, to university networks and to EU and international policy bodies and will provide a crucial contribution to further policies. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits\r\nThe project will be an essential contribution to the current discussions, developments and policies around doctoral training in the EU, US and Latin America.

However, the control systems for energy generation, energy utilisation, energy storage and electric vehicle charging work are currently separate from each other. This results in high costs and CO2 emissions due to energy inefficiencies.\u00a0  Electric vehicles are mostly powered by fossil fuel generated electricity. At the same time, renewable energy is inefficiently utilised because production and demand are not synchronised across the city.\u00a0  The project CleanMobilEnergy will integrate various renewable energy sources, storage devices, electric vehicles and optimisation of energy consumption through one unique smart energy management system. The development of this intelligent Energy Management System (iEMS) will increase the economic value of renewable energy and significantly reduce CO2 emissions. The iEMS will assure the smart integration through interoperability based on open standards for data flows and analysis tools.\u00a0  CleanMobilEnergy will make it possible for renewable energy sources to be used locally, so electric vehicles can be charged with 100 % renewable energy offered at an optimum price. Electrical energy from the grid will only be required when prices are low or renewable energy sources are not available, the iEMS monitors and optimises the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  One generic transnational iEMS will be adapted to the 4 specific city pilots in Arnhem, London, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Nottingham. These pilots range from small towns to large cities. The 4 city pilots cover different types of renewable energy, storage and electric vehicles as well as different contexts and diverse city environments.  The 4 CME City Pilots are:  1) Arnhem: medium size city, large renewable energy production, large storage in industrial area;\n2) Nottingham: medium size city, large renewable energy production, medium size storage, electric vehicles and bi-directional chargers in a controlled area (depot);\n3) London: large city, large renewable energy production at multiple locations, large storage, electric vehicles and bi-directional chargers in controlled areas with separate grid (depot);\n4) Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: small city, small renewable energy production, storage facilities and electric bikes in residential area.  The city pilots will utilise different state-of-the art storage media in various environments, which are representative of North West Europe and are easily replicated in other cities across Europe. Specifically in London and Nottingham, for example, electric vehicles themselves will be used to power the buildings and depot by using innovative bi-directional chargers controlled by the integrated energy management system iEMS. In Arnhem, on the other hand, renewable energy will be supplied to ships in the harbour adjacent to its industrial. These pilots were chosen to represent a wide range of city sizes and environments, which are essential to developing a widely applicable system for future implementation across Europe.", 1483228800000, 1640908800000, 101727.0, "nweurope_12_4"]]}}, "5AS": {"esif": {"data": [[1491004800000, 1535673600000, "Journey to Work Plus", "Charnwood (Trading as Twenty Twenty)", "The proposed model adopts the specialist skill sets of three organisations, TwentyTwenty, The Y and Futures, to deliver an intensive and focused package of support to assist young people with complex needs to successfully secure sustainable employment.
