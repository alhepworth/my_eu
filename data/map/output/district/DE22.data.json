Due to deterioration, regular maintenance works are necessary to seal the concrete cracks and restore durability. In Europe, infrastructures such as tunnels and earth retaining walls alone cost approximately 5 billion EUR per year. Self-healing strategies (particularly bacterial-based self-healing) are regarded as a promising solution to reduce the high maintenance and repair cost of concrete infrastructures. It is believed if self-healing concrete had been used for all these structures, up to 120 million EUR could be saved annually on their maintenance. The research to date has tended to focus on the self-healing process in air or water environment. However, infrastructures (i.e. bridges, buildings, tunnels) are built on or in the ground, where part of their concrete structures are inevitably embedded in soil environment with all sorts of ground conditions such as different types of soil, saturation regimes, and chemical exposures. It is not clear if the process of self-healing is efficient within concrete elements exposed to such complicated ground conditions. \nThe project aims to explore the efficiency of the bacterial-based self-healing (bio-hydrogels) in underground concrete structures.

Lifelong guidance has been receiving increasing attention at both European and national levels. Two Resolutions of the Education Council (in 2004 and 2008) have highlighted the need for strong guidance services throughout the lifespan to equip citizens with the skills to manage their learning and careers and to lead the transitions between and within education/training and work.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions drew attention to four priority areas: 1. the development of career management skills (CMS); 2. accessibility of services; 3. quality assurance and evidence base for policy and systems development; 4. co-ordination of services. \r\n\r\nMember States were invited to take action to modernise and strengthen their guidance policies and systems, but in many countries CMS frameworks has not been yet developed. Also previous EU projects provided evidences of this differences of approaches and remarked a great need of a shared framework and related training materials and resources, to improve learning and decision making skills, but also entrepreneurship, at any age.\r\n\r\nThis project is named LEADER to underline the need of people to learn this strategic skills for managing and driving their own careers in a more and more changeable world. Following the report of ELGPN (2012) \u201cLifelong Guidance Policy Development: A European Resource Kit\u201d, is based on some crucial questions on CMS:\r\n\r\n1. What are the competences that citizens of all ages need in order to effectively manage their career in a lifelong perspective? 2. How can such competences be organised within a framework that is meaningful in their substance and in developmental terms? 3. How can such competences be taught in educational and other contexts, in ways that, while effectively catering for all citizens, are also sensitive to different life development challenges, and the specific concerns of groups and individuals with diverse social, economic, cultural and other needs? 4. How can different providers work together to offer CMS programmes more effectively, in ways that make the best use of their specialised knowledge of the worlds of education, training, and employment? 5. Which pedagogical strategies and resources are most effective in enabling the mastery of career management competences, and how can such mastery be assessed and accredited in ways that support career development across different life stages?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this projects aims at the following actions:\r\n\r\n1 - identify and develop teaching and learning approaches, methods and resources that effectively support the development of CMS as transversal key competences ;\r\n\r\n2 - develop assessment and evaluation methods and practices that improve the quality of learning of Career Management Skills\r\n\r\n3 - identify and develop the integration of the European dimension in teaching and learning CMS.\r\n\r\nThis project also aims at providing the whole professional comunity of career guidance practitioners with useful tools to implement CMS, even with a coherent and consistent use of mod\r\n\r\nStarting from some positive experiences already tested from the consortium, this project aims at improving the quality in the learning and guidance processes, developing key skills of practitioners and experimenting innovative tools and methodologies with the use of new technologies.

In March 2016 a resolution of the European Parliament was published. This resolution request, from the European Union, sought for equality and against discrimination of LGBTI- people: \u201cIn a key report (\u2026) on Gender mainstreaming in the work of the European Parliament, the European Parliament made a strong call to include \u2018the rights, perspectives and well-being of LGBTIQ people\u2019 in all gender mainstreaming activities.\u201dThe relevance and challenges of these issues are evident on different levels: nationwide controversy about the incorporation of the topic of homosexuality into school curricula, the controversial discussion about the implementation of gay marriage, homophobic attacks and bullying (particularly at a young age), the outing of and dealing with homosexual migrants, homophobic behavior in sport, homophobic legislation of LGBTI-people in Russia and likewise many African countries, with images published and distributed by the mass media helping fuel it further.The aim of this project is to make a contribution towards better understanding homosexuality. This is true equally for the areas of tertiary as well as secondary education. Taking a cross-sectoral approach, cooperation between eight countries is proposed for the project, with one university and one secondary school participating from each country respectively. The project thus addresses students and lecturers at teaching colleges and universities, teachers in secondary education and students at secondary schools. Greater understanding is hoped to be achieved through resources which will be created by the project team and then implemented, tested and evaluated within the relevant institutions.A comprehensive assessment and a comparative study is to be published, including images related to homosexuality in the participating countries, and the mission, aims and content of gender-appropriate behaviors in schools (for example: the topic of homosexuality in the training of teachers, in curricula and teaching resources for secondary schools) and of complementing non-school initiatives in other educational institutions. A curriculum module \u2018Gender & Homosexuality\u2019, covering general diversity of lifestyles, sexual identities, the question of coming-out and sexual well-being, is to be established across target groups and will form the basis of a school project over a period of several days.

The resources will continue to be available (indefinitely and without limitation); through the development of applications thus their transparent dissemination is ensured far beyond the duration of the project itself.The project intends to make an active contribution towards establishing intercultural dialogue towards gender equality, and, last but not least, acceptance and better understanding of homosexuality. Apart from its comprehensive geographical reach across the diverse historic backgrounds of the partner countries, the project is enriched especially by our Turkish partner.
