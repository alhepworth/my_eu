These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. \n\nThe experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=81", "http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk,", "life_75"]]}}, "3NL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Year Long Mentorship and support Program for 'freelance' Trainers sharing  NVC and Restorative Processes  across the UK.", "Giraffe Social Enterprises CIC", 39446.0, 2, 2, "This Year Long Mentorship and support Program for 'freelance' Trainers sharing  NVC and Restorative Processes  across the UK arises out of the ongoing work of GSE as a needs-focused community organization and is intended to meet two sets of needs. On the one hand, there is at present no system of support or guidance for non-certified trainers and sharers of nonviolent communication (NVC) in the UK; GSE is ideally place to fill this gap with our existing profile and competence as an initiator of innovative training and outreach projects. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to forge and expand national, cross-border and inter-cultural links within the wider NVC community as we face the threat of Brexit and increasing divisions in society. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives therefore center around two strands: to support individual participants to become better trainers and sharers of NVC within their local communities and to strengthen ties between peers in different European countries, both at the new trainer and experienced mentor levels. Bridging these strands is our ever-present focus on human experience as members of a living community rather than as isolated individuals. Participants will have an intense experience of living needs-focused community at a 9 day International Intensive Training (IIT) in Denmark and a continuing experience of it through the inter-group contacts during the rest of the year. Both aspects will feed into the future ability and resourcefulness of our participants to return to their own communities the benefits of the learning they will achieve during the year through a 'cascade' learning model.\r\n\r\nWe have accepted 15 applicants for the project coming from all over the UK, including 5 men, 9 women and one of undefined gender. All are currently sharing NVC in a range of diverse contexts such as education, mental health services, LBGT communities, families and more whilst not having been certified as NVC trainers with CNVC. \r\n\r\nThe activities to be undertaken include monthly Skype calls, face to face meetings at least 3 times in the year,  individual mentoring with GSE staff, regular peer support exchanges, the 9 day residential IIT in Denmark. We will also offer residential weekend trainings in the UK during the course of the year and in the latter part of the project we our project participants will embark on individual dissemination activities including workshops, group facilitation and other NVC related events within their communities and sphere of interest.  In the course of the project, peer support will be central for the development and continuous assessment of individual goals, while mentoring from GSE staff will also be available as required. Group gatherings will be used to celebrate achievements, mourn setbacks and consolidate community involvement. Written evaluations will also form part of the methodology of the project.\r\n\r\nThe key results we expect are a cohort of better equipped and resourced NVC trainers and sharers who are ready to take on leadership roles within the wider NVC community as well as the development of stronger and more resilient networks both within the UK and across borders within which these trainers can continue to develop further.  In the long term this will lead to better and more widespread penetration of nonviolent values and practice in the participants' different spheres of agency, to greater involvement in supporting local communities and to the expansion of the European NVC network.", "http://www.giraffesocialenterprises.org.uk", "Giraffe Social Enterprises CIC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-035665_coordinator"], [2014, "International IntensiveTraining Nonviolent Communication", "Giraffe Social Enterprises CIC", 26109.0, 2, 2, "Stichting De Kleine Giraf (SDKG) focuses on improving the life of children in health, education and dreams. The foundation is a platform that supports projects that enable this, including training of people working with children in education and health care. We use the method Nonviolent Communication of Marshall Rosenberg. His approach is aiming at mutual understanding and trust, and connection from the heart. The tools used in the methodology are Empathic Listening, and working with a 4 steps scheme, that shows us a way to translate judgements into feelings and needs which results in a request (instead of a demand). In this way people will experience a (compassionate) connection with themselves and with others.\r\nSDKG wants to strengthen the professional development of its trainers, expand on the number of certified trainers and to build a network with their international partners.  \r\nThe participants of this project will be active NVC trainers in the SDKG. They want to further develop, strengthen en deepen their skills and become professional NVC trainers in this field with a commitment to sharing and disseminating learning within their local communities. One of the requirements to become a certified trainer is to live (attend) an International Intensive Training (IIT).\r\nAn IIT is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me for any NVC practitioner. This 9 day training is led by 4 accredited and highly experienced NVC trainers. During those days all participants will be in 4 different workshops per day, including their own, and engage in 2 community circles each day for further personal development and professional learning, and will highly benefit from the inter-cultural exchanges and networking. The Lead trainer Robert Gonzalez is well known throughout the world for his compassionate communication and deep understanding of the NVC concept. \r\nBefore the start of the IIT participants will make a Personal Development Plan, prepare a NVC workshop together that they will offer at the IIT, and follow a workshop on Inter-cultural awareness.\r\nAfter the IIT they will meet for a mid-evaluation, organise ideas that have been picked up at the IIT and plan a set of workshops to be given in the Netherlands. At least one training will be offered to peer volunteers at SDKG and each participant will organize and facilitate a workshop or training to an organisation within the target group of SDKG. In addition they will write an article sharing their experiences on several websites national and international, and share experiences with EU partners met during the IIT, and the UK partner organisation. This way we will disseminate and share the new knowledge and at the same time SDKG will become more widely known. Each participant will write an evaluation of the project within their own Personal Development Plan to conclude the project.\r\nBesides the strengthening of our trainers network by supporting them in their path to become certified NVC trainers, SDKG is also eager to participate in this project as we would like to raise our profile:  we have the ambition to become an European Platform for expertise on NVC in Child and Youth care organisations. We already have strong connections with our colleagues in Sweden. We want to share our experiences at the IIT in order to connect with colleagues in the UK, Germany and other European countries. \r\nWe expect to see a breakthrough in the personal and professional growth of the participants. We estimate that 4 of the participants will certify as a NVC trainer in the next 12 months. For others it might take longer as NVC is about internalising a new way of living, which is a process that cannot be rushed. They all take an essential step on their certification path and gain new and deepening knowledge about NVC.\r\nThe reason for SDKG to introduce NVC in schools and other child related organisations is to contribute on solving social problems, like violence and bullying at schools, drop-outs (children leaving school early), and teachers who fall out. This is a serious economic and a social problem. Also the national worry of young teens drinking alcohol can be approached by introducing NVC in families and Youth work. \r\nWe also want to introduce new ways of education to an organically changing society. We would like education and health care organisations to support each young person in living with their own wishes and ambitions by learning NVC, a language that focuses on inner motivations of each of us, a beautiful starting point to make choices that matter to each of us. \r\nThrough NVC we want to offer people tools which enhance mutual understanding so that they can enjoy a place where all human needs are equally important and we aim at getting these needs met.", "http://www.giraffesocialenterprises.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA104-000354_1"]]}}}}
