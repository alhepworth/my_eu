Their successful inclusion into the school system of their adopted country is vital to the long term outcomes of the child and can play an important part in integrating their wider families into society.  Gardening and farming are an international language and this project seeks to use school gardening and farming projects as a tool for inclusion.  The objective is to develop a model for inclusion using the best practice from six European partner schools that can be replicated elsewhere in a variety of settings.\r\n\r\nThe six secondary schools are from the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and the French Caribbean.  It includes one residential secondary school for special needs pupils.  Each school will take it in turn to host a short term teaching and learning visit during which students will participate in collaborative gardening or farming activities designed to be inclusive and to build pupils self-confidence and self-esteem.  Between exchange visits pupils will undertake collaborative school based activities where the results are shared.  These will include competitions to grow the tallest sunflower and the largest pumpkin!\r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact of this project is that pupils will feel more included in school which means they are happier, more self-confident and have greater self-esteem.  This will mean that their academic attainment will be improved and they will have better life chances.  For teaching staff and schools the impact will be that they are better able to offer a more inclusive education to their most disadvantaged students.  The principal outcome will be a guide to best practice based on international collaboration that can be used to inform other projects.", "http://www.huntershill.org.uk", "Tile Cross Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036531_4"]]}}, "4AL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1322697600000, 1385769600000, "Development of a Novel Treatment for Clostridium Difficile", "Cross-Check Systems Ltd", "'We wish to exploit the need for effective treatment for nosocomial diarrhoea especially that caused by Clostridium difficile\n\ndisease (CDD). Patients treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are at greatest risk of CDD diarrhoea and many of those\n\naffected are hospitalised elderly patients with serious underlying illnesses. Antibiotics can cause disruption of the normal\n\nintestinal flora, an important part of the immune system, leading to an overgrowth of CDD. Currently, some 2350 patients\n\nsuffering from chronic CDD in a number of countries have been treated by faecal bacteriotherapy (FB), using samples\n\ncollected from donors. Although this procedure is reported, in a number of small studies, to be around 90% effective, it is\n\nhazardous, in that infection from the donor could be transmitted to the patient and it involves delivery of faecal samples into\n\nthe duodenum via a nasal probe.\n\nWe propose to treat CDD using a modified FB to restore the patient\u2019s original intestinal flora (employing samples collected\n\nfrom the patients themselves prior to their treatment) We will produce novel enteric-coated capsules, containing processed\n\nfreeze dried colonic flora that can be swallowed by a patient to restore their intestinal flora and immunise them against\n\nfurther infection by CDD.

In the context of global change these tools are increasingly pushed towards and even beyond their design limits (the latter resulting in the first line from the prevailing limitations in spatial and temporal resolution of environmental observations).\n\nFor this project, we propose a rationale stating that only novel, high-frequency/high-resolution environmental monitoring and predictive modelling will yield new process understanding of ecosystem functioning.
