All 6 Missions Locales having signed the partnership agreement possess a significant experience in transnational project management.

Some territories covered by the consortium members benefit from no European mobility action, rural territories being very often disconnected from those plans. This directly impacts their professional career  when searching for a job or qualification and also their chances for equal opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur operation would include 3 operational mobility activities:\r\n\r\nActivity 1 would be for publics with no mobility experience. It would consist of a 10 day immersion (excluding travel days) with a complete accompaniement by 1 accompanying person during the whole stay.\r\nActivity 2 would be for young people with a previous mobility experience. It would consist of a 28 day immersion (excluding travel days) in complete autonomy.\r\nActivity 3 would be for the staff of the Missions Locales participating in the consortium. It would consist of a 10 day immersion (excluding travel days).\r\n\r\nThese activities would include mixed publics and take place simultaneouly in the following countries:  United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Spain, Lithuania and Bulgaria. The consortium members would be involved at the same level in the three activities.\r\n\r\nIn order for those three activities to take place under the best possible conditions, an active partnership involving 6 organisations with transnational mobility experience is established.

A training period is compulsory in their curriculum. The mobilities will last four weeks. An accompanying person will assist the students at the beginning of their training period. That\u2019s why we are asking for 11 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\n\u2018FREE!' focuses on achieving many of our priority objectives: the fight against early school leaving and international openness. Indeed, 'FREE!' will provide the conditions for every student to succeed and will give meaning to their learning process by personalising each trajectory. \u2018FREE!\u2019 will promote their personal, professional and social development. Our priority objective is to help our students continue their studies. We want to improve achievement for all students thanks to European mobility, to help them believe in themselves and in their capabilities so they can start building their own future with a diploma. No pupil shall leave school without qualifications. European mobility will act as an efficient springboard uniting many partners: students, parents, teachers, local authorities and companies.\r\n\r\nFor our students, the added value can be measured at different levels: they have acquired strong cultural benefits, strengthened language skills, specific technical and professional knowledge related to the country, European citizenship-based autonomy development, a greater willingness to access higher education after the mobility, increased employability.\r\n\r\nOur vocational school has gained a broader permanent partnership with European companies, which shows the quality of the work of the teachers and the administrative staff involved in the project, having a great impact on our school's reputation, image and recruitment.\r\n\r\nOur host companies have received new contributions on the French vocational training supplemented by the exchange of knowledge and know-how in different professional fields.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the objectives for the students are to acquire new professional skills: they will be able to exchange practices, implement the acquired know-how, and discover new production and marketing techniques. By producing weekly reports about their activities sent by email, they will improve their computer skills; they will also have a validated training period in compliance with the training framework and curriculum, an enhanced EUROPASS CV and EUROPASS MOBILITY. Furthermore, the beneficiaries will take the international dimension into account when looking for a job, give meaning to their Education, develop new abilities such as adaptability, mobility, curiosity, autonomy. Expected results: an increased self-confidence, better communication skills, a better approach when solving problems and dealing with stressful situations.\r\n\r\nAs far as language and cultural skills are concerned, developing language skills, visiting historical and geographical landmarks in the European partner countries will help our students reach CEFR (Common European Framework) B1 (2nd year) or B1+ level (3rd year) in the following skills: listening, interacting, speaking. They will also take the optional mobility unit, which will be part of their exam. Not only will their mobility enrich their personal school file but it will also enhance their application file for higher education studies.\r\n\r\nOur school aims at increasing partnership work with European companies and improving its image thanks to innovative actions and through the quality of its international openness.
