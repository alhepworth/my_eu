We have high levels of SEN (33%), free school meals (78%) and EAL (87%). We are an increasingly popular school with a growing roll. Pakeman was named National Primary School of the Year in the 2013 Pupil Premium Awards for raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.  We have high expectations of all our pupils and are not complacent. We are constantly striving to improve what we do. Our children achieve well in relation to national expectations at L4+ at KS2. However, our school priority remains to increase the numbers of children attaining higher levels, especially disadvantaged pupils.  Many of our children have very low attainment levels on entry and we have a broad range of provision on offer to support those children who are working below age-related expectations.  However, we would like to match the quality of provision on offer for higher ability pupils to what is already offered to their less able peers. We are always keen to share best practice and to learn from the practice of others. To this end, to date, we have worked collaboratively with a large number of schools, both locally (we are part of a cluster of 17 primary and secondary Islington schools) and nationally.  However, we feel that we lack an international perspective, and this has been highlighted during recent visits to our school by a number of Norwegian schools.  We have helped these schools to organise their visits, to ensure they meet their objectives and stay within their budgets.  We are committed to sharing best practice with other schools, and do this already through providing courses, visits and consultancy.  Having a more European perspective would enable us to better offer this kind of support to other schools.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a greater awareness of what international schools are doing and for participants to learn from these schools' best practice in order to raise the attainment of our more able pupils, especially those who are disadvantaged.\r\nThis project will allow us to send 20 teachers from across the school (including school leaders) to four European countries (Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Spain) to observe good practice with a view to implementing more effective strategies at Pakeman and to developing opportunities for the children in our classrooms to connect with children in the classrooms of other European countries.  We would offer the opportunity for the schools we visit to undertake return visits to us. 16 teachers will be split into 4 groups of 4, accompanied by one of our senior leaders (20 in all), with each group visiting one of the four countries. We already have links with schools in Norway and Portugal and the Global Learning Association (led by Ray Kirtley of the University of Hull) has agreed to help us to organise course at schools in EU member states (Sweden and Spain).  On returning from each trip the group will share their findings with the leadership team and phase leaders, and the information will be evaluated and action plans developed, then shared with the teaching staff, intervention teachers and teaching assistants, in order to drive improvement.  Then, at the end of the project, we will compare and evaluate the results and draw conclusions that will support us to improve our own practice and that we can share with other schools in our cluster and more widely.\r\n\r\nThe courses will include:\r\n- A visit to the education department in the district visited to learn about the national, regional and local education system.\r\n- Visits to a number of local schools to observe practice, talk to practitioners and see the strategies being used on the ground.\r\n- Visits to museums, art galleries and other cultural attractions that schools in the areas use to support and enhance their curricula. \r\n- Return visit to the education department to discuss and evaluate our findings, and prepare for the dissemination of this information to staff in our school and more widely.\r\nThe aims of this project are that staff will:\r\n- develop a greater awareness of international education systems, including similarities to and differences from our own education system\r\n- be motivated and stimulated to try out new ideas and adopt new practice \r\n- be more confident in supporting others to develop their practice\r\n- use an increasing number of and a more varied and effective range of strategies for supporting more able pupils\r\n- be more confident about sharing good practice, within the school and across the cluster of schools and other schools nationally.\r\nIn addition, we believe the project will help us to build and extend opportunities for our children to communicate with their European counterparts (eg. collaborative projects, exchanges, penpals, Skype). \r\nThese aims will all be achieved by the end of the project and in the longer term shared with others.", "http://www.pakemanprimary.co.uk", "Pakeman Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013194_coordinator"]]}}, "6LA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Social Enterpreneurship for Younger's Empowerment", "London Business Partnership Limited", 9329.0, 2, 3, "The aim of this project is to promote the mobility and exchange of young qualified people (those with a university degree or tertiary education), in order to foster initiatives of social entrepreneurship among qualified youngers. These exchanges are aimed to give this target population the skills needed to run their own business as an alternative way to seek employment opportunities. But at the same time, the exchanged skills must empower them to transform their social awareness in a social company.The goal of empowering Young People by means of providing them with entrepreneurial skills to foster social enterprise initiatives gives an answer to the need of empowering young qualified people who might have been marginalized by the economic crisis and are being excluded from economic and social life due to their lack of job opportunities.Priority will be given to those young people with a university degree/tertiary education diploma, holding initiatives or ideas aimed to cover social needs related to education, employment and wellbeing, young population under risk and the protection of the environment.SEYE\u2019s objectives are :1. To help youth qualified people to create social companies aimed to serve the unfulfilled needs of underserved population and other social needs, with a special emphasis on education, employment and wellbeing, young population under risk and the protection of the environment.2. To cover the horizontal mismatch between the qualifications of young people who has completed tertiary education and their entrepreneurial skills3. To provide the participants with a multicultural experience aboard, so that they are able to know how social companies and initiatives operate in another country, which are the Youth policies and needs in some other MS, and which business ideas that are being evolved in other countries could be transferred to their own home countryEEXPECTED RESULTS1. The participants will gain competences (skills) related to entrepreneurship, which constitute a crucial part of the gap between their formal qualifications and the skills they need to initiate a business. Moreover, they will gain skills related to international relations, and soft skills such as interpersonal communicative skills and critical thinking. Also, they will improve verbal skills in a foreign language, and they will eventually have a better understanding of Youth policies across the EU. 2. The partners will gain skills to act in an international environment, being able to improve their management skills and to develop internationalization strategies in the near future. They will also gain knowledge on innovative strategies to recruit the most suitable candidates for programs oriented to improve the skills of young people and/or workers interested in social business initiatives3. The companies that will be hosting the participants will also gain international experience. They will have improved the international dimension of their business activity, and they will have had access to information aimed to design innovative solutions to Youth needs.IMPACT.SEYE expects to have a long-term impact in at least these dimensions:1. Exchanges of experience and information about the avenues through which young people can help to handle and give a solution to social needs, from the most traditional forms of volunteering to more innovative forms of social entrepreneurship.2. Through the activities developed, we expect to contribute to bridge the gap between formal competencies these young people already hold, and the soft competences needed to foster an initiative of social entrepreneurship.3. Young people involved in the exchange will be able to improve their language skills, and they will gain international experience.

But many education systems struggle to provide the language training necessary for migrants to succeed in their new communities. \r\n\r\nMany students with a migrant background are also blocked by language barrier. On average, 64% of first-generation migrant students and 41% of second generation students speak a language at home that is different from the language instruction. \r\nTeachers have a large role to play. Many recognize that handling cultural diversity in class is difficult. Large proportions of teachers in several countries feel they need more professional development in the areas of teaching in a multicultural setting. Children in migrant families are key actors in the process of integration, as they broke communication between members of the host community and their own families. While teachers are critical to migrant students\u00b4 success in schools, so are their parents. \r\n\r\nStudents are better learners when their parents are involved in their education. While migrant parents often have high aspirations for their children, they may face multiple obstacles to becoming involved in their child\u00b4s schooling, including language barriers, insufficient understanding of how schools in the host country function, and lack of time or money to invest in their child\u00b4s education. They also feel alienated and unwelcome, especially if their child has encountered discrimination or abuse. Communities and schools that host migrants need to find ways to communicate with migrant parents who may have different levels of education, language skills and understanding of the school system.\r\n\r\nAn insufficiently explored approach to overcome the difficulties to involve migrant parents in the education of their children is the Family learning pedagogical approach. Family learning is any learning that includes more than one generation of a family (including extended families and carers). The learning may be informal, through events such as family fun days, or more formal - family learning courses are delivered in settings such as schools, children's centres and community centres. Family learning is an effective way of providing adults with the skills and knowledge to support their children\u2019s education. It also provides a non-threatening route into learning for adults. The courses aim to help parents support their children's education \u2013 usually focusing on numeracy, literacy and/or language skills.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of MIFAMILY project is to strength the integration of migrant students in Schools and their success in education by providing training, coaching and guidance to migrant parents on Family Learning methods and resources to overcome language barriers and foster active involvement of migrant parents in their children's education, equipping teachers, school leaders and educators with the necessary skills and innovative tools to support migrant families in the process, strengthening collaboration between schools, families, and other external stakeholders. \r\n\r\nTo do so, 7 organizations supporting Schools and migrant families from 5 countries (France, Ireland, Romania, Spain and United Kingdom) will work together to lead the project and co-create and test innovative methods and freely accessible OER, including a Training Curriculum (IO1) an Online Platform of OER (IO2) and Guidelines and recommendations (IO3) on Family Learning for Migrants at School. \r\n\r\nTeachers, school leaders and educators from organizations working with migrants are the main target users of the project products and final beneficiaries are migrant school pupils and parents. During the life time of the project, the partnership will directly involve 78  teachers, school leaders and educators (28 partners staff / 30 experts involved / 20 target users in pilots), 100 migrant school pupils and parents (in pilots) and 475  stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nThe project will use European frameworks and instruments, like EQF Europass and SchoolEducationGateaway, to boost transparency and recognition of learning outcomes on Family Learning for Migrants at School, with the active support of a network of key associated partners and relevant stakeholders. MIFAMILY will have a direct impact on target beneficiaries, improving the skills on national languages of both migrant children and parents and strengthening School integration and success in education of migrant students, and in the target users, improving the teaching competencies of teachers and educators in Family Learning methods.

With those theatres, actors and actresses had a lot of opportunities to meet each other and to travel to international festivals (for either deaf and hearing people). But those theatres were existing only because of subsidies and grants and one by one those subsidies have been cut off, until there are only a handfull of theaters left. In a personal view, Teater Manu in Norway is the strongest theater company, receiving hundreds of thoundands euros of subsidies for their theater production and employing at least ten staff members. Other theaters in Sweden, Finland and France are somewhat moderate. But all of them have one similar issue: there are very few actors and actresses who are young. According to the theaters it is because those young people are not interested in theater anymore, but according to those young people, it is because young people do not receive the opportunities to train to become an experienced actor. \r\n\r\nTheatre as a form of art do bring people closer: shy people develop social skills to engage themselves with other people, people with a strong personality develop an understanding for other people and develop skills to be a leader and a role model. Theatre develops skills, but it is also a platform to show culture and language. As Deaf theatre does have different aspect than mainstream theatre, it is the perfect place to play with sign language and to show what Deaf culture is made of. With the closing of different theatres, there have been fewer and fewer places to experiment with different forms of sign language and having a place to expose Deaf culture.\r\n\r\nThat is why those of the few Deaf young actors would like to ignite the spark across Europe to bring theater closer to Deaf young people, giving them something to think about and giving them a chance to discover hidden talents. And at the same time a network will be developed, so there could be international links to (future) theater companies, as talents could be borrowed from each other. Giving Deaf young people the opportunity to learn about theater and building a stronger network will most likely to contribute to a broader audience, as it is likely that theater made by Deaf young people will also attract Deaf young people to watch. \r\n\r\nSo this project will have two activities (alongside with an APV), the first one will be a training in theatre arts in its various forms, in Norway. Established actors will come to facilitate those trainings in: Visual Vernacular, poetry, story telling, and body language. Everybody will get a taste of each form and when the end is approaching, they will engage themselves in a challenge to set up a short performance of maximum 10 minutes. As there will be four smaller groups, there will be four performances. They will receive feedback from Teater Manu, the Deaf theatre company in Norway. \r\n\r\nThe second activity will be in Paris, where they will develop their skills further and start preparing on the final draft of the performance. This is also the time the participants will think about what will happen after this project: will they be enterpreneurs in theatre and will they be able to set up a network of Deaf (young) actors? At the same time they rehearse, they will receive tools to give and receive feedback. \r\n\r\nThe biggest expected impact for those participants, is that they finally get the chance to develop theatre skills, which established or non-existent Deaf theatres have been neglecting to do so. With those skills they will build a network of Deaf young actors to support and empower each other and to start a dialogue with older actors.

The training takes place in the context of the increasing importance of media, of the democracy and freedom of speech debates and of the European citizenship and values that arise in the daily life of youth organisations. The scope of the training does not only address the learning of media technical skills but also the understanding of the European issues as well as the role the deaf youth workers can take through media and lobbying in their youth organisations. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to promote the inclusion of deaf youth workers who face greater obstacles in their access to information; to increase their capacities in using media tools and in participating at the European, national, regional and/or local levels; to support their professional development in the acquisition of competences with a view to improve the quality of youth work in the deaf youth organisations as well as to fight against discrimination and to promote the fulfilment of the human rights of each deaf young person in the EU and in the EU neighbouring countries. \r\n\r\nThe training will take place in the buildings and facilities of \u00c5l Folkeh\u00f8yskole og Kurssenter for d\u00f8ve located in \u00c5l, Norway for a period of twenty (20) days, excluding two travel days. Twenty-five (25) deaf youth workers aged between 18 and 30 years old will participate in this training on behalf of their youth organisation.

They will acquire understanding in the history, the functioning of the European institutions as well as their instruments and European values. They should also be able to develop lobbying tools with the help of the media and be able to identify opportunities for their youth organisation. They will take into account their role in providing high quality alternative media in sign language to complement the accessibility gaps due to lack of sign language use in the mass media and to ensure that deaf young people become citizens in a multiplying effect. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used during the training is based on the non-formal education methods. The participants will be provided tools by experienced trainers in the field of media and in European actions. Transition between the trainers regarding methods will be ensured by the NDFU and the EUDY and they will coordinate to guarantee that there is non-formal education methodology and tools provided to participants. They will have the opportunity to discuss with other participants through debates, self-reflective workshops, and identification/development of strategies based on good practice examples they experienced as youth workers. Participants will also be asked to work on practical assignments to use the tools and get the chance to develop their skills. Finally, time will be provided to the participants to develop some movie products themselves and to experience the research, creativity and production processes on their own. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact on immediate participants and their youth organisations is that they gain professionalism in their external communication thanks to improved skills and competences in media and that they get more opportunities to promote European values and concepts at the local, regional and national levels.

EUDY noticed that deaf youth organisations face issues and have real needs in accessing the information about youth work since the information is not accessible in their first language which is sign language. Fortunately the EUDY is an unique ENGO providing fully accessible trainings for deaf young people in Europe since they are conducted in sign language.\r\nThe seminar gives the opportunity to deaf youth workers to be included in the youth work sector thanks to accessible information in sign language. It also allows them to develop together a network of deaf youth workers that shares good practices, useful resources and tools to address better the needs of deaf young people in their countries.\r\nThe seminar takes place after two previous seminars the EUDY organised in the Baltic region as well as in the Netherlands with the purpose of bringing deaf young people together to exchange their experiences. In both seminars, EUDY identified gaps and needs of the participants in developing their skills in the domain of youth work as well as the needs of organisations to be reinforced and develop better and efficient working strategies to respond to the individuals' needs.\r\nThe objectives of the seminar are to facilitate the exchange of good practices, achievements, obstacles and other experiences among deaf youth workers; to address the human rights and fundamental freedoms of deaf young people in Europe and how deaf youth workers could promote these in their youth work; to identify obstacles in their professional development and to develop strategic tools; to reinforce the deaf youth organisation in their daily management; to develop the knowledge and competences of deaf youth workers in looking for appropriate funds; as well as to ensure the acquisition of the competences through non-formal/informal education.\r\nThe seminar will take place in Brussels, Belgium for a period of four days, excluding travel days, and it will reunite twenty-two (22) participants throughout the EU and the neighbouring EU countries. The participants, aged between 18 and 35 years old, are selected by the national deaf youth organisations and they are deaf youth workers or deaf young persons responsible of the daily management of the organisation. Their background is based on their experience in youth work: since they work for the organisation, they have relevant experience and good practice examples to share with other participants at the seminar. \r\nThe seminar consists of training sessions combined with self-reflective and practice-oriented sessions through which participants gain skills and competences as deaf youth workers. The methodology used is non-formal education and it will be ensured by three deaf young trainers experienced with the conduction of activities following the methods of non-formal and informal education. During informative sessions, participants will receive tools which they will be able to practice themselves through self-reflective workshops, constructive debates and the identification/development of strategies based on good practice examples they experienced as youth workers. They will also get the opportunity to meet with a deaf Member of the European Parliament as well as to visit the staff of the European Youth Forum, both experiences allowing them to face real-life situations of youth workers and to develop skills in networking. \r\nAt the end of the seminar, participants are expected to gain knowledge on human rights instruments and develop an attitude of multiplier in the human rights education processes happening in the EU and neighbouring EU countries. Finally the participants should develop an understanding of their potentialities and of the opportunities for improved youth work in their country. They will be encouraged to adopt appropriate strategies and behaviours to fulfill their role as youth worker for less advantaged minorities, such as the deaf young people. The EUDY wishes that participants gain solutions, strategies and a know how for high quality youth work. The expected impact on the longer term is the development of youth work quality by the EUDY member organisations and by deaf young persons in the EU and the neighbouring EU countries.\r\nFurthermore participants are expected to improve their networking and representation skills within the broad youth organisation sector at local, regional, national (National Youth Councils) and European levels (European Youth Forum).

In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users. At local level, Essenia UETP pursues  the objective of enhancing the cooperation with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the competences (ECVET), in order to make the  formal and informal competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market.", "http://www.sagittertraining.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005687_23"], [2018, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION", "Sagitter Training Ltd", 319905.0, 8, 38, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION represents the ideal continuation and expansion of the previous edition of WORKSTAR project. The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented.

The project idea originates from the constant contact and confrontation with students, recent graduates, VET staff, companies, stakeholders and public and private Institutions.The strong information activity on the learning and mobility opportunities offered by European Programs, carried out at national level, through seminars, infodays and meetings, permitted  Essenia UETP srl to understand the needs of the job market and the education world as well. Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension. In the project Portugal has been identified as one of the Countries with which to activate sinergies, according to the internationalization strategy.

Due to the consolidated experience in the two territories and the continuity of relations with the host partners, no preparatory visits are planned.\r\nThe destinations of the five mobility courses for trainers have been defined on the basis of methodological innovation objectives, linked to the introduction of alternance training for apprentices in AFOL, and have therefore been assigned to France and Germany, two countries that have a consolidated tradition in training of the apprentices.\r\nThe duration of the teachers mobility has been reduced by one day compared to the current project, to allow a simpler integration of the mobility with the teaching activities of the teachers.\r\nAFOL COMO will adopt, within the month of July, the ANNUAL PLAN of the mobility, already defined in the general lines, which will detail the different operational phases of the European and international actions, in an integrated and synergistic way to the school calendar.\r\nThe annual plan includes, for each target, the detailed time schedule, according to the following steps:\r\n- NOTICE AND INFORMATION\r\n-SELECTION\r\n- PREPARATION OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n- MOBILITY REALIZATION\r\n- MONITORING", "http://www.sagittertraining.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006514_3"], [2017, "VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN EUROPE 2017/2018", "Sagitter Training Ltd", 141980.0, 6, 10, "With the accreditation obtained through the Mobility Vet Charter, AFOL COMO will implement mobility activities as described in the application form and in its Internationalization Strategy.

Introduce innovative elements in educational methodologies and help the development of teachers skills \r\nThese general objectives will be pursued through the following actions, detailed in the AFOL COMO Internationalization Strategy:\r\n- Introduction of measures in training programs aimed to characterize in a international way the AFOL COMO training offer\r\n- Adoption and consolidation of the Organizational Model described in the Internationalization Strategy for the management of the mobility activities with specific rules for AFOL COMO staff\r\n- Implementation of mobility activities quality  through a Management Model with operational procedures and management and assessment tools\r\n- Consolidation and implementation of relationships, both in the international partnership, and in the local network of contacts with companies and institutions in the Province of Como and in Lombardy Region\r\n- Interventions of educational innovation, particularly regarding the dual system, to be achieved through the comparison with the best European models of apprenticeship training (Germany and France first of all)\r\nThe international partnership is confirmed, since the Partner Institutions have collaborated actively to the organization of mobilities and the different national contexts are interesting under the profile of the opportunities for professional and cultural growth for the beneficiaries. It has been added, because of the indications given by tutors and trainers of the catering and hotel sector, the partner Centre de Formation des Apprentis de la ville de Tours (FR), considered of particular interest for the professional sector, since located in a strong touristic area, important also for food and wine culture. It is considered very interesting also from a methodological point of view, because of an extensive experience in the management of apprenticeship training, directly linked to the priorities of AFOL COMO. \r\nThe destinations of the five mobilities for teachers/staff have been defined on the basis of this methodological innovation priorities, linked to the introduction in the AFOL of apprenticeship training (dual system), and are therefore assigned to France and Germany, which have a strong tradition in education for apprentices and in Spain, where a comparison about professional profiles and training standards has already been started.\r\nThe mobility activities are strongly oriented toward providing employment. AFOL COMO participates in EUROPEAN APPRETICESHIP AMBASSADORS project that allows young people to enter apprenticeship with employment contracts in European contexts (France in particular).

Our students come from a medium-low socioeconomic background, often disadvantaged, and almost completely devoid of the least incentive to get in contact with foreign countries or different cultures. This background is also marked by a very strong presence of immigrants. All of this has led us to look for complementary paths to traditional ways of teaching, paths that can give students a chance to grow, not only on a professional level, but also on a human level, allowing them to interact and engage with contexts very different from the usual ones and with multicultural and multiethnic realities. Participants in the mobility programme will come from the fourth and fifth years and will be selected from the four departments of our school (food and wine, dining room and sales, bakery and patisserie, tourism and hospitality). 42 students will take part in this mobility programme, 21 from the fifth year and 21 from the fourth year. 38 of these students will stay abroad for four weeks of training, and will be accompanied throughout their stay by an Italian tutor, chosen from the teachers of our institute. There will also be a company tutor and a representative of the partner organizations in the host country. Among the 42 learners there will be 4 students with special needs, with moderate cognitive disabilities, supported by a specific tutor throughout their internships that will last two weeks. Host countries are: Belgium, Spain, the UK and Malta. Participants will be divided into six flows, three for the fifth year and three for the fourth year (the fifth year will go to Malta and to the UK, the fourth to Belgium and Spain). The mobility programmes will take place between December 2017 and June 2018. The participants' selection criteria are based not only on achievement at school, but also on motivation, personal attitudes, and the degree of reliability and the capacity of the students to adapt themselves to different contexts. After a period of preparation based on linguistic and cultural reinforcement held by our teachers at school, and after doing a course on risks in the workplace before leaving, the learners will carry out internships in high-profile companies selected by our foreign partners in the host countries. During the internship the students will deepen and broaden the knowledge, skills and competencies related to their areas of specialization. The students with special needs will participate in all activities but with a reduced workload in terms of schedules and with closer monitoring. For them, however, the objectives of the acquisition of social and behavioural skills, autonomy and self-esteem will be given greater importance. The methodology used for all will be that of \"Modelling\" and \"Fading\", with a gradual acquisition of autonomy in working activities. The learning outcomes are part of the EQF framework, level IV. The mobility programme will be considered as valid for completing the total hours of \u201cAlternanza scuola-lavoro\u201d (Work-linked training), related to the 2017-2018 school year, in accordance with Italian Law 107/2015. The learners will write a diary using the e-twinning platform, they will share this diary with the teachers and the students at our school both during the training and after their return. When they come back to Italy, the trainees will bring back a digital document containing documents, comments and videos that they will use to share their experience. This product will be screened in the dissemination activities. For the certification of skills, knowledge and competences acquired, our school will  require the Europass Mobility record and participants will be given a training credit by the school. The project will start in October 2017 and will end in March 2019 with a big final event structured over several days to be held in the most important locations in our local area, as well as in our institute.
