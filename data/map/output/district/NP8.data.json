However, the reality presents itself differently in school life challenging this perception.  Being able to share photos, chat and tweet does not seem to imply being inherently able to use ICT tools effectively or safely for learning, nor even for entertainment, as teachers have witnessed on many occasions at school and as reports of cases of fraud and abuse in social media testify. Fundamentally, the process of growing up as human beings remains the same in this day and age as before. Young people are possibly perhaps even more insecure of themselves in this image-conscious era where one\u2019s photos and thoughts can be commented on effortlessly world-wide in a matter of seconds.Young people are not the only ones affected by the digital era - it also poses challenges for teachers. The concept of knowledge, the theories of learning, the roles of learners and teachers are changing. Curricula and methods are being reformed all over Europe as schools try to adjust to the needs presented by this development. Thus, three secondary schools across Europe, Nurmeksen lukio in Nurmes, Finland, Crickhowel High School in Crickhowell, Powys, Wales in the UK and BG/BRG Klosterneuburg in Klosterneuburg, Austria formed a partnership to equip their students with both roots and wings to survive in the modern world. Altogether, 87 students (aged 16 - 19) and 9 teachers will be working on the project for two years. They will collaborate both online and in real life in three student meetings and two teachers' meetings.The project \u2018Roots and wings \u2013 survival skills in the digital world\u2019 has three main aims. Firstly, we aim to enable our students to better understand their identity and appreciate their background and cultural heritage. Secondly, we want to equip them with skills needed in the modern world. We wish to encourage students to be responsible, show initiative and take charge of their lives. This will be done by adopting a learner-centred approach and applying principles of phenomenon-based learning and team learning. We will work on three phenomena: 1) digital literacy, 2) identity, health and wellbeing and 3) higher education.   By using various digital tools and collaborating online, we will learn how to behave responsibly and effectively in the digital world.  And thirdly,  we as teachers will also be learners in this project and learn from each other and students as we try out new pedagogical methods and tools. To understand one\u2019s own background, it is useful to be able to compare and contrast it to others\u2019 and that is why we formed this transnational network of partners. By comparing and contrasting cultures, we will also find what unites us as Europeans. In this age of economic uncertainty and increased migration it is vital to discuss why the European Union is important even to people in its border regions and in its very centre. A transnational cooperation will also highlight the importance of learning foreign languages and show that learning languages is about much more than learning vocabulary and grammar.As a result we aim to produce a website full of information for other young people wanting to discover the meaning of their roots and gaining wind beneath their wings:  eg. how to be digitally literate, how to assess the validity of online sources of information, how to behave responsibly in the social media, how find and finance higher education, and other vital life skills such as how to maintain a healthy lifestyle, how to examine and strengthen one's own identity and how it can be represented through various forms of art. Another important result is aimed at educators struggling with the demands of modern society and the need to revise pedagogics. The teachers taking part in this project shall share their experiences of guiding and mentoring students both nationally and transnationally according to the principles of phenomenon-based learning and team learning. This collaboration will thus be a testing ground for the renewing curricula in partner countries hoping to establish viable working methods that shall live on even after the project itself has finished. The change  from teacher-led activities to a more learner-centred approach allows educators to support the independence and life skills of our students, so that they can tackle the issues they face in this modern, digital age knowing who they are and where they come from. Thus, equip them with both roots and wings.It is also hoped that this project will be a start of continued collaboration not only among three partner schools but also among the young citizens of three European countries.", "http://www.crickhowell-hs.powys.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA219-022682_1"], [2018, "You're Up in Europe 3", "CRICKHOWELL HIGH SCHOOL", 65656.0, 11, 14, "In a world that is rapidly coming to terms with the realisation that countries need each other to establish a healthy economy and prosperity, we believe that students can contribute their skills to this goal and learn a tremendous amount when interning with companies or institutions in another European country.

The FoodRisC consortium is comprised of experts in key fields relevant to food risk/benefit communication from research institutes, consumer organisations and SMEs in ten Member States. This consortium is supported by an Advisory Board of representatives from seven organisations of world renown in food risk/benefit communication (including EFSA, WHO and Google).The project will identify the barriers to communicating to consumers across Europe and identify key socio-psychological and socio-demographic characteristics, including gender, that affect food risk/benefit perceptions and processes as well as consumer preferences for communication channels. These objectives will be achieved through a range of research approaches and methods and by extending the theoretical basis of how people acquire and use information in food domains. The impact of the project will be at a European level and will be facilitated through the development of the FoodRisC toolkit together with practical guidance to enable the effective communication of coherent messages across the Member States. Use of the toolkit and guides will assist policy makers, food authorities and other end users in developing common approaches to communicating coherent messages to consumers in Europe.

Currently, they can only turn to the establishment of energy producers to realise their objectives. These traditional actors are slowly becoming interested in RE but are very reticent to share socio-economic benefits with the local communities concerned. The result is a growing public resentment (NIMBY) and a failing market for RE.Characteristically, RE allows for distributed production and for involving local communities. Bio-Energie D\u00f6rfer in DE are the best proof of this: actively involving local communities in their RE production is a feasible way to address the failing RE market. Especially rural areas and farmers offer the physical and social resources needed for a decentralised, community based approach to providing RE.However, emerging local community initiatives are presently facing barriers. They lack adequate knowledge (of finances, technology, marketing, and management), which prevents them from becoming reliable RE providers. Numerous policymakers have indicated, therefore, that an effective exchange of knowledge is needed to speed up the RE transition.We aim to accelerate the growth of local Energy Community Co-Operatives (ECCOs), both in effectiveness and in numbers. We will achieve this by bringing ECCOs together and linking them up with relevant sources of knowledge from around NWE to overcome the barriers they face at present. Additionally, we will inspire policymakers and community groups to initiate their own ECCOs and, subsequently, we will facilitate their initiatiation and development processes. By designing and establishing a transnationally connected Accelerator Network (AN), we build the organisational structure that secures that the support activities are continued after the project has ended. The large number of policymakers and organisations that have already signed up as associated partners to this project are seen as a first testimony of commitment to the results we want to deliver.We start off bottom-up with the combined experience and best practices of 9 existing ECCOs spread around NWE. The transnational work of these pilots will function as\u00a0'beacons' for us during the project period and beyond to inspire policymakers and prospective ECCOs.We will reach and engage 50 new ECCOs during the project, each producing at least 600 MWh RE on average, reducing GHG emissions by 7.500 tns/yr in total. The tangible demonstration of this potential will encourage other policymakers to adapt their policies in favour of ECCOs (20 policies expected in 10 years post project).REScoop originated as an H2020 thematic EU network for mostly larger RE coopertives. The AN will make them well equipped to reach out to individual local ECCOs. This\u00a0results in\u00a0500 additional ECCOs in 10 years post project, bringing the GHG reduction total up to 150.000 tns/yr.", 1483228800000, 1640908800000, 238024.0, "nweurope_17_11"]]}}}}
