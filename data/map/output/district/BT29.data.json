This background supports the urgent need to map and understand the situation of the caregivers, as well as give them the necessary skills in order to support their work with the elderly at their charge. From the perspective of health and social services in it is crucially important to both identify the hazards of caregiving as well as to develop potential improvements and solutions allowing caregivers to continue caring for as long as they wish to and are able to do so, without jeopardising their own health and wellbeing, financial security, or reducing their expectation of a reasonable quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to support the development and implementation of higher standard services for the elderly through specialized training and innovative empowerment of ageing specialists and caregivers in order to assist recognition and validation of informal and non-formal competences and skills and provide increased employment opportunities along with acquisition of key competences of the latter.\r\n\r\nParticipants: 6 physicians or  nurses; 6 psychologists or social workers; 14 NGO staff; 6 public administration staff; 60 caregivers of elderly; 4 actors; 1 theatre director; 1 theatre producer; 1 theatre technician.\r\n\r\nActivities: elaboration of framework for the assessment, validation and recognition of informal and non-formal competences of elderly caregivers; elaboration of a unified curriculum on elderly caregiving fundamentals; organization of focus groups with caregivers to identify their emotional needs; elaboration of a workbook for caregivers of seniors; production of 2 videos for the empowerment of the caregivers; virtual and physical training of ageing specialists and caregivers; interactive forum theatre demonstrations; elaboration of a model of intervention to support elderly caregivers  in order to reduce public costs; organization of career guidance for caregivers.\r\n\r\nMethodology: i). common research of partners to elaborate: the framework for the assessment, validation and recognition of informal and non-formal competences of elderly caregivers; the unified curriculum on elderly caregiving fundamentals; the workbook for caregivers of seniors; model of intervention to support elderly caregivers  in order to reduce public costs; ii).
