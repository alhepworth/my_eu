Indeed current standard mammographic screening, with entry stratified by age alone, has recently been largely questioned. Despite a demonstrated mean 20% reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality, together with reduction of late-stage disease in women older than 50, it is associated with potential harms including false positive recalls and over-diagnosis. \nIndividual breast cancer risk estimation, through models including clinical variables, mammographic breast density and more than 100 genetic polymorphisms, now has substantial clinical and scientific bases. Personalized screening strategies, based on individual risk levels, could potentially improve the individual benefit/harms ratio of screening (earlier cancer detection and less intensive treatments in high risk women, less false positives and over-diagnoses in low risk ones), and increase the cost-efficacy for health insurances. \nMyPEBS will conduct an international randomized phase III trial to validate this hypothesis.

Specifically, her aim is to understand when and why \u2018popular\u2019 books underwent a change in their perceived value, from books to be used and reused to books that were considered at once disposable and worthy of collection, and how time and space, politics and cultural policies influenced this change. \nSupported by three centres of excellence (the Consortium of European Research Libraries or CERL, the BL and the Istituto Centrale per il catalogo unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche or ICCU), the PATRIMONiT project combines the more recent developments in three main disciplines (Library Science, History and ICT), to tackle historical questions which cannot be approached and successfully solved individually.", 155629.0, 155629.0, 1, 1, "PATRIMONiT", null, "http://www.cerl.org", null, "h2020_195819_986247792"]]}}, "1UL": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FOUNDATION CHARITABLE TRUST*EJFCT", 1234077.0, "Food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture (21.02.07.04)", "fts_2016_18209"]]}}, "3GA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Dezvoltare \u0219i progres", "The Arvon Foundation Ltd.", 7610.0, 3, 4, "The project\u2019s necessity can be justified by the need of adaptation to the continuous changes present in a highly developing world.

The action begins with a review of the market, which is necessary during the current economic crisis: a lack of employment coexists with a lack of specific skills. Hence the need to train updated professionals with digital and language skills. Learners ask for synergies with the market, especially in Europe, and contacts with the outside world, along with forms of creative learning, informal, close to the world of young people suitable to awaken interest and creativity.\r\n\r\nGiven digital natives' skills, it is productive to exploit and hand over them to the vocational field in order  to create jobs.
