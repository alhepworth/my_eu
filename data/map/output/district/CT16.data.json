Each school has rising numbers of migrant pupils and so this project is aimed at supporting the integration, inclusion, teaching and  understanding of migrant children from different cultural backgrounds. Through staff sharing and observing best practices in the teaching and understanding of migrant children, we intend to develop  high quality provision so that each partner school will be able to improve the inclusion and teaching of migrant children. This will have a positive impact of the progress and achievement of migrant children.  We want to improve the teaching and learning of migrant children in each school by sharing best practice in five key areas;  Innovative intervention programmes, Reviewing and developing the use of ICT, Improving parental involvement, Developing effective induction and transition programmes and finally Developing a school ethos that values and celebrates diversity.  Current good practise will be researched, adapted and adopted by each partner. Staff from each school will visit the others to observe, first hand, how the practices are put into place. These will then be reported back to schools so that the current practices can be adapted to ensure the aims of the project are met. Collaborative pupil participation projects will enable pupils to work with peers in other countries, participating in celebration events and creating a resource bank of traditional tales and social stories in a range of languages.During international learning, teaching and training events staff will observe intervention groups, classroom lessons and any other aspects of school life involving migrant children. Each partner will plan a five day programme of activities all supporting the achievement of our common goal.The findings of these observations and subsequent discussion will form a new non-national language speaking policy in each of the partner schools. Schools will implement provision changes so progress and attainment of migrant pupils accelerates and the gap with children already in the culture will be closed. This will be evident in the data collected from all the partner schools.Each school will follow a time table of activities that details research, development, monitoring, evaluation, data collection and dissemination activities. Longer term benefits of the project will include continued high quality provision for migrant pupils, leading to improved attainment and integration. This will enable pupils to develop skills which support them in secondary school and will help them to become valued members of society in the future.", "http://greenpark@kent.sch.uk", "Green Park Community Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024273_coordinator"]]}}, "3NF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Europ\u00e4ische Mobilit\u00e4t in der Nagel-Group", "Nagel Logistics (UK) Limited", 40363.0, 14, 14, "The Nagel-Group is a European family-owned company with East-Westphalian heritage and is represented at more than 100 own locations in 16 European countries.

In the course of the stay abroad, the trainees get an insight into the operational activities of the company (export operations, transport planning, insurance, accounting, customer management). In addition to the basic skills, such as expertise, the ability to work in a team and collaboration, the trainees should acquire and improve additional skills, such as independence, the ability to manage stressful situations and endurance, openness for different working methods and cultures as well as communication.
