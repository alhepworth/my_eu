Transnational training mobilities: 8 weeks:\r\n\r\nMobilities will take place during summer in order to avoid interfering with participants\u2019 school commitments and classes. The duration has been decided in collaboration with VET partners, who have indicated the period as appropriate for: developing training plan in hosting enterprises; participants\u2019 achievement of technical, professional knowledge, skills and competences as well as soft skills.\r\n\r\nb. Monitoring and tutoring;\r\n\r\nc. Training experience evaluation;\r\n\r\nd. Acquired competences evaluation\r\n\r\n3. Cross-sectional activities:\r\n\r\na. Administrative and financial evaluation;\r\n\r\nb. Dissemination and follow-up.\r\n\r\nE. METHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nEstra will manage the project; Mercury will coordinate.\r\n\r\nTraining plan in hosting enterprises will be organised in accordance with ECVET procedure: Units of Learning Outcomes (ULOs), with their activities and Learning Outcomes (LOs) (knowledge, skills and competences). Estra has prepared the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which has been signed by all transnational partners. In line with MoU, ECVET-LAs will be elaborated. At the end of 2 months training, hosting enterprises will evaluate the LOs achievement through examination. Final evaluation will follow. Registers will show the number of daily hours training. They will be daily signed by tutor and trainee. Once having reports, applicant will start procedures for having Europass Mobility Certificates validated by Erasmus + National Agency.\r\n\r\nBefore departure, participants will attend the Online Linguistic Support tool. Participants moving to EL and PT will attend language and culture tuition at destination.\r\n\r\nEach 14 days tutors and trainees will fulfil monitoring questionnaires.\r\n\r\nOpenCom will realise a Web Platform for direct access (through username and password) to administrative documents, reports and monitoring questionnaires.\r\n\r\nF. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS\r\n\r\nLeaning outcomes will be expressed in terms of knowledge, skills and competences. 150 students, who have carried out at leat 80% of training and have succeeded the final exam, will receive the Europass Mobility Certificate, where LOs will be validated. \r\n\r\nG.

SDC has therefore highlighted an important need to develop more internationally relevant curriculum and generate more cultural impact to better prepare our learners with International Employability Skills to be able to compete with learners from other nations and make a meaningful contribution to the global economy.\r\n\r\nThe main activities within our Developing Overseas Skills Experience 3 (DOSE 3) Project will be one flow of 12 student mobilities for two weeks to each of our partner organisations., per year. These will be in France (two locations), Saint Gabriel Vocational Training College in Pont l\u2019Abb\u00e9 and Cannes Hotel and Trade School plus Bromangymnasiet, Hudiksvall, Sweden with a programme of work placement, college and cultural activities.

In addition one flow of staff mobilities per year to each country partner  for work shadowing and review of quality assessment systems  for Automotive and Marine; Tourism, Catering & Hospitality, Engineering and Business.\r\n\r\nThe main areas we wish to develop through this project are:\r\n- Our teaching methods and resources to improve skills in communication and critical thinking \u2013 recognised as key employability skills which enable people to apply skills to different contexts, solve problems, use their initiative and work independently;\r\n- Our methods of working with industry to better inform curriculum developments and respond to and anticipate sector skills needs;\r\n- Ensuring an international context and dimension is present throughout the learner journey at SDC;\r\n- To convert existing international relationships to partnerships with knowledge transfer and innovation outcomes for staff, and cultural experiences and work placements for learners;\r\n- To cement a network of international contacts from which to grow and generate sustainable international collaboration.\r\n\r\nSDC has a mission 'to inspire its community through learning for all' and has an entirely learner centric focus to enable every learner to achieve their best potential.\r\nThe main objectives for the participants are to:\r\n- Support learners to develop their competences through the acquisition of skills and experience\r\n- Improve their personal development and employability in the European labour market\r\n- Develop their cultural awareness and improve social understanding of another country\r\n- Broaden horizons by breaking down perceived barriers that may limit learners aspiration\r\n- Provide further professional development opportunities for staff through work shadowing experiences\r\n- Improve progression levels to higher levels/Higher Education.\r\n\r\nWe expect that this programme will have positive, long lasting effects on all the participants, students and staff and the organisation. and these will mirror the aims of the programme. The overall impact for SDC will be increased high quality employment outcomes and greater numbers of progression to higher level learning for our students. who often suffer from economic or social disadvantage and have limited opportunities.", "http://www.southdevon.ac.uk", "South Devon College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035803_coordinator"], [2014, "European Vocational Education and Training", "South Devon College", 236961.0, 6, 38, "Bromangymnasiet in Hudiksvall is situated in a region of very high unemployment, among the young it is the highest percentage in the country (25 %). Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, sixteen of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.  Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland. All organisations to be receiving partners have had vocational students from us in previous projects, which ensures that they will take on our students in the very best way and provide them with supervision, relevant work as well as plan, carry our and assess to what degree the learning outcomes have been reached in the time of work placement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally. We will use the chart provided by the commission and also create learning agreements an formulate learning outcomes for all participants, i.e. both students and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bromangymnasiet project group - a principal, an administrator and a coordinator - organises all activities that relate to the work shadowing and work experience. The group is in charge of and responsible for selecting participants, communicating with partners, establishing various agreements/contracts, practicalities such as bookings, economy, evaluation and dissemination of the project results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy partaking in this project, we expect of participating teachers to develop their teaching practice to a more entrepreneurially featured kind that supplies the students with tools to succeed in their field of training. We know from experience that vocational work experience abroad generates increased vocational competences, a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills and an enhanced self-esteem, which also makes them dare take the step onto the European field of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers who participate in work shadowing will share their experiences and learning outcomes with colleagues upon their return, which will further the progression in the eduactional development. The students who engage in work placements elsewhere in Europe will inspire other students to do the same in the future.

Focusing on the sustainable use of natural water resources as our study theme - with special emphasis on the development of aquaculture and fisheries - there will be four visits organised in each of the hosts countries.The primary objective is the exchange of best practice within educational methodology, but also in respect of the relevant industries, stimulating innovation.To achieve a sustainable use of our natural resources within Europe, these partnerships are essential to ensure long-term, continuous improvements, leading to a motivated and skilled work force to bring about effective change and development.Each of the partners will host one week of activities, over the three-year programme, welcoming six students/instructors from each partner, with one activity each year.  These activities will relate to a specific local geographical area bringing a focus on the merits sustainable development for all stakeholders and the potential of new species development with a mixture of theory, visits, work experience/exercises and workshops.  As well as engaging with the host partner, these workshops will involve an engagement with governmental bodies, local industry and include instruction to people outside the project, for example with a local primary school.  As part of the week, the host will be expected to include elements of the social and cultural dimension of the area to engender goodwill and empathy amongst the participants.There will be close dialogue before and after the events to ensure proper planning, management and to ensure the best outcome for the participants involved.   The participants will each submit activity reports which will be uploaded to a dedicated website and they will be encouraged to engage via social media to share expectations and experiences.  All participating students will receive a Europass. The activities will provide valuable new knowledge on the bio-economy, to each participant, as well as the partner organization, improving motivation and skill, especially in the field of the sustainable use of our water resources.  Participation in this project for the partners will have an intrinsic marketing value in addition to an increased international network and improved teaching skills, along with increased understanding of the management and structure of this resource.  The potential longer term benefit will be an increased interest in education and career development within bio-economy.

The specificity of work experience placements in the field of HGV driving will lead us to reduce the periods of in-company training as students will only be able to accompany drivers. The Erasmus+ programme which permits short duration placements of 2 weeks would perfectly suit this type of experience.\r\nAll the participants in this programme are final year Professional Baccalaur\u00e9at students from the different sections in our establishment - maintenance, logistics and transport. We will privilege the sending of small groups of students, between 3 and 5, in order to ensure the quality of the placements both within the company as well as the accommodation. Proceeding in this way, we hope to develop the initiative-taking skills of the participants.\r\nPartner companies are chosen according to the different tasks that they can propose in accordance with the course curricula of our students and also according to the technical equipment they possess.    We inform the companies of the different stages of the training courses followed by the students as well as the content of examinations, which necessitates pre-placement preparation.\r\nThe entire European project, with the support of the headmaster, is managed by a team of volunteer teachers. One person coordinates the group throughout the year and has the administrative and financial responsibility. One teacher per destination country is clearly identified for colleagues and students. This organisation means that projects can be formed over a long-term basis and allow for the replacement of the different actors (due t retirement) over a long period of time.\r\nThe impact of the European Project in our establishment can be quantified by the number of participants who undertake periods of work experience abroad each year. \r\nOur partner companies talk of a feeling of increased dynamics and a feeling of openness towards others amongst their personnel. \r\nLocal businesses have encouraged us to continue in this direction and to propose this \u00ab European Dimension \u00bb to students who wish to participate as part of the obligatory work experience training which is an integral part of their course. Experience of this kind is looked upon as being an important employment criterion.\r\nSchools with which we have created links continue to work with us and we are always available to help them in any reciprocal projects.\r\nBecause of our geographical situation, we feel it is necessary to propose added value to our courses. The European dimension is a valuable complement that we promote in our different publications, in career conferences, open days and local media \u2026 At a crucial time when young people are making important career decisions, we feel that this dimension is an important criterion.", "http://www.southdevon.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013700_1"], [2016, "Developing Overseas Skills Experience 2", "South Devon College", 16719.0, 2, 2, "As one of the leading Further Education establishments in the country South Devon College (SDC) is ambitious for its learners to achieve their highest potential and whilst SDC has invested significantly in improving capacity for teach English and Maths already, it recognises that global literacy is not just about the skills of reading, writing and maths and wants to improve learners' ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences and their ability to interpret information and apply it appropriately to the situation or setting.SDC has therefore highlighted an important need to develop more internationally relevant curriculum and generate more cultural impact to better prepare our learners with International Employability Skills to be able to compete with learners from other nations and make a meaningful contribution to the global economy.The main activities within our Developing International Vocational Experience Project will be a flow of student mobilities for two weeks to our partner organisation in France, Cannes Cookery School including a programme of work placement activities. In addition one flow of staff mobilities  to the partner school for work shadowing and curricula development for Catering/Hospitality teachers to broaden their knowledge and understanding to inprove outcomes for our learners.The main areas we wish to develop through this project are:- Our teaching methods and resources to improve skills in communication and critical thinking \u2013 recognised as key employability skills which enable people to apply skills to different contexts, solve problems, use their initiative and work independently;- Our methods of working with industry to better inform curriculum developments and respond to and anticipate sector skills needs;- Ensuring an international context and dimension is present throughout the learner journey at SDC;- To convert existing international relationships to partnerships with knowledge transfer and innovation outcomes for staff, and cultural experiences and work placements for learners;- To cement a network of international contacts from which to grow and generate sustainable international collaboration.SDC has a mission 'to inspire its community through learning for all' and has an entirely learner centric focus to enable every learner to achieve their best potential.The main objectives for the participants are to:- Support learners to develop their competences through the acquisition of skills and experience- Improve their personal development and employability in the European labour market- Develop their cultural awareness and improve social understanding of another country- Broaden horizons by breaking down perceived barriers that may limit learners aspiration- Provide further professional development opportunities for staff through work shadowing experiences- Improve progression levels to higher levels/Higher EducationThe expected impact on the participants is that 8 students will have undertaken a student mobility to our partners in France that would not have been possible without the support of the Erasmus+ project. Each individual through this enrichment programme will have developed a Europass CV  recording the activities and achievements of their visit. Ultimately this will lead to improved confidence, aspirations and employment on completion of their course.Through the staff mobilities the impact will be that 3 staff will have improved and added to their personal and professional  development this in turn will benefit their students through improved approaches and practices to communication and problem solving, improved employer engagement to inform curricula development and employment pathways. In addition the staff  impact will be to develop the curricula, introduce new methods to make it relevant for employability in the international arena thus benefiting the employability and opportunities for their students in the short and long term. The improvement of attainment for students is a high priority for the UK government and by seeking to develop good practice from others we ultimately would see the desired impact to be to try and improve the OECD ranking of the UK in the long term through improvements to teaching methods.", "http://www.southdevon.ac.uk", "South Devon College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023996_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1491004800000, 1593475200000, "Hi-Tech & Digital Work-hub", "South Devon College", "This ERDF project will enable the creation of 15 individual work-hubs plus 2 large open plan collaboration zones with 2 meeting rooms within the new South Devon College Hi-Tech & Digital Centre (HTDC).  \nThe project offeres good value for money on both the Capital and Revenue elements.\nVFM was checked as part of the appraisal process and the project offers good VFM when compared to the OP average.", "ERDF", 928210.0, 1547017.0, "erdf_england_496"]]}}, "7EP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "ERDI-HEZIKETA 2017", "Geltec Ltd", 89921.0, 4, 14, "This proposal \u201cErdi Heziketa 2017\u201d is aimed at 22 young students, of Initial Vocational Training of 33 professional training center located in the Basque Country. \r\n\r\nThis new proposal includes the following partners:\r\n\r\n-Confebask as proposal's oordinator.\r\n-Vocational training schools included on the consortium, both public and private, belonging to the Training Network of Centres of the Basque Country, as sending institutions.\r\n- The Department of Education of the Basque Government, Provincial Councils as Institutional and co-financiers partners.\r\n- Intermediary partners and Host organizations in Italy, Portugal and the UK.\r\n\r\nThe objectives and expected results are the achievement of meeting the following needs of the participants covered by this proposal: \r\n- Improvement of practical training, in addition to theoretical training gained during their training period in their centers.

Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique.
