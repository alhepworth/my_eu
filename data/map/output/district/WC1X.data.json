Young people and poverty", "The Church of England Children's Society", 185747.0, 6, 7, "BACKGROUND\r\nResearch shows young people living below the poverty line face multiple barriers to access education, employment, housing etc. To be poor is a very stigmatising experience, which affects self-esteem, confidence and personal security. Thus, low income is a strong predictor of low educational performance, lower aspirations for the future and finally social exclusion. \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Annual Growth Survey shows that poverty and social exclusion are major obstacles to the achievement of the Europe 2020 objective of inclusive growth. There is a lack of extensive knowledge on how young people experience poverty in the different member states and much to learn how the dynamic nature of poverty and youth intertwine. A better understanding is urgently needed towards achieving the Europe 2020 goal of \u201cat least 20 millions fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion\". \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES, NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nYES Forum, the European network of organisations working with and for disadvantaged young people having members and affiliates in 18 EU member states, leads the strategic partnership \u201cOur life. Our voice. Young people and poverty\u201d. We will place young people\u2019s views at the heart of this project to explore young people\u2019s attitudes to poverty and what it means for them to live in families struggling to make ends meet from day to day. By listening to the young people experiencing poverty we want to bridge the gap between policy and practice. \r\n\r\nThe project partnership involves 6 partners and the YES Forum, the coordinating organisation. We implement the project in 5 countries different with regard to welfare system, historical development, and economic performance.  Therefore we collaborate with partners coming from the UK, Italy, Germany, Finland and Romania covering different regions of the EU. These organisations have strong experience in delivering services for those experiencing poverty, listening to young people and influencing policy to improve the lives of those in or at risk of poverty. To reach a large audience ranging from youth work organisations, service providers, policy makers and public authorities, we involve another strong European network, active in the field of streetwork: Dynamo International. We estimate that the activities will reach between 200-500 young people per country. Through extensive dissemination activities we aim to reach around 5.000 multipliers across Europe. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES, METHODOS USED\r\nThis strategic partnership builds on a model established by The Children\u2019s Society, the partner from the UK. Aim is to set up a group, so-called panel, of young people experiencing poverty in 5 countries. These groups of 12-15 young people are accompanied by youth workers applying interactive and participatory methods to get an insight into the experience of young people in poverty. The young people create discussion on different perceptions of poverty and as a result formulate their recommendations against poverty and what real support should look like. At regional and national events they will meet youth organisations, service providers, local authorities, and policy makers to discuss their suggestions. The methodology used for engaging those young people who might be hard to reach will be published in a tool-kit for practitioners. \r\n\r\nThe participants\u2019 activities culminate in the final international conference organised by the YES Forum together with Dynamo International in collaboration with SALTO-YOUTH Inclusion Resource Centre. This event will be held in Brussels, presenting the project findings in creative and interactive ways, devised by the young people to reach the various actors working with disadvantaged young people across Europe, ranging from professionals of youth services and youth work to opinion formers and policy makers at EU level.\r\n\r\nRESULTS, IMPACT, LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nBy applying this participatory approach the project aims to fill a gap in the discourse around poverty, where often the focus at national and EU level is on statistics and the definition of poverty rather than the day to day experience of young people. Local authorities and those responsible for developing services and policies for young people will benefit from our substantial knowhow in including those young people who may not otherwise be engaged in established platforms for policymaking in the youth field (e.g. youth councils, youth organisations). Thus we provide fresh ideas for both actors in the field of youth services and youth work as well as policy makers how to better target resources to disadvantaged young people\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nAs the young people will be able to voice their opinions about issues affecting them, with a firm focus on poverty we contribute to the cornerstones of the EU 2020 Growth Strategy and the European Youth Strategy. In the longer term, the project objective is to mitigate the effects of poverty as well as tackling marginalisation and reduce youth poverty.", "http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-2-DE04-KA205-001641_6"], [2015, "YES Academy", "The Church of England Children's Society", 43117.0, 15, 24, "Throughout the EU, young people are the category of persons hit hardest by unemployment, underemployment and feel discouraged to look for work. Furthermore the last European elections and numerous elections in the Member States in recent times show, that there is a growing absenteeism of young people combined with an increasing European scepticism. This development and the complex situation of young people in transition to adulthood call for trained and experienced professionals in the field of youth work. \r\n\r\nDriven by our members, the \u201cYES Academy\u201d project contributes to achieve a greater impact of the Inclusion and Diversity Strategy in youth work leading to increased active citizenship of young people:\r\n\u2022 To create a more inclusive environment, with more and diverse young people participating in civic activities throughout Europe.\r\n\u2022 To enable organisations working with and for young vulnerable people to be a more effective force \u2013 to make it easier for young people to actively participate \r\n\u2022 To increase the capacities of individual youth workers and their organizations in working with young people and to foster greater cooperation among organisations and other sectors throughout the EU\r\n\r\nThe idea for the project came from our partner organizations that have an ongoing interest in increasing civic participation of disadvantaged young people. All the project partners bring strong expertise in working with young people affected by social inequalities (educational, emotional, economical etc.) in their own communities. Ranging from school social work to street-based work, our partners aim to prevent, resolve and avoid the worst effects of exclusion and help young people flourish. \r\nOver the span of 16 months, the YES Academy project will include four events for youth workers including an international seminar, two contact-making events, and a study visit. The project aims to reach 115 participants from 15 different European countries. The first event builds a common approach based on mutual understanding. Using interactive methods, participants present their experience applying concepts and methods concerning young people\u2019s engagement, active citizenship, participation and social inclusion. The second contact-making event will conclude the learning activities and summarise the experiences into an action-oriented report on how to be more effective in reaching young people and to make it easier for young people to actively participate in society. In addition, our international seminar organised in Brussels will foster a space for exchange of good practices and information between participants and high-level EU stakeholders in the EU policy field of Youth. Here we aim to be in dialogue with European policy makers as well as public bodies involved in youth social inclusion, youth unemployment, and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project will culminate in a study visit in Finland co-organised with After Eight, an organization with a long standing experience in the development of youth active citizenship, participation and social inclusion. The event offers an in-depth look into After Eight\u2019s implemented measures and projects with young people, their methodology and their political, financial and administrative infrastructure. The event will provide youth workers with space for reflection on different approaches, methods and perspectives, as well as an opportunity to exchange experience with their professional colleagues. Finally, activities facilitating transfer into practice will take place to analyse ways to promote and use constructively the knowledge gained during the project visits and adapt it to reflect participant\u2019s own context and working environments.\r\n\r\n\u201cYES Academy\u201d will innovatively combine a process-oriented learning approach that prioritises youth worker reflection on key issues with an aim to produce tools for sustainable approaches in working more effectively with young people in Europe. The envisioned tangible results of the project include:\r\n\u2022 policy recommendations for European youth work on promoting active citizenship among young people, as well as involving young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in democratic decision-making processes;\r\n\u2022 a good practices guide for youth workers throughout Europe on issues of active citizenship and youth social inclusion; \r\n\u2022 an action-oriented final report that will summarize the case studies of good examples for inclusive youth work. \r\n\r\nThe expected learning results for youth workers are:\r\n\u2022 deeper knowledge of structures and support measures for young people in the Member states of the participants,\r\n\u2022 qualitative support for the dialogue between with different stakeholders in the field on Youth on issues of young people with fewer opportunities,\r\n\u2022 greater knowledge and implementing new transferable models for supporting active citizenship of young people with fewer opportunities", "http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012744_17"], [2016, "Lernmobilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Fachkr\u00e4fte in der Jugendsozialarbeit - \"Junge Gefl\u00fcchtete und Migrierte  in internationalen \u00dcberg\u00e4ngen - Young refugee and migrant in international transition\"", "The Church of England Children's Society", 21888.0, 5, 7, "Learning mobility for practitioners in the field of youth - \"Young Refugee and Migrant in International Transition\" Y REMIT\r\n\r\nAcross Europe there are young people on the move searching for personal and economic security. Fleeing war, violence and persecution, these young people are forced - on their own or with their families - to leave their home country and seek safety in Europe. During their journey these young refugees/migrants go through many different European countries, staying in each for various amounts of time. \r\n\r\nAfter arriving in southern European countries, many young refugees/migrants want to move onwards to central and northern European countries, each guided by their own unique hopes and plans for resettlement. Throughout their journeys these young people are often trapped in legal limbo and are forced to stay in different countries for extended periods whilst on route to their destination countries. As a result, these young refugees and migrants have to navigate many international transitions, in turn creating different categories of young people. These can roughly be differentiated into three main types \u2013 1) the \u2018new arrivals\u2019, 2) the \u2018long stayers\u2019 and 3) the \u2018in-betweens\u2019.\r\n\r\nA young person in \u2018transition\u2019 can therefore undergo just one or all three different phases in one or several countries. \r\nThis requires practitioners who work with young refugee and migrants to employ a range of methods and strategies to best support them in their various situations. Across Europe different countries have their own well established structures for providing effective practical support to young refugees and migrants. However, up until this point there has been very little exchange of knowledge and best practice between the different European countries, and their respective social organisations, who share the same challenge of supporting young refugees/migrants. \r\n\r\nAims:\r\nIn order to ensure that across Europe young refugees/migrants are supported to the highest standard, the aims of our project are: \r\n1) To organize and implement a learning mobility project amongst practitioners working with young refugees/migrants from different European countries:\r\n\u2022 An exchange of knowledge and experience between practitioners working with young refugees/migrants in different European countries. This peer learning will create a forum for discussion and consideration of different policies and methods for supporting young refugees/migrants, with a special view on informal/nonformal learning/VET, and will enable best practice to be shared between the partners. \r\n\u2022 An exploration of the different experiences of young refugees/migrants associated with each partner organisation, to gain insight of their wishes and expectation, in order to develop effective strategies which respond to the specific needs of the young people.  \r\n2) As a partnership of highly experienced youth organisations working with young refugee and migrants, we will utilise the outcomes of aim 1 to develop a strategic transnational partnership (Erasmus +K2)\r\n\r\nTarget group:\r\n\u2022 Practitioners (primarily) who work with young refugees and migrants, e.g. youth workers, social workers and advocates. \r\n\u2022 Young people in transition (secondly) who are refugees or migrants, who will participate in the study visits in their current of residence. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n\u2022 Preparation meetings (online)\r\n\u2022 Three study visits (2 days) in three countries: Greece (March 2017), Sweden (June 2017), UK (October 2017). \r\n\u2022 Interviews with refugees and migrants in the study visits \r\nTo prepare and apply for this learning mobility funding all six partner organizations from five different EU countries came together: Sweden, Greece, Italy, UK and Germany. All of the organisations have a wide range of experiences in the youth and social work sector working with young refugees and migrants.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\u2022 To understand the particular political and social situation in each partner country relating to young refugees and migrants.\r\n\u2022 To learn about different approaches and methods of how to support and integrate young people in transition in the respective countries.\r\n\u2022 To evaluate the role of of youth and social work sector professionals in supporting young refugees and migrants in particular towards VET\r\n\u2022 To gain insight into young refugee and migrants needs in order to improve youth and social work on the European level. \r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThrough the partnership of six organisations with expertise in supporting young refugees and migrants in five different European countries, we will gain a rich and broad insight into the different systems and approaches to enabling social integration of young refugees and migrants in transition.

The problem they encountered or noticed in their communities is an increased intolerance towards people who are culturally different. Both immigrants and natives are increasingly fearful of each other, seeing the \u201cOthers\u201d through the prejudiced lens of stereotypes, racism, and xenophobia.    \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThrough this project we aim to break the psychological and social barriers that replaced the real ones in Europe. We want to bring young people with fewer opportunities, namely those with immigrant background and natives closer to the European project and closer to each other, help them develop intercultural competencies and thus promote tolerance towards people from different cultural backgrounds.  Exploring European citizenship through their own identities, as immigrants or as natives, we expect them to discover a European community that fosters diversity without stifling national/individual identities.\r\n\r\nThrough the project\u2019s objectives we actively contribute to the attainment of several of the goals and outcomes envisioned for Key Action 1: Mobility project for young people and youth workers, and we furthermore support the EU Strategy for Youth and the Europe 2020 strategy:\r\n- Enhance intercultural skills of young people \r\n- Raise participants' awareness and understanding of other cultures within their own country and other European countries\r\n- Increase their awareness of European citizenship\r\n- Increase their self-empowerment and self-esteem \r\n- Improve their foreign language skills\r\n- Increase the participating organisations\u2019 capacities in offering transnational activities and projects that better respond to the needs of their target groups\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\nHalf of the young participants have an immigrant background in the countries they reside and the others are natives. All of the participants are at their first transnational project experience, aged between 18 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nActivities and Methodology\r\nThe key concept of the project is linked to non-formal learning and the work is centred on an interactive, activity based, and process-oriented pedagogical method. During the first day the young people will get acquainted with the new environment and the host organisation. As a preparation for the workshop on European citizenship, on the second day they will present themselves, their language, culture, and country through interactive and engaging methods. During the European citizenship workshop on the third day, they will approach the concept in a more systematic manner, combining the information and knowledge of the participants with a rights-based perspective from the facilitators. From the fourth day on, the main methodological approach used to attain the project\u2019s objectives and learning outcomes is film-making. On the last day they will reflect on the learning from the project and discuss possible follow-ups. \r\n\r\nGiving young people the opportunity to create a video from scratch can be very empowering, even more so as their own identities and cultural backgrounds are brought into it. It is a creative way to explore the dynamic and complex concept of European citizenship, which translates a rather abstract and distant idea into young peoples\u2019 reality. \r\n\r\nThe Social Art Association has the expertise and experience in using creative methods, such as film making in youth work and will be the partner supporting and guiding the participants. The process involves the following:\r\n1) Idea \r\n- how to get an idea for a film; when and where do I get inspiration?\r\n\r\n2) Film Structure  \r\n- feature film, documentary\r\n- narrative forms \r\n\r\n3) Film Technique  \r\n- drama, animation, cartoon, miniature film, stop-motion, pantomime  \r\n- how and why to use different framing techniques and camera angles\r\n\r\n4) Planning \r\n- practical preparations, timetables, recording schedules   \r\n- research \r\n\r\n6) Screen Writing  \r\n- what is a synopsis, outline and treatment\r\n- how do you write a script/draw a storyboard  \r\n- action, characters, dialogue\r\n\r\n7) Filming  \r\n- how is it done? Guidelines\r\n\r\n8) Film Editing  \r\n- cutting, music and sound effects\r\n- how to export the final product\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nGiving the participants the opportunity to explore, debate, and reflect on European citizenship, might lead them to play an active role in their communities, while their participation in a transnational youth exchange could improve their mobility. Furthermore, becoming more self-confident and able to communicate more easily could help them in the long term to access educational and professional opportunities they did not even dare to previously consider. Their employability will also be positively influenced by more hard-nosed skills like increased foreign-language proficiency and film-making abilities, but also by strong intercultural competences.", "http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DE04-KA105-001355_5"]]}}, "0LR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1454284800000, 1548892800000, "Social Innovation Community", "Social Innovation Exchange", "Developing an enabling environment for social innovation that links actions across the whole field and supports the full exploitation of their potential is vital to addressing societal challenges both in Europe and globally.

It will primary aim to influence children\u2019s behaviours and prevent obesity in early childhood. Strategy The proposal will identify key behaviours related to early childhood obesity and their determinants and evaluate behavioural models and educational strategies. Based on the obtained insights at a local level, a multidisciplinary team will develop and implement a school based family involved intervention programme that could be applied on a European scale. Process, impact, outcome and cost-effectiveness evaluation will be conducted to support decision making for European Public Health Policy. Methods The combined use of Precede-Proceed Model and Intervention Mapping will provide the framework for the development, implementation and evaluation of the ToyBox intervention. To achieve this, the project will be subdivided into 10 WPs. This carefully planned stepwise approach will include systematic reviews, secondary analyses of existing data sets, focus group research and school policies overview.

However, they are generally not readily available for patients who are in need of them for medical reasons. It is estimated that over 80% of the world's population is inadequately treated, because opioid (pain relieving) medicines have been categorized as 'controlled substances', due to concerns about their possible abuse. These medicines are therefore subject to strong international control, &  rendered accessible. Severe under-treatment of pain is reported in more than 150 countries. In 15 countries of the EU-25, medical consumption of opioids (&  other medications that are controlled under these conventions) is close to non-existent, consequently a large number of patients are not treated appropriately for moderate to severe pain. The overall goal of this project, is to undertake applied research into the reasons why opioid medicines for moderate to severe pain &  for the treatment of opioid dependence are not used adequately in 12 European countries &  to elaborate &  disseminate tailor-made recommendations to each country for improving the accessibility, availability &  affordability of controlled medicines, &  disseminate these to governments, health-care professionals, other key decision-making bodies as well as to the general public. The outcome of the research will serve to underpin informed policy decisions on health systems &  more effective &  efficient evidence-based strategies for health therapies (pain management) in 12 European countries, thereby contributing to the realization of the activity area that frames the specific call to which this project responds, Optimizing the Delivery of Health Care to European Citizens &  the overarching EU values of 'universality, access to good health care, equity &  solidarity, aiming to make provision that is patient-centred &  responsive to individual need'.'", 396303.0, 2367348.0, 7, 11, "ATOME", "http://www.atome-project.eu/", "http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163144.jpg", "fp7_92685_996697505"]]}}}}
