It will contextual this in Global, European, national, regional and local arenas. The Action Plan involves refining Case Studies of replicable and scalable SiS activities for children with an associated pan European benchmarking and mutual agreement process, which will provide vehicles for strategic and political alignment, as well as shared assessment tools.\nThese core WPs will be enriched by WPs which systematically engage three critical groups: young people, students and Key Players. The focus will be on children with ability, who are currently least likely to progress to study science in post secondary education. It will also combine the science and society agenda with the social inclusion agenda through entrepreneurship as well as considering the ethics of activities.\nThe capturing the mutual learning will be priortised and robustly disseminating and communicating this in regional, national, European arenas and beyond, specifically targeting newcomers. The totality of the activities of the consortium will be externally evaluated and all actors will be assisted to reflect on the \u2018Partnership Learning\u2019 that has occurred. This will be captured as an example of mobilising mutual learning for future European initiatives.\nKey to the project will be the active participation of young people, exploring their perceptions and understanding of science. Learning from them as the scientists of the future. The Action Plan will be systematically promoted in Europe and beyond, with the goal of having at least 20 Ministers for Education presenting the same certificates to children in 20 countries in the final year and a Children\u2019s Gateway to the website of every University in the World", 15871.0, 3810332.0, 12, 19, "SIS CATALYST", "http://www.siscatalyst.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015-08/161215.jpg", "fp7_99851_964274382"]]}}, "3JE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "WANNABE INTERNATIONAL! - Youth exchange", "Creative Communities CIC", 9785.0, 2, 2, "WANNABE INTERNATIONAL! (Youth exchange - 2 countries - 22 participants + 4 youth workers - CUMBRIA, UK - 1st to 8th of September 2018)\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to build mobility and raise aspirations in the participating groups. Conducting an exchange will foster mutual understanding, improved communication and allow participants to enjoy and understand another EU member states culture. Activities will provide opportunities to build skills and confidence and through the whole project young people will get to know others participants and exchange life experiences. The objectives of project are: to provide the youngsters better possibilities in future, regarding their international experience during this project. The project gives the young people the opportunity to work together and be involved in the process of preparing, implementation and evaluation of the exchange, through which they try to develop their personal skills, knowledge and attitude as listed in the learning outcomes. Providing them opportunity to work on their own needs and wishes regarding to exchange and gaining new experiences through action is essential in the project. One of the main objective is also improving youngsters language skills and awareness of other cultures based on the young people\u2019s own wishes. Because youngster will cooperate in the whole process of exchange, they will have opportunity to develop english language skills, working with youngsters from other countries, that are taking part in the project. In the preparation time, we will provide them online language course, what will bring all of them together and provide them opportunity of speaking a foreign language.  and make constructive intercultural dialog. The project is providing opportunities for youngsters to build resilience in everyday life. An important objective is to increase self-esteem of participants and provide all the information and opportunities from the EU programme. Youth exchange has long term results, that will have an impact on the local communities involved as well as on international cooperation in the future. We also see that this project links to the need of the education system and the structure of society not giving many possibilities for youngsters to be active or to know they could be active. We want to create a space open to creativity, to encourage active discourse and to promote new knowledge/skills exchanges between countries. We want to improve our tools where possible, participate and be active, not passive listeners. \r\n\r\nThe group of young people will take part in a range of activities. The activities are designed to present an appropriate challenge to the young people and offer opportunities to work together and develop new skills. The full list of activities is attached in a programme plan, but broadly activities will include:\r\n\r\n1) Cultural exchange activity\r\nYoung people will prepare presentations about their lives, where they live, what they like and what problems they face. Each country will share their presentations with young people from the exchange country and similarities/ differences will be highlighted. It will be the catalyst to kickstart conversations allowing young people to share life experiences and learn from people of another culture.\r\n\r\n2) Teambuilding Activities\r\nThese activities will take place in the areas surrounding a Cumbrian youth centre. It may be raft building next to a lake or canoing. All these activities will be fully risk assessed and carried out by experienced professionals (and of course insured and appropriate to the needs and abilities of the group)\r\n\r\n3) Creative Challenge\r\nThe groups will work with a local artist and be set a challenge to make an object inspired by nature and their personal experiences. This will provide opportunities for collaboration and ideas exchange.\r\n\r\n4) Life skills\r\nBudgeting, planning and preparing a meal is a valuable and sometimes underestimated challenge. It will offer young people the chance to carry out a specific task in a new country, where they will have to collaborate to succeed.\r\n\r\n5) Knowledge exchange\r\nThis will be an opportunity for both young people and youth workers to share ideas and experience of best practice in youth work, to see what works for groups with differing needs/backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe methodology of all these activities is learning by doing, with opportunities to reflect and modify participants approaches. Experimentation is encouraged in a safe, supportive and inclusive environment.", "http://www.facebook.com/artlocatesme", null, "erasmus_2018-2-FI01-KA105-047380_1"]]}}}}
