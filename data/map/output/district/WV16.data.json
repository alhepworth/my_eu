When a car is repaired the spot welding parameters can be different as the mass production machinery used in manufacture can no longer be used. The repairer often is not an expert at inspecting spot welds. Assured reliability of the spot weld is paramount, since the integrity of the spot welds is vital to the crash performance of a car and the safety of its passengers. Therefore, there is a need for a rapid non-destructive inspection device that can be operated by somebody without specialist skills. SpotTrack proposal is for creating the first automatic spot weld tracking device that can be applied non-destructively in the automotive repair industry.\n\nThe only inspection option available to body repair shops today is to create a spot weld on an off-cut and carry out a \u2018peel test\u2019 on it, which is destructive. However, the assumption that the test spot weld is identical to the one on the car can be unsatisfactory. In some cases the spot weld may not be tested at all. The new SpotTrack device will allow the user to quickly and reliably tell whether a spot weld is acceptable by giving a simple pass or fail indication. The proposed SpotTrack system will have the advantage of testing the actual weld made within a matter of seconds and without the need for interpretation. Most importantly it will ensure that the actual spot welds going into service are safe.", 163513.0, 1207323.0, 7, 9, "SpotTrack", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112547.jpg", "fp7_100886_964620478"]]}}, "4EU": {"nhs": {"data": [["R1D", "Bridgnorth Hospital", "nhs_R1D22"]]}}, "4RN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Systemic large scale eco-innovation to advance circular economy and mineral recovery from organic waste in Europe", "Rika Biofuel Developments Ltd", "SYSTEMIC will reach a break-through to re-enter recovered nutrients from organic waste into the production cycle.

Hence originated the strategic nature of this project, aiming at providing 80 STUDENTS and 28 QUALIFIED / HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES with the opportunity to acquire and develop technical, professional, linguistic and intercultural skills. This will be possible through 30 days internships (for the former) and 90 days internships (for the others) within an international professional context.

In MECHMOB we have pursued this same pattern by involving all levels: from professionals schools, to technical schools, to ITS, enhancing skills usable also in the IFTS courses within the planned LO.\r\nMECHMOB was born within the new Professional-Technical School (PTS) Eureka, which is a technical and professional school headed by ITIS Galileo Galilei in Arezzo, specialising in the innovation of mechanical processes and products as well as in mechatronics. PTS Eureka was founded with the aim of creating a network between schools, universities, training agencies and businesses, in order to strengthen the alternation school / work and to make paths of professional qualification more effective, up to the apprenticeship experience.\r\n\r\nEureka is the only mechanic PTS in South Tuscany.

It should be unerlined that, in 2015-2016, the Institute has consolidated, in the preparatory phase of the actual proposal, relationships with training centres and international companies, already mentioned in its internationalization plan (e.g. Vuste Envis, Cap Ulysse), and created new contacts with companies able to identify and implement quality training in accordance with the participants\u2019 profile.In addition to the international mobility project, The Institute - in 2015 - has consolidated the relationship with local companies that declared their availability to participate in the selection process of candidates and to the final evaluation of the project and its impact. They have also identified apprentiship paths at local level to increase students occupability and training courses about tutoring an counseling for teachers to complement mobility experieneces in 2016-2017.Operational actions specifically for project management of the actual proposal are; -signing MOU for single professional profile;-Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the Vet card request.
