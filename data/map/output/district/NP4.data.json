The high production costs and problems related to obtaining reliable components explain that the utilization of piezo actuators up to now is far from having reached its full potential. Noliac and its partners for the IP are proposing a radical innovation in the piezoelectricity field, based on an enhanced understanding of materials degradation. This will greatly improve the properties of long actuators, and thereby allow end-users to use them for new industrial applications. The actuators shall be able to sustain extreme conditions, including high temperature, humid environment, and high pressure and will provide extreme long-term reliability.  The activities are divided in 4 work areas: \u2022 Research in materials degradation and the development of ceramics, which offer better resistance to crack initiation and propagation and are less sensitive to extreme conditions (WP2-WP4). \u2022 Two parallel approaches are followed to improve the interdigitated electrode technology for deposition ultra-narrow electrode paths in the laminated piezo materials (WP5-WP6). \u2022 The development of optimized final components will be insured by the combination of the new piezoelectric materials with the new electrode technology (WP7). \u2022 Industrial applications for the automotive-, production- and wind power industries.

The ink formulations will be tested on a case study through printing of a thin film battery. The general objective of the project is to scale-up the ink formulations to pilot line ensuring large volume fabrication of new products with improved properties for printing application. Especially, the particles definition at nanometer size will be one key parameter for the compatibility in ink jet printing. Moreover, knowledge will also be generated on electrochemical inks formulation and additives used in order to stabilize the ink products. \nThe concept of nanomaterials for printing application will be applied to flexible printed electronics and more specifically to printed batteries. These printed batteries are needed as power source at the closest part and the development of printed electronics so as to as to design an all-in-one product allowing better process ability in ink jet process for 3D design and 2D screen printing process.\nBASMATI will also provide a new source of nanomaterials for the formulation of conductive and electrochemical inks. These nanomaterials will be metallic particle (Ni, Cu, Al) that will be usable for numerous applications of printed electronic on flexible substrate. Another type of nanomaterials will be layered positive active material such as LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) and olivine LiFePO4 (LFP). \nThe know-how level reached in BASMATI by research groups and transfer and up-scale to pilots (TRL 6) at SMEs and industry facilities will pave the way for future industrialization of inks formulations production for mass markets such as printed electronics.

It will take advantage of the excellent physical properties of diamond and gallium nitride heterostructures. The association of the two materials will give rise to the best materials and devices for ultimate performance in extreme environments. Both materials possess durability and robustness to high temperature, radiation and electric field. Diamond material exhibits the best mechanical robustness and thermal conductivity, while GaN presents also high electron mobility, giving high power handling and efficiency. III-N systems have other desirable properties for sensor applications in extreme environments.  It is the only highly polar semiconductor matrix that has ceramic-like stability and can form heterostructures.  It has the highest spontaneous polarisation with a Curie temperature above 1000\u00b0C for AlN: a lattice matched III-N heterostructure with a built-in polarisation discontinuity is expected to enable transistor action above 1000\u00b0C.
