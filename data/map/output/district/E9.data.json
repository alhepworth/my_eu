This innovative initiative will seek to develop new audiences, deepen engagement and extend the reach of positive participation in the arts across Europe.Artists who work collaboratively connect with non-artists in the creation of contemporary artwork. Collaborative Arts, more than most forms of art making, is fundamentally based on principles of participation and democratization. In collaborative arts the non-artist participants (community member, young person, hospital work, scientist etc.) can become both co-creator and new arts audience.  Collaborative Art by its nature affirms the right of everyone to take part in cultural life.  Historically this work has seen artists co-create with communities, connected to social, political and environmental agendas and quite often marginalised groups and culturally diverse communities. The different strands of the work programme will cumulatively build skills and competences, and offer professional development opportunities for artists through a series of workshops, artist residencies, arts commissions, presentations and a final cultural showcase.  The COLLAB Arts Partnership Programme was initiated as a pilot for the first time during Ireland\u2019s hosting of the EU Presidency in 2013 by lead partner Create Ireland in tandem with founding partners Tate Liverpool (UK); Live Art Development Agency (UK) and m-cult (Finland).  The original partners have been joined by Hablar an Arte (Spain), Agora (Germany), Kunsthalle Osnabruck (Germany) and Ludwig Museum (Hungary).", "http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk", null, "creative_552219-CREA-1-2014-1-IE-CULT-COOP2_3"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Jardins nourriciers, assiettes gourmandes", "Public Works ltd.", 2823.0, 3, 3, "In a context of economic and social transition in Europe, four organisations active in the fields of youth and social inclusion have decided to work together on the development of a youth exchange project.\r\nThe project will bring together 18 young Europeans and provide them with a framework for a common reflection on the construction of a Europe committed to the responsible use of resources and to inclusive growth.

The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth acknowledges lifelong learning. The crisis has highlighted the major role which adult learning can play in achieving the Europe 2020 goals, by enabling adults to improve their ability to adapt to changes in the labour market and society. Virtual learning and virtual competency development paralell with the implementation of e-work provides a means of up-skilling for those affected by unemployment, restructuring and career transitions, as well as makes an important contribution to social inclusion, active citizenship and personal development.\r\nNowadays business becomes global and competition worldwide is increasing among young  adults. They have to compete not only for the better jobs, but for their employability. One of the possibilities to become more attractive for the employers is to start learning in a new way, become virtual learners,  E-Workers and to become more flexible workforce. Preparing oneself for \u201cvirtual working environment\u201d is not an easy task and can not be learned alone.  Good training tools and professional e-tutors are required to assist the learing process. One must understand how to work and learn in a virtual environment, how to communicate, how to distribute tasks, how to work in virtual teams in order to succeed in an on-line environment, where usuall methods are not available. \r\nThough there may be no need for an homogeneous training system for adult educators, there is a need for a competence-building  framework based on approaches to learning such as developing virtual tutoring, on-line collaboration,  tutoring, e-learning, peer learning, e-assessment (1st Youth Work Convention). There are tools already developed, it is time to transfer them to young adult learners, to improve them where needed, to  disseminate them and to identify needs for further instruments(Youth Pathways 2.0 ). \r\nExisting gaps: \r\n(a)lack of development tool kits for  young adults, future e-employees to measure skills and build development plan in order to meet the requirments sufficient e- jobs\r\n(a)lack of access for young adult learners to virtual competency development training  in order to up-skills\r\n(c) lack of training material and access to training for educators,potential e-tutors to prepare new way of teaching(virtual class)\r\n(d)SMEs lack prepared indoor e-tutors to support changes and implement virtual leanring and ework\r\nBased on existing e-work related tool-kits developed by prior LLL project(that became \"best practices\" of the program), this project builds on these results and adds innovation by adopting, transferring knowledge and developing further innovative outputs to fill the gap.

We consider that improvements will be made in all of these areas.\r\n1. One of our main priorities is to work on staff competences regarding the knowledge of Spanish language, so they can eventually use it  in their classrooms in a daily basis, spread the use of Spanish around the school and  deliver their own Spanish lessons. Our aim is also to have a Spanish speaking  school, where pupils can find interactive displays in Spanish that can help them with their learning,and where children and staff can use Spanish greetings.\r\n\r\n2.We also want to embed the use of CLIL in our classrooms and we know that this is really well implemented in Spanish schools ,so observe and learn form our link school will give a boost to our good practice. We want to link Arts and Spanish making art lessons more European and international rather than focusing only on UK  art. We think is important to have a broader knowledge of  the world, and a good way to show children about different cultures through art and combining it with a language is definitely a good idea for a better engagement.\r\n\r\n3.Implementing the use of ICT in our teaching and learning is also one of our key priorities. Therefore observing how our link school does it and sharing good practice with them, will definitely be mutually beneficial. \r\n\r\n4.We aim for an European and international dimension to be central in our curriculum.\r\nWe consider that these elements of the curriculum that teach pupils to be open minded and curious about other places peoples and cultures across Europe and internationally  are essential life skills for them,  to get to be good citizens.\r\nWe strive to use the criteria for the International School Award to develop and monitor our provision and to work towards the achievement of the Full Accreditation for the International School Award\r\n\r\n5.We wish to embed the link with a partner school in Spain to our school's life. We are certain that a strong sustainable link will be a real incentive for both pupils and staff to develop their Spanish competences and engage them more with both the language and culture. The mobility will offer a great opportunity to share good practice and learn new techniques. It will also give the pupils a real audience for the work in Spanish using at the same time ICT tool to share them with pupils from our partner school.\r\nDuring the whole length of our project our aim is to involve pupils  giving them the change to express their opinions and views to shape the project as it proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know that our objectives are ambitious but we have a clear view of what we want the outcomes of the project to be.\r\nSome of the outcomes, such as the development of staff competences, will be developed through the project and monitored by the SLT of our school through our PDI process.\r\nWe wish as many of our staff as possible to avail themselves of this CPD opportunity. We have, therefore, requested a two year project where 10 members of staff can take part in mobilities. We know that in order to have a major impact on the life of the school, we need to have a whole school approach and buy-in from all staff. However, in order to maximise the participants' use of Spanish whilst on the course, we are suggesting that no more than 5 at a time take part in the mobility thus cutting down on the temptation to resort to English instead of Spanish.\r\nWe have found a structured training course which we believe will meet all the areas that we have identified as meeting our needs.\r\nThe 7 day course will involve intensive language classes at a level appropriate to each person; planned and supervised activities which will involve the application of the language learnt  in a variety of assessed situations; cultural visits and activities lead by the course organiser and delivered in Spanish with the carrying out of assessed activities; observations of CLIL lessons and the sharing of good practice from our own school; planning of initial joint work which will be developed in both settings between the mobilities with outcomes shared and further developed during each mobility.

We have a large percentage of pupils from a low socio-economic background who are ethnically diverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nAim\r\nOur aim is to spread the teaching of ICT in the curriculum through the innovative teaching of literacy and language learning  together with the exchange of knowledge and pedagogy which will support the idea of working in partnership with our Spanish school.  In undertaking this aim we hope to meet the needs of our pupils in a modern technological society and equip them to be literate, life-long learners across borders in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nWe hope to work in collaboration with our partner teachers  in Spain in order to improve staff compentency in the use of ICT as a motivation and an innovation in the teaching and learning of Literacy  and Language through the curriculum.  We envisage that teachers will meet, plan lessons together and share resources throughout the project. Pupils will undergo preparatory lessons, sharing their work at regular intervals and then work together on planned  study visits to complete the outcomes of each task.  Together they will experience learning ICT skills through role play, drama, animations & puppetry, creating  videos / films, blogging, skyping, databases,  The children will use the skills of collaboration, planning, drafting ,editing, analysis,etc.,, to create bi-lingual resources that can be used after activities or in the future.  Through these activities they will apply the literacy and language they are learning and use them for a real purpose.\r\n\r\nResults & Impact\r\nAs the project evolves the work of staff and pupils will be  evalualated through shared assessment systems in order to measure the progress being made and the impact on the school and those taking part in the project.  \r\n\r\nWe expect this innovation, the use of ICT and the ability to have a transnational aspect to the project, will increase staff and pupil motivation.  Pupils will improve their communication, critical thinking, listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in Literacy and Language  and will gain confidence in presenting work to their peers in a different physical and cultural environment.\r\n\r\nGlobal Dimension\r\nThe nature of the project lends itself well to promoting the global dimension of young citizens of the world.

The children were immediately enthused by this new subject.  Once members of the school community felt comfortable with this new subject on the curriculum, we reached out to the wider European community and found a partner school.  This has proved to have been a very successful relationship with communication between teachers, and pupils of both schools via postcard, letters and email.  The children have learned about each other through their letters and visits where they have met each other face to face.  There was an extremely high level of engagement in the children's learning whether it was when learning the language or preparing work through the curriculum to share with their penpals.  Using the language as a tool for communication in real and relevant situations had an inspiring effect.Now we are in the process of changing to Spanish at KS2  at the request of our local authority and need to improve the language competency of Staff in the new language.  The Erasmus+ programme is ideally placed to support this.  Whilst looking at this need  we have also taken this opportunity to review our School Development Plan, European Development Plan and  school curriculum offer. At present our teachers' needs in terms of improving their Spanish language learning has been identified as a priority if we are to make new relationships with schools in Spain. Looking at our School and European Development plans we also noted  that we needed to further enhance our curriculum through internationalism.  We also saw this as an opportunity to give teachers a framework in which to develop their leadership skills.To this end, with the support of the Erasmus+ programme we hope to: - improve staff language competency through a periods of intensive language learning in Spain over the next two years, supported by highly qualified staff - address the need to further enhance the curriculum with an aspect of  internationalism through communication between partner schools and collaboration in joint projects at a level that engages and inspires pupils and staff.   - Participants on the programme would be able to develop their leadership skills through sharing  methodology and best practice with colleagues in training sessions. Some of the activities we will conduct are regular language learning sessions as a follow up to the courses in Spain; the sharing of planning and resources through different media with our partner school; creation of joint projects that reflect a global dimension; presentation of these projects through various electronic media, assemblies, staff meetings and conferences via the Hackney Spanish Network.Before and throughout the Erasmus+ programme targets for our needs (language, curriculum, internationalism, leadership) will be set and reviewed at regular intervals by the SLT member (curriculum), Phase Leaders, MFL Subject Leader and course participants as approriate in their roles of responsibility.  This will be done through meetings, training, coaching and team teaching.Improving language competency and bringing a element of internationalism to the school through Erasmus+ will inspire and engage the teaching and learning taking place.  Pupils will see language learning not only as a subject but a tool through which other things can be learned.  They will experience a global dimension to their learning and learn empathy and tolerance of other nations.  They will also see their teachers modelling the ethos of life-long learning which we hope they will take with them into adulthood.", "http://www.orchard.hackney.sch.uk", "Orchard Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023934_coordinator"]]}}, "7JF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "CPD for staff to boost skills in language learning and teaching and sharing good practice", "St John of Jerusalem C of E Primary School", 17049.0, 1, 1, "We have newly introduced Spanish as our MFL to KS2.

We have recently linked with a partner school in Madrid and are excited and enthused to develop this partnership so our children are motivated to learn and understand about the European Dimension. The objective being that they eventually become better Global Citizens. To do this we are aware that staff members need to be developed at all levels. By giving the opportunity of participating in these courses to as many staff as possible, we aim to make the European/Spanish dimension a key part of our school life. In addition to these courses we wish to build a strong, mutually beneficial and sustainable relationship with our Spanish partners. We will begin to share and develop resources and good practice with the school and children and parents will be involved in our communication. We will use eTwinning as a platform for sharing our projects and look forward to welcoming members from our partner school to London and our school. The problem of Post Code wars should diminish when children from this area have a better understanding of the European Dimension and areas outside their Post Codes which have a rich, interesting and enduring  attraction. We are committed to ensuring the abilities of our staff members is enhanced and they feel confident to contribute to the embedding of MFL across the curriculum, and not just the specialist language teacher. \r\nOur project will develop so everyone in our school community is included giving status to those involved in leading projects, designing new curriculum material and disseminating and evaluating the the outcomes. All participants will improve their language skills, their cultural understanding and ensure that the pupils in our school have the best possible support in learning Spanish.
