An increasing number of staff are not born in the country.  Therefore linguistic and cultural diversity are challenges underpinning all training needs in this area. \r\nThe six partner countries differ in the extent to which cultural diversity is addressed in health institutions (directly or indirectly) i.e. to the extent they offer special measures to facilitate the access to health services for people with different cultural backgrounds.\r\nSeveral good initiatives exist in Denmark, Austria the UK and Italy, however, there is still a strong need for dissemination and mainstreaming of intercultural approaches and best practices.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue the \u201cHealthy Diversity\u201d HEAD project offers innovative ICT based training tools to address cultural diversity in the health sector \u2013 both in terms of the client / patient groups served and the diversity of the personnel of the health institutions.  This implies the development of the intercultural competences of health professionals as well as the development of health institutions\u2019 capacity to handle diversity.\r\n\r\nOur ICT-supported training tools would address the following target groups:\r\n\u2022 Health professionals working with multicultural patient / client groups:\r\nA compendium of critical incidents, a reader of medical anthropology and a training in intercultural skills would develop their competences for understanding and negotiate the patients\u2019 concerns as well as to establish and maintain a rapport necessary for a successful treatment.\r\n\u2022 Managers of health service providers and decision-makers: \r\nA collection of innovative practices will serve as benchmark and model for the adaptation of local solutions to address diversity.\r\n\u2022 Institutions providing continuous / initial education for health professionals\r\nThe testing and evaluation phase of the training materials developed will involve these institutions with the aim of both quality assurance and improvement but also further exploitation of these results.\r\n\r\nTo achieve our objectives we wish to \r\na) Map the impact of diversity on health sector through case oriented research \r\nb) Identify and share existing best practices addressing diversity in the health sector.\r\nc) Based on these develop a curricula and set of training materials available online.\r\nd) Run a series of multiplier events and blended mobility for health professionals \r\ne) Lobby healthcare decision makers on the need for cultural diversity underpinning training in the future. \r\n\r\n \u201cHealthy Diversity\u201d addresses VET targetting health professionals attending multicultural patient / client groups, health service providers and institutions providing continuous / initial education for such professionals.   We also aim to influence key decision makers at senior levels of management and governance.

But predominantly it enables higher energy conversion efficiency by ensuring that prime movers are effectively loaded at all times and across all operating conditions. This dominating advantage cannot be matched by mechanical transmission systems because gearboxes offer little chance of integrating a high number of prime movers in the restricted space of a ship whereas this integration is straight forward when managed electrically. Thus the electric ship concept offers reduced emissions through improved efficiency of engine operation but critically it offers significant reduced emissions during the critical phase of entry to littoral water when with speed generally reduced engines in a mechanical systems become very lightly loaded.\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to enhance the electric ship concept so it suits a wider range of vessels than currently. The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in merchant ships is the size of the equipment. However if size reductions can be achieved then adopting the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships will, as described above, reduce emissions and improve the impact on global warming. Overall this impact will be significant given the current and anticipated levels of global trade and the proportion to be moved by sea transport.\n\n\n\nThis challenging ambition, to enable the adoption of the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships, will demand the development of new technologies across all of marine electrical engineering:\n\n\n\n1.  High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS): This is a technology that allows smaller principal electrical components and an increase in efficiency.\n\n\n\n2.  Wireless monitoring:  This provides simpler internal control communication and enables the adoption of more advanced control regimes (as offered by the electrification of propulsion).\n\n\n\n3.  Harbour Shore Electrical Supplies: Running lightly loaded generators in harbour - as is commonly the practice among merchant ship operators - threatens the environment in a sensitive zone. The lack of any propulsion load prevents loading the generators more effectively. The answer is to supply the ship with electricity from shore connections. This does not need technological innovation but the widespread adoption of shore supplies demands standardisation among connectors and mode of electrical supply that has yet to be investigated.\n\n\n\n4.  Electrical actuation: This is a technology which aims to replace mechanically actuated auxiliaries by using direct electrical actuators and reduces size, cost, maintenance and improves efficiency\n\n\n\nThe benefits of these proposed innovations will be tested by developing designs for specific ship types: multi-purpose, cruise and container. The integration process will be composed of 6 steps:\n\n\n\n1  Ship mission\n\n\n\n2  Energy consumers\n\n\n\n3  Draft design\n\n\n\n4  Performance simulations\n\n\n\n5  Final design\n\n\n\n6  Environmental impact.\n\n\n\nTo reduce costs only the design for the multi-purpose ship will be taken through all the six steps. The remaining 2 ship types will only be taken through steps 1 to 3.\n\n\n\nFinally, the innovative HTSC technology will be demonstrated in a land demonstrator, scaled as much as possible to reduce costs, while retaining relevance of the demonstration to full scale implementation. This demonstrator will include: the propulsion system, including an HTSC propulsion motor and its power converter, a DC distribution system with innovative protection and an HTSC segment, and various auxiliary loads.", 3906957.0, 18860929.0, 8, 34, "POSE\u00b2IDON", "http://www.poseidon-ip.eu/index.php/", "http://www.converteam.com", null, "fp7_90101_999527868"]]}}, "1EH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Fresh Start", "The Avon Valley School and Performing Arts College", 60550.0, 1, 1, "Avon Valley School and Performing Arts College is a larger than average 11-16 school in an area where selection to grammar schools remains an option.

The main objective of Integ-micro is the research and development of new hybrid and reconfigurable multitasking machines and combined processes based on integration of different ultra high precision techniques for the generation of 3D complex shape microcomponents made from different kinds of materials. Multitasking micromachining can be best described as the ability to perform multiple machining operations in one workholding configuration. This guarantees greater accuracy, reduced handling and plant area, faster throughput and increased productivity. The availability of several machining technologies on a single machine allows important synergies between the different machining methods. For instance, combining machining by chip removal and laser micro machine will provide the capability to remove (by laser) the burr remaining from the previous chip removal operation. Alternatively, chip removal machining and laser LIGA technique can be combined in order to machine small components that could not be produced otherwise. The project will bring high added value thanks to the minimum time loss in setting new production lines for strategic products through short reconfiguration time and reduced ramp-up phase.
