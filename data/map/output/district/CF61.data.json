Youth work - both local and international - can help to move from isolation and confrontation towards dialogue and exchange. However, this poses a challenge for trainers and youth workers who need the right skills and attitudes to facilitate productive encounters between groups, as well as open and honest exchanges within groups. This training course addresses this by exploring various dialogue formats to enable partner organizations to run new and improved dialogue projects. It further serves to produce videos and a step-by-step manual to further share the dialogue approach. Over the past few years, we have developed a set of methods that we believe are very useful for anyone who endeavours to bring different people together - whether they differ by nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class or political attitudes. Most of these methods are rather simple conversation formats that shift the emphasis from convincing someone towards listening for real understanding, yet their delivery requires practice.\r\n\r\nTherefore this training course will: \r\n** acquaint youth workers with different methods to facilitate dialogue across divides \r\n** enable youth workers to experience such dialogues and to practice facilitating them \r\n** encourage youth workers to share their experiences, learn from each other and broaden their professional network\r\n** support youth workers to reflect on their personal motivations and barriers in facilitation intercultural dialogue \r\n** help youth workers in planning dialogues and the dissemination of the approach, both locally and internationally \r\n\r\nIt will take place in October 2018 in Maastricht, and bring together youth workers and youth leaders from all across Europe. The training will be delivered by trainers from the Maastricht Dialogue Foundation and emPOWER Training, and involve participants from 11 other partners who were selected for their ability to put the learnings into practice over the next year and thus to benefit young people directly, as well as for the diversity of outlooks, approaches and experiences they bring. \r\n\r\nDuring the training, participants will experience and practice different dialogue methods (including quality dialogue, topical dialogue, evaluative dialogue), reflect deeply on their personal motivation and journey through a meditative labyrinth activity, and form a peer group willing to support each other in the implementation. In addition, they will share their experiences and learnings from their prior work and spend time planning the next steps for themselves and their organizations. Then they will receive coaching from their peers and the trainers to refine these. We expect the participants to gain the ability and motivation to improve or initiate projects in their organizations that promote self-awareness, empathy and communication skills while developing a better understanding of others, building relationships across divides, engaging harder to reach groups and increasing the commitment to fundamental European values. We hope that the follow-up activities will help to transform public discourse at both the local and the European level away from confrontation and towards more understanding. To that end, we will create videos and a step-by-step manual to the methods and work with all partners to disseminate these widely among youth workers and organizations that can benefit from the approach.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL02-KA105-002020_10"]]}}}}
