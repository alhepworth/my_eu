Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period.
