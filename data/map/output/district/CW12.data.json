The main aim of our institution and educational policy is to combat early school leaving. Working with Erasmus+ and offering placements is a way to motivate pupils for choosing vocational training and to finish school and training because they can spend some time abroad during their apprenticeship period. \r\n\r\nThis project will be one of 3 actions that will be coordinated by Vestfold county council the next few years. I 2017 we planned a consortium with staff mobility, where 8 out of 10 of the upper secondary schools in our region will take part in a Erasmus+ prosject. We write a new applicaton for staff mobility in 2018.  We have also received funding for a partnership project which will start in 2018. Mobility for apprentices in VET is considered a very interesting possibility to make vocational training attractive, and to offer something extra for young persons who need more challenges and who are curious about other countries and vocational training abroad.

These participants are for example technicians for illumination advertisements, electricians for automation engineering, chemical lab assistants, metal workers and technical assistants in the field of design.\r\nSo far we have organized VETPRO-projects for trainers and teachers which took them to our partners abroad for one week. Last year they worked under the title \u201cTeaching the European Way\u201d. Our IVT-projects under the title \u201cDifferent Places-Different Faces\u201d enabled our students to work for three weeks in Finland, Rumania, Malta, Great Britain and on the Spanish island of La Palma.\r\nAll those activities are now coming together with ERASMUS+ and the GEK is now offering future participants to work under the title \u201cIVT quality+\u201d. In addition to our successful student mobility, we are now planing to apply for strategic partnerships for those students who won\u2019t be able to stay abroad for that long. \r\nBut the GEK does not only send students abroad, we also welcome our partner school\u2019s students from Finland here in the Rhineland area. The teachers and trainers of the GEK organize accommodation and internships with our cooperating companies in the field of electrical engineering, chemistry and design. These internships usually last from four to six weeks.\r\nOur project implementation has been consistently improved and is now divided into three main stages: The first stage is the application phase. In this stage students qualify by participating in cross-cultural preparation lessons. Here they also create a europass CV in English and pass a mobility interview, to show their motivation to work abroad. This stage ends in an intercultural evening which prepares all the participants for their upcoming departure day.\r\nThe second stage is their actual stay abroad. During this time, the students are monitored, both by the local partners as well as the responsible teachers and trainers of the GEK. The participants document their linguistic, intercultural and professional impressions and experiences in a travel diary called \u201cTravelog\u201d. The Travelog is also an important instrument of the third stage of the mobility project. This is where the evaluation of the experience abroad is going to take place. With the help of the Travelog their gained competence are documented and can be comprehended. Later on these competences are used to fill out the europass Mobility certificate.\r\nThe project results, their benefits as well as their impact are closely related. The Europass Mobility is one example. It is used for future applications by our trainees after the end of their vocational training. This document increases their career prospects on both the national and European job market. \r\nOur collaboration with regional companies that employ apprentices of our foreign project partners, often results in the decrease of language barriers and more cultural acceptance. By implementing our European mobilities we do not only spread the idea of Europe within the GEK but also increasingly on a regional level.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001997_6"]]}}, "4RG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Excellence in French teaching", "Astbury St Mary's Primary School", 7137.0, 1, 1, "Our school currently does some French teaching, but we are keen to improve and extend this provision and to give our children an excellent experience of language learning. We believe that the key to this is to offer our staff excellent training opportunities so that they are able to teach French to a very good standard. This will motivate our children and lead to better teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this we will offer our children the opportunity to communicate face-to-face with French children of their own age and, through this, to develop a much better understanding of French life and culture. We would like to focus on celebrations, customs and traditions within our cultures and use these to gain a better understanding of our similarities and differences.\r\n\r\nWe also intend to give our children the opportunity to use effective, high quality resources. \r\n\r\nAnother of our objectives in this project is to revise and strengthen the professional profile of our staff. We believe that this training will equip them to be able to teach languages at any level in any school in their future careers and also to be able to pass on their skills through the development of training courses.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to extend our French teaching to Key stage I and early years.\r\n\r\nWe intend to use this project to further develop our links with parents and the local community.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve 8 members of staff and 2 governors taking part in a training course in France which will involve language, culture, methodology, teaching activities and time in a French school. They will then be involved in dissemination of their skills through training sessions for the rest of the staff when they come back.\r\n\r\nThis will lead to all our staff having a great increase in their confidence to teach languages and a better language learning experience for our children. Through this we hope to raise attainment, build long-lasting links and give our staff the confidence to move forward in their careers.", "http://www.astburyschool.org.uk", "Astbury St Mary's Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000044_coordinator"]]}}}}
