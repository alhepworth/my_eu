We are currently at the early stages of introducing this.\r\n\r\nWe would like to take a creative, cross curricular approach to introducing languages right from the beginning. We already work closely with our cluster schools, and would like to be able to mutually support each other. \r\n\r\nWe need language training for our staff so that Spanish can be taught confidently throughout Key Stage 2. We also need to give our staff the chance to understand language teaching methodology. We would like to involve the whole school in this, particularly the senior management team.\r\n\r\nWe want to develop a link with a school in Spain as we feel that this is essential in order to teach Spanish properly and to give our children and understanding of the culture. \r\n\r\nWe plan to create a Spanish web page on our school website and to offer some really exciting cultural events in our school that will involve all our children, parents and other schools.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the above aims, we plan a project over the course of two years. This would involve sending seven members of staff, which will include the Head Teacher and Assistant Head Teacher, to take part in training courses in Spain. We will be able to use this course to help us to plan our teaching in a way that will be enjoyable and fun but will also have clear learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nWe believe that there will be a great impact on our school from this project. Our staff will be more skilled and confident enough to be able to teach the requirements of the curriculum and give our children a really positive experience of learning Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe impact on the children will include having more opportunities, having very enjoyable first experience of learning Spanish which will impact on their view of language learning in general and mean that they are more likely to continue with languages throughout their lives. They will also increase their understanding of life in another country and will be able to develop friendships with Spanish children through the link that we will establish at the Spanish school.\r\n\r\nSpanish will be given more time and higher status as a result of this project. We will plan to embed Spanish across the curriculum and within other subject areas. \r\n\r\nWe will have regular contact with our link school using eTwinning and other methods. We will also develop a web page on the school\u2019s website in which we will upload and share resources. A great impact will be our school\u2019s plan to organise cultural events which will be open to everyone in our school including parents and the local community and also to other schools within our cluster.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this will have a great effect on the enjoyment of Spanish within our school and local area and will increase everyone\u2019s motivation. \r\n\r\nLong term impacts will include developing a love of languages (both staff and pupils), a general increase in attainment and better future opportunities for staff and children.", "http://www.stleonardslangho.org.uk", "St Leonard's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001966_coordinator"]]}}}}
