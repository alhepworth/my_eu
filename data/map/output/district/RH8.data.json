Humans could be overwhelmed by fast changes of potentially dangerous incidents occurring at confined environments with mass-gathering. They could fail to make objective decisions to find their way to safety. This condition may lead to mass panic and make emergency management more challenging. In eVACUATE, the intelligent fusion of sensors, geospatial and contextual information, with advanced multi-scale crowd behaviour detection and recognition will be developed. The structured fusion of sensing information with dynamic estimated uncertainties on behaviour predictions will advance eVACUATE crowd dynamic models; and virtual reality simulations of crowds in confined environments.  A service oriented Decision-Support System shall be developed to dynamically distribute on-demand evacuation information to emergency management actors as the crisis unfolds. Decision-makers at the command posts, first responders, front-line stewards and volunteers receive real-time situation aware information of updated evacuation strategies using robust and resilient eVACUATE information and communication infrastructure. Smart spaces of electronic, audio and other mobile devices shall be connected to the integrated system to provide safer evacuation routings for people. The eVACUATE system performance and scalability will be validated in four distinct scenarios involving incidents with large crowd at various venues with the requirements of evacuation time reductions and increases of safety and security. These are: 1) Underground stations in Bilbao; 2) Real Sociedad Footbal Stadium in San Sebastian, 3) Athens International Airport and 4) a STX Cruiseship.", 439199.0, 10523860.0, 8, 19, "EVACUATE", "http://www.evacuate.eu/", "http://www.crowddynamics.com", null, "fp7_108077_958270470"], [1493596800000, 1572480000000, "Law Enforcement agencies human factor methods and Toolkit for the Security and protection of CROWDs in mass gatherings", "Crowd Dynamics International Limited", "LETS\u2013CROWD will overcome challenges preventing the effective implementation of the European Security Model (ESM)  with regards to mass gatherings.
