Their work becomes more problematic considering the heterogeneity of threats, the wideness of the surveyed area, the adverse weather conditions and the wide range of terrains. Although there are several research tools and works targeting these areas independently for border surveillance, nowadays border authorities do not have access to an intelligent holistic solution providing all aforementioned functionalities.\nTowards delivering such a solution, ROBORDER aims at developing and demonstrating a fully-functional autonomous border surveillance system with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network. The system will be equipped with adaptable sensing and robotic technologies that can operate in a wide range of operational and environmental settings. To provide a complete and detailed situational awareness picture that supports highly efficient operations, the network of sensors will include static networked sensors such as border surveillance radars, as well as mobile sensors customised and installed on board unmanned vehicles. \nTo succeed implementing an operational solution, a number of supplementary technologies will also be applied that will enable the establishment of robust communication links between the command and control unit and the heterogeneous robots. On top of this, detection capabilities for early identification of criminal activities and hazardous incidents will be developed. This information will be forwarded to the command and control unit that will enable the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous sensor data and the provision of a quick overview of the situation at a glance to the operators, supporting them in their decisions.", 223166.0, 7870662.0, 13, 25, "ROBORDER", "http://roborder.eu/", null, null, "h2020_209949_927024733"], [1496275200000, 1575072000000, "Embedded Network Services for 5G Experiences", "Capritech Limited", "5G ESSENCE addresses the paradigms of Edge Cloud computing and Small Cell as a Service by fuelling the drivers and removing the barriers in  the Small Cell market, forecasted to grow at an impressive pace up to 2020 and beyond and to play a key-role in the 5G ecosystem. 5G ESSENCE provides a highly flexible and scalable platform,able to support new business models and revenue streams by creating a neutral host market and reducing operational costs by providing new opportunities for ownership, deployment,toperation and amortisation.\nThe technical approach exploits the benefits of the centralisation of Small Cell functions as scale grows through an edge cloud environment based on a two-tier architecture: a first distributed tier for providing low latency services and a second centralised tier for providing high processing power for computing-intensive network applications. This  allows decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the benefits of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms will allow sharing the 5G ESSENCE infrastructure among multiple operators/vertical industries and customising its capabilities on a per-tenant basis. The versatility of the architecture is enhanced by high-performance virtualisation techniques for data  isolation, latency reduction and resource efficiency, and by orchestrating lightweight virtual resources enabling efficient Virtualised Network Function placement and live migration. 5G ESSENCE leverages knowledge, SW modules and prototypes from various 5G-PPP Phase-1 projects,SESAME being particularly relevant. Building on these foundations, very ambitious objectives are targeted, culminating with the prototyping and demonstration of 5G ESSENCE system in three real-life use cases associated to vertical industries, i.e., edge network acceleration in a crowded event, mission critical applications, and in-flight communications.", 215839.0, 6996168.0, 9, 22, "5G ESSENCE", null, null, null, "h2020_211072_927024733"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "CAPRITECH LIMITED", 214792.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_3391"], [2017, "CAPRITECH LIMITED", 211668.0, "Fostering secure European societies (18.05.03.01)", "fts_2017_3789"], [2017, "CAPRITECH LIMITED", 10856.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (18.05.50.01)", "fts_2017_33730"]]}}}}
