This learning will then be shared with staff members within and out with Newfield for maximum benefit. There will be one participant for our school and her enthusiasm, hard working attitude and drive to succeed will ensure successful implementation of a modern language programme on return. The activities during the training will teach important vocabulary and greetings. It will immerse the teacher in French culture and provide many opportunities for discussion and reflection on how the materials will support the specific needs of the school. The methodology to deliver this training will include trained modern language teachers who are native to France. Resources provided will be supportive and will include links to modern technology, games and exciting activities which will help demonstrate how best to teach French to the pupils. This experience will hugely improve the candidates confidence, knowledge, skills and abilities in teaching modern languages to young people.
