In Scottish Borders Council all schools have made language learning a priority on their school improvement plans.  Within our cluster French has been chosen as the additional language to be taught from primary 1.  The applicant had no previous French language experience before the policy was introduced but has already undertaken all available CPD courses within the local authority to develop her French skills.  The rural location of Newcastleton Primary School means that CPD courses are located 40 miles away and are are fairly infrequent.  Therefore an immersion course is essential for this teacher to improve her language an grammar skills in French and she has identified this as a further training need as part of her PRD process in consultation with her headteacher.The course activities will include speaking in French with native speakers, learning new cross curricular approaches to teaching languages, developing a cultural awareness of France and using ICT to support engaging teaching methods.   It will also allow the participant to engage in professional dialogue with fellow teachers and share ideas.Following the immersion course the teacher will share new knowledge, skills and resources with other staff in the school to allow a maximum positive impact on the learners at Newcastleton Primary School and our partner school Stirches Primary School.  This will allow learners to raise their attainment in French and be better able to promote French language and culture within our local community.", null, "Newcastleton Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023324_coordinator"]]}}, "7QP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language training", "Stirches Primary School", 1573.0, 1, 1, "This project consists of working towards the development of languages following the Scottish Governments languages 1+2 recommendations. The application is for one primary teacher from Stirches Primary School to take part in the immersion course to build up on the work started in Stirches and Newcatleton schools to implement French into the curriculum by 2020.\r\nThe participant will take part in their own professional development prior to the course (learning key phrases, background reading, learning about the geography of the area they will be visiting). Whilst participating on the course, the activities will include speaking in the target language with native speakers, gaining resources and strategies for cross curricular approaches to teaching languages, developing a modern cultural awareness for the country being visited.  All language skills learned on the course will be used to implement the national, local and schools plans for addressing the Languages 1+2 recommendations from the Scottish Government.\r\nThe aims of this project are to develop staff ability and confidence in the teaching of French. This will in turn enhance the learning experience of the pupils in our schools allowing them to access languages from an earlier stage in their primary career. ICT will be used to enhance and support learning at all stages and will form a key area for how resources are shared and disseminated amongst staff in the schools and learning community. Getting pupils using ICT to communicate with other schools in the UK and abroad will widen their own cultural understanding.\r\nThe long term objective is to equip our staff with the knowledge, confidence and skills to deliver an effective language progression for all pupils in our primary schools, raise attainment in languages and ensure that young people are able to access the best opportunities within language and the world of work beyond school.", null, "Stirches Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013224_coordinator"]]}}}}
