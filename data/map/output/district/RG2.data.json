Geomaterial waste represents half of the waste volume generated in EU-27. These waste geomaterials generally exhibit poor engineering characteristics that prevent their direct reuse on construction/mining sites. However, if adequately treated, they could represent an excellent resource for construction purposes with significant money saving and reduction in the environmental footprint, thus contributing to the establishment of a circular economy. To achieve this, GeoRes will develop protocols, software and tools to improve the engineering characteristics of waste geomaterials, and to guarantee the level of performance over the service life of geostructures built from waste geomaterials considering site-specific conditions. The fundamental concern of the research in the GeoRes network is thus to develop strategies and tools for sustainable reuse of waste geomaterials generated by geoengineering activities, and to determine how to turn a waste geomaterial into a valued durable material, with a positive revenue stream. The proposed network is at the interface of two domains of engineering; geotechnical and geoenvironmental.

The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study.

However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions.
