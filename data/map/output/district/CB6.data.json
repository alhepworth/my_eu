The application of UV-C still need to be optimized and automation is required to allow introduction in horticulture. UV-ROBOT will try to tackle these issues and has three main goals:\n\nDevelop robots for autonomous mildew control\nIntegrate UV-C in current IPM strategies\nImplement the innovation by growers\n\nIn the course of the project we will develop, test and demonstrate cost-effective UV-C robots to control mildew in three types of crops:\n\nSpherical: strawberry\nVertical: tomato and cucumber\nHorizontal: lettuce and basil\n\nHorticultural experts in Belgium and the UK will together find ways to incorporate UV-C in current IPM (Integrated Pest Management) strategies of each crop. Belgian expertise in automation and French expertise in data analysis will jointly develop innovative robots that can autonomously apply UV-C.

It is known, however, that some women are at a much higher risk of getting the disease than others, and that mammography is unsuitable for cancer detection in women with dense breasts. The aim of this project is to develop personalised methods to tailor breast cancer screening to the individual needs of the woman. We will propose methods to stratify women at the highest risk to MRI; those with intermediate risk and/or dense breasts to follow-on ultrasound. A risk model will be developed that includes both breast cancer risk and the risk of missing cancers in mammograms. In this model, breast density plays a key role, as one of the largest known risk factors and the factor making mammograms ineffective. Two SMEs focusing on breast density are involved, where academic partners bring unique databases with over 80,000 screening mammograms and associated risk profiles. These are essential for model development, and subsequently for the development of products that benefit all women. Personalised screening is only economically feasible if it is based upon cost-effective strategies. While current methods in breast MRI imaging and breast ultrasound are promising, more efficient protocols must be developed to use these modalities routinely in screening. With leading SMEs and clinical partners, screening procedures will be optimized by developing automated image analysis tools to guide workflow and quality assurance. More efficient MRI protocols will be investigated to reduce time and cost, while the use of novel MRI imaging sequences without intravenous contrast will be explored.

Raw natural gas varies in composition and also contains undesirable impurities and contaminants, including water, CO2, nitrogen and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Unconventional sources such as shale gas have an even greater variance. Despite this, the composition of gas delivered to transmission pipelines has to be tightly controlled by the gas producers to meet stringent quality standards and specifications. \n\nNatural gas therefore has to be processed to remove these contaminants. With high financial penalties or the threat of closure for gas producers not meeting high quality standards, and because producers do not currently have sufficiently accurate data on the gas composition at any one time, most natural gas is highly over processed. This is time consuming, energy intensive and leads to high CO2 emissions. It is also ultimately expensive, (a cost of \u20ac91 billion p.a globally).  \nThe industry has an urgent and growing requirement for a new gas analyser that can accurately and rapidly measure the composition and contaminant levels of the gas stream so that the gas processing stage can be optimised. \n\nThe aim of this innovation project is to bring to technology maturity and market readiness a disruptive, cost effective, multi-species natural gas analyser to improve the energy efficiency of natural gas processing facilities by up to 20%.
