Cooperation to shape an all renewable vision \r\nfor Europe by 2050.\"", "Churston Ferrers School Academy", 82155.0, 4, 4, "\"Could the lights go off across Europe?  Cooperation to shape an all renewable vision for Europe by 2050.\" \r\n \r\nInspired by the hardrainproject\u2019s web of energy (www.hardrainproject.com/web_of_energy ) this project will explore how our \r\nactivities and attitudes will have to be altered if we want to change from carbon energy - coal, oil and gas - to renewable energies: solar, wind, hydro, wave and geothermal energy generation.   \r\nThe 2050 vision requires simultaneous and coordinated progress on many levels as well as a cooperation between governments, \r\nindustry and consumers. Are we ready to seize the day and collaborate on a solution which is European-wide? \r\nFollowing new guidelines on the optimization of transnational energy flows which were published in April 2014, our project aims at \r\nbuilding and strengthening cooperation among schools from different European countries. We hereby want to offer adolescents \r\nfrom different regions a profound, long-lasting and consequently European perspective on two topics which will shape many \r\ngenerations to come: sustainability and renewable energies. The central aim of the project is to offer students and teachers a first-\r\nhand encounter with different technologies that use renewable energies. Different countries offer different ways of implementing \r\nrenewable energies. Getting to know these various ways of using renewable energies on-site will broaden our students' horizons \r\nand thus lead to a sustainable and long-lasting learning effect. They will learn in which ways their everyday behaviour has an effect on the global environment by actively learning about the connectedness of different European regions and their respective use of \r\nrenewable energies. Thus they will learn not regard themselves as isolated individuals from a certain region, but as active and \r\neffective European agents for change. They will improve their language skills through different communication forms (face-to-face \r\ncommunication, email, eTwinning, homepages, skype, facebook, google docs etc.) methodical skills (preparing presentations, \r\nconducting workshops, designing leaflets etc.) and gain a deeper understanding of the shared European heritage and responsibility. \r\nOwing to the past Comenius project in which the partners from Germany, England and Norway took part, there is a common \r\nground from which the new project can be launched. The addition of Portugal as a fourth partner will enrich our project and lead \r\nto even more comprehensive discussions and results. Since all schools are situated in UNESCO Geoparks in rural areas and are \r\nspecialized in Geography and Science, we can all benefit from the different national ways of approaching the topics of sustainability and renewable energies. Due to already established external partnerships such as affiliations with regional companies (e.g. ENO, Steiff in Buchen) or research institutions (e.g. South West Energy Centre, Paignton, Aveiro University Campus) we can conduct highly \r\nefficient exchange trips for five students and two teachers to the different countries where we are planning to hold lectures, take part in workshops, conduct student presentations, attend discussions etc.   \r\nThe possible stages of the project (raising awareness within & between our communities, challenges we are facing now and in the \r\nfuture, responses: from local to national solutions, a web of energy - a 2050 all renewable European supergrid?) could serve as \r\nmultiplication activities for the teaching staff (internal training programs, school conferences on relevant topics etc.) as well as for \r\nstudents (the projects topics will be presented in different subjects). Besides using our findings in school contexts, we are \r\nplanning to publish our results through different media, on our homepages and in permanent exhibitions in our school buildings as well as in communal buildings. This will offer the chance to continuously evaluate our procedures and share our thoughts with the other partners based on feedback sessions. Additionally, we are not only planning to build models of photovoltaic systems, but also to shoot video clips about the individual school projects which will be combined to comprise a longer film about our conjoined \r\nproject.  \r\nThe students will thus acquire expert knowledge about renewable energies, improve their language skills as well as gain access to universities and other external partners such as companies or political boards and parties. Most importantly, they will actively participate in formulating and realizing the European vision of sustainability and energy efficiency. They will act as active multipliers for the project's central aim by not only learning about renewable energies, but also integrating them into their daily life and thus influencing their social environment. The project's scope reaches far beyond the walls of our schools and will contribute to a coordinated European step towards sustainability and renewable energies.", "http://www.churstongrammar.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035486_2"]]}}, "0LT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Internationale Kooperation in sozialp\u00e4dagogischer Ausbildung und Praxis", "Galmpton C of E Primary School", 55371.0, 2, 12, "According to changes in society due to immigration, work related migration and the attractiveness of Germany as an international hotspot of innovation and science the project responds to the increased national need of experienced childcare practitioners and special needs practitioners with intercultural competence.\r\nComplementing the experience of prior projetcs the current project application adds decisive aspects, which demand a deepened contrastive view of own and foreign culture as well as own and foreign understanding of education: the work placement abroad is preceded by an intensive work related and language related preparation in a mandatory course \"Intercultural Education\" comprising 360 hours.

We will deal with project-based learning, problem-based learning, gamification, blended learning, etc. These tasks will have a communicative approach and will be developed in cooperative or colaborative groups.
