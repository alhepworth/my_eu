It is and will remain for the foreseeable future a crucial artery for Europe, both in economic terms, as it services the vast majority of goods traffic, and in social terms, as it does so for passenger travel as well.\nMaintenance is considered to be the most expensive function of a high-way operating agency, so there is a special need for the early detection of deterioration mechanisms and of potential presence of defects through a more advanced road pavements inspection technology.\n\nThe proposed system will detect the presence of defects, determine the cause, extent and rate of deterioration, provide information for assessing stability and serviceability and for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various remedial measures and provide this information in real time, not causing traffic disturbances.\n\nThe system is aiming to upgrade and optimize the inspection & maintenance of the European roads, reducing costs and increasing traffic safety and will achieve this by developing a novel automated and integrated NDT (Non Destructive Techniques) system for high speed analysis and evaluation. It will demonstrate the value of combining 3 technologies: Ground Penetrating Radar, InfraRed Thermography and Air Coupled Ultrasonic testing with Near Real-Time data transfer and analysis as a reliable, fast and safe tool for pavement inspections, as well as a great business opportunity for SME participants in EU. The proposed system incorporates and drastically enhances the capacities of the traditional NDT techniques, to produce quantitative, reliable, precise, continuous and at-traffic-speed measurements for the assessment of structural pavement condition. Research & innovation outcomes will be to obtain a GPR capable of detecting subsurface defects and adjacent layers of the same materials at traffic speed and quantitative and high speed image capturing Thermography resulting in the approximately 100% coverage measurement tool, which can be further extended with ACU optimized for continuous surface layer profiling.", 196595.0, 1159419.0, 6, 9, "RPB HEALTEC", null, "http://www.metgeoenvironmental.com", null, "fp7_188541_951910083"]]}}, "4BS": {"nhs": {"data": [["RGD", "Aire Court", "nhs_RGD02"]]}}, "4HX": {"esif": {"data": [[1456790400000, 1472601600000, "South Leeds CLLD", "Health for All (Leeds) Ltd", "The project is the preparatory stage of the CLLD strategy for inner south Leeds.

It is expected to be revolutionised by the widespread introduction of LED solid state technology. However, LED technology has some major problems to overcome on the delivered efficiency of multi-LED lights, cost, and the quality of the light colour produced.\n\nHERCULES will produce solutions for LED lighting for a range of applications. It will build on a successfully demonstrated concept that combines the light from different LED sources to produce near perfect colour rendition at colour temperatures as low as 2500K. HERCULES will provide the normal benefits of LED lighting \u2013 high electrical energy to light conversion efficiency (reducing energy consumption), instant start-up and efficient dimmability, but will also allow tuneable colour rendering for applications such as food retailing.\n\nIt is essential that light sources produce high quality colour rendition, which has proved critical to the health and productivity of workers. High efficiency LEDs have very poor colour rendering and current approaches use multiple phosphors on each LED to generate a poor typically \u201cblue rich\u201d approximation to natural light. These phosphors can seriously reduce the efficiency of the LED, so more LEDs are required to achieve the light ouput. In a compact light source this has the effect of increasing the temperature of the LEDs, which has a very negative feedback as their efficiency decreases rapidly with temperature. The HERCULES solution will overcome this serious limitation.\n\nThe key developments in this project will be:\n\u2022\tCharacterisation and selection of suitable high efficiency LEDs\n\u2022\tNovel electronic driver design\n\u2022\tOptical design for several form factors, especially to de-image LEDs\n\u2022\tLow cost injection moulding tool making technique for optical finish\n\u2022\tPrecision injection moulding of optical elements\n\u2022\tNovel luminaire design for indoor/outdoor/specialist applications'", 406069.0, 1128143.0, 4, 7, "HERCULES", null, "http://www.brandon-medical.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149297.jpg", "fp7_102177_965587762"]]}}}}
