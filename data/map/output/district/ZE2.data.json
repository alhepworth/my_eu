Will take place in Molins de Rei and Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThe overall project objective is to increase self-esteem and self-awareness, and promote the active participation of young Europeans and fewer opportunities regardless of their origin using the Hip Hop and non-formal learning mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe project duration is one week and the countries involved are Spain, UK, Czech Republic and France. The total number of participants is 40. The raised activities revolve around the world of Hip Hop in all its facets (dancing, rapping, graffitty and DJ) as a vehicle for the active participation of the young people. The applied methods will be participatory, active and very dynamic, sustained in formal and informal models. Both the activities and methods can be seen in the attached document.\r\n\r\nThis project puts us in a new scenario, to which we find ourselves not if not for participation in projects like this. This project will see other ways of living day to day, the perspective that gives each common problems that we have young Europeans and places us in a space of greater awareness of other cultures.\r\n\r\nOur project promotes dialogue between young people from different backgrounds and cultures, because it is a multilateral project, with wealth in nuances that entails. Thus, we promote intercultural encounters that will not both formal and informal spaces.\r\n\r\nThis project will also help to prevent and combat prejudice, where we highlight those that lead to the exclusion, in its broadest sense. We look forward to the participation of each and everyone irrespective of origin, economic status, social stratum. We will pay special attention to the inclusion of women and men equally. There also will monitor balance nationalities, when we do group activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, we note that this project encourages a sense of mutual respect and understanding of diversity. This project is like a small sociological, intense and extremely instructive experiment.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a clear effect on strengthening the sense of European citizenship among the young people who will participate in it. But so it will have on the people who will indirectly contact and join us for activities and even after the conduct. Thus, other youth groups, media and even technicians, experts and politicians will be more present than ever the importance and value we have young people as engines of social change, with a clear European approach.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have a more intimate and personal effect. It will allow us to understand our role as part of the present and the future of Europe, as key players in the process of change and improvement.\r\n\r\nSo added, this project reflects a common concern for us and for the whole European society, such as racism and xenophobia (in this project will involve young children of immigrants, black people who come from France and UK in its mostly descendants of people from former colonies), drug abuse (as we insist on the healthy practice of Hip Hop, especially dancing).\r\n\r\nThe topics chosen for this project are result of long discussions and reflections between the two partners. We have found that these issues correspond to the interests and needs of the participants. Since we are people linked to Hip Hop and that the activities have developed mutual agreement, there have been disagreements in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe working methods detailed in the document the activities, but we advance in this paragraph that the methodology is especially active and dynamic, given the characteristics of the promoters groups themselves.

We are surrounded by specific and diverse fauna and flora and endemic species that we must care in order to assure our own health. This health comes not only from our Natural Park but from the good care of the Environment all over the world. We started working on this aim in 2000 and many of our traditions and culture have to do with the care of our surrounding. We want to share all this with other two schools which also want to transmit us all their traditions and cultural heritage as well as their concern and enthusiasm for the environment preservation. We wish to learn from the  multiculturalism and the Natural Park of  Entre-Deux and/or the fauna, flora and traditions from Yell. All this will be shared as well as the interesting ways the three members fulfill or must fulfill to maintain healthy our environment. In order to do so, our students will develop and improve their communicative skills of the foreign languages they are studying.\r\nMost of the subjects will be involved to do the activities and achieve our objectives. Many activities will be done in different subjects with the same goal. Then, they will begin by establishing  a code of conduct to be carried out at school in terms of recycling, saving energy and water, noise pollution, reusing materials, etc. This code will be also carried out at home and at the town, and broadcast on the local radio as to know at last its impact that we will request to the families, citizens and local government by means of analysis of data and questionnaires.\r\nOur students will transmit their traditions recording tutorial videos like reusing fried oil to make soap or explaining the rules of traditional sports practiced in the natural setting as \u201cBolos Serranos\u201d. These ones and others the other members will do will be at the disposal of everyone on the web.\r\nOur students will also have fun together with their parents who will participate in a contest of traditional food made with products of the area (olive oil (Spain), fruits and vegetables (UK) or cane sugar (France) at school.\r\nTraditional local legends will be read in order to write a story based on some traditional elements from the legends and transmit a message related to the preservation and conservation of the Environment. This will be done as a comic using a comprehensible foreign language since it will be addressed to Primary School students to celebrate the World Environment Day. This will develop our students reading and writing skills in an enjoyable way and will be at the disposal of the Education community to be used as a teaching material.\r\nThe three face to face meetings they will have in each country will provide them cultural and environmental information to create a final brochure. This meetings will also lead to make new friendships and speaking foreign real situations for the students and the teachers who will continue working together in the future.\r\n Then we are sure that this amazing experience will change our students and families minds.

By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.\n\nBecause hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle.

The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. \n\nThe experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=81", "http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk,", "life_79"]]}}, "9QF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1451520000000, "Novel high performance, waterbased \u201chigh solids\u201dand bio-based industrial wood coating", "Bod Ayre Seaweed Products Limited", "The stringent Solvent Emission Directive (1999/13/EC), fully transposed in 2007, imposes limitations of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) due to the use of organic solvents in paints and varnishes. The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece.

Growth in electricity from renewable sources is stalling due to intermittency, grid restrictions, curtailment, and high costs. Sustainable energy to supply the transport sector and heating demand are even further underexploited. GENCOMM will address these issues by developing a sustainable, renewable community-scaled, hydrogen (H2)-based, energy model based on the results of 3 pilot plants that will use local renewable sources to supply electricity, heating and transportation fuels.\nThe project will begin by addressing the communities, mainly remote, around the pilot facilities in the Western Isles (Scotland), Saar-Lor-Lux region (Germany, France, and Luxembourg), and County Antrim(, to then continue to expand throughout NWE region.\nGENCOMM aims to reverse the current situation in which communities meet 75-80% of their energy needs from non-renewable sources. The proposed model will allow renewable generated energy to: [1] be dispatchable [2] meet heating demand and [3] supply transportation fuels. Therefore, through the model, communities will be able to develop autonomous, secure and sustainable energy matrixes.\nThe main output of the project is an H2-based energy model. The second output is the adaptation of the model to a Decision Support Tool (DST), allowing communities to project and implement their own H2-based energy matrix. The 3 H2-based pilot facilities (H2/biogas plant for heat and power, a solar-powered H2 station for vehicles, and a wind farm with H2 storage and distribution) will constitute the third output of the project. The final output is the creation of an H2 stakeholder\u2019s forum. The forum will, sustain the rollout of the project\u2019s main outputs and support the continuous operation of the pilots.It will start with the partners and APs and then anticipates to address 20 new communities within 5 years and 50 within 10 years.", 1489622400000, 1568419200000, 315703.0, "nweurope_24_4"]]}}}}
