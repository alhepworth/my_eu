Our Sports Academy programme for young adults aged 16-18 years old combines full-time education with sporting excellence and is delivered in partnership with 65 professional and amateur clubs. The Football Academy is open to aspiring players, coaches and referees aged 16-18 and aims to equip students with the skills and experience to progress into education or employment within sport via a formal, full-time training programme. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to enhance the vocational and professional development of students undertaking our Football Academy programme. Working with host partner Sportilia in Italy, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the SCL Football Academy programme and our students.\r\n\r\n2. Exposing participants to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3. Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip participants with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThere are over 2,000 Football Academy students across 65 programmes throughout the UK. In line with our company mission, the programme is aimed at students from all walks of life, allowing anyone with a passion for sport to gain the vocational qualifications they need to pursue a sporting career leading to employment, Further and Higher Education. Students therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds. Participants for this project will be selected from circa 300 students at eight Surrey-based programmes in the 2018/2019 academic year.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at the Sportilia facility, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Italian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nSportilia will use its links at a local, regional and national level to enable SCL to enhance the project activities.
