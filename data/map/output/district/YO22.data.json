For some years now there is a movement of a so-called Blue- or Social Entrepreneurship. The EU Commission has already started to promote the movement of social innovations. Social business is seen as a main key scope to social innovation and (social) economy.  The concept of \u201cBlue Living Labs\u201d combines new approaches of social innovation, social entrepreneurship and social integration. There is now a huge demand for new learning concepts and innovative adult learning approaches linked to competence development and skills training to support the encourage of developing blue (sustainable) and social entrepreneurship, social licenses and fair-share models of benefits and participation especially for segregated people and people which are not regular involved in adult training programs and experiences.  One main innovation of this Living Lab concept is, that the development and training/learning process is done together with the potential users in their social context. It is also intended to involve disadvantaged people like immigrants, minorities or people with special needs as testing users or innovators and entrepreneurs themselves. Especially the integral and inclusive learning approach is new and quite unusual but there is an obvious potential for human resources and innovation in this target group.  The second innovation is the learning and testing of new business-beneficiary and contracting models like FairShare- and Social Licenses. One of the main goals is to identify empower and train/educate new human resources, which are indispensable in the context of social entrepreneurship.The third innovation is the FairSharesLab Exchange and Cooperation platform. Through this platform people can put their ideas and challenges on the virtual table, inviting others to participate in finding solutions or creating social innovation/business together on European level. The project is developed and will be carried out by a strong European consortium consisting of 6 partners from 5 European countries (UK, DE, NL, HU, HR) running over 29 months. The partners have worked together before and have a lot experiences in Adult Training and blue/social entrepreneurship. A well developed working plan, a management and communication plan  as well as plans for Evaluation/QM, dissemination and exploitation of results and at least for Gender and Accessibility aspects will help and guarantee a successful development and implementation of the scheduled core intellectual outputs and other outputs.During the lifetime of the project 12 blended pilot trainings will be provided, a train the trainer training concerning the FairSharesLabs methodology and the trainings with potential blue/social entrepreneurs in local labs and hubs as well as Transeuropean virtually.   The intellectual outputs will be:1. FairSharesLabs methodology how to develop and implement social and blue projects/enterprises 2. Guideline and Self- and blended learning tool for FairShares hubs, labs, learning groups3. FairSharesLabs Exchange and E-Learning platform4. FairSharesLabs train the trainers tool for coaches and mentors 5.

Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs) face persistent challenges integrating disadvantaged groups of the population into the labour market and facilitating their access to decent work opportunities. Simultaneously, the new paradigms of social and economic sustainability of the third sector organisations demand more innovative and professional solutions for those organisations. The WISEs need to strengthen the professional skills of their staff and integrate new professional profiles into the organisations in order to better respond to these current challenges.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo meet to these needs, our project aims to: 1) To increase the professional competences of social enterprises and rise their ability to meet the new challenges for labor inclusion of disadvantaged groups; 2) To recognize which are the emergent professional profiles needs of the social enterprises; 3) To define professional profiles and suitable training resources of two of those emergent professional profiles in social enterprises; 4) To contribute with guidelines and training solutions to improve the professional competences and respond to the most relevant corporate needs of social enterprises. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour digital publications will be produced: 1) an overview on the emergent professional profiles of social enterprises, 2) one professional profile and training package for the job-tutor/coacher of disadvantaged groups, 3) one professional profile and training package for the social marketing professional in WISES, 4) guidelines and recommendations to enhance WISES' human resources and effectiveness in social inclusion. To support the multiplier impact of these outputs and validate its results, we will develop five national workshops (one in each participating country), two training validation sessions with the contents of each professional profile and, lastly, a final European seminar. In addition to this, all partners will meet six times over the project life-cycle to debate and agree on the main aspects of the thematic addressed, visit national WISEs in each country and develop a deeper understanding on the different national contexts of social entrepreneurship. This project is built on a project methodology of mutual learning and working together, designed to stream and capitalize partners\u2019 knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA variety of different participants will be involved in this project: 2 staff members from each partner organisation (project managers, social researchers, trainers, business development professionals) will contribute to the project implementation; each organisation\u2019 representative will participate at least in the final seminar; 20 national participants will attend the national workshops in each country, including WISES professionals, WISES beneficiaries, VET professionals, private business professionals and public employment services professionals; 20 WISES professionals will attend the two training validation sessions in Portugal; 64 people will attend the final seminar, including policy makers, social and employment services providers, business associations professionals, WISES professionals, WISES beneficiaries, VET professionals, students, mostly from Portugal but also, at least, one guest from each partners\u2019 country.

BFF have established that the required knowledge cannot be acquired using the learning services available at national level. It has been noted that the amount of business disputes submitted to civil courts considerably lengthens the resolution process and increases the cost of settlement. In view of the incurred process length and high level of expenses, BFF has seen an increase of queries regarding options of mediation and support for out of court settlement of business conflicts. Requests have come from a wide range of business representatives not limited to franchising. All have expressed their dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs and the legalistic approach. We believe that this method of efficient business conflicts resolution is required and have turned to business mediation as a solution. Business relations among Franchiser and Franchisee are explicitly asymmetric. BFF considers that deeper knowledge and skills of narrative coaching are needed to ensure that equal support is provided to both sides in franchise. That would include support on mobilizing internal and attracting external resources, conceptualizing, managing and initiating business processes at a new level of quality. The attention of BFF has been drawn towards social entrepreneurship widely spread in the EU and its offered possibilities of qualitative growth in form of Social licensing or franchise. While the concept of social entrepreneurship is yet to be defined by Latvian legislator, this Project aims to research EU\u2019s social entrepreneurship experiences. The outcomes of the research would contribute to the facilitation of such enterprise establishment and development at national level. It would drive the further growth of social entrepreneurship facilitated by development social franchising or licensing models. To enable the activities, we would have to become knowledgeable and skillful in social enterprise management and the opportunities for improvement, understand the legal context of social enterprise; carry out a detailed examination of real life examples of social enterprise growth, research the strategies of integrated marketing communications within the field. Participants both have more than 20 years worth of experience in business management and consulting, and have been closely involved in franchising. Activities are firstly orientated towards acquiring comprehensive knowledge of business mediation in order to use the advantages of this method and spread these competences among business consultants and coaches.  While popularity of narrative coaching is increasing activities in this respect will be oriented towards detailed learning of this method. We aim to use this approach when dealing with small and medium size enterprises, develop this knowledge for further dissemination beyond national borders. Other activities will be devoted to the acquisition of experience in the field of social entrepreneurship to help understand the social enterprise paradigm, answer the specific questions regarding the motivation of Stakeholders, intellectual property, growth prospects and the macroeconomic impact. The methodology used is both a qualitative and quantitative approach, for example, the establishment of appropriate focus groups and discussions within their remit, provision of the seminar sessions and finally the consistent application of SMART method to goal-setting. The Project aims to drive cooperation within a virtual environment, as well as include face to face collaboration with the European Social Franchising Network (ESFN), the national franchise associations, individual members of such organizations - companies, respectable business training and consulting companies. The result would be measured in the first instance by the increase in the overall scope and quality of participants\u2019 competencies that are to be used in their everyday\u2019s professional activities, as well as to ensure the dissemination of knowledge among partners and customers, including professionals outside the national scope. It would further be measured within the field of social entrepreneurship, where achievements will be marked by the increasing popularity of social entrepreneurship amidst so-called \u2018new EU countries\u2019. In medium and long term perspective the follow-up of the Project would entail the opportunity for the participants to make their own investment (social and material) in this business area.
