In fact, although the right to receive assistance is undeniably accepted, disabled persons are still forced to passively accept the services and support that are created with a top down approach, therefore excluding them from the process of selection and use of the services that best suit them. In addition, services and systems of managing services are increasingly digital. At the same time persons with disabilities \u2013 especially persons with intellectual or learning disabilities - receive none or only little support or education on how to manage their services and use ICT-based systems. Often family members and front-line staff are the key people supporting persons with disabilities in their everyday lives. Yet they don\u00b4t have enough skills and competences to support persons managing their services or using ICT.\r\nThis project will look specifically at the different needs required to develop good Self Directed Support systems, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and feasible in the day to day practice of professionals and individuals that will use the service.\r\n\r\nThe following results will be produced:\r\n- Accessible Training & Toolkit on Self-Directed Support\r\n- Training & Toolkit for Front-line staff working in the disability services\r\n- Training & Toolkit for Staff working in the field of (formal or informal) Adult Education\r\n- Strategic planning and lobbying toolkit\r\n- Report: Self-Directed Support in Europe\r\n\r\nThis projects will help to understand how SDS systems could work and what role different actors in these systems should use.\r\nAt national level the project will help identifying the gaps and will help fill them him by clarifying the needs of different actors and providing resources.\r\nAt European level the project will provide a major understanding of SDS systems and the project will shed light on the needed steps to take on in the future debates around SDS.\r\n\r\nAll results will be made available on the SKILLS digital platform and will be freely available to all.", "http://www.centreforwelfarereform.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA204-034769_2"]]}}, "1TA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1561852800000, "MAKERSPACES IN THE EARLY YEARS: ENHANCING DIGITAL LITERACY AND CREATIVITY  (MakEY)", "Makers Partnership", "This two-year project involves an international and inter-sector research and training network that focuses on the potential of makerspaces, which are specific spaces that enable creative design and the production of both digital and non-digital artefacts, to foster the digital literacy and creative skills of young children. A key aim of the project is to inform educational policy and practice in this area, enabling formal learning institutions (early years settings and primary schools) to learn from practice in non-formal learning spaces, and vice-versa, and also to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in the makerspace sector, enabling SMEs to develop robust business models and appropriate resources for future work in this area. The project involves 16 academic and non-academic beneficiaries and 10 non-academic, non-beneficiary partners across 6 EU countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Romania, UK), an Associated Country (Colombia) and 4 Third Countries (Australia, Canada, South Africa and USA). This global network of university scholars, cultural industry partners in makerspaces, early years practitioners, museum educators and librarians will engage in a collaborative research and training programme that addresses 4 objectives, which are to:\n1. Conduct a comprehensive review of the role of makerspaces in the formal and non-formal educational experiences of children and young people.\n2. Undertake empirical research to determine how makerspaces can foster the digital literacy and creativity skills and knowledge of young children.\n3. Develop a conceptual framework for analysing young children\u2019s engagement in makerspaces.\n4. Make recommendations for policy and practice that will foster innovation and entrepreneurship in SME makerspaces and facilitate the use of makerspaces for enhancing digital literacy in early childhood educational institutions and non-formal learning spaces.", 7862.0, 479558.0, 11, 20, "MakEY", null, null, null, "h2020_207457_919014570"]]}}}}
