I have been selected to apply for the course because of my interest in teaching and learning in the French language, and my enthusiasm to learn more about this, having only been trained to deliver the subject for a year of my career. The course involves daily workshops and presentations teaching French vocabulary and grammar, sharing good teaching strategies, sharing ways of using ICT to teach a Modern Language and discussion of the French school system. In addition to this, the course includes a visit to a French Primary School.Other activities on the course include experiencing French culture at the cinema and restaurants.The impact of the course on myself and my colleagues is that I will are able to improve my own teaching of the French language and embed this into my daily practice.  I will also share my experience and resources gained with colleagues at school, cluster and authority level.  I will run extra-curricular activities in my school and organise whole school activities around France and the French language. The impact of the course on pupils is that they will learn new French vocabulary.  Through new pedagogies learned at they course, pupils will be engaged and motivated to learn the French language. Children's confidence in speaking, writing and listening in French will improve.The long term benefits of attending the course are that my school will be in line with the Scottish national 1+2 Modern Languages policy.  Pupils in my school will be confident in communicating in the French language, a skill which will be useful to them in life and work.  This confidence will also motivate children to learn other foreign languages.Finally, the skills I learn on the course will benefit me throughout my career, and I will take these skills with me through work in the future.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/er/Netherlee/", "Netherlee Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023879_coordinator"]]}}}}
