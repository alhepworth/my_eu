Raise employability of CFGM graduates and increase the number of students going on to study higher level courses (CFGS).\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n\r\n- Mobility of 62 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. \r\n- Mobility of 34 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 12 VT institutions acting as members, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VT institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the language platform and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual FP educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants, video report of mobilities by Audiovisual students; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.

This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.

The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector. These developments are essential in order to create a successful workforce in Wales that can compete in difficult economic circumstances - research has shown that individuals with Welsh language skills are more likely to gain employment and perform better at higher qualifications in Wales. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of Project:\r\n\r\nTo raise the profile and share good practice of post-14 bilingual and Welsh medium provision in the Basque country.\r\n\r\nTo learn about the strategic direction set out by the Government in the Basque country in order for them to be able to increase the number of fluent speakers in the country.\r\n\r\nTo establish whether working in partnership (and with which organisations) is crucial to achieving a substantial increase in the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo understand how the Government in the Basque country monitors objectives set out in policy and strategy documents to increase the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo observe good practice in relation to practitioner  training (Professional Graduate Certificate in Education) in Higher Education establishments, in particular, aspects of delivering post-14 provision bilingually or through the medium of a minority language.\r\n\r\nTo create new partnerships and understanding between Further Education establishments in Wales with Further and Higher Education establishments in the Basque country in order to develop a wider communication network.\r\n\r\nTo continue to improve the quality of Welsh medium and bilingual post-14 provision through the consideration of adopting practices and policies currently being implemented within educational establishments in the Basque country. \r\n\r\nTo share good practice in Welsh post-14 education with key individuals and establishments in the Basque country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nFour Further Education Colleges and CollegesWales (the body that represents Colleges in Wales). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nVisits with Government officials to learn about Basque language planning.\r\n\r\nVisit with a University to learn about Teacher Training in terms of bilingualism.\r\n\r\nVisit with a Vocation Education provider to learn about bilingual post-16 provision.\r\n\r\nShare good practices from Wales. \r\n\r\nLearn about effective partnership work and its impact on bilingualism and language planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\n\r\nNew skills and knowledge developed in minority language planning and bilingual post-16 provision and delivery.
