The mythos Individual Producer Responsibility will be investigated if it can become the all-healing-solution in electronics industry as well as how this concept can be applied to other industrial sectors. WP2 concentrates on new technological developments, WP3 on waste prevention methodologies and strategies and WP4 will adapt existing software tools supporting waste prevention. All this knowledge will be then formalised into an innovative production model for resource-use optimisation and waste prevention in WP5. This preparatory work will enable the 9 industrial case studies in Work package 6 that forms the core of the ZeroWIN project with more than half of the total budget. These case studies will be used to prove that the ZeroWIN approach can meet at least 2 of the stringent targets of the call. WP7 closely monitors and validates the improvements by quantitative assessment. WP 8 investigates the implications to policy and formulates recommendations. Finally WP9 will disseminate the results of ZeroWIN as broad as possible and WP10 ensures the efficient operation of the ZeroWIN project. By concentrating on industrial networks in the automotive, construction, electronics and photovoltaic industries ZeroWIN will address \u2022 nearly 3 million companies (of which 80% are SMEs) \u2022 with more than 2,8 trillion \u20ac turnover and a value creation of more than 800 billion \u20ac \u2022 with more than 20 million employees \u2022 creating about 40% or more than 400 million tons of industrial waste \u2022 using as much as 50% of all materials extracted from the earth\u00b4s crust \u2022 generating about 40% of all energy use and about 35% of all greenhouse gas emissions.

As the number of wheelchair users continues to grow each year, our consortium needs to grow new products to take market share back from the US giants and keep pace with the increasing market. To counter this downward trend, our consortium intends to develop the CarGo concept, to permit greater numbers of wheelchair users to gain access to popular cars by developing a wheelchair and accompanying electrically powered lifting system, capable of lifting the user and wheelchair into a vehicle without physical input from the user or helper. Many current products require permanent modification to the vehicle, or outside assistance to store the wheelchair elsewhere in the vehicle during transport. We will develop an innovative electro-mechanical system to carry the user and their wheelchair into the passenger seat space of a car through a complex, optimised path.
