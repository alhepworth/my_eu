Departing from the particular analysis of our Secondary School and the situation of education in our town, some changes are taking place to permit our school centre to offer a better and varied answer to the demands of our pupils.This fact has led us during the last years to lay down a European Plan of Development (EPD, from now onwards), aimed at trying to find a global improvement of our Secondary School. Following this idea, last year our school centre asked for a KA2 project, together with other four secondary schools from Europe which, after been approved, we will coordinate during two years and at the same time it will be the answer to some of the assigned objectives by the Europe Strategy 2020, such as the promotion of the European citizenship and the improvement of the linguistic competences in our pupils and teachers. The project \u201cMeeting the Bilingualism\u201d permits the advance of those objectives outlined in our EPD, focusing the first stage on our teachers. In this way, the existing request in our town for implementing bilingual studies in Secondary Education (being our school centre the only Secondary School in our town) and the need to improve the academic results and the management of the school centre, all these are the basic pillar that support the need for this project. This idea has led us to lay down a working outline focused on the improvement of the teachers\u00b4 training to deal with the challenge that implies the establishment of bilingual educations with the best guarantee. Furthermore, the project helps us with a better organization in our Secondary School. In this way, several are the competences intended to be improved with the involvement of our teachers in the different activities planned in this project, for example:\u2022 Competence in the foreign languages.\u2022 Methodology, or\u2022 Promotion of the European Citizenship. In order to achieve the objectives laid down, a group of teachers from different departments and/ or members of the education management team of the Secondary school have been selected to attend courses about linguistic education, CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and periods of observation. The acquired knowledge and experiences lived by these teachers will serve in a second part of the project to provide a quality education to our pupils that will allow us to create a better working environment resulting in an organizational improvement of the school as well as the strengthening of working ties with the other Secondary schools.Another crucial item of this Project is the organization around it where team work is encouraged. For this reason, an Erasmus Team has been set up, organized in different offices that will help with the control and the monitoring of the project that will be developed along it. This way of working, through questionnaires and plans to schedule the tasks will improve the management and the better use of the project.On the other hand, an ambitious spreading plan of the activities and results has been designed to allow a wide number of people to take part in this project, producing in this way a great repercussion (great impact) in the project itself. This spreading plan comprises actions of local, regional, national and international nature, being of paramount importance the use of digital means for the spreading of the results during and at the end of the project. In this way, some of these means of communication will be: eTwinning platform, Erasmus+ platform, EPALE (Electronic European Platform for Adults Learning), official website of the Ministry of Education in the Region of Murcia, website and Facebook of our Secondary School, among others, as well as traditional means of communication such as writing press, radio and local television.Last but not least, I\u00b4d like to highlight that the sustainability in time of the project is completely ensured as there have been a lot of organizational and pedagogic changes included in the General Didactic Programme in our Secondary School and the curricula in the Departments.", "http://www.dulwich.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024453_1"]]}}, "8LR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "ROCVF verover de wereld", "Kate Taylor", 90817.0, 9, 14, "Since September 2015, a major new start has been made with Internationalization at ROC van Flevoland. A strong collaboration has started with ROC of Amsterdam and this is now bearing fruit. Two international coordinators were appointed for Lelystad and Almere in 2016, and policy developed from the management platform is expressly implemented systematically. From the deployed implementation to embed an internationalization @ home in 2020 in all educational curricula, the awareness of the relevance of internationalization within management and education teams has been increased. This has a huge impact on the interest in physical mobilities of both students and teachers. After a successful year in which students and teachers have gained foreign experience, the question is even more at this moment. The quality of the students and teachers is visibly improving and this year more students will go to level 3 and 4 to different countries within Europe. The clear structure that has arisen within the two MBO Colleges works very well for both the management and lecturers and students. Students know where they need to be when they want to do an internship abroad. The classrooms and regional companies are also very impressed by the interest in this foreign experience. The activities of the two international coordinators of ROCvF consist of setting out a broad policy on mobility in collaboration with coordinators of the ROC of Amsterdam, vision policy and mission, the implementation of internationalization within the framework of the new qualification structure aimed at sustainable contacts and cooperation with foreign partners or companies. The collaboration creates new sources and opportunities for the ROCvF, such as the cooperation with the Amstelveen branch for Sport and Wellness, where we set up a project with each other to London and Rome / Reggio and students go on a 2-week internship and professionalize teachers. Another example is through the joint platform Rocva / vf and The Dutch Alliance we come into contact with a Vocational School in Finland where teachers and officers from the professional field will go for a research with issues surrounding crossovers in the neighborhood-oriented work on well-being, care and sport. The cooperation that has been established between the Entrepreneurship department and two schools from Austria is an example for other departments, which means that many departments are now crossing the border. This year, 151 students and 22 teachers will cross the border. That is considerably more than in previous years. With this we indicate that the ambition is to grow to 6% mobility for the entire ROC. In terms of quality, as described in the project, we will also make improvements in the preparation, execution, monitoring, contact maintenance, dissemination and evaluation in various areas. Students will gain the experience this year, which they will continue to play next year to the new students. They will stay abroad for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of 20 weeks. There are many new mobilities to create new places that are sustainable in the long term, investing in relationships also costs a lot of energy and attention from the coach. The ROCvF van Flevoland explicitly chooses to invest in this project, through coaching visits and study trips by teachers. For lecturers, research in particular will be central to their own professional development, with the explicit task of looking at how the knowledge can be incorporated in the new curriculum to be developed and to further disseminate this knowledge both within the organization and outside the organization. the professional field, thereby expressly entering into a dialogue with the professional field in order to coordinate policy and implementation of the updated knowledge.\r\nWith regard to the 20 week internships of students. In a longer internship it goes alongside the professional skills, with emphasis to take personal skills such as independence and initiative. Business that takes time to grow. Here, too, attention is paid to the ROC during the preparation by coaching students and activating awareness processes. In more short internships, a lot of attention is paid to increasing direct professional skills in combination with global citizenship, and intercultural skills.", "http://www.rosendale.cc", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038680_6"]]}}, "8SQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "MFL training - Spanish", "Kingsdale Foundation School", 2642.0, 1, 1, "Kingsdale Foundation School has a growing cohort of students studying Spanish both at KS3 and KS4.
