AP systems require algorithms using blood glucose levels obtained via glucose monitoring for controlling subcutaneous insulin administration. First, well established subcutaneous continuous glucose sensors and insulin pumps will be combined to improve and verify the functionality of enhanced closed-loop algorithms. We will advance algorithm quality, improve sensors by bringing their accuracy below the desired 5% error level and add a remote hypoglycaemia alarm. Second, in parallel, two AP systems will be developed by combining an insulin pump and a sensor into a single device, using only one access point through the skin ('single-port'). Thereby the need to puncture the skin twice, once for the glucose sensor and once for the insulin infusion, can be avoided ('two-port'). If proven successful in computer simulations we will evaluate the best selected single-port system under clinical conditions.Deliverables include: description of more precise glucose sensing methods; description of system integration of the two-port and both single-port AP systems; validation of prototypes in the clinic and at home. In a multinational controlled trial AP performance will be compared with standard intensive insulin therapy in daily life.Impact of the project includes strengthened competitiveness of European industry across a complete value chain involving large, mid-sized and small companies, enabling Europe to lead progress in AP systems. Also, the project will put European research and clinical organizations in leading positions with an increased number of high-skilled jobs in the medical device industry. Finally, diabetes care will be simplified, quality of life of patients with diabetes will be improved and diabetes related complications and health costs will diminish in the long run.", 446483.0, 11464251.0, 7, 15, "AP@home", null, null, null, "fp7_94149_998621209"], [1514764800000, 1688083200000, "MW Fuel Cell micro grid and district heating at King\u2019s Cross", "Fuel Cell Systems Ltd", "ELECTROU will install the first MW fuel cell in Europe fully integrated into a building at the high profile redevelopment at Kings Cross, London. This includes the full use of power & heat generated by the fuel cell within the local building, the site wide heat, power and cooling networks, and extends to water re-use and support of the micro grid.\n\nELECTROU will prove that the multi-MW installation due to operational efficiency and negligible emissions will massively improve local and EU wide carbon emission targets. Designed to be an outdoor installation the plant will be adapted to indoor requirements e.g. space, ventilation, and safe access and egress. Up-scaling more than 3 times the installed capacity compared to current indoor installations is a critical step for large scale deployment within building applications.\n\nThe use of fuel cells in this critical sector is currently prevented due to the high spatial requirements of multiple smaller modules, high capital cost compared to other technologies, and complexity of integration. ELECTROU will break all of these barriers. The project will demonstrate to key decision makers, investors and financiers that there is a near term route to produce electricity and heat in a highly efficient way by a technology which is commercially viable today.\n\nELECTROU will prove through funding support that multi-MW installations within buildings can make an investment grade return without the need for any form of local or EU subsidy, this is a critical step in making the sector viable. A targeted dissemination campaign will be performed to share all of the results with stakeholders and the general public that promotes the technical, commercial and environmental benefits of this mature but high tech technology.
