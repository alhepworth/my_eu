However, employers require graduates who are prepared in both professional and personal terms to handle tasks and problems in the workplace. The subject Professional experience provides a link between the world of education and work. However, we have noticed that work experience is often only formal and does not bring expected results. Previously we implemented a project of foreign professional experience through mobility, entitled \u201cPraxis abroad improves the school quality\". The impact of the project among all of the parties involved, convinced us that it is indeed the correct way to increase the quality of professional practice and hence also of the professional formation and competencies of the students in order to prepare the graduates for both national and international labor market, and at the same time to increase the prestige of the school. We have therefore decided to continue the implementation of such projects with the new title \"My Mobility - Experience, Expertise, Quality.\"\r\nThe involvement of such students in international projects and their personal experience with working abroad can break stereotypes and broaden the horizons in the area of job diversity within their expertise and rid them of their fears and worries of mobility.\r\n\r\nThe practice will be held in 2 two-weekterms - September 2017 and September 2018 for students of the 4th year in London, Havirov, and Katowice. \u00a0 Students with special educational needs may also apply for the foreign experience of mobility, thereby improving their \u00a0chance to succeed in the labor market and gain an advantage over other candidates.The main objectives of the planned project are to improve vocational education with an emphasis on the compulsory subject of professional experience and other economic subjects in our school, to prepare students for the labor market, to ensure their readiness for lifelong education and thereby improve the indicator of unemployment of our school graduates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStudents participating in foreign mobility aim to improve their hard and soft skills which are needed in the modern work environment, particularly: improving the ability to work independently, problem solving, enhancing presentation skills, developing verbal and language skills, and improving self-knowledge and self-reflection.The aim of the teaching staff is to gain direct experience with the foreign labor market and with the current requirements of graduates, to expand conceptual and organizational competencies and to improve the management skills of the project team.\r\n\r\nOther objectives of the project are to design and verify the ECVET methodology in the process of preparation, implementation, and evaluation of mobility, to ensure certification through the Europass system, to improve the organization of teaching and learning and integrate new knowledge into the \u0160kVP \u201cgraduate profile\u201d, to implementthe skills and practices acquired by teachersinto the following subjects: professional experience, accounting, business economics, administration and correspondence, English language, and the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe consider the implementation of professional practice in enterprises and organizations in London, Havirov, and Katowice to be the goals concerning students and teachers.

The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the school, we were able to implement compulsory vocational experience in companies abroad through Erasmus +, KA1 Mobility of VET Learners and Staff.

The subject of the project is the realization of foreign mobilities, which will take place in the Czech Republic (specifically in Ostrava) and in England (specifically in London) for a duration of 2 weeks - 10 working days, 14 days together with a journey and a weekend.  It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area.

The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market.

We rarely hear from young refugees as experts or legitimate voices - even when the news agenda concerns their country of origin. Migrants, it seems are only allowed to be migrants. There are many organisations, media-makers and activists across Europe who want to change this. \u2018Displaced In Media\u2019 will bring them together to create a collaborative infrastructure that supports the training of a new generation of young citizen journalists drawn from Europe\u2019s refugee and migrant diasporas.

Fourth, in a multiplier event, we will contribute to wider policy debates about how european governments create the conditions that enable Europe\u2019s new citizens to become a part of the public sphere. All over Europe people who work with media and young people are drawn to working with refugees and migrants. But this practice is often isolated - many groups are going through the same issues and challenges, but distance, language differences and time are all barriers to them learning from one another - and stop policymakers learning from them. This is why we need to work transnationally and we are committed to building stronger networks of like-minded organisations and sharing methods. It is also why our approach - whether we are learning from one another, with policy makers, experts or refugees - is one of peer learning. The great refugee crisis is a new event - there are no clear answers to how europeans should best welcome and live with their new neighbours.

In each centre, teachers \u2013 throughout the pertinent group- will foster a discussion regarding the methodological changing of the involved teachers; selecting tools and analysing the temporalisation and how these tools will be applied in class.The coordinating centre maintains a clear and transparent process to participate in these projects on the students and the educational community behalf.Since the other centres do not possess any guidelines to follow, a selection committee will be established; a dossier with documents (such as application form, a commitment letter, and selection criteria, among others) will be created in order to transfer the proceeding to the other centres. All the information will be display in the web within the Erasmus+ section.The documentation related to the Project (convocations, lists of admissions, minutes,...) will be published in each centre\u2019s web. Also, blogs for dissemination will be created. Moreover, centres will take advantage of social networks (as Facebook) to publish news, dissemination results and searching for partners. This is a very ambitious project which collects the needs of the four centres in their different locations which also share the same teaching and aims to create a wide impact at provincial level. The effectiveness of this project will be checked throughout the project life by the revision of the indicators.The project assessment will be accomplished throughout an \u2018Assessment Plan\u2019 in which each member will be involved. This assessment will be continuous and carried out in four steps: preparation of participants, during and after each activity, at the end of the school year and at the end of the project.The assessment instruments are: active and direct observation by the correspondent committee, the tutor of the courses, assessment questionnaires, teachers\u2019 daily work\u2026Once the project is finished, the results will be analysed and future training programmes offered at the centres will be improved. Some of the indicators used will be: level of linguistic competence improvement, attitudinal changes, implementation of new methodological strategies achieved, expansion of the provincial and international network, percentage of absent students which ends with the further education success.", "http://www.oxfordhousecollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA104-023353_5"], [2016, "Kvalitn\u00e9 jazykov\u00e9  vzdel\u00e1vanie - slu\u017eba pre mesto a regi\u00f3n", "Oxford House College Training Limited", 13671.0, 2, 3, "Language school Your Choice in its 10 years existence has gained a reputation as a professional and innovative place for high quality language teaching. We work extensively with local and regional employers to increase the levels of employment in the region. More than 70 of our courses are designed for students of business English as required by our corporate clients. In the Trnava, Nitra and Bratislava regions we significantly contribute to the increased public participation in education, the improvement of employee skills of corporate clients and to building effective links between employers and young people to improve their chances in the labor market.The project has 2 main targets. The first is to provide additional professional skills to our teachers.  The courses focus on creative methodology and business English. The participants will be trained in current innovative teaching methodologies, use of the current teaching and supplementary materials, creative and alternative approaches to teaching, in the skills to teach English for special purposes (business). Our aim is that the project participants will gain practical appliable knowledge and skill which will then be forwarded to other colleagues. The professional development of the individuals will contribute to the growth of the school as a whole. This part of the project includes courses for trainers in cooperation with the Pilgrim Language School and other educational and training centers in the UK. This will involve three teachers from our school.The second objective is to set up an effective system of training for teachers and a progressive approach to working with students. The course \"How to train teachers\" will allow us to work with our lecturers to ensure their continued education, to link the needs of the schools, of the clients with teachers' performance and lessons. The second activity is coaching and NLP, which represents a new and modern way of working with students based on empathic understanding, effective communication to maximize the students' potential, leading to better results and increased motivation. Both activities are in line with the latest trends in education that emphasize a humanistic approach to the student and the need to adapt the education to students (not students to the education plan).The knowledge and skills acquired by the teachers will be applied practically in the form of new courses, improved methodology, in creative work with teaching and supplementary materials to provide the student with more interesting and effective classroom hours. Their contribution to the development of the school will be optimized in the school\u2019s curricula with the teachers able to provide a wider range of courses and actively participate in the training of colleagues through mentoring. The expected learning outcomes of activities aimed at training teachers will improve the system of professional development of our lecturers. Our school will offer training courses intended for both our teachers and those at other teaching institutions. Better results and good feedback achieved by more effective approach to students will motivate them to seek further language training.The results are seen at several levels: the personal and professional development of the teachers, the continuing development of the school and its human resources, the expansion and diversity of course offer, the enrichment of teaching methodology, an increased interest in courses from corporate clients, greater public participation in education and improved language preparation of candidates and corporate clients.The impact of activities at local and regional levels is seen in qualified and professional language services for key employers, graduates and jobseekers with a positive affect on their work performance and activities on the labor market. New expanded courses with topics relevant to teachers from other language schools will create an opportunity for the further professional development and improve the quality of language teaching in Slovakia - at the national level.The project will enable us to modernize the methodologies used in our school and to carry out training that will increase the professionalism of our teachers . We wish to respond to the needs and expectations of the labor market and its participants with our language services. According to recent data up to 54% of jobs require English skills (source profesia.sk 02/2015), but in reality this requirement cannot be met. In this area we see the key effect of our project.

Why a new identity? Because this is a new school, in a new neighbourhood, with mixed population , which forced us to review constantly our working plans. We were pioneers in cooperative and task-based work, to improve our students results, as they are from different socio-economical origins. They have lots of problems to find resource so we decided to change our methodology.\r\nNow, educational laws are about to change and we need to increase our school objectives. Since two years ago, all teachers are focused on integrated language teaching. We live in a bilingual region and in addition to that, English is becoming stronger at school. Thus, we have designed a new multilingual school in which then three languages can be used in specific moments, focusing on language use rather than language teaching.\r\nWe want to improve our students communicative skills so we need to offer our students situation to use all languages. This is not a problem with official languages, but now we need to reinforce English language as an international communicative tool\r\nWe must offer our pupils the possibility to use English at school, and this is only possible if it is the teaching language. \r\nSince year 2012/2013 we have been developing several CLIL experiences at different levels (pre-primary and primary) and in different areas (assembly, project, science, art, P.E. etc) The results were really good and we decided to continue the same system. So, this year we are teaching in English some P.E. And art classes, and we would like to go on with the programme next year.\r\nThe main problem to develop this change at school is the English level of teachers. Most of them are not able to speak English in their classes with an appropriate quality level. For this reason, our  lifelong learning project states that all teachers should improve our English level, as well as  the use of different resources and strategies to integrate English in their classes in a natural way.\r\nErasmus + offers us the opportunity to improve the quality of our education through teachers courses. For this reason, in this first edition, our K1 project is going to focus on improving communicative and teaching competences. \r\nParticipants belong to different school levels, so the expected impact and diffusion will be wider. Also, they are active teachers who are cooperating with the project design from the first moment. \r\nThe activities have been selected according to the initial English level and to the different needs. Thus, the English teachers have selected courses about creative methodology and professional development. On the other hand, primary and pre-primary teachers have chosen courses focusing on speaking skills.  We think it is very important because they need to feel comfortable and sure when using English at school, and they need to offer a good linguistic reference tom their pupils to assure a quality education.\r\nWe are also interested in getting closer to European countries through cooperative projects. If teachers improve their English level, they will feel better participating in this kind of projects, such as those in eTwinning platform.\r\nAbout our partners in this European adventure, we have chosen 2 companies with a lot of experience in English teaching and teacher training. Selected courses, from  5 to 10 day, have been chosen according to their content and to the required English level  . We have also taken into account the location of the courses, Dublin and London, as travelling there is easier and they offer lots of possibilities to enjoy every moment during the stay.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, we would like to highlight that the main objective of this project is improving teachers communicative competence and, as a result of that, also the students one. We want to increase the quality of education, , offering equal opportunities to students with social difficulties. We want to show everybody that a new model of school is possible.", "http://www.oxfordhousecollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-003032_2"], [2015, "Mehr Methoden - mehr Motivation - mehr Vielfalt /Methodology and Language Skills", "Oxford House College Training Limited", 2312.0, 2, 2, "Project background:  This course is based on theoretical and practical principles which faciliate task based learning in a classroom. \r\nIt focuses on managing a classroom effectfively, which will be achieved by the definition of various types of learners and the use of a variety of methods such as visualisations, lexical approaches, correction techniques and other methods such as Harmer's ESA teaching model, Scrivener's ARC teaching model, etc.\r\n\r\nProject aims:  This intensive course enables teachers to improve their didactic skills and encourages them to integrate creativity in their classrooms.
