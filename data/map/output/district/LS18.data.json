At present, KS2 children receive regular French lessons. A link to a school in Spain and India has been establish. However, at present, only a small number of students are involved in these projects. A survey of KS2 staffs' confidence of speaking and teaching French was carried out and revealed that except for one member of the team, no staff had any formal training in French beyond GCSE level and confidence levels with regards to speaking French were extremely low. Having identified these needs of both staff and pupils, we decided to run a mobility project.\r\n\r\nWith our project we aim to:\r\n- provide various professional development opportunities for staff in order to improve their confidence with regards to speaking and teaching French. These include: immersion courses in France, in house training and job shadowing in the Spanish school)\r\n- raise attainment of all pupils in French by developing and implementing a French curriculum in KS1 and further improving our current KS2 curriculum. \r\n- establish a link with a school in France and further develop our link with the school in Spain\r\n- provide meaningful opportunities for children to learn about other cultures and communicate with children within Europe\r\n\r\nWho is participating?\r\n- Four of our staff (two from KS1, two from KS2) are being sent on immersion courses in France. All will be selected according to their willingness to help train other staff & develop the curricula along with the MFL coordinator. Moreover, participants will be selected in accordance to their confidence (low) in speaking and teaching French. Participants who have little or nor formal French qualifications will be prioritized. \r\n- Two members of staff will take part in the exchange to our Spanish link school. A willingness to develop the links and oversee joint to this school further will be the essential criteria for selection. \r\n\r\nWhat activities are being conducted?\r\n- Staff attending the immersion courses (tailored to the language needs of the individuals) in France. Their focus is on developing staffs\u2019 language skills, their understanding of the French culture, improving pronunciation and directly establishing links with a French school. \r\n- We will be expanding our current link to the Spanish school and will be establishing a link to a French school, so that we can offer all children opportunities to participate in termly joint projects which will provide them with meaningful opportunities to learn about other cultures. Two members of staff will additionally job shadow teachers in Spain.\r\n\r\nMethodology: Use of questionnaires, external & in-house professional development, pupil progress data analysis, development of French curricula\r\n\r\nWhat we envisage for our school in the near future:\r\nWe envisage that all our staff develop more confidence in speaking and teaching French. Termly professional development around language teaching will take place and will be led by the participants in our mobility project in conjunction with the MFL coordinator. A link to a French school will have been established and the current link to the school in Spain will have been further developed. Joint projects will be run on a termly basis in all three European schools. In light of this professional development and new/better links to other schools in Europe, children in KS2 will start making more progress in French and Year 6 children will be leaving our school with solid foundations in French and language learning. With the support of the participants, the KS2 French curriculum will be improved in order to better meet the needs of the new curriculum. A new curriculum for KS1 will be developed and trialled, before findings are shared amongst cluster schools. \r\n\r\nWhat we envisage for our school in the distant future:\r\nIf this project is as successful as we believe it will be, by the end of Year 6 our children will be leaving as competent, enthused language learners with strong foundations in French and a good understanding of the world. Children from the age of four will be making good progress in French each year and will be being taught by knowledgeable, confident class teachers. As a school, we will have strong links to various schools within Europe and will be regularly running joint projects. In order to maintain an excellent standard of language teaching, we will set-up a rolling program of professional development in which every year two staff go on an immersion course in France. Amongst our cluster schools and other Leeds based schools, we will assist in the set-up and running of similar projects/curricula.", null, "Horsforth Newlaithes Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012808_coordinator"]]}}, "4RR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Good Start for All: Development of Inclusive Education Methods for Pre-school Children from Socially Disadvantaged or Culturally Different Environments", "Tiny Signers", 231780.0, 5, 6, "According to the Eurydice Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in Europe 2014 report, 25 % of children under the age of six in the EU are at risk of poverty or exclusion. This number is likely to become higher with the current influx of refugees into Europe. To reach the aim of 95 % attendance for ECEC set out by the European Commission\u2019s Strategic Framework for Education and Training 2020, we must develop and strengthen capacities to meet the extra demands of this vulnerable group. \r\n\r\nFamily and community engagement is a necessary component in any strategy to tackle this challenge.  As highlighted by the OECD report on Encouraging Quality in ECEC, strengthening links between ECEC programs and community services is an effective way to engage with disadvantaged groups. Through already established contact and cultural sensitivity they are valuable partners in developing and implementing strategies to improve attendance and quality. Furthermore, evidence suggests that family engagement is key when addressing exclusion. The cognitive and socioemotional skills necessary for achieving success in schools are developed  before children enter the formal pre-school environments. Enriching family environments for disadvantaged children will proactively improve the possibilities for them to succeed (Heckman 2008)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the project will go into detail on the possibilities of cooperation among informal education settings with the pre-schools aiming to support the inclusion of children from socially disadvantaged or culturally different environments. The project builds on the outputs of the Strategic Partnership implemented in 2014-2016 focused on the support of social and emotional competencies of pre-school children. The goal of the current project is to draw out innovative recommendations based on the best practices in partner countries on how they work with families and children from socioeconomically disadvantaged  or culturally different environments such as migrant and Roma families, in order to prepare children to enter formal education and sustain. Accordingly the project is intended to prevent early school leaving (ESL) through engaging with socially and economically disadvantaged children at an early stage. In cooperation with partner organizations from five EU countries, the project will identify the main activities, methods, programs and strategies that are currently used to support pre-school children and parents at risk of social exclusion.  In order to facilitate effective exchange of best practices, a platform will be created, which will work on the selection of the methods, which proved to be successful and compile innovative inclusive practices to be used by the informal and formal education settings across the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project will start with data collection in partner countries focusing on the specific tools and strategies employed in various settings in which our partner organizations operate. This will be done through a survey conducted by partner organizations and other relevant stakeholders. Additionally, the partner organizations will submit independent reports where their practices will be thoroughly described.  Based on the data collected, the most effective elements and components of each strategy will be used to put together a set of best practices and develop a new inclusive approach to education of children at risk of social exclusion.  Gathering of best practices in different countries and different domains of partners will enable to developed new or improved practices to cater for the needs of children from disadvantaged environments.  Subsequently, training program for pedagogical as well as non-pedagogical personnel (45 in total) will be implemented for participants from every partner country in order to facilitate an effective exchange of best practices. Piloting stage of the project (15 non formal educational settings in partner countries, involving approx. 120 children and parents) will provide information on the transferability of evidence based practice into different cultural environment. As a result a Good Practice Guide for effective inclusive ECEC will be compiled describing the methods and strategies of involving children and parents from disadvantaged environments into mainstream education and the conditions needed for their implementation. Furthermore, if will elaborate on the possibilities of cooperation between non formal educators and pre-schools in supporting equal access for all children and preventing their drop out from school. \r\n\r\nThe identification and exchange of best practices will equip organizations and professionals with new methods and a larger toolbox to tackle issues surrounding socially disadvantaged children.

The scale of the impact is evident across all social classes and all ethnic groups. (Desforges 2003). \r\n\r\nThere is still underdeveloped public awareness of the importance and the need to educate parents and only small number of printed and published material is available to provide parent with enough  information. On the other hand, schools are not intensively involved in the parents education because of lack of trainings for work with parents.\r\n\r\nWhat the parents corner should be? \r\nParents Corner should be the place through which we strengthen our relationship with parents and build a new level of partnership.  We do not want our parents only come to the informational and parent meetings with class teachers, but it is at full capacity involved in school life. Through the \"Corner for parents\" actively involve parents in the new forms of partnership with the school: parents educators, volunteers, trainers, advisers, teaching assistants, participants in workshops, panel discussions, lectures, authors and co-authors in making guides, brochures, etc., which encourages and directs parents to serious relation to the obligations imposed by the education of children, and ultimately affects the improvement of relations between family-school and graduating with a resulting level of cooperation on the level of partnership. \r\nEducate parents in Corner for parents is meant to offer greater support to parents of children discrimination based on gender, age, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and disability, as well as to all parents whose children attend the school.

Essential in this process will be the close cooperation and involvement with parents, local communities as well as policy makers.  The reason and the need for the project comes from the fact that our time is characterized by immigration of historic proportions. Even before the recent migration trend,  the OECD report (2008) stated, at least 15 percent of the school population aged below 10 within the \u2018old EU member states\u2019 was either born abroad or has both parents born in another country\u2019. Particular increases have been monitored in the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Italy and Spain, where the percentage of school pupils born in another country has multiplied by a factor of three or four since 2000.   However recent OECD\u2019s analysis shows that further migration waves in 2015  have indeed provoked the unprecedented migrant crises. Not only because of the large numbers arriving in Europe, but also because of the differences with refugee flows in the past. This  calls for  support from countries which have limited experience in dealing with such flow.  Further promotion of migration and mobility by the European Union in the context of Europe 2020 strategy, shows the  need to improve the effectiveness of policies aiming at integration of migrants (Global approach on Migration and Mobility). The child care professionals, the kindergarten teachers, childminders and other carers are often  among the  first persons from the new cultural and education environment that the young migrant families build the relationship with.However the challenges the preschool teachers as well as other child care professionals  are facing  are sometimes overwhelming. The examples from the partner country show the following pictures:   in childcare in Soderhamn (areas of (areas of Lillberget, Kilsmyra and Ljusnev\u00e4gen) the children come from as many as 25 different linguistic and cultural environment. The situation is similar  Bradoford with as many as 17 languages and  in east Leads with 34 languages in Czech Republic they are facing the increased population from Poland and Ukrain,  in  Kilis the  immigrant population currently equals the local population.   The project multicultural/multilingual learning in early years will therefore develop the grounds to share, disseminate and further develop the approach of  multicultural/multilingual  education in early years. More specifically it aims:  \u2022 To identify, compare an exchange and further develop the practices, methodologies and approaches  as response to the needs of the immigrant children.  \u2022 To increase the quality of the early years education  through developing and implementing competence based accredited training modules on multilingual education in preschool for preservice and inservice training in preschool education,  training of parents and other childcare professionals, such as case workers, children\u2019s\u2019 centers supervisors as well as volunteers.  \u2022 To develop a comprehensive model  for parental involvement. \u2022 To use  the response to the needs of immigrant children and their families  as a means to favor educational and social inclusion of children and families belonging to minority and/or disadvantaged groups.All of our activities will  therefore include valuing children\u2019s first language, involving the families in the language learning and  promote their home language and culture while building the second language skills, which influences attitudes to education for a lifetime.

For young children with different cultural backgrounds and social disadvantages, this transition can be a challenging one. As such, it is important that programs are in place in early education institutions to facilitate the integration of such special needs children with their peers and thereby promote social development across the board. Evidence indicates that such programs, if executed properly and at an early age, help to negate pre-existing obstacles for young children with special needs and have a positive long-term impact on their social and emotional development, as well as academic capabilities. \r\n\r\nThere is a great emphasis on improving the basic academic skills of kindergarten and pre-school students because such improvements are easy to quantify and mean that a country's schools will compare favorably to those of other countries when analyzed statistically. However, while an emphasis on skills such as reading and writing is crucial, it fails to address the important social and emotional growth that occurs in ECEC.  In particular, many of the current educational systems do not do enough to address the needs of children who find the early school environment challenging as a result of learning disabilities or difficult backgrounds. Instead of being included, these children are often directed to separate schools or simply treated in a way that will only deepen their problems. This occurs largely as a result of an inability on the part of teachers to adequately handle the difficulties that come with taking responsibility for the special needs of children  who might require additional attention in order to become included and supported at a young age. \r\n\r\nIn this spirit, this strategic partnership aims at the development and implementation of innovative methodologies for the inclusion and adjustment of the children with special needs, especially those coming from socially disadvantaged or culturally different environments. Instead of considering disadvantaged children to be an insurmountable challenge, ECEC practitioners must be familiar with effective and proper ways to integrate and address the individual needs of such children. This includes familiarity with techniques for dealing with the many different kinds of behavioral difficulties children may have. For example, ideally, teachers would be comfortable addressing the needs of children from socially challenged families as well as those whose backgrounds may lead them to have trouble with linguistic and cultural issues (i.e., Roma children).

For the project \"Inclusion of children from a different cultural environment into kindergartens and the overcoming of language-cultural barriers\", we decided for two key reasons: the needs of students of the preschool education, who enter the intercultural labour market and are equipped with less inclusive knowledge, skills and the needs of the Pomurska kindergartens, with which we work and who are facing the growing cultural and linguistic diversity of children involved. An analysis of the needs of students and kindergartens has shown that children from a different cultural environment are involved as well in our kindergartens and that when dealing with them and their parents they face various challenges of overcoming both communication and cultural barriers.\r\nAmong the objectives of the project are:\r\na) at the student's level:\r\n- At least 60% of the pupils involved will have at least two methods at work with children from a different cultural environment or two inclusive approaches that will later be presented and used at school and kindergartens. The knowledge and skills will be gained through the observation of educators at work, the conversation with educators and concrete work with children;\r\n- at least 50% of pupils involved will increase their degree of tolerance and empathy during work in an intercultural environment during mobility;\r\n- at least 50% of the students involved will improve mobility on their communication skills and their understanding of the foreign language.\r\nb) at school level:\r\n- after completed mobility, at least 20% of teachers in the preschool education program will acquire the knowledge and skills acquired during the implementation of the project and will become involved in their Annual Work Plans, thus helping to spread tolerance and acceptance in the intercultural environment among students of preschool education;\r\n- on the project the acquired knowledge and approaches will be presented by the involved teachers, as well as students; and at least 50% to the professional staff of the Pomurska kindergartens and their principals. \r\nMobility will be carried out in two years: the first year in Germany and England, the second year only in Germany. During these two years, 30 pupils and 6 teachers will take part in the mobility (10 students in England, 20 students in Germany, two followers for each mobility flow). Students will be selected according to previously known criteria: a motivation letter, a foreign language proficiency, a mentor's grade at PUD (Practical Training at the Employer).\r\nThe main activity will be the mobility of students, which will be conducted in the same course after the same scheme:\r\n- preparation of pupils at school,\r\n- the arrival of students in Leeds or Paderborn and the accommodation with their host families,\r\n- presentation of the visiting organization and kindergartens, where students will be given practical training,\r\n- introducing students into a new working environment, acquainting with the rules of work in kindergartens, the way of working in a kindergarten and the way of monitoring their work,\r\n- practical training of pupils in kindergartens,\r\n- regular daily and weekly evaluations,\r\n- a joint workshop where participants and all mobility participants will present a joint evaluation,\r\n- the visit of cultural sites of York and Leeds in England or Paderborn and Detmold in Germany and two museums,\r\n- going back to Slovenia.\r\nAfter the mobility is done, evaluation reports will be prepared by all participants, dissemination will take place in the form of a presentation to the teacher's council and to other students, as well as the information about mobility to the public.
