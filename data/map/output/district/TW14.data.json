To give an example, activities, which will be taught and trained during an exchange period in the department air freight import may involve training in new IT systems, incident handling as well as creating and validating invoices. Activities with regards to air freight export include creating AWBs, identifying security status and enhancing customer communication tools. The exchange program will be supported and apprentices will be supervised locally by mentors who are operationally embedded in the respective departments.
