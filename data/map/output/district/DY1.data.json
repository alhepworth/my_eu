We also mean to make our students more open to the multicultural quality of today\u2019s world.\r\n \r\nWhat is more, our mobility project is strictly related to the eTwinning project we have been involved in for several years now with our two partner schools. We believe that thanks to meeting our eTwinning partners \u201cface to face\u201d we will be able to talk about what we have already achieved, to make detailed plans for the future, see the outcomes of the project and create real, not only virtual relationship with our partners. Our eTwinning project relates to the last main goal listed above, i.e. teaching values to children and improving their behaviour, as it is based on promoting moral values such as respect, kindness, honesty, friendship and family.\r\n \r\nThe project participants are a group of eight teachers who teach different age groups and different subjects but are also representatives of the management of the school and people who provide pastoral and special needs care for the students. They do not necessarily have to know English at a proficient level. The level enabling them to communicate is sufficient.

So, the company training represents a valuable and effective instrument to make the most of the competences acquired at school, in an international dimension.

Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners.

Within mobilities the learners will further improve or gain new learning outcomes (LO) applicable in practice according their qualification, they are being prepared for. Especially LOs that cannot be gained in sending institutions, but the labour market needs or will need them in near future. Effective evaluation and secure validation of gained LOs gained abroad is possible thanks to using elements of ECVET. \r\nDuring preparation the learners of 40-day mobility will use OLS and have course of bilan de compet\u00e9nces (BdC) with certified BdC counsellor from KABA, in which we will use tools imported within projects SCAN (LdV TOI 2012) and CompCert (KA2 2015).

Enlarging one's knowledge, discovering something new and being able to look at familiar things from a different perspective and to put them into question during an exchange with people from other cultural backgrounds, these are skills which are of increasing importance in view of a rapidly changing and increasingly networked world.The objectives of our project are therefore:- Giving incentives to move into something new- Sensitizing participants for different structures and approaches by taking a different point of view- Enhancing intercultural competence by \"immersing\" in complex and different professional environments and situations- Developing and strengthening self-confidence and empowerment by engaging in different everyday lives and working structuresand by getting to know and experiencing different value systems- Enhancing perseverence and the ability to remain calm when coping with unfamiliar situations- Getting to know the languages and approaches of colleagues, business partners and customers and learning how to work and communicate in these languages without misunderstandings- Providing learners and teaching staff with skills which enable them to adapt more easily to technological and organisational changes within complex social structures and a diverse and multilingual information society- Improving the quality and efficiency of vocational training by exploiting the plurality of learning environments both at home and abroad- Improving chances, flexibility and competitiveness - employability - of young people in different professional fields on global labour markets- Encouraging learners and teaching staff to actively \"live\" mobility and cross-border cooperation by widening their perspective andtheir personal and professional range beyond national borders- Giving teachers the opportunity to explore the common work and learning place called Europe and to initiate and shape learning cooperations and networks Europe-wide- Enhancing the international orientation of our vocational school and integrating it visibly into all its fields.The project participants come from different job and training backgrounds but they all have something in common: They all learn, study and work in a multicultural environment characterized by diversity. Taking part in this project will enable them to work more efficiently in internationally orientated enterprises and organisations, especially with regard to people coming from different cultural backgrounds and speaking different languages.For the teaching staff the project offers the chance to enlarge their intercultural competence both professionally and personally in a European context, to get new input and ideas for their work and to review and reassess familiar concepts.All in all: Our main objective is to motivate students, trainees, trainers and teachers to get to know people in different cultural contexts , to exchange knowledge and experiences, to discover something new, experience diversity as a value, broaden their horizons as much as possible and use the qualifications, skills and experiences thus acquired as a basis for further learning and training. The most important topic of the project is to encourage people, regardless of age and status, to stay open-minded and curious, to discover the diversity of ways of life and of approaches, to change their familiar point of view and their learning environment which means to increase their mobility by acquiring more competences enabling them to cope with rapidly changing situations and to communicate with people world-wide.During the project different activities and measures will be carried out, e.g. work placements for students or assignments for teachers to initiate cooperations with colleagues in Europe to exchange professional knowledge, ideas and materials.

The schools became more active in the mobilities, students gained vocational experience they brought back home. To prepare this project as consortium was a challenge, since the members (including new member) had to think about strategy of development in upcoming years and also because for 2015 we included several innovations. \r\nAmong most important is inclusion of elements of ECVET. We are going to implement them in electronically (online) for on our portal www.ucetzrucnosti.sk (transl.: \"skillsaccount\"), where the participants of current project are already filling their daily reports under supervision of VET teachers. \r\nTo raise the number of involved participants within the set budget according the availability of schools we want to create a twin or \"buddy\" for each participant. These would be students of the same field that before and during mobility communicate with participant abroad and hopefully observing the gaining of competencies by participant they would be motivated to work on their own personal development. \r\nAs the last innovation we are planning to do a pilot combined-mobility from two schools that have partially overlapping fields. We will create miniproject teams that will get a task. For successful dealing with the task the students of both schools within the team have to cooperate before and during mobility, in foreign environment and foreign language. We expect bigger impact compared to two single mobilities with lower costs. \r\nThe main goal of the project is within vocational practice to place 18 students of Obchodna Akademia Martin in the field business academy and 28 students of Stredn\u00e1 priemyslen\u00e1 \u0161kola Martin in the fields electronics, mechatronics, logistics and technical lyceum to VET schools and training institutes in UK and Czech republic, then 34 students of SO\u0160 of trade and services in Martin in the gastronomy and hotel services, cosmetics and hairdresser into companies in Italy, Spain and at VET school and it's local partners in Poland and 14 students SO\u0160 Turany of agricultural entrepreneurship - breeding and horse riding in Italian companies. In three rounds we are planning to send 6 members of schools' management and 7 VET teachers for vocational education to schools in Greece, Czech republic and Italy. \r\nAmong other goals belongs successful implementation of ECVET elements, to know how to evaluate and validate gained skills and competencies, identify key competencies of participants, using bilan de comp\u00e9tences, involvement of management and VET teachers in participating on mobilities and so prepare field for broader cooperation in further years not only by sending but also hosting teachers and students, allow the participants to improve their language skills and bring new techniques and proposals for improvement of study programs. \r\nIn total there will be in involved 94 students, out of which 46 in VET institutes and 48 in companies, 6 members of management and 7 VET teachers and 13 more teachers in role of accompanying person. Among main activities (A1) belong 3 rounds of staff mobilities to Italy, Greece and Czech Republic, (A2) 4 rounds of students for 2 weeks to companies abroad to Italy, Poland and Spain and (A3) 4 rounds of students to VET institutes for 2 weeks in UK and Czech republic. \r\nThe aim of the project is on practical education and during preparation we will use tools of bilan de compet\u00e9nces that we imported via Leonardo TOI in 2012.

Experiencing, exploring and documenting different learning and working environments in Europe to enhance intercultural skills in education and vocational training\" for students, trainees and teaching staff is on the one hand based on the fact that we have a growing range of organisational, logistic and financial opportunities to open up and discover Europe as a space for learning and on the other hand on the motivating awareness that we are life-long learners, regardless of age and status who have to move within increasingly internationalized networks. Enlarging knowledge already acquired, discovering something new and being able to look at familiar things from a different perspective and to put them into question during an exchange with people from other cultural backgrounds, these are skills which are of increasing importance in view of a rapidly changing and globalized world.\r\nThe objectives of our project are therefore:\r\n- Giving incentives to move\r\n- Sensitizing participants for different structures and approaches by taking a different point of view\r\n-  Enhancing intercultural competence by \"immersing\" in complex and different professional environments and situations\r\n-  Developing and strengthening self-confidence and empowerment by engaging in different everyday lives and working structures and by getting to know and experiencing different value systems\r\n- Enhancing perseverence and the ability to remain calm when coping with unfamiliar situations\r\n- Getting to know the languages and approaches of colleagues, business partners and customers and learning how to work and  communicate in these languages without misunderstandings\r\n- Providing learners and teaching staff with competences which enable them to adapt more easily to technological and organisational changes within complex social structures and a diverse and multilingual information society\r\n- Improving the quality and efficiency of vocational training by exploiting the plurality of learning environments both at home and abroad\r\n- Improving chances, flexibility and competitiveness - employability - of young people in different professional fields on global labour markets\r\n- Encouraging learners and teaching staff to actively \"live\" mobility and cross-border cooperation by widening their perspective and their personal and professional range beyond national borders: Feeling \"at home\" elsewhere in the world\r\n- Giving teachers the opportunity to explore the common work and learning place called Europe and to initiate and shape Europe-wide learning cooperations and networks\r\n- Enhancing the international orientation of our school and integrating it visibly into all its fields.\r\nThe participants come from different job and training backgrounds but they all have something in common: They all learn, study and work in a multicultural environment characterized by diversity. Taking part in this project will enable them to work more efficiently in internationally orientated enterprises and organisations, especially with regard to people coming from different cultural backgrounds and speaking different languages.\r\nFor the teaching staff the project offers the chance to enlarge their intercultural competence both professionally and personally in a European context, to get new input and ideas for their work and to review and reassess familiar concepts.\r\nAll in all: Our main objective is to motivate students, trainees, trainers and teachers to get to know people in different cultural contexts , to exchange knowledge and experiences, to discover something new, experience diversity, broaden their horizons as much as possible and use the qualifications, skills and experiences thus acquired as a basis for further learning and training.\r\nThe most important topic of the project is to encourage people, regardless of age and status, to stay open-minded and curious, to discover the diversity of ways of life and of approaches, to change their familiar point of view and their learning environment which means to increase their mobility by acquiring more competences enabling them to cope with rapidly changing situations and to communicate with people world-wide.\r\nDuring the project different procedures and measures will be carried out, e.g. work placements for students and trainees or assignments for teachers to initiate cooperations with colleagues in Europe to exchange professional knowledge, ideas and materials.\r\nThus preparation measures which accompany the different project flows vary according to participants and include for example intercultural training and language courses.\r\nDuring the implementation and follow-up of the project different ways of documentation will be used, e.g. presentations, releases in the media or printed material.\r\nThe results of the project will ensure a sustainable development and growth of each participant's personality and provide evidence for vocational training structures in a European context.", "http://www.dudleycol.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001729_24"], [2018, "Konzorcium obchodn\u00fdch \u0161k\u00f4l - spolo\u010dne do Eur\u00f3py 2018", "Dudley College of Technology", 128361.0, 4, 4, "The aim of the project Consortium of business schools \u2013 Together to Europe 2018 is the enhancement of vocational knowledge, skills and competencies for the mobility participants, through the work placements in companies and trainings in institutions.

Students involved are studying one of these specialties: car technician, cleaning services, household economy, cooks, cook's helper, building and road construction, IT specialist, customer service assistant for logistics\u2019 companies, agricultural producer, equine management and veterinary assistance. Staff mobility includes 4 staff members (head teachers and the management) and 10 professional teachers. The aim of staff mobility is to introduce different teaching methodologies and tools, also to widen their knowledge so that it would lead to appropriate changes in our respective curricula. We hope that it would help teachers to generate new ideas on how to integrate different subjects in order to improve the teaching quality, so that the learner would be more motivated to learn, and that the knowledge would help them in the future life. The involvement of different methods and ICT tools help to teach how to solve vital problems and face challenges, and as a results of this, students are more enterprising, more willing to generate ideas and look for new solutions, able to set goals and achieve them, and are more responsible. \r\nIn addition, we value life-long learning key competences: developing foreign language skills, motivating participants to study other foreign languages and gaining an interest in foreign cultures, teaching both students and teachers\u2019 self-confidence and initiative. The project activities offer opportunities to broaden their mind by learning more about foreign traditions, cultures, technologies and work-specifics vocational skills. \r\nIn the mobility project, we prefer to include students from the second and third year, because they have already gained knowledge and professional skills and have some work experience.

We believe that work placements abroad and foreign experience makes young people more privileged than their classmates, also proves their courage and initiative to achieve more.

Like every human being also people with disabilities have social and economic needs. To meet these needs the problems appear to be faced more than other people, it is thought that they have been experiencing difficulties in terms of both education and employment. The most important way to bring disabled people into society is to educate them and have them get a job.\r\nThe right to work is important for all members of society plays a key role in for people with disabilities for the participation to the society in which they live. Working means an effort physically and mentally to produce something, contains important implications for individuals and society in which they live. First of all, individual\u2019s survival being safely and self-fulfillment depends on working. \r\nPeople, who are not able to have a job and career, live with the lack of social and economic confidence. It is necessary to teach the individuals with disabilities the occupation they can do best to develop the confidence, to gain a realistic self-concept, to reduce their dependence on others.\r\nHowever, a few disabilities have managed to have a job though, for the vast majority of people with disabilities occupation remains as the most important issue.\r\nIn addition, prejudice and attitude inaccurate information about disabilities of many employers and others in the community will limit further job opportunities. Therefore, both it is just not enough to teach the people with disabilities the best job can do but also the employment of individuals and maintaining thereof is equally important.\r\nIt is a well known fact that a right to vocational training however, considering people with disabilities especially vocational trainings and career directed of mentally disabled, this mentioned issue only have been carried out by a limited number of institutions hence, it is thought that people with mental disabilities do not enough benefit from vocational training services of apprenticeship centers and adult education centers as the other individuals benefiting from. \r\nOne of the most significant barriers to employment of persons with disabilities is the low education levels of these individuals.\r\nIt should be achieved to try to eliminate the disabilities\u2019 handicaps or where this is not possible to provide them necessary material and spiritual possibilities to be able to continue their life.

This process is focus on the institution both as vocational training center, and the founder center of InnMain European network (www.innmain.eu). XABEC is the coordinator of the mobility strategy of InnMain, including 18 institutions from 12 EU countries. \r\n\r\nThe project name is representative of the spirit behind the proposal: an authentic \"catalysis\". Taking as a simile the process by which the speed of a chemical reaction is supported (or increased) due to the participation of a substance called a catalyst.\r\n\r\nInnMain members want to turn the mobility of our students into a regular, sustainable and successful practice for all stakeholders: students, teachers, companies and families. The departments are the catalyst of all those \"reactions\" generated by means of students and teachers' mobilities.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of team work, a tool based on \"Common Units of Learning\" has been developed. The online tool fill the need for professionalism in the preparation of the MoU between institutions (www.topomost.es). The MoU sets the basis for the preparation of the specific activities to be undertaken in a school during the period of mobility. Activities must be measurable and capable of recognition and validation by the sending institution, which fully agrees with our \"ProjectX\". (www.projectxone2one.eu). Since ProjectX do not require an overall match in academic level or programs, mobilities of teachers, to exchange ProjectX implementation between institutions is a medium-term goal. Thus national education systems are respected and the ordinary rhythm of classes is not disturbed.\r\n\r\nCaLoReT 2015 has three objectives:\r\n\r\n1.- TEACHERS. \r\nConstitute International Technical Departments, based on common knowledge areas. Departments gather teachers of similar subjects, from whom proposals of students and teachers' mobilities, may arise in the future. From such departments will naturally arise interesting strategic partnerships for academic innovation. To achieve this goal 11 meetings have been scheduled in 11 different countries. Xabec organizes the meeting in \"Human Factors\" and attends 9 more meetings. Xabec teachers who will use mobilities for this call are the Heads of Department and, in some cases, will travel with a collaborator.\r\n\r\n2. STUDENTS.\r\nA group of 3 students carry out three months internships in Portugal and the UK. The companies share our mobility strategy.\r\n\r\n3. STUDENTS.\r\nAnd 6 students will travel to four schools for a \u201cProjectX\u201d previously agreed and validated by both institutions (sending and receiving) with assessment and validation of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe most important result is the consolidation of InnMain European network. All of the partners are well-known: we have worked together in the past in TOI projects, or associations. And, of course, with some we already have positive experiences of mobilities.\r\n\r\nMobilities of both teachers and students will have their prior preparation: Technical Departments have a script supervised by the Executive Board of InnMain, and students will be prepared according to standard procedure established by Xabec's Internal Rules of procedure.\r\n\r\nXabec has a International Department that will be the one responsible for the administrative management of the entire project (see presentation: http://www.xabec.es/xabec-internacional.php).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on Xabec environment will be very important: \r\n- firstly, teachers are going to be involved with the international department. This sets a new challenge on continuous improvement and extra motivation to improve language skills.\r\n- In the students, because the mobilities of ProjectX will not break the ordinary rhythm of classes and do not require  a high level of knowledge in foreign languages. This has already gotten the attraction of our students, increasing the number prospective students who wish to have an international experience.\r\n- In companies related with Xabec because they ask for students with social and international skills.\r\n- In the Valencian and Spanish society in general, because we honestly think that this experience can be put as an example of good practice.\r\n- And at European level, we hope to keep increasing the number of schools participating in this project, with this tool and methodology.\r\n\r\nAs a final summary we can say that CaLoReT 2015 reflects a desire to consolidate the international dimension we want for Xabec, in the context of InnMain European network: a reliable and stable network, with a strategy perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy.", "http://www.dudleycol.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-013718_11"], [2014, "EuropAktiv", "Dudley College of Technology", 26519.0, 3, 4, "Project participants:\r\nAssociation 3K-Aktiv, IBD Partnership / UK, Europe PARAGON for Malta and the Dudley College in the Birmingham / UK.\r\n3K-Aktiv leads and supports the administrative and organizational aspects of the project.

They has taken responsibility to improve the social environment and quality of life of young people who are faring worse.These new entities have made a effort to fill the gaps of the welfare system, but often these associations are disoriented and they can't alleviate the basic needs of youth in all its areas and also claim for their rights.This it's a job that does not appear in the news or in the media, but is necessary for society to know that there are heroes who implement many initiatives to change and add value to their municipalities. Initiatives managed by young people that sometimes, either through ignorance or lack of experience, are disoriented and do not know well how to manage projects and implement their projects.\"We're super\" is an initiative that seeks to value all that work done by young people and for young people through the creation of a European network to boost and strengthen the community impact of all associations that work in their regions. This project seeks to help them in any way necessary to enable them to have a profound impact on their young beneficiaries.For that reason, \"We're super\" aims to create a high-quality intellectual outcome endorsed and promoted by many local and regional governments: INTEGRAL SYSTEM FOR PROMOTION OF YOUTH ASSOCIATIONISM.This result will include:1. An innovative Web Application that enables economic, social and employment impact calculation of social entities in their region. This program standardize the criteria to measure their impact, obtained from rigorous study by educational and governmental authorities to help the public authorities better assess the return of aid given to the third sector.2. Platform \"We're super\" for the promotion and visibility of the associations and their projects across Europe. This platform will provide ICT and innovative tools that promote transparency and quality management processes and results of social entities.3. European guidelines and multimedia resources for the management of association, implementation of projects and know more about the taxation of youth associations.In addition to this intellectual result, this project will also enhance the visibility and communication of social associations, creating networks of multidisciplinary work and relations between entities, promotional organizations and technical experts promoting new projects of high quality and with greater social impact.For that, the new network will include 6 prestigious European organizations as Fundaci\u00f3 Horta Sud (Spain), Association of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Nova Gradi\u0161ka (Croatia), Asociatia of Culture Tineret if Educatie \"Speranta Ramniceana\" (Romania), AKTO - Human Rights and Democracy (Portugal), Enlights Projects (UK) and Gia Evropaiki Diktio Politotita ke Taftotita (Cyprus). For 18 months they will held three international meetings and will prepare materials with collaboration of local governments, universities and hundreds of associations cooperating in the field of youth, that will ensure the impact, visibility and dissemination of results. It should be noted the support of the Directorate General of Participation of the Generalitat Valenciana and the Generalitat Jove-IVAJ. They will provide a real impact to the project.It is necessary for society to know that there are many initiatives to change and add value to their municipalities. To do that, a large multiplier event will be made at the end of the project. It will serve to publicize the results, but above all to enhance the visibility of all beneficiary organizations and to promote their dialogue with public authorities.In \u201cWe're Super\u201d young people never get down, we know that our dreams are possible, we can improve our society and build the future.

These are the three spines that articulate our project. It is a project initiated by a group of young local artists who rely on the structure of the municipal youth information center to develop their idea with an European dimension. Urban art is their focus and the mobility that allows public transportation (in our case the rail) is their way to meet other young people in similar situation. Thus, from the youth information center we have been working with them for a year and now we have decided to explore the situation in other parts of Europe. We will work on two parallel levels, first the animators and youth counselors who work with youth groups and second the youth themselves .\r\n\r\nThis project has 3 parts . The first is a seminar of youth workers that will be address issues of urban mobility, urban art and youth participation. It will also serve to prepare local activities. The second part will be a series of local activities that each partner will develop in their environment. And the third part will be a youth exchange where young people will meet, share their local realities and learn new artistic techniques and citizen participation .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipation of 3 youth workers/professionals per partner is expected . The profile will be workers / professionals using city youth art as a tool of their regular activity. It will be a 5-day activity in which debates , visits to art spaces , interviews with young artists, workshops and exchange of good practices will be organized. This activity will take place in Silla ( Valencia).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n300 youth participation in local activities is expected . These activities will be coordinated by the partners and will include both training workshops and exhibitions / collective artistic interventions and playful and festive gatherings. In all the local activities, the transnational component of the project will be present , providing a colorful dose of international partnership and visibility of EU funding .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participation of 33 young people and 7 leaders in the youth exchange is expected . The profile of the participants will be young people interested in urban art ( any form ) and motivated by meeting new people from other countries.

They will gain planning and organisational skills, skills working with people from different cultures, increased understanding and breakdown some of the stereotypes that exist in the world today. Enlight and its partners hope that the young people will also begin to get rid of some of the fear they have of travel and the fear of meeting somebody new and building positive relationships with other young people across Europe. Young people will also learn more around Europe and gain an understanding from another young person's point of view.The participants will learn some common words in Spanish and Spanish and people will learn common words in English.
