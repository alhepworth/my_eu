Therefore, in Germany the discussion about basic orientation and the future of youth work is recently more and more focussing on a change of this paradigm moving to more adequate strategies to \"enable youth\" (BMFSFJ) or \"giving free spaces for young people\" (AGJ). The strategic partnership ENOC - European Network of Outdoor Centres, wants to link with this new orientation and strengthen the programmes of outdoor education centres on both, national and European level. \r\n\r\nThe main methodical approach of this project relies on the ideas of outdoor adventure education and experiential learning and focuses a differentiated aesthetical practice. Examples of best practice from each partner organisation will be collected, systemized, and further developed within the implementation of this project in order to provide a handbook with appropriate tools to address the power of youth work more to the necessities of a pleasant youth. The five involved organisations can refer to a long experience in outdoor pedagogy and reach thousands of young people each year with their non-formal educational programmes.  \r\n\r\nSome aspects about the understanding of aesthetic approaches: In natural and outdoor settings they offer opportunities for individually perceived experiences. Understood as learning processes with the use of all senses, aesthetic approaches contribute to a successful process of personal development for all young people - and in particular for those with fewer opportunities. The involved organisations are important players on each of their national level of youth work with strong connections to the formal learning sector, which gives additional potential of strengthening of concepts - such as aesthetic approaches - focussing on open processes of (experiential) learning. Main objective of the project is the exchange of good practice in the work with groups of young people in outdoor centres. At the end of the project all outdoor centres should be provided with new methodologies and approaches in the field of the aesthetic, which in turn leads to a benefit for all future participants of outdoor education programs of the involved organisations. At the same time the project aims to a stronger and deeper collaborations and networking of al partner organisations on a European level. By establishing a web-page this network should become a strong pool of outdoor centres with a good visibility for other interested people. \r\n\r\nTo summarize the project objectives: We want a) to publish a handbook with examples of good practice of outdoor education with aesthetical approaches, b) to implement a \u201eTrain the Trainer\u201c-seminar, c) to evaluate the examples of good practice during a long-term period of implementation into the daily work of the outdoor-centres, c) to create better conditions for a cooperation between all partners in terms of other projects on European level (e.g. youth meetings, job shadowing). \r\nThe most important part to reach these goals are three planned project meetings, which serve to develop a professional concept, to consider theoretical aspects, to share the best practice and to evaluate and disseminate the project results. Being part of the project means to further develop the professional standards and methodical diversity of each organisation in their daily work. This leads to a stronger appearance of the outdoor learning programmes for potential partner and target groups. \r\n\r\nAs a whole, the project marks a starting point of the implementation of a network of outdoor education centres across Europe. Thousands of participants of their programs of non-formal education will benefit each year from the outcome of this strategic partnership. On the basis of a functioning network we hope to win new members and continue to share ideas, methods, good practice and experiences on a bigger European level. All involved organisations see the project as a chance and good start to deepen their connections to Europe and establishing youth work on a more transnational level.", "http://www.brathay.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DE04-KA205-016004_4"]]}}}}
