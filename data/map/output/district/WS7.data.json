This project will have three types of beneficiaries. The first group consists of learners/apprentices who are under taking a level 2 or 3 apprenticeship in early years. This group of 18 learners/apprentices are aged from 16 years upwards and are in the early stages of their vocational education and training with limited childcare experience. The second group are staff (BAM) who are undertaking a management qualification. This group of 22 staff have considerable childcare experience and are a group of elite staff (BAM) whom the company has identified to move into management positions. The third and final group will comprise of 5 staff (trainers) who have considerable childcare and management experience and deliver the company training programmes from level 2 to 5 plus short courses.We envisage the following impacts for each of the groups :Learners/apprenticesAs the youngest group of learners/apprentices and least experienced we expect they will return with  increased confidence supported by an increased appetite for learning and mobility. Greater cultural awareness and an understanding of different childcare practices will be a positive outcome. The initial impact will be measured by completing and discussing their reflective diaries and analysis of facebook and other social media comments. Longer term impact will be measured by interviewing learners three months after the programme as to the impact the experience has had on their practice. Staff (BAM) undertaking management qualificationAs the most talented group and upwardly mobile staff we envisage the new found skills and abilities will impact on each organisations ability to be  the sector leaders for innovative care. In addition this group will benefit from an increased appetite for learning and mobility ,greater cultural awareness and an understanding of different childcare practices. The initial impact will be measured by completing and discussing their reflective diaries and informing practice. Also through analysis of facebook and other social media comments. Longer term impact will be measured by the number of applications to become a mobility champion. Other staff (Trainers)As a highly skilled, adept at training and delivery with strong childcare and managerial background. As a consequence we would expect greater use of their critical anyalsis skills to improve leadership and management techniques plus an increased appetite for learning and mobility. In addition the staff (Trainers) group will benefit from greater cultural awareness and an understanding of different childcare practices. The initial impact will be measured by completing and discussing their reflective diaries and informing practice and the presentation of their findings. Also through analysis of facebook and other social media comments. Longer term impact will be measured by incorporating findings into practice and training programmes .All staff (Trainers/BAM)and learners/apprentices will return with greater inter cultural awareness and an international perspective on teaching, learning,management and training. In addition they will return with an enhanced and richer early years vocabulary founded on an international perspective. It is also expected that all staff (Trainers/BAM) will return with greater enthusiasm and inspiration to adapt their offer to reflect newly acquired skills and approaches.  The experience and opportunity will have broadened their horizons particularly for those who have not been abroad before, expanded their knowledge of Dutch culture and language, cement group relations and developed the soft skills required to engage with members of society ( non verbal and verbal communication techniques, team building and assertiveness.)", "https://www.busybeeschildcare.co.uk/", "Busy Bees Nurseries Ltd", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023663_coordinator"], [2014, "Portfolioarbeit im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich  -  das Lernen der Kinder von Beginn an individuell begleiten", "busy bees childcare", 13898.0, 3, 5, "Translation:\r\nWorking with portfolios has become a big issue in pedagogical work of Austrian kindergarten groups, depending on the responsible carriers- especially in Vienna and Lower Austria. There are different ways of using portfolios- some are more detailed than others, but all focus on the main question: How can those written documents become an individual companion of the children\u2019s learning processes?\r\nThe aim of this project is to show the students current topics of kindergarten work and also to raise their awareness of diverse aspects of portfolio work throughout different institutions. Some work more intensively than others, which is determined by factors such as the role of man, the personal role of teachers and the current status of pedagogy and didactics.  \r\nTherefore it is crucial for our pupils to gain experience in England and Finland to see similarities and differences when working with children of the same age.\r\nProject aims\r\nThe students get the chance to\u2026\r\n\u2022 \u2026have an insight into the work of different international educational facilities\r\n\u2022 \u2026learn about new concepts and methods about portfolio acquisition.\r\n\u2022 \u2026experience, how portfolios support to observe educational process which then can be  \r\n    recorded\r\n\u2022 \u2026come to know that portfolios are a medium to achieve sustained education\r\n\u2022 \u2026get to know about the significance of life-long- learning\r\n\u2022 \u2026find out that portfolios foster resources  and open up new vistas\r\n\u2022 \u2026learn about the meaning of portfolios in integrative and activity-oriented learning\r\nNumber of Participants/ additional information about students:\r\n20 pupils of 4th upper- grade can take part in the project in which they make a practical training in selected kindergarten groups, for three weeks. There they get the opportunity to get an insight into different ways of portfolio work and also the chance to try out and implement these.\r\nThe achievements of these students are not only work experience and new teaching methods, but more importantly of personal advancement.", "http://www.busybees.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000418_3"]]}}}}
