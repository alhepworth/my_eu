They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_149"]]}}}}
