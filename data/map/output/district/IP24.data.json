This unique approach, moving on from the current state of the art using rigid cell or film based PV materials and batteries, will allow development of large-area deformable products, including agricultural shading, automotive soft-tops, building facades, rollable shades, curtains and roofing, aerospace fabrics, and outdoor goods.\n\nThe key challenges are:\n\u2022\tFormulation of PV and energy storage materials to be applied as flexible thin coatings on monofilament fibres. SME materials suppliers Cyanine (PV dyes) and PPC (polymer coatings) will work with universities, EPFL (PV) and Brunel (storage) who are leaders in these fields.\n\u2022\tDevelopment and application of fibre spinning and coating methods to make the two multi-layer fibre types, followed by generation of a textile combining the two. Fibre and fabric manufacturers Sefar, CeNTI (SME) and VDS weaving (SME) will work with textile and coating experts, Centexbel and TWI.\n\u2022\tIntegration of the two fibres, requiring end preparation to reveal conductors, interconnect and micro-circuitry, followed by attachment to a load device.

The main requirements are: durability, ease of installation, optical appearance, ease of cleaning and low cost maintenance.\nOn the other hand slip accidents are a major source of injury in Europe. The floorings industry is therefore challenged to develop flooring with improved slip behaviour under varying environmental conditions (humidity caused by rain or cleaning can reduce friction dramatically). Besides there is often a conflict of interest between decreasing slipperiness and maintaining ease of cleaning  because conventional approaches to reduce slipperiness imply the macroscopic roughening of the surface resulting in the collection of dirt (problem in hospitals).\nWith new standards and testing methods harmonised in Europe this problem becomes more prominent, requiring substantially new and innovative approaches to address the problem by the flooring industry, like material suppliers, coating technology manufacturers, flooring installers, cleaners and companies developing testing methods.\nSlipSafe involves the key players in the industry in an integrated bottom-up approach. Based on fundamental studies of the tribological phenomena of slip under varying environmental conditions, SlipSafe will develop new intelligent material formulations and processes to gain control of the interface between flooring and shoe. New technologies will allow the use of these new materials in flooring manufacturing as well as in an after-treatment process to renew existing or worn out floorings with anti-slip properties. A key aim is to at least double service life and to allow easy cleaning. An important factor will be development of a new testing method, allowing monitoring of slipperiness as a function of the wear of installed flooring material.", null, 2158258.0, 5, 13, "SLIPSAFE", null, "http://www.peerless-coatings.co.uk", null, "fp7_111374_954688454"]]}}, "1RH": {"life": {"data": [[1992, "The management and protection of the Breckland", "Norfolk Naturalists Trust", 608919.0, 243568.0, "Consisting of 7 000 ha of poor, acidic sandy soil on top of chalk, the Breckland of East Anglia, has long been recognised as an area of high nature conservation value. It contains a priority habitat type (pseudo-steppe grass heath) under the Habitats Directive, only occurring in three other areas in the EU.  Its significance lies in the close association of wetlands, heather and grass heaths which flourish in semi-continental conditions unique to Britain. There is a mixture of rare steppe, Mediterranean and coastal species (including nine species listed in the annexes of the Birds Directive). Although traditionally these habitats formed part of an integrated system of land use, these practices have since given way to more permanent intensive agricultural practices.

Moreover, students could easily increase and strengthen their professional language skills in a foreign  language environment. \r\nThe working language of the project is English, it is used in contacts among the partners as well as for the practical training. At the beginning of the project participants are trained by an English language and cultural preparation course.\r\nDuring the project, a total of fifteen teachers and twenty-three students and four accompanying teachers (one for each turn) travel to the foreign partners.  The internship of the participants will be monitored by local assistants (one contact mentor for each turn) and our accompanying teacher.\r\nTeacher's internships:\r\n1)  Racing Academy & Centre of Education - Kildare, Ireland: in our irish partner's place our teachers can get more informations about its worksystem, and trainings for galopp racing, and work with English Thoroughbreds - Autumn 2018. \r\n2) Shadwell Stud Ltd. - Thetford, United Kingdom: This is a perfectly place of English Thoroughbred's breeding.
