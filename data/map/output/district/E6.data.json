This involves challenging stereotypes and stigmas about young people and communities (through creative arts and writing).\r\n\r\nThis is our first Erasmus+ project. Its objective is to create a platform for young people around Europe to report on social, cultural and migration issues through creative media, and to develop the competences of the youth workers, young people and partner organisations involved. The project results will be written articles, graphics and video / podcasts, presented on a public, interactive website. The longer term benefits will be increased public awareness and understanding of European intercultural and migration-related issues, and more young people involved in reporting them.\r\n\r\nScribersHive is one of our most innovative and already successful projects in the UK. It is a new platform for young writers, storytellers and change makers age 16+ which enables them to share thoughts and opinions on various social issues and topics that matter to them. ScribersHive has a strong social purpose; to empower young people to find their voice and be heard through writing and creative arts. Through the project, they connect to social issues, topics, stories & debates in a unique and interactive way. It involves 3 activities: (a) writing an article on youth social or cultural issues; (b) creating graphics (comic strips) based on the article; (c) creating a podcast based on the graphic. Through this process, one young person inspires another, and socio-cultural issues are represented in a lively, creative and accessible way.\r\n\r\nOur KA1 project will now promote the ScribersHive concept around Europe, using the same methodology but with a focus on migration issues and intercultural dialogue. The aim is to understand other European and migrant cultures from the inside and the outside, appreciate differences and similarities, and confront stereotypes, preconceptions and prejudices, particularly in relation to migrant communities. The project will be in 3 phases, with local activity in between:\r\nPhase 1: training course in UK. Participants will learn about ScribersHive, review results of the UK pilot project and meet young people involved. They will then take part in a full simulation of the ScribersHive process (so they completely understand it) and make action plans for working with young people back home. Additional training will be given on journalism. Followed by LOCAL ACTIVITY 1: work with young people to produce written articles about social or cultural life in their own country. Finished articles will be collected by You Press for publication on the website.\r\nPhase 2: training course in Poland. Participants will review progress and be given additional training in graphics, podcasting and video making. Followed by LOCAL ACTIVITY 2: within each partner group, written articles from country A are passed to young people in country B, B to C, and C to A. Each group will interpret the article they have received, and create a graphic (comic strip) from it. Finished graphics will be collected by You Press for publication on the website. LOCAL ACTIVITY 3: another exchange of material from one country to another in each partner group. This time, each group interprets the graphic, and turns it into a podcast or video.

The work experience will be directly related to their vocational studies which include the sectors of Travel and Tourism; Customer Service; Hospitality, Administration; Digital Technology, and Accounting/Finance.\r\nThe above sectors have been selected for this project based on the skills gaps the industries are facing today and the need to address these disparities in line with the growth of the sectors. \r\nWe want to focus on creating professional opportunities for our learners (many of whom are from disadvantaged backgrounds) and give them an experience to travel outside of their local community \u2013 from which many of them rarely leave. Newham itself is a highly deprived area, with 30% of its wards ranked in the top 10% of the most deprived in the UK.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the INSPO project include: \r\n\r\n- Providing our learners with meaningful work experience which will be directly applicable to their current vocational courses and eventually their future careers\r\n- Deepening learners\u2019 knowledge of their sector, from a European as well as a UK perspective\r\n- Exposing learners to the Spanish/Portuguese languages \r\n- Deepening their understanding and respect of other cultures \r\n- Giving them greater confidence in their skills and abilities, especially when faced with challenging situations \r\n- Improving their overall employability and increasing their potential of finding more work within the sector in the future\r\n- Helping them to have a clearer direction regarding their future career; helping learners decide what aspects of the industry they most/least enjoy so that they can take action accordingly in the future\r\n- Improving participants\u2019 soft skills e.g. time management, teamwork, communication skills, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS \r\n\r\nMany of the participants in this project will come from low socio-economic backgrounds and will face a variety of issues outside of the college environment including poor housing, fractured/chaotic family structures, responsibilities as care-givers for other family members, high exposure to drugs/alcohol and lack of good role models, amongst others. As a result of these issues, our learners often have low aspirations, poor social and employability skills, lack of cultural awareness/experience and lack of any foreign language skills. \r\nWe want to give them opportunities not only to prevent them from becoming part of the out-of-work population but to actively thrive in a career that they love. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe principal activity taking place in the INSPO project is a two-week period of work experience in a company which is directly related to their vocational course. Other activities will include:\r\n\r\n- Cultural Activities: including historical tours of host cities, intercambio evenings, etc.\r\n- Mentoring and monitoring: to ensure that each participant is on track professionally and that they are coping well socially and emotionally.\r\n- Dissemination: of project results and outcomes to potential participants, local colleges/training centres/industry networks/policy makers.\r\n- Project Evaluation: based on participant/partner/staff feedback and used as a tool for continual improvement throughout the project life cycle\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe INSPO project will create a learning experience for 240 participants which involves developing key skills related to their sector \u2013 and transferable, \u2018soft\u2019 skills that can be applied to their working life in general \u2013 alongside industry professionals based in Spain and Portugal.

This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants.

The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved.

ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment.

Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.

It is made up of 20 courses belonging to 13 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their CFGM; \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s  global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of CFGM graduates and increase the number of students going on to study higher level courses (CFGS).\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n\r\n- Mobility of 62 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. \r\n- Mobility of 34 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 12 VT institutions acting as members, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VT institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the language platform and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual FP educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants, video report of mobilities by Audiovisual students; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.

ROC van Amsterdam has about 39.000 students and about 2100 staff of about 150 different nationalities. Over 50% of the students have a non Dutch background. ROC van Amsterdam aims to be a 'Podium for Talent' and in its mission statement it is declared that it wants to be the bridge between the potential workforce (all our students) and the demands of the labourmarket. It also aims for improving the quality of the education and to become one of the top five educational institutes within MBO/VET by seeking strengthening the professionalism and working towards excellence in all levels and areas.\r\n\r\nROC van Amsterdam would like to provide an added value to its vocational educational programmes by enhancing international mobilities for its learners and staff. It is necessary to achieve a better uderstanding of the educational systems within Europe and by cooperation with institutions and enterprises within Europe share best practices that help to develop personal, generic and professional competences of teaching staff and learners; thus improve the quality of education, the learning - teaching process, internships and thus enhance employability for our learners and staff. International activities are part of the Team Plans, so form and integral part of the complex educational programme.\r\n\r\nErasmus+ KA1 is about mobilities so most of the activities planned are student and staff mobilities. Individual mobilities, internships, study programmes, language courses, job shadowing, study exchanges will have been offered and organised by ROCvA for all its students and teachers on a decentralised level by the internship coordinators and Programme Teams of the ROCvA MBO Colleges. Next to that general flow of mobilities ROCvA has a renewed interest in internationalisation, already has about 400 students at the moment following international bilingual programmes. Individual mobility, internships for them are important to integrate their knowledge into an international, European experience by living and working in a foreign country. The staff working within the bilingual courses need to be multilingual and must have higher than average language skills to be able to teach in a foreign language. They also need to know the education system and culture of the relevant other country, so trainings, job shadowings, study exchange, teaching/training  experiences etc. are essential for them to be able to improve and develop themselves in their  jobs. Activities are planned for staff already working with international programmes but also for the planned new bilingual courses for the creative programmes already mentioned, Art and Design, Dans, Hospitality,  International Jean School and  Make-up Art. Activities are planned  in the field of sustainable, renewable energy for technical learners and staff and sustainable tourism and hospitality etc. programmes for teams offering these educational programmes, and are willing to have it integrated into their every day work to improve the quality of work and learning.\r\n\r\nNext to that study career coaches (SLB) of the Programme Teams need to get a better understanding of the international possibilities and need to develop a more international character to be competent to bring that element into their work and be able to prepare learners for a greater variety of international, European pathways in further education. EU citizenship should be promoted by them as well through internships, trainings, foreign experiences, exchanges, virtual international classrooms etc.\r\n\r\nMultilingualism should improve within ROCvA and even Management Teams will take up language trainings to enhance their skills and competences and motivate their staff by giving a good example!\r\n\r\nThe project will stimulate and add value to the cooperation within the EU vocational qualifications, VET providers and between small and medium size enterprises.  It will support the implementation of best practices for the educational programmes and internships by exchange of experiences;  special emphasis regarding quality assurance.\r\n\r\nThe most important impact is to improve mobilities on a European level, and on national and institutional level as well. Through successful mobilities new sets of skills and competences will be obtained by all the participants, learners and staff, and a new way of thinking  will have an added value to the personal and professional development of all the participants.
