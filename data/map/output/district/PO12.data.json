Specifically, the solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of the plant will be improved by increased receiver operating temperatures as well as an innovative power cycle configuration also providing advantages regarding plant operation. Additionally, improved control methodologies based on dynamic multi-aiming-point strategies for heliostats will further enhance efficiency. Besides the improvement of the plants efficiency and operation, also the construction and operational costs will be minimized via mass production of heliostats and smart heliostat calibration systems.\nThe global objective of this project is to increase plant efficiencies and reduce levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by developing all relevant components that allow implementing an innovative plant configuration. This plant configuration is based on a multi-tower decoupled advanced solar combined cycle approach that not only increases cycle efficiencies but also avoids frequent transients and inefficient partial loads, thus maximizing overall efficiency, reliability as well as dispatchability, all of which are important factors directly related to cost competitiveness on the power market. The core topic of the project, the innovative solar receiver, will be an open volumetric receiver allowing operating temperatures beyond 1200 \u00baC, providing the absorbed solar heat to the pressurized air circuit of the Brayton cycle via a network of fixed bed regenerative heat exchangers working in alternating modes (non-pressurized heating period, pressurized cooling period).", 594373.0, 5374899.0, 6, 16, "CAPTure", null, null, null, "h2020_193759_942303106"]]}}, "2NJ": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Living with the sea  - Living with the sea : Managing Natura 2000 sites on dynamic coastlines", "English Nature", 1814120.0, 907061.0, "There\u2019s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland.

It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019.

The First World War in a European theatre of peace\"", "Bay House School", 53639.0, 3, 3, "Looking at the news every day we realize that peace in the world is a rare value and that after a period of peace since 1945 Europe now has to face the consequences of international conflicts and wars directly with the refugees streaming into our continent. This flow of refugees provokes one of the most serious conflicts between European countries since the beginning of European cooperation. This fact leads us to times when European countries were fighting against each other in two world wars. For the centenary of WWI, one of the major events in European history,  we've chosen this conflict, the \u201eUrkatastrophe\u201c of the 20th century, to show why this conflict directed Europe to a deep crisis ending in World War II. As European citizens students nowadays have to learn from this aspect of history to value European cooperation as an integral part of peace and prosperity. They also have to realize that they have to assume responsibility for other parts of the world in order to spread out peace and prosperity to others. With three schools from countries of former enemies in World War I from Germany, France and UK we want to get a multinational perspective on the historical as well as on the actual topic especially from young persons' point of view. As we already realized a successful project between Werdenfels-Gymnasium in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Lyc\u00e9e Ozanam Lille about \u201eyoung citizens in WWI\u201c it was obvious to choose these schools as partners. With Bayhouse School from Gosport an ideal partner was found already showing expertise in this subject at the \u201eEurovision 1914\u201c in Oberhausen, a historical conference where all partners took part. The main objective of this new project is to develop a theatre piece about the First World War and about the consequences we have to draw from this today. Students are involved from the beginning by creating a new theatre piece that doesn't exist yet to a performance including all aspects of theatre work like acting, stage design, choreography etc.  To get a high quality of youth work the pupils are supported by professional artists from the Residenztheater in Munich, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nord Lille and the Hampshire Cultural Trust. Benefitting from this cooperation they understand the need for high level competencies in modern society and work and for cross-sectoral learning. With the raising awareness about the historical facts about WWI they develop the peace-keeping dimension of cooperation in the EU and the importance of everybody's engagement for an active European citizenship especially if we consider a lack of solidarity between European nations nowadays.12 students from each school will be member of the artistical project but there are also others involved, for example to establish the website or document the progress of work in a film. School community will see the final product, the performance of the theatre piece, during a pan-European tour.To get this project running students will do historical research at the beginning, visiting the battlefields in Flandres and Picardie as well as historical sites, museums and archives. They will interview volunteers about their connection to WWI and get a personnel impression they can use to develop theatre scenes. They keep the question in mind, why this war did not end all wars as it was thought by contemporaries and why even today numbers of war increase all over the world. With all these considerations they will create their own multilingual theatre piece in multinational groups and in a second part produce the performance being responsible for all the performance works supported by professional artists leading multinational theatre workshops. The final product will be shown to school communities as well as to publicity in Munich, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Lille, Gosport and Winchester. The progress of the work will be documented at the website and a film about the \u201emaking of\u201c and the final performance. After the project an academic paper will be launched abouth the pedagogical implications and methods of the project. The benefits for all partners will be to get in contact to students from other countries in an artistic and creative way. Pupils will increase their self-confidence, learn more abouth professional work and get more open-minded to active European citizenship. The schools get a link to other European partners and can enlarge their international profile.
