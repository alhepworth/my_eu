Innovative nano/micro particle based coatings, suitable for 3D printing, will be also developed to achieve anti-corrosion resistance, high mechanical strength, improved solar reflectance, improved ageing resistance and anti-vandalism properties. \n\nTo create the panels, an innovative manufacturing process will be created that includes Reconfigurable Moulding (RM) techniques, 3D laser scanning and 3D printed technology. In addition, 3D printed microstructured formworks will be developed as permanent external layer for the polyurethane panel to match the existing building aesthetics and provide solar radiation efficiency. The overall manufacturing process will (i) allow for mass production of panels, which take into account complex architectural and aesthetic issues, (ii) allow for faster production while lowering prefabrication costs and (iii) develop new controlled and cost effective solutions.\n\nIMPRESS will also develop a new Iterative Design Methodology, which will incorporate all stages of the Design-Construct-Install-Operate process. This will be integrated with a BIM cloud based database focussing on the interoperability between software tools required for the prefabricated process. Furthermore, new penalty based business models will be investigated. The final result will be demonstrated on two existing buildings where final as-built product performance will be validated against the initial design.", 4749.0, 5044927.0, 7, 18, "IMPRESS", null, null, null, "h2020_196758_943911754"]]}}, "8JB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Cultural Experiences Through Service To Others", "Morley Community Church Trust", 96437.0, 7, 16, "The project \u201cCultural Experiences Through Service To Others\u201d has been developed by Time For God drawing on our 50 years of experience in international volunteering.

Based on the items of this framework, the project includes actions on:- Enhancing creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, which are crucial aspects integrated into our project. Thus our planned short-term exchange of groups of students are designed to link this broad objective to the specific aims of our project (awareness of a balanced diet, inactivity, obesity, junk food etc.)- Promoting justice, equality, social cohesion and active citizenship. With this project we would broaden the work our schools are developing in their areas: for example,  the percentage of students with additional educational or emotional needs in Queenswood School (28% in 2015/16), the unemployment rate in the area of OSCUS Badajoz (around 30%), the percentage of students who have health problems in Leo Karsavino school (86%) or the increasing flux of immigration on the coast of Salento- Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality; Hence tools like Portfolio of European Languages and e-Twinning permeates  our proposal both as a methodology and as an assessment for our learning outcomes. Our Polish partner, who has experience of e-Twinning projects awarded with the European Quality label, is the guide for the rest of the team who need to implement this useful tool in their school. In turn, our Spanish partner will be in charge of disseminating experiences with the European Portfolio of Languages to promote language learning in the scope of school activities.- Improving the quality of education. All our activities, including those in the short-term exchange of students, are designed to be based on the acquisition of key competences for all age ranges (4 to 14 years) and abilities. In this sense, it is important to mention the commitment to improve the quality of education and the European dimension which our schools have demonstrated over previous years: OSCUS Badajoz was awarded a Quality Assurance system, ISO, where \u2018Europe\u2019 and \u2018Lifelong-learning\u2019 is fundamental, Levo Karsavino is in the group of schools Lithuanian Ministry of Education selected to have units adopting a healthy lifestyle, Queenswood school was awarded the full status of the ISA (2013-16), Comprensivo 1 Polo Leverano is recognized by Trinity College for its language teaching system; Polish partner is an e-Twinning ambassadorThe key issue for the schools in this partnership is understanding how to harness what a healthy, active lifestyle can do for individuals while turning activities into a successful learning strategy that works for  young people. Our schools believe that teaching topics in real-life contexts can improve pupil engagement and learning. Methodologies include:- Identifying specific, measurable goals- Establishing a realistic time frame- Preparing for potential obstacles- Compiling a support group list- Clear planning- Regular evaluation- Formal/informal assessments-Teaching, modeling, and reinforcing desired pro-social skillsOur project will provide participating institutions with a means of overcoming the barriers associated with preventing a child from succeeding such as low attendance, poor behaviour and low self-esteem. Children in our partnership range from 4 to14 years of age and come from varied social and economic backgrounds. Results of this project will address the concerns of all partner schools over diet, obesity and the physical and emotional health of our students as well as continue to develop educational standards of our schools incorporating pro-active teaching methods.Results also include the opportunity to create a European area of learning and encourage the idea of cross-cultural mobility. In the longterm, activities will be integrated into the school curriculum to ensure all students/learners benefit. Developing language skills in English as well as in digital competence will allow students and staff to explore things from a range of different viewpoints. Sport and PE can build personal attributes that are important for the holistic development of students. These include confidence, ambition, self-esteem, aspiration, having respect for rules, being able to cope with winning and losing, forming positive relationships, determination, courage etc. If these qualities are present, young people are more likely to feel secure in taking risks in their learning, attempting more challenging work and therefore improving their ability. Our partnership incorporates many innovative ways to ensure that these personal values are developed, recognised, nurtured, and celebrated throughout the life of the school.  Adopting a healthier lifestyle through physical activity also helps develop relevant skills in other areas of the curriculum; these include observational skills, analytical skills, leadership, teamwork, communication, and motor skills.", "http://www.queenswoodschool.co.uk", "Queenswood School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024320_coordinator"]]}}}}
