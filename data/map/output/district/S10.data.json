The nature-culture divide has narrowed the scope of landscapes to the technical management of either natural or cultural sites. Within heritage policy, this binary is reproduced in the separation of \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201ccultural\u201d landscapes in national and international legal and administrative frameworks resulting in the problematic separation of natural and cultural resources in the practice of planning and development. More recent developments aim to broaden discussions of sustainability to encompass human and non-human actors and environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs archaeological heritage comprises a distinct part of culture heritage and the nature is an intrinsic element of the past shared culture heritage conforming the local identity, the project intends to focus on the integration of both types of heritage. Accordingly, the preservation, management, and conservation of such integrated heritage is an indispensable element of international and national policies as well as every conservation activity. As these two types of heritage operate in two largely impenetrable organizational frameworks, common concerns of both cultural and natural heritage have hardly been systematically defined, not to mention transferred into coherent training materials directed to both sectors. Hence, the project objectives involve production of a range of innovative didactic materials aimed at integrating archaeological and natural heritage. Understanding the environmental impact of archaeological heritage and significance of natural heritage for regulations and practices in the domain of archaeological heritage is to be mainstreamed into education and vocational training systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA need of developing and upgrading vocational skills in the sector of protection and management of archaeological and natural heritage is a must taking into account dynamic changes over the past couple of years in both fields in Europe. Doubtless to say, these are not sufficiently known among people professionally responsible for the protection and management of both archaeological and natural heritage across Europe. As both heritage domains need to be systematically integrated, the project intends to identify their nature along with its constituent elements. This will then be used for the production of training materials and methodology of content preparation and delivery to meet the needs of rapidly changing modes of protection and management of archaeological and natural heritage sectors in the Partners\u2019 countries as well as a significance of this integrated heritage in spatial planning and regional development policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is directly inter-sectoral in scope by providing didactic materials and training for archaeological and natural heritage professionals aimed at increasing synergy between these sectors. It will also  foster the assessment of transversal skills and promote the take-up of practical entrepreneurial experiences in education and training. In order make the changing character of archaeological and natural heritage understood, the project intends to elaborate and prepare a range of didactic material aimed at address the most pertaining issues in the process of integration of natural and archaeological resources in the practice of their protection and management as well in the spatial planning and regional development. Finally, in order to make the delivery of this new content sustainable, the project intends to establish Centers of Integrated Heritage Teaching Excellence. They will provide an organizational structure to educational activities in the domain of integrated heritage.  They shall be able to effectively use different methods of distance learning in the domain of the integrated heritage dedicated to different job markets. The Centers will run trainings of a group of ca. 100 people representing all target groups. The final outcome of the project comprises the production of innovative methodology of vocational training in the domain of integrated archaeological-natural heritage. The project shall also explicitly attempt to integrate an offer of the CIHTE with the VET systems in participating countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CIHTEs will be intrinsically integrated with the activities carried out by participating institutions.

It will embed international experience and transnational mobility throughout.\r\n\r\nContext / Project Background\r\nIt is difficult for archaeologists to move around Europe to work, as there are not consistent ways to record and demonstrate skills\r\nProfessional archaeology as a sector was heavily affected across Europe by the global economic changes from 2008 onwards, owing to its relationship with the construction industry\r\nThe sector now anticipates growth in many European countries, with concern about potential shortages of skilled workers\r\nThe project proposes a novel and innovative way for practitioners and aspirant practitioners to access VET that they and employers value, in order to enhance their potential to play active roles in the labour market \r\nThe project partners are from Spain, UK, Italy, Austria (German Language), Netherlands and Poland. According to labour market intelligence these countries/language groups have some of the largest European archaeological workforces and so could support increased transnationality \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe project will create freely accessible training materials to teach archaeologists technical skills to a common standard, delivered as digital materials, specifically short videos, in a modular format so each skill would be addressed in a self-contained learning experience that could either be separated out and learned individually or combined into a longer, structured learning VET experience\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nThe materials will be created by researchers, technicians and managers from six partner countries (UK, Spain, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, Poland) who are sectoral experts in both archaeological practice and in VET. Approximately 60 people will contribute to the creation of materials for the project, and several hundred more practitioners will be involved in testing the materials\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nPartners will collectively identify priority area for skills development (taking into account data gathered in previous labour market intelligence projects undertaken for the sector by some of the partners and funded in part by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme) matching these against the requirements of a shared validation tool, the Archaeological Skills Passport \r\nFrom these priority areas the partners will create sixteen focussed training videos with voice overs available in six partner languages, thus creating a total of 96 separate VET training tools (16 videos in 6 languages) allowing their use across multiple countries. These videos will then be freely available as stand-alone training materials, and will also be able to form part of more substantial, structured learning activities\r\nThe materials will be available in a portable digital format allowing access in the workplace on a mobile device such as a smartphone or laptop. The modular nature of this resource means it will be quick and easy to access training for a single skill while working on an archaeological site\r\nThe videos will then be integrated into the Heritage Education Portal, an e-learning platform developed by some of the partners under a predecessor Erasmus+ project (ANHER), and through that and by use of YouTube they will be made available and accessible\r\n\r\nResults and Impact Envisaged\r\nAudiences for this training are early career practitioners and those looking to refresh their specific, technical skills that are common to archaeological practice in most countries, encouraging up-skilling of workforces across Europe. Some materials will be country-specific, so beneficiaries will learn quickly and efficiently the required skills and techniques to begin working in a different country, encouraging a transnational workforce that can meet skill shortages across Europe\r\nThe materials can also be included in formal training and CPD programmes. Because they will be licensed under an open Creative Commons license, universities could integrate them into their teaching. Employers and professional associations could use the training materials as validated CPD for their professional grades \r\n\r\nPotential Long Term Benefits\r\nThis project proposes the development and delivery of materials that could help train up a workforce quicker than a 3-4 year degree in archaeology, in order to meet anticipated increased demand\r\nBeneficiaries will be able to use the Archaeological Skills Passport to have their skills validated and thus demonstrated to employers", "http://www.landward.eu", "Archaeology Scotland", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047943_4"]]}}, "2JF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RHQ", "Royal Hallamshire Hospital", "nhs_RHQHH"], ["RHQ", "Sheffield Teaching Hospitals", "nhs_RHQPH"]]}}, "2LJ": {"creative": {"data": [[1404172800000, 1435622400000, "CHILDREN'S FILM FIRST", "THE CHILDREN'S MEDIA CONFERENCE LIMITED", 44339.0, 5, 7, "The European Children\u2019s Film Association is Europe\u2019s only membership organisation for professionals working in children\u2019s film.

This proposal aims to develop a transdisciplinary research programme for mapping, analysing and intervening in border areas in the form of a digital atlas. \n\nTopological Atlas is developed as a methodology for producing visual counter-geographies at border sites. It is ground breaking in its use of digital technologies combined with a participative approach that attends to those who are at the margins of traditional geopolitical inquiry. The project uses topology as conceptual framework and methodology to make maps that produce \u2018seamless transitions\u2019 from the space of the migrant to that of the security apparatus that creates barriers to her movement. In doing so it seeks to disrupt the cartographic norms that are being reinforced through the prevalence of GIS technology and mapping platforms such as Google Earth. It investigates forms of visual and co-produced research adapted to situations of crisis and proposes a new model for researching border areas beyond the current top-down international relations or security perspective. At the same time it acknowledges the intertwined relationship between the practice of academic inquiry, the knowledge it produces and what such knowledge can do. \n\nThe project is organised around the following research question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?", 1304871.0, 1304871.0, 1, 1, "TopATLAS", null, "http://www.shef.ac.uk", null, "h2020_213397_999976881"], [1467331200000, 1625011200000, "Multi-modal Context Modelling for Machine Translation", "The University of Sheffield", "Automatically translating human language has been a long sought-after goal in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Machine Translation (MT) can significantly lower communication barriers, with enormous potential for positive social and economic impact. The dominant paradigm is Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which learns to translate from human-translated examples.\n\nHuman translators have access to a number of contextual cues beyond the actual segment to translate when performing translation, for example images associated with the text and related documents. SMT systems, however, completely disregard any form of non-textual context and make little or no reference to wider surrounding textual content. This results in translations that miss relevant information or convey incorrect meaning. Such issues drastically affect reading comprehension and may make translations useless. This is especially critical for user-generated content such as social media posts -- which are often short and contain non-standard language -- but applies to a wide range of text types. \n\nThe novel and ambitious idea in this proposal is to devise methods and algorithms to exploit global multi-modal information for context modelling in SMT.

Women are unique among animals due to menopause and a prolonged lifespan after last birth. Evolutionarily, the quest of everyone is to maximise grandchildren numbers. Hence, human women life-history is enigmatic. One possibility is that older women increase their fitness by directing resources to already produced offspring rather than having more. Thus, although women gain most grandchildren from own reproduction, they also gain more by helping offspring. This has fascinating implications. All animals must split their energy between reproduction vs. self-maintenance. Most continue to reproduce until death and produce maximum grandchildren by optimising investment between current vs. future reproduction. Human women must also optimise investment between mothering and grandmothering.

The opportunity of multi-scale modelling spanning, sub-cellular level up to whole heart is to improve CVD outcomes by providing a consistent, biophysically-based framework for the integration of the huge amount of fragmented and inhomogeneous data currently available. However, multi-scale models have not yet been translated into clinical environments mainly due to the difficulty of personalising biophysical models. The challenge of the euHeart project is to directly address this need by combining novel ICT technologies with integrative multi-scale computational models of the heart in clinical environments to improve diagnosis, treatment planning and interventions for CVD.<br/>To meet this challenge we will bring together leading European physiological modelling and cardiac groups to develop, integrate and clinically validate patient-specific computational models of the cardiac physiology and disease-related processes. The main outcome of euHeart will be an open source framework for the description and representation of normal and pathological multi-scale and multi-physics cardiovascular models, using the international encoding standards.

Cost estimates by EU governments indicate that billions of euros will be spent over several decades to implement WFD. There is an increasing level of concern on the implementation cost (financial and carbon). Integrated water quality models designed to predict the quality of water across the linked urban and rural scales in a catchment is seen as a tool to optimise this cost. Integrated Catchment Modelling (ICM) is based on linking numerous empirically calibrated sub-models of water quality processes.  Catchment scale WQ predictions are then used to justify investment. Current water quality sub-models contain significant uncertainty.  Methods have been developed to quantify uncertainty at a level however little work has been carried out to investigate WQ uncertainty propagation between sub-models. QUICS will develop a generalised catchment wide approach to uncertainty assessment that can then be used in WFD implementation studies. It will address uncertainty propagation at the spatial and temporal scales found in catchments and develop tools to reduce uncertainty by optimising sampling and monitoring and the objective selection of model structure.

However, there is a need to ensure access to training for vulnerable groups and to ensure that training is transferred to the work setting and thus effective in improving safety behaviours. \r\n\r\nObjectives. As a result of this scenario, this project aims to: a) review and identify the barriers and facilitators that may be effective in VET training particular groups of vulnerable workers, i.e. low-skilled & migrant workers in construction; b) develop and test a Safety Training Programme (STP; O3), an innovative training model (including an Interactive Platform, O2) for the development and delivery of safety training among these groups of workers; c) develop and test a Safety Training Evaluation Device (STED; O4) that captures training transfer, i.e. that safety skills learned are transferred into daily work activities and thus results in improved safety climate and behaviours.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants. During the project, we expect to train at least 140 people, namely employees (120 construction workers, focusing on migrants and those with low skills), and safety trainers and supervisors with safety responsibilities (20 people to become trainers themselves). Furthermore, 120 people will participate in the focus groups (10 people in 9 focus groups; 3 per country) and interviews (10 people per country). Moreover, the total number of people expected to attend the Multiplier events is 300 (50 per Event). The total number of visits expected to the Interactive Platform is 1,500. We also expect 20 requests for registration and 600 downloads of documents in the Tools and Methodology area of the Interactive Platform, as well as at least 15 practices uploaded from the platform.\r\n\r\nDescription of the activities. The ESTEEM project consists of three main phases: 1) preparing the background for the development of STP and STED, via the compilation of the Safety Knowledge Base (O1); 2) developing and implementing STP (O3) and developing and testing STED (O4); and 3) following learning from these tests, developing a Certificate System (O5) that allows for the cross-national recognition of STP, Guidelines (O6) for effective training and training transfer, and the publication of training tools and materials.  All will be made freely available on the Interactive Platform (O2) and partners' websites. \r\n\r\nMethodology used to carry out the project. The ESTEEM project will be developed applying the design cycle methodology, which is composed of 6 steps: i) \u201cDefinition\u201d of the goals and the functions of the project by studying the target groups\u2019 views and needs; ii) \u201cAnalysis\u201d with the aim to develop the Knowledge Base; iii) \"Synthesis\u201d, which represents the definition of the Knowledge Base that will represent a milestone, necessary to effectively develop the STP and STED; iv) \u201cSimulation\u201d, in which STP and STED will be concurrently implemented and tested; v) \u201cEvaluation\u201d, of STP and STED will be conducted by the stakeholders; vi) \u201cDecision making\u201d,  to finally disseminate the STP, STED, Guidelines, and the Safety Training Certificate System.\r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged. The project is designed to develop deliverable outputs that could be used by a wide range of organisations across Europe. Specifically, those outputs concern the definition of Safety Training Guidelines, which could be especially useful for Health and Safety Practitioners to plan safety training in their organisations and improve organisational policies concerning safety training. Furthermore, an effective and tested Safety Training Package (STP), also including ICT instruments  and a Safety Training Evaluation Device (STED), will be developed and disseminated for free, aiming to enhance safety skills and consequently enhance low-skilled migrant workers' safety behaviours. All material will be made freely available on the project's website and through social media we will raise awareness of the project and its outcomes. Moreover, a Safety Training Certificate System, helpful in acknowledging the safety skills acquired across European boarders, will be implemented.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits. The long-term benefits of this project are relevant. First of all we expect a medium-term decrease in the number of injuries and accidents which in turn means healthier workers and lower costs for EU countries. Furthermore, we expect that if the Safety Training Certificate System will be implemented, this could facilitate the mobility of workers in companies all across Europe. The activities will also have an impact in terms of increasing Lifelong Learning in Safety trainers and trainees\u2019 competences.

The main network activities will focus on creating spaces for young women to consider physics as a field of academic training and drawing upon the diversity of physics for the career planning of female physics students. These pragmatic interventions will enable the network to establish collaborations in and beyond physics, including scholars from gender studies. The evaluation of the project\u2019s activities and wide circulation of its outcomes will advance gender and diversity awareness in physics. The transnational approach allows for a broadened comprehension of professional cultures of physics and how to make necessary changes.The  work programme covers two main lines of action, both combining the creation of tangible results with teaching and learning activities:(1) Coordinated transnational outreach events addressed to young women will be organized annually. These activities will be prepared through exchange visits and workshops, and based on a comparative approach of best practices in different national educational settings. During the project phase we will seek further collaborators from universities and schools from outside the partnership. Documentation consisting of teaching materials and presentations from the outreach events will be made available to students and teaching staff in secondary and higher education via the project website.(2) Design, organization and evaluation of a European summer school series for aspiring PhD students, which will be held each year in tandem with changing partners. Key actors are the working groups in the physics departments of the participating universities together with regional research institutes, science policy and gender equality institutions. Essential to the summer school series is experiential reflection within the participating student peer group and the interdisciplinary collaboration of teachers. A sustainable network will be established through the ensuing mentoring and monitoring contacts. Besides the curriculum development, a collection of lesson plans for \u201cGender Knowledge in Physics\u201d will be an important transferable outcome of this line of action. As the documentation on each summer school events and the final evaluation, they will be published online.Outputs of the strategic partnership will be made available on the open access platforms of the partner universities for long-term use. In addition, the partnership will encourage active discussion through a range of conference contributions and through its own multiplier events in order to make gender knowledge and diversity awareness an issue in the fields of physics. Summarized results from the project will be published in professional journals.The proposed project builds on the extensive expertise of the partners regarding gender-equality activities in physics. The strategic partnership aims to extend existing networks beyond the national limits and make the disciplinary and cultural diversity of doing physics internationally visible. Diversity functions both as an objective and resource for developing and implementing equality-oriented initiatives in physics teaching and training. Thereby, we draw on the findings of gender studies in science, with a particular focus on physics, EU-wide as well as nationally. These studies have documented the professional cultures of physics in different locations and disciplinary specializations regarding their gender effects. Heightened awareness of the differences in the work areas of physicists, consciousness about the heterogeneous political and everyday contexts of scientific research, and knowledge about equality measures at European universities can provide pathways for women and other under-represented groups in physics to pursue their career and life plans. Identifying and opening up these opportunities is the central goal of this project.Establishing an appropriate network is a fundamental requirement to exploit this potential. The project\u2019s target groups and stakeholders comprise university students, researchers and teachers, representatives from science administration, educational policy and gender equality bodies as well as high-school teachers and their students. The activities of the strategic partnership will bring together actors at various levels (local, regional, national, EU-wide) and strengthen their collaboration. Over the course of the funding period, the partnership envisions gradually expanding its network involving more partners within the EU, esp. in Eastern Europe.

One of these challenges relates to identifying suitable programmes for the teaching of language and literacy.Children may have a number of reasons for facing difficulties in this area, e.g. learning disabilities, a right to an individual special educational needs programme, social disadvantage, or a multilingual background. This challenge has increased over the past year, due to the increase in refugee numbers in Europe this past year, leading to rising numbers of pupils who struggle to follow lessons due to language issues. Many teachers have pointed out the lack of suitable professional development opportunities inthis area, and in the area of differentiated facilitation of literacy. They are faced with growing challenges, often without the required knowledge or skills. The project therefore aims to develop practically-oriented knowledge in the area of language and literacy development, and to make these available via an online-learning platform and two MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), to all those interested (teaching staff, volunteers, students). A starting point is a discussion with teaching staff in participating countries, through which questions will be developed which aim to address good practice in the area of language and literacy facilitation among a heterogenous student body. These questions will be addressed at three synthesised levels: 1) through relating to relevantexpert knowledge, 2) through examples of good practice, and 3) through the development of relevant exemplary materials. This synthesis will occur via a number of media, including text, video-sequences and video talks. Furthermore, materials will be developed from an international viewpoint, incorporating examples from many different national contexts.The project participants span universities, as well as a college and a school, from five different countries (Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, England and Spain). Each participating institution has expertise in at least two of the three relevant topic areas (multilingualism, inclusion, social disadvantage), resulting in a close network of competences. The following activities are at the core of the project: Questioning teachers about their questions/needs in the area of language and literacy facilitation and creation of case studies about teaching for further development through video sequences, video talks and texts, which will be made available on the online learning platform; Bring key findings together in two MOOCs (MOOC 1: Language Facilitation, MOOC 2: Literacy Facilitation); Creation of teaching handbooks for the continuation of MOOCs following the end of the project's life cycle.Due to the primary dissemination focus of project results and activities via the WWW, intellectual outputs will be openly accessible to anybody interested. In addition to this, project structures and results will be developed in such a way that all materials will be accessible and usable beyond the lifecycle of the project, specifically the online learning platform and the MOOCs.

However, SMEs lack the knowledge to implement such practices and achieve EEO  due to lack of proper market oriented curricula offered by higher education institutions (HEI)  that will enable the emergence of graduates suitable to tackle EEO concepts. Still, scientific/academic knowledge by HEI can provide solutions for this matter. Alternatively, the industry provides the realistic setting where scientific knowledge can be applied.  However, to be effective, Industry-Academia collaborations should be based on mutual trust, commitment and knowledge exchange/sharing. One way of achieving this \u2018open communication\u2019 between academics and the industry, is through co-creation which is the cornerstone of open innovation practices in today\u2019s industry. For example, through co-creation, academia can gain useful input from industry, that will eventually lead to more market oriented curriculum and better prepared graduates capable to implement EEO.  Hence, open innovation and co-creation between academia and industry/SMEs will highly increase HEI's capacity of producing graduates capable of being next generation leaders in EEO. \r\n\r\nTo this end, the proposed project (Training for Energy Efficient Operations or TrainERGY) responds to this need by aiming to develop an innovative, evidence-based transnational training framework that will markedly improve the knowledge and skills of HEIs to produce more marked oriented EEO curricula, reducing the barriers in this field.

It will also bring together a range of other OER resources in a search-able catalogue which will help incubator staff and entrepreneurs  find useful materials.\r\n- Guide for Incubator Managers\r\nThis guide will help incubator managers offer the training to their Start-ups in a sustainable way. It will be a valuable resource with all the information needed to duplicate the I-BIS model.\r\n - Guide To Doing Business Online\r\nWith the Internet being one of the most important ways of doing business for SMEs today, especially with customers in other European countries the partnership will provide participants with information on how to best sell their products and services through this medium. Partners will provide specific information on how online business is conducted in their country. \r\n - European Networking Area\r\nIn order to encourage communication and cooperation between Start-ups in the partner countries and across Europe I-BIS will set up a networking area. It will be open to current participants and past EBGC members as well as the wider enterprise community in Europe in order to enable the sharing of best practices between Start-ups and already established businesses. It is envisaged that this will also be a networking platform for incubators across Europe who are passionate about the development of new business programmes.\r\n\r\nAll I-BIS materials and resources will be freely available online and maintained after the project so incubators can continue to access the I-BIS tools and use them to help more businesses to set-up and develop.", "http://www.shef.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013489_coordinator"], [2015, "3D PRInting Skills for Manufacturing", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD", 238846.0, 5, 5, "BACKGROUND & CHALLENGES\r\n3D printing is a cornerstone of the industrial shift towards advanced manufacturing, creating opportunities for employment, value creation, and reallocation of manufacturing production back to Europe. As is the case with any disruptive technology, new needs for skills and qualifications are emerging; 3D printing requires skilled blue-collar employees in manufacturing (i.e. technicians & operators) to acquire new competences. Still, the development of skills required to enter the 3D printing job market is not currently supported by VET programs and apprenticeships that can lead to certification, and applied 3D printing skills remain unavailable to most VET job profiles.\r\n\r\nAIM\r\nThe project aims to tackle this challenge by supporting VET provision to equip technicians & operators with 3D printing skills. The needs of VET providers, learners, employees, and the sector will be addressed by: a) matching skill supply with demand, b) increasing employees' employability, performance and job security, and c) strengthening the EU manufacturing sector by valorising investments on 3D printing through a skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n1) Support VET provision on 3D printing skills with guides, resources, OERs, and a hands-on training methodology.\r\n2) Identify new occupational profiles in the manufacturing sector, to facilitate and accelerate the integration of new skills and qualifications in VET.\r\n3) Contribute to the implementation of EU policies on qualifications, transparency, mobility, and a European Industrial Renaissance, creating secure and sustainable jobs.\r\n\r\nTHE 3D PRISM PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe partnership comprises 5 organisations from 5 countries from the world of VET, the manufacturing sector, the EU skills & qualifications accreditation field, as well as learning innovation specialists.

Planning cities for hospitality and social-spatial integration requires innovative methods to understand the urban phenomenon and enable transnational knowledge exchange because of the shared nature of the challenge and the beneficial consequences of a transnational response. Indeed, an increase in the capacity to operate at transnational level and share knowledge beyond singular national settings is crucial. In the academic context, this challenge calls Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) involved in teaching Urban Design and Planning into particular account. HEIs are called to assume new awareness, as actors committed in the treatment of urban and social issues, taking on new social responsibilities. Relevant teaching tools and methods need to be refined, novel competences are required, and new narratives and representations need to be developed in order to produce a more in-depth knowledge of urban phenomena, prepare urban practitioners to tackle them and contribute to more incisive urban policies towards more just cities.The University of Sheffield (UK), the KU Leuven (BG), the Politecnico di Milano (IT), Architecture Sans Frontieres International (FR) and Housing Europe (BG) are the proponents of this project. The underlying motivation of this strategic partnership is to produce new pedagogical approaches and tools in urban design and planning, addressing the reception and social inclusion of migrants and refugees, and other marginalised urban dwellers in European cities. New methodologies, contexts and tools capable to offer novel teaching environments to better prepare students as future practitioners, as well as teachers and civil society organisations, to deal with urban challenges towards more just cities.The partnership will cooperate and exchange expertise and experiences in order to:- co-produce innovation in the educational process towards capacity development of current and future urban practitioners, to better understand and face hospitality and social inclusion challenges in European cities.- develop innovative approaches to raise quality in teaching and learning activities within the HEIs- create opportunities for organisations, teachers and learners to innovate and to adapt traditional teaching methods offering a mix of learning possibilities, also through increasing the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) thanks to the MOOC developed within the project.All the project\u2019s partners will contribute in the development of the project tasks and activities, participating together to the achievement of the project\u2019s objectives and results. Project\u2019s partners will be responsible for the development of several activities, in order to produce three Intellectual Outputs:- O1- New learning needs: Challenges and approaches in Urban Design & Planning for inclusion, is addressed to civil society organisations interested in approaching new competences and skills to improve their ways of acting. The aim is to document emerging forms of urban practice for social inclusion, initiated by civil society organisations. The output will be a Handbook that will reflect the learning and experiences developed over the project.- O2- New modes of learning & teaching: Learning inclusion in action is addressed to graduate and postgraduate students, who have the need to improve their specific and transversal competences. The aim is to improve the provided education, by means of live teaching contexts, and refine profiles of future practitioners. Novel pedagogical experiences will be embedded in each HEI partner and will be defined in close collaboration between HEI & non-HEI partners.- O3 - New teaching abilities: Developing pedagogies for inclusion, is addressed to academic staff, who wish to update their skills. It consists in the design and implementation of a MOOC on the applied pedagogical approach. A massive online open course (MOOC) will support European teachers in renewing their approaches, by means of action-learning initiatives developed on the basis of a live engagement with marginal contexts. Concerning impacts and project\u2019s sustainability: the handbook (O1) will be used by civil society partners to articulate and make more explicit emerging approaches to the field of hospitality; the content of the handbook will be included among the training and capacity development resources that HE and ASF-Int make available to their member organisations. The teaching modules (O2) will inform and be made integral to urban design & planning courses within each of the institutions involved, which will ensure their sustainability over time.

Overall, at least 600 students will be enrolled in the course till October 2018.The platform will operate in 5 languages (EN, BG, GR, PL,TR) and will be maintained at least until 2020. The MOOC will be based on a comprehensive methodology and will include 10 modules, which will be jointly elaborated by the partners and will introduce students to the fundamentals of social entrepreneurship: identify opportunity, create a business model, prepare business plan, attract investors, learn how to establish, effectively manage and communicate the activity of a social startup, and how to apply various replication and exit strategies. The project will especially address the gender gaps in entrepreneurship and will promote more gender-balanced career choices through attracting female students from different studies to social entrepreneurship. The course content will include 50 inspiring female start-ups and will promote successful role models through involvement of women entrepreneurs as mentors. The gamified platform:\u2022 Create an attractive and engaging learning environment that will put students in the \u201cshoes\u201d of social entrepreneurs and give them the chance to experience the essence of being a social entrepreneur;\u2022 Involve students in exploring business concepts and fundamentals of social entrepreneurship through real cases and challenges, thus allowing them to embark on an exciting and motivational learning journey; \u2022 Sensitize learners about the important social issues, and help learn how to identify needs and opportunities and turn them to shared value ventures; \u2022 Encourage collaboration and competitive dynamics among students, foster creativity and experimentation, enhance leadership and critical thinking, thus helping them to develop the specific soft skills & entrepreneurial mindset, while dealing with concrete situations in gaming environment. \u2022 The features of the game design (collaboration, sharing, feedback, awards, etc.) will help provide a highly participative and friendly learning environment, so that female students and those from non-business studies obtain generic entrepreneurship skills and more specific business competences, while solving specific social problems in collaboration and competing for achieving better results. The gamified platform and the developed methodology will allow to link learners' accomplishments with ECTS points, to enable better recognition of results for students. In order to build a more supportive and inclusive entrepreneurship ecosystem, the e-learning platform will bring together:\u2022 Leading education and training providers, who will guide students in their learning pathways; \u2022 Experienced entrepreneurs and business mentors, who will share practical tips and help students develop their ideas; \u2022 Stakeholders and prospective investors, to suggest opportunities, feedback and finance for viable social start-up ideas; \u2022 Senior students and graduates from business fields, who can provide peer coaching and improve their leadership skills; \u2022 Cross-disciplinary community of  learners, which will foster collaboration and inspire ideas and development.Thus, the project will undertake a truly social entrepreneurship approach, offering win-win for all parties involved.

The need to improve and increase the exchange of knowledge on healthy ageing and the challenges raised by the increasing number of elderly people is a major task for all EU countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSexuality is an essential element of one\u2019s identity. However, the social environment of most Western cultures has never allowed for the discussion of sexual behaviour. This same secretive environment exists for seniors today. Also, gerontologists and other medical experts generally agree that continued sexual interest and activity can be therapeutic for older men and women. However, we do not give enough attention and respect to sexuality when considering the lives of older adults. There are many false expectations regarding the effects of aging and sexuality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledgeable professionals are a key to this vital personal and social change: in giving permission, providing information, and offering specific suggestions that enable people to overcome barriers to one\u2019s health and happiness.

In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  \nInformation systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by developing technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination.

The training course developed under this project will make available for working women a high quality educational path in an European context created specifically to meet their professional needs.\r\n\r\nThe European consortium gathered to carry out this project is composed by seven VET providers, business associations, SME's and professional women associations from Spain, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Romania and Malta. \r\n\r\n'Women in Power' will work towards the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.- To develop new learning approaches and teaching strategies toward gender leadership education, defining a European learning pathway on leadership specifically developed for women working in the traditional sectors.\r\n\r\n2.- To develop a course for women to promote basic and transversal skills to achieve executive roles within their industries.\r\n\r\n3.- To define a training methodology that improve the learning process and that is specifically tailored for women working in the footwear, furniture and textile industries.\r\n\r\n4.- To promote transnational partnership, to gain experience in international cooperation and   strengthen the capacities of education for women.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project three intellectual outputs will have been developed: \r\n\r\n- IO1: two reports will have been drafted, the first one detailing the professional profile of European women working in traditional sectors, and the second of them giving a solution to the problem by developing a training path to help them break the glass ceiling.\r\n\r\n- IO2: a complete course for women to promote basic and transversal skills in order to achieve executive roles within their industries.\r\n\r\n- IO3: an intuitive and innovative platform that will host the designed training path, increasing social capital, competencies and professional skills of women.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact as a result of this project\u2019s outcome provides, which includes the consolidated training methodology developed by all the partners,  will ultimately provide the development that women need in order to be empowered in furthering their career. The effect of this project is anticipated for women inside or outside the corporate mainstream, including entrepreneurs, academics, civil servants and senior women with professional service backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe development of this project will assist in raising awareness with policy makers, stakeholders and general public of the issue through seminars and project dissemination in general (press conferences, events, online materials and news), as well as give room for potential legislative solutions. It will also increase the number of people discussing the issue of women and leadership in relevant industries, as well as  trainers' awareness of needs of women education towards professional empowerment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the project outcomes (freely available in different languages) can be widely applicable and used well beyond the countries involved in the project, serving also as a basis for further development and adaptation to various contexts.", "http://www.inovaconsult.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA202-038258_6"], [2017, "Social Media = Social Capital.

They have extensive experience working on projects to support disadvantaged groups in Adult Education to build skills linked to increasing Social Capital (building social networks for greater individual potential) and social inclusion of female migrants in partner countries using social media. Partners have been allocated to lead on Outputs relating to their expertise and skills, whilst working collaboratively across all outputs on sub-activities to ensure a truly joined-up partnership approach. Women migrants and refugees fare the worst when it comes to integrating into new host communities and expanding the necessary social networks in order to gain employment or access to support services. There is therefore a need to find innovative ways to support female migrants/refugees to build Social Capital and networks. SMS aims to do this through tapping into the benefits of Social Media and how having access and skills for these tools can open up new networks and possibilities for social integration. \r\n\r\nTarget Group\r\nMigrants/refugee women who identify themselves as feeling socially isolated/not integrated into the new host community/country are the main target group to be actively included in SMS (also via intermediaries/third sector organisations). Women who are low-skilled/qualified will be prioritised for inclusion in SMS. 440 participants will be engaged directly with SMS via focus groups, interviews, attending training programmes and multiplier events. Wider numbers of participants will also benefit from the SMS E learning Hub to build skills and experiences to aid social integration and skill development. \r\n\r\nOur target group will participate in an iterative cycle of learning, practicing training skills back in their personal life/working life (if they are employed), and reflecting throughout the training programme (through participation in Mentoring Circles\u2122\ufe0f). Women from each of the Mentoring Circles\u2122\ufe0f will run Social Media training sessions to embed their digital skills whereby they train other women in Social Media skills for social impact in the community. Learner packs will be produced, in addition to a Training the Trainers guide. To facilitate skill-sharing for sustainability, SMS will develop an online Learning Hub containing e learning resources and a forum where SMEs and charities/NGOs can post requests related to social media issues and receive support from the \u2018Social Media Sisters\u2019 (participants who have been trained via SMS).\r\n\r\nOverall Aims:\r\nTo develop an innovative learning methodology (building on previous UK methodologies) where learners engage in six hard skills modules in Social Media Skills followed by 5 soft skills reflection sets- Mentoring Circles\u2122\ufe0f.\r\nTo train women migrants/refugees in digital media skills to improve their social integration into their host countries and to promote their future employability and entrepreneurship prospects. \r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nA blended methodology combining hard skills (Social Media/digital skills) with soft skills (reflection, personal development) with the added benefits of peer learning. Iterative learning will be employed, as well as experiential techniques - aiming to get the female migrants 'learning by doing' wherever possible to build skills and motivation as well as confidence. \r\n\r\nMain Outputs:\r\n- Action Research Reports on migrant/refugee women illustrating training requirements & gaps in Social Media skills.\r\n- SMS Training Programme (building on methodology from previous projects coordinated by Inova) including Learner and Facilitator Guides and training materials which will be piloted twice with the target group.\r\n- Insider's Guide to Social Media for Female Migrants (a guide aimed at empowering female migrants/refugees in using Social Media to develop their Social Capital, as well as information for intermediaries and organisations working with these groups).\r\n-  Development of an E Learning hub (access to learning materials and an area where trained participants can transfer their training to others by supporting other women in social media skills). \r\n\r\nSMS is expected to impact on social cohesion and integration of female migrants/refugees into the community via their involvement in the project and the subsequent building and expansion of social networks which the women will have access to through being trained in Social Media skills.

Migrant workers are more likely to experience over-qualification \u2013 where their level of education is higher than the job they are doing. With the worsening refugee and migrant crisis across Europe and linked negative media coverage  we need to make sure as an EC community that we are making the most of migrants' skills and education and showing the benefits they bring.Erasmus+ guidelines (2016) have been updated to address issues around social cohesion and the integration of migrants. \u201cEducation and youth work are key to prevent violent radicalisation by promoting common European values, fostering social integration, enhancing intercultural understanding and a sense of belonging to a community.\u201d  Migrapreneurs will contribute to this priority by ensuring Europe is making the most of our highly skilled migrants in order to enhance social inclusion and enhance intercultural understanding.

Target group:The group targeted in the project will be highly skilled migrants (HSM) (educated to university level) would-be entrepreneur migrants around Europe (mainly in countries who have been more affected by the refugee crisis) who might never have thought about starting up businesses or are in the early stages of thinking about starting up. We will aim to help them develop their skills by developing a bespoke training programme to develop Entrepreneurial Mindsets for Migrants which will focus on the development and reflection of soft skills required for business start up. Following this course, those participants who are seriously thinking of starting up a business will move onto a start-up/growth business course and those who are not ready yet will complete the programme with an Employability/Intrapreneurship unit to ensure they are more employable. Additional mentors/facilitators will be migrant entrepreneurs with relevant entrepreneurship experience who will support the trainers (partners) to run the sessions.Objectives:The overall objective of this project will be to better utilise the skills that highly skilled migrants bring into partner countries by fostering an entrepreneurial/intrapreneurial mindset for migrants.  The difficulty of immigrants successfully integrating into society is becoming an ever-more pressing issue and needs to be addressed. This project will help to combat this problem by increasing migrant employment in skills-matched areas as well as increasing entrepreneurship amongst this group and helping migrants to create strong social networks. The project will do this by providing migrants with the necessary skills and knowledge to improve their chances of finding employment that matches their skills and experiences or start a business instead. The project will also connect participants with both business professionals and fellow immigrants via a networking platform which will contribute to a more cohesive society and lead to more active participation in the community.Outputs:O1: Research Reports (National and European) on training needs of highly skilled migrants to develop entrepreneurial mindsetsO2: A Training Programme - Entrepreneurial Journey for HSMO3: Training the Trainers materialsO4: Guide \"Transferring your Skills into Self-Employment for HSMO5: Policy Guide - Developing Entrepreneurial and Intrapreneurial Mindsets: A Guide for Working with HSMO6: E Learning HubImpactMigrapreneurs will impact on HSM in the partner countries, providing them with training in developing entrepreneurial mindsets and further detailed training on business start-up and growth tailored to the migrant perspective.

The large influx of migrants in Europe needs to be effectively integrated and one aspect of integration is employment.  Research has shown that employees in a positive work environment are more effective in their work and perform better (Jeffrey Fermin, www.business.com). Therefore, successful mediation within an intercultural workforce context could improve the company\u2019s productivity and thus their bottom line. \r\n\r\nHowever, research in the partner countries of the project has shown that conflict at work is highly present, but the amount of managers with mediation training is low.  The more efficient an employer is to integrate a migrant in the workplace, the more successfully a migrant integrates into society and can thus contribute to the economy. This makes intercultural mediation  a crucial skill for managers to have in order to maximise talent in the workplace across Europe and improve the image of migrants within communities.\r\n\r\nInterMED is aimed at managers of SMEs who:\r\na) are currently managing an intercultural workforce\r\nb) are about to recruit migrants and want to successfully integrate them in the workplace\r\nc) are currently not managing an intercultural workforce and need more information about the business case of diversity in the workplace\r\n\r\nInterMED will aim to:\r\n-  Develop and increase mediation skills amongst managers to apply in an intercultural workplace context.\r\n-  Support managers to maximise the talent of their migrant employees through recruitment, retention and progression strategies\r\n-  Provide an innovative and holistic training based on role play, conflict resolution and self-reflection to improve soft skills\r\n- Provide a business case for diversity in the workplace in order to encourage more managers to recruit migrants and celebrate diversity\r\n\r\nInterMED  aims to train managers in intercultural mediation across Belgium, UK, Poland, Italy and Portugal (at least 20 per country) to integrate migrants successfully in the workplace by transferring overall mediation skills to an intercultural context. Managers will assist their employees in respecting and understanding different cultural demeanours in order to keep a calm and productive atmosphere at work. They will also be able to better understand strategies to recruit, retain and help migrants progress in organisations. Furthermore,  managers representing each partner country will attend an international event to learn more about mediation in an intercultural context and apply the knowledge acquired through the national training programme.\r\n\r\nThe project also fulfills the need to combat isolation and segregation of migrants by integrating them successfully into society through employment. Intercultural Mediation SKills for Managers differs from other training targeting migrant employability which has been mainly focused on the skills of migrants. That migrant-focused approach is important, but lacks the understanding that the most successful aspect of integrating a migrant in the workplace means mediation between two (work) cultures and is not based on the effort from the migrant only. \r\n\r\nThe training methodology will be divided in two pillars: Firstly, the training will use  Active Learning methodology which includes role-playing exercises with presenting intercultural scenarios  and other practical exercises focused on topics of mediation and intercultural communication. Secondly, the participants will focus on self-reflection, goal setting and action planning during the Diversity Circles\u2122. The Circles will offer a methodology well aligned for change management needs. Other topics covered will be Neurolinguistic Programming,  Coaching and Mentoring Skills to improve self-efficacy, Action Learning Questioning and Hofstede's Cultural Dimension theory.\r\n\r\nAside from the training for managers, the project partners will develop a Business Case for Diversity Management which shows managers both the benefits of employing migrants and how to manage a diverse workforce in order to benefit fully from diversity. This guide will be made available for all interested parties via the e-learning platform and disseminated widely. \r\n\r\nThe project will also develop an e-learning platform where managers in Europe will be able to access valuable resources in this field as well as showcasing successful case studies of companies who have embraced diversity.

WEB 3.0 is characterized by advanced data mining and machine learning technologies capable to extract knowledge and key information that can be exploited in any possible way. Ideally however it should be exploited for the benefit of its owners through activities such as personalized learning and the present project is supporting the move towards this direction.\r\nTHEREFORE THE QUESTION THE PROJECT WANTS TO ADDRESS IS HOW ONLINE IDENTITIES CAN IMPACT OUR DAILY LIFE AND THE ONE OF OUR RELATIVES, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN OR OLDER PARENTS.

Statistics continue to paint the bleak picture of the issues facing vulnerable women which may prevent them from becoming economically or educationally active. 1 in 4 women across Europe experience domestic violence over their lifetimes and between 6-10% of women suffer domestic violence in a given year (Council of Europe, 2002). 68% of human trafficking victims are women (2013, Eurostat). A significant proportion of refugee women living in the UK have experienced violence prior to arrival and they remain vulnerable to violence in the UK, their country of asylum (Refugee Council, 2012). There continues to be a need to provide high quality support and training to vulnerable women at risk of exclusion from the labour market. The sector continues to rely on volunteers working with vulnerable women to provide much needed support in the fields of personal empowerment, confidence and employability or entrepreneurship skills. Support Workers who work to provide support to vulnerable women have been overlooked in terms of the type and variety of training they are provided with. Whilst issue-specific training is provided for Support Workers working with vulnerable women, Support Workers report that they feel less able to support and provide information and guidance on issues relating to employability and entrepreneurship to their female clients. \r\n\r\nEMPOWER (Educational Materials for Practitioners providing Opportunities for vulnerable Women\u2019s Employability and Resilience) aims to bridge this gap by developing innovative blended training programmes to both target groups (Support Workers and vulnerable women themselves) via the EMPOWER Training Programme (training knowledge, skills and abilities in tools and methods for increasing confidence and awareness of strengths for employability) and EMPOWER Circles Programmes (action learning and increased self-reflection for success). \r\n\r\nEMPOWER is a consortium of skilled and experienced organisations from 4 partner countries (UK, LT, EL and IS) who all work in the field of gender and VET.

Firstly, the issue of migrant employment and integration in general, and secondly the specific challenges that are faced by women on top of these employability problems. Advancing Migrant Women (AMW) aims to address both issues by specifically targeting female migrants. Its main aim is to empower women migrants by developing their employability and entrepreneurship skills through a holistic programme based on training and mentoring which will increase their self-efficacy. This programme will enable migrant women to find employment or set up a business where they can fully use their talents and strengths.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, a special dual training methodology will be used to support migrant women. Firstly, they will be able to take part in a training session that addresses several different employability skills through active learning techniques such as role-playing. Secondly, they will be able to take part in Circles\u2122 that aim to develop soft skills, focus on self-reflection and build confidence. In the four partner countries, both the training and Circles\u2122 programme will be conducted over two pilots with a minimum of 80 women being trained throughout the partnership.\r\n\r\nAs employment and integration is a two-way street, the project also aims to support and empower employers to hire migrant women.

Work-related stress is among the most commonly reported causes of work-related illness, affecting more than 40 million individuals across the European Union (EU). Employment is beneficial to physical and mental health. The mental health and well-being of the Public Sector workforce is a key resource for productivity and innovation in the EU. The pace and nature of work is changing, leading to pressures on mental health and well-being. Action is needed to tackle the steady increase in work absenteeism and incapacity, and to utilize the unused potential for improving productivity that is linked to stress and mental disorders. \r\n\r\nMany organisations focus on providing training programmes for workers but it has been found that it is often the management practices that need to change in order to promote better mental wellbeing at work and reduce levels of work-related stress. For example, 40.7% of Finnish employees (compared to the EU average of 23%) in the Public Sector believe that there is a lack of awareness amongst management of psychosocial risks at work. 45.5% of Cyprus employees believe Public Sector Managers have difficulties addressing psychosocial risks.  In the UK the figures are just below the EU average (21.7%), pointing to the fact that while in the UK there has been success in work wellbeing campaigns there is still work needed to be done in training Managers to recognise mental health issues and talk openly about these issues at work. \r\n\r\nMindful Managers objectives are to both de-stigmatise the discussion around mental health at work whilst giving Managers tools and resources to actively support positive wellbeing at work for themselves are their teams. \r\n\r\nMindful Managers builds on the scientific evidence resulting from the Mental Capital and Wellbeing research project (UK Gov) which identifies 5 actions that people can take to boost their mental health and wellbeing (at work or in personal life). This mimics the successful campaigns across Europe for healthy eating which focus on getting '5 fruits/vegetables or more a day' e.g. www.kavikset.fi. For Mindful Managers we will focus on developing these 5 habits in the public sector workplace by training managers with the objective of strengthening workers' mental capacity and wellbeing and therefore reducing the impact of mental illness economically and socially across Europe.  \r\n\r\nMindful Managers is innovative in that in the countries of UK, Finland, Cyprus and Belgium there is a lack of engaging workplace training for Public Sector Managers in developing awareness of psychosocial stressors at work and how to actively build mental wellnes in the workforce using games and e-learning. In all countries, there is a recognised need for more support in the workplace to talk openly about mental health and tools to support mental wellbeing for all. Additional innovation comes in the form of developing a 'Healthy Workplaces Game' online/via an App, which will engage users into developing and implementing their 5 a day healthy mental wellbeing habits every day at work and in their personal life. Innovation comes in engaging a group of users i.e. Public Sector Managers into the game, many of whom will not be used to gamified learning and it will therefore be an opportunity for them to develop new skills in this area via interacting with the game online.  \r\n\r\nWe will target Managers in the Public Sector to receive training in the 5 ways to wellbeing at work and to 'play the wellbeing game' online and on the App developed.

Women in rural areas require extra support, since they are underrepresented in business; often face extra obstacles such as a lack of self-confidence or dealing with caring responsibilities and are often working in isolated areas with a need to build up their support networks. Women are also moving away from rural areas to more populated ones, in search of better opportunities, which is leading to \u2018brain drain\u2019 in some areas.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of this project are to assist women from rural areas in the 5 partner countries (Iceland, UK, Lithuania, Croatia and Bulgaria) to become successful entrepreneurs with a focus on small business development.\r\n \r\nThe partners involved are experienced in working with women entrepreneurs in rural areas, with qualified staff and extensive networks for dissemination.

AL provides a means of up-skilling or reskilling those affected by unemployment, restructuring and career transitions, as well as makes an important contribution to social inclusion, active citizenship and personal development.\r\nREASON FOR THE PROPOSAL\r\nThis project proposal could be addressed to all mentioned flagship initiatives.\r\nIn effect, the proposal is based on some elements:\r\n- CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING METHODOLOGY: a 2010 IBM poll of 1,500 CEOs from 60 countries and 33 industries have identified the creativity as the most crucial skill for future success and leadership competency. Creativity is a critical skill that can be taught through a specific methodology starting from the understanding of the importance of the creative problem solving in daily life and stimulating the findings of alternative solutions and practical exercise to test and learn to think outside the box\r\n- The ideas of SHARING AND COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION as alternative lifestyles where the participants share access to products or services, rather than having individual ownership\u2013a way to rethinking consumerism in order to ensure more sustainable lifestyles \r\n- ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND SOCIAL INCLUSION through the stimulation for a higher common benefit by changing the relationship within people living in the same urban areas\r\n- The proportion of URBAN POPULATION of the overall population in Europe has a trend that is going to reach up 80% on the next years -ref. European Environment Agency (EEA)\r\n\r\nThe CREATIVITY is really important and could be applied in any context of the daily life. The \u201cSHARING\u201d is, in reality, a creative rethinking of not sustainable lifestyles: alternative approach to the waste and excesses of the consumerist society in order to preserve the environment especially in urban contexts\r\n\r\nThe project idea is actual and would like to develop and integrate the experience coming from a previous project involving 3 of the partners (including the coordinator): a LLP Grundtivg Learning Partnership: \u201cWe Share\u201d about collaborative consumption and sharing in Europe that was named as \u201cStar Project\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe PROJECT PROPOSAL is about the learning to be creative in Urban areas thanks to the improvement of  the level of key competences and skills of citizens. In effect, the beneficiary is anyone living in an urban area and that want to find creative and alternative ways to fell more active, connected with the neighbours and also find a local job coming from a stimulated entrepreneurship e.g. social enterprises\r\nOUTPUTS/RESULTS \r\nThe project aims to:\r\n\u2022 Research and in-depth analyse from across EU successful GOOD PRACTICE examples about creativity and sharing in Urban areas\r\n\u2022 Promote the development, testing and implementation of INNOVATIVE PRACTICES/METHODOLOGIES in AL: Creative Problem Solving Methodology, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Open space Technology, World Caf\u00e8 method, other resources and tools to promote, activate and driving a Shareable city etc.\r\n\u2022 Transfer the knowledge about the METHODOLOGIES through an interactive GUIDE integrated with videos in order to promote the active citizenship, creativity and exploit the results to urban and local areas\r\n\u2022 Create a WEBSITE integrated with Blog and Social Networks containing a DATABASE OF MATERIALS TRANSLATED into all partners\u2019 National languages to promote and encourage an extensive exploitation and dissemination\r\n\u2022 Stimulate ENTREPRENEURSHIP and mainly social entrepreneurship thanks to the methodologies acquired and to a deep knowledge of own local area\u2019s needs\r\n\u2022 Disseminate the project outputs and results throughout EU with a database of OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES available through open licences\r\n\u2022 Create the staff profile \u201cEXPERTS IN CREATIVITY  AND SHAREABLE POLICIES\u201d thanks to an intensive training and support on ECVET system and then recognised and validated by a specific Memorandum of Understanding\r\n\u2022 Arrange a series of MULTIPLIER EVENTS involving a large number of stakeholders to foster exploitation and dissemination of PROJECT Intellectual Outputs\r\n\r\nIMPACT ENVISAGED\r\nThe partnership will bring together partners coming from several countries and their stakeholders both public and private with the synergic power to reach a very large and diverse audience. It has the potential to stimulate active citizenship, live better in the urban areas and also create job opportunities at local level.\r\nThe project activities will be focused on the implementation of the European Agenda for AL in not-formal context enhancing the creativity through really innovative knowledge, skills and competences coming from the transferred Methodologies and detailed good practice guide ready-to-be-applied in other countries.", "http://www.inovaconsult.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA204-014775_3"], [2014, "Mind the GAP!

A disturbing ongoing skills gap in the EU STEM sector, continued shortfall of women & increasing STEM drop-out rates of girls in STEM requires GAP to address these issues with practical tools and results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1,300m people with technical skills will be required by 2020. Current graduate levels (both male & female students) in STEM subjects are not sufficient to fill these vacancies. Policy makers within the EU have recently called for more to be done to attract students to this area. However, there is a secondary problem in that women are grossly under-represented in STEM: A 2012 WISE report stated that \"While a few (mainly ex-Soviet) countries have around 20% women in STEM, Western European countries such as France and Spain (17% each), Denmark (16%), Germany (15%), Finland (15%), and UK (9%) all bring the European average down to 17%\". With women currently making up almost half the labour market (46% of the workforce in the UK), the GAP partners therefore recognise that by encouraging more girls into STEM subjects after compulsory education we can make a contribution to:\r\n\r\n1/ Filling the STEM skills shortage by inspiring more girls to stay in school and gain STEM qualifications\r\n\r\n2/ Combating high levels of early VET drop-out rates and youth unemployment by raising aspirations amongst young women \r\n\r\n3/ Improving gender diversity in STEM by raising awareness of the current gap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMind the GAP! will work directly with:\r\n\r\n1/ VET Teachers working in STEM subjects\r\n\r\n2/ Girls, (16-18yrs) in STEM subjects (& girls who dropped out or completed study but not entered STEM jobs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand indirectly with:\r\n\r\n1/ Younger girls in secondary schools\r\n\r\n2/ VET teachers generally\r\n\r\n3/ Key decision makers and stakeholders\r\n\r\n4/ Organisations working in the field of gender diversity and STEM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on a needs analysis of VET teachers and girls in STEM, the partnership will complete activities with the overall aim of: \r\n\r\n1/ Directly helping a number of VET teachers in each partner country to recruit and retain more girls onto their STEM courses \r\n\r\n2/ Supporting and inspiring a number of girls to continue their STEM education and careers by helping them develop the soft skills they will need to work in a male-dominated environment. \r\n\r\nLonger term we will also work to raise awareness amongst a wider target group of the importance of promoting STEM to young women and girls in schools and colleges across Europe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAP will achieve this via concrete results:\r\n\r\n- Mind the GAP! Gender Training Programme\r\n\r\nA new training programme will be adapted by the partnership (from VHTO materials in NL) and will be designed to support VET teachers to recruit and retain female students on their courses; providing teaching tools and inclusive methodologies for increasing teachers' gender-awareness in STEM in their teaching approaches.\r\n\r\n- Career Circles: Girls in STEM\r\n\r\nBased on a peer mentoring and action learning methodology developed by Inova (UK), GAP will develop Career Circles to support girls studying or recently finishing STEM subjects to help them develop the soft skills they need to develop their career plans, assess their goals and build the self-confidence they will need to work in a male-dominated field.\r\n\r\n- Career Circles: VET Teachers\r\n\r\nCircles will also be developed for VET Teachers to explore with peers, issues faced by women in  STEM, understand how they can better support young students, reflect on their CPD and share teaching methods and tools.\r\n\r\n- GAP Online Learning Hub\r\n\r\nA Learning Hub will make the materials produced by GAP available freely to a wider audience of girls, VET teachers, policy makers and the community. It will also bring together a range of other OER resources in a search-able catalogue which will help girls and teachers find useful training materials.\r\n\r\n- Policy Makers Guide: Improving Gender Inclusivity in Teaching of STEM Subjects at VET Level\r\n\r\nAimed at highlighting issues of gender diversity in STEM to key EU policy makers in VET, produced in order to ensure VET teaching in STEM is inclusive and address VET STEM subject drop-out rates (esp.girls) and measures to counter these in STEM via GAP tools.\r\n\r\n- Mind the Gap!

However, there is a continuous entrepreneurial skills gap and a strong lack of female representation in many creative fields, leading to the undervaluation of the importance of art to our global economy and keeping alive a level of deeply rooted inequality between men and women. Female artists and creatives are underrepresented in the creative commercial markets, in award shows and in the creative industries as a whole.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the representation of women in CCIs, 2 main issues can be identified that are visible across all EU-countries in general and across the project partner countries in particular: \r\n1. there is a broad entrepreneurial skills gap between CCIs and the European business world;\r\n2. there are specific challenges faced by women running CCIs that further lower their opportunities of international business growth and development. \r\nGlobal FemArt aims to address both by specifically targeting female artists and creatives in order to develop specific support for their entrepreneurial development through a holistic programme combining (online) training and mentoring. The training programme will enable female artists and creatives to increase their knowledge on how to run and develop a creative business as well as strengthen their self-confidence and self-efficacy. Global FemArt will hereby enable female artists and creatives to take the next step with their business, encouraging them to move towards more globalised trade in line with the EU 2020 Strategy for Growth and Jobs that aims to build a cultural sector \u2018able to increasingly contribute to employment and growth across Europe\u2019. \r\n\r\n5 partners based in all areas of the EU, will develop a special dual training methodology combining online (Global FemArt Academy) and face-to-face (Artist Circles\u2122) learning that is fully job transcendent and can be applied in any type of creative sector. This programme will be tested over 2 pilots with a minimum of 50 female artists and creatives being directly trained throughout the partnership.\r\n \r\nThe combination of an on- and offline dimension brings a flexible approach to participants\u2019 learning (eLearning has proven to increase information retention rates by up to 60% - The Research Institute of America) while still taking into account specific and individual needs of each participant. This will increase the positive and beneficial outcomes for learners, is expected to improve retention rates, and leads to a greater likelihood they acquire the confidence to continue the path of self-employment and global business growth.\r\n\r\nGlobal FemArt goes beyond mere theoretical transmission of information; it allows participants to put into practice all that they have learned via the Global FemArt Trading Area. Here, the \u2018Global\u2019 in Global FemArt truly comes to life: platform registrants will be able to create a personal profile, communicate with other platform users, share their stories and find inspiration in the stories of other female artists and creatives, promote their business and sell their products/services on a global level. \r\n\r\nAs gender equality is a two-way street, Global FemArt will not only empower more women to set up and grow their creative businesses, it will also grab every opportunity to raise awareness of the issue on a regional to global scale throughout the project lifetime and beyond. These efforts will culminate in the Policymakers Guide \u201cGlobal FemArt \u2013 the women that drive the creative industries\u201d, demonstrating the importance of policies and programmes to build and sustain creative businesses across the EU and beyond. The most successful tools and techniques as presented in the piloting programmes will be promoted, participants\u2019 experiences with CCIs as a whole and Global FemArt in particular will be presented, and the partnership will include strong policy recommendations on how to combat existing inequalities.

The project will also develop framework about burnout and resilience (background) , the assessment to explore and recognize B&R and guidelines for workshops. Burnout is a rapidly growing problem for both employees and employers in all European countries, it is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work  \u2014 facts and figures stress is the second most frequently-reported work-related health problem, affecting 22% of workers from the EU. Studies suggest that stress is a factor in between 50% and 60% of all lost working days. This represents a huge cost in terms of both human distress and impaired economic performance. The number of people suffering from stress-related conditions caused or made worse by work is likely to increase due to the changing world of work which is making increased demands on workers. If the stress response continues over a longer period, or if it is particularly intense, this may have pathological ramifications. Research has proven that stress at work is associated with cardiovascular diseases , musculoskeletal diseases , immunological problems , and problems with mental health (anxiety and depression disorders).The project will develop 2 toolkitsthe toolkit for resilience - how to maintain,strenghten your own resilience, the toolkit - how to help others in strenghtening the resilience of others, assessment tool to explore and recognize burnout and resilience, framework - to give some background about burnout and resilience, and a gudelines for workshop in the elearning (m- learning) format.

In its Higher Education Agenda, the EU highlights the importance of increasing the number of HE graduates to 40% and places HE at the centre of Innovation, job creation, competitiveness and sustainability. Despite the current success, there are trends risking the positive outcomes, the educational ROI at social, financial and innovation level.\r\n\r\nUnemployment and underemployment among HE graduates, fragmented work careers and employment have increased in the EU during the past decade, distributing unevenly among educational sectors, countries, and origins of HE graduates creating groups most at risk. Long-term unemployment increases difficulties of HE graduates to return to work and hence social exclusion. Poorer employment opportunities drive HE graduates to fragmented and short-term employments, low-skilled jobs, emigration and brain-drain. Absence from graduate work causes lack of work experience, skill mismatch and loss of taught skills.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the changes in work life and the new requirements for competencies of Work 4.0 further create challenges to return and/or enter to work life, such as\r\n- Unpredictability, fragmentation and fluidity of future work life, digitalisation replacing people\r\n- Need of non-cognitive skills and competencies, e.g. problem solving, creativity, readiness for change, people skills, design competencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the goals of the EU policies for education, innovation, it is crucial to re-integrate and re-skill also the unemployed and underemployed HE graduates to work life with solutions that will enable their successful entrance or return to work, and mastering competencies for Work 4.0. Yet, these subjects have largely been overlooked and the current HE and employment training offer is mainly focused on discipline-based competencies, hardly addressing Work 4.0 competencies. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE and OUTCOMES\r\nReboot project aims to increase the employability potential of the unemployed and underemployed HE graduates by upskilling and developing relevant and high quality skills and competencies for Work 4.0 in 5 future-oriented and sector-agnostic competence clusters, their ability to recognise and demonstrate these skills, and their change readiness. The vehicle will be an online non-formal training programme with a skill-competence testing tool especially targeted towards unemployed and underemployed HE graduates. \r\nThe noticeable national differences in the partner countries\u2019 HE unemployment and underemployment realities will assist to create a holistic picture of the situation at the uropean level taking into account all the most important perspectives. This will facilitate creating a Pan-European approach that any country can apply according to their current national context.\r\n\r\nThe main outcomes of the project will be:\r\nO1: Validation of Reboot Competency Clusters for Work 4.0\r\nO2: Reboot Online Training Programme\r\nO3: Reboot Competence Self-testing Tool\r\nO4: Handbooks for Implementing Reboot Training: Reboot Pilot Course, and Training of Trainers\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe Reboot project will apply target group and stakeholder surveys, desk research and comparative analysis in competence and training analysis and verification, and participatory, design, product development methods, piloting and observation in the development of the Reboot online training programme, self-test and handbooks for the users.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nThe primary target group of Reboot will be European unemployed and underemployed HE graduates, with a special attention on groups at risk: young graduates, women who have taken parent leave, employees over 45 who have been made redundant, and (young EU) migrants. The secondary target group will be HEI and career counsellors, C-VET and unemployment training organisers, unemployment offices, HEI professors and teachers, key-actors in HRM and employment areas.\r\nReboot is expected to involve or reach circa 16000 representatives of target groups and stakeholders in the project activities from development and  to dissemination, of which as direct participants in intellectual outputs, circa 120 unemployed and underemployed HE graduates, 120 employment organisations, and 100 stakeholders represented by employing organisations.\r\n\r\nENVISAGED IMPACT AND LONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIncreased understanding and knowledge of Work 4.0 competencies, the perceptual differencies of them among different groups, and about employment training needs and realities of the unemployed and underemployed HE graduates.\r\n- Unemployed and underemployed HE graduates: increased mastering, awareness and ability to demonstrate of own Work 4.0 competencies, and increased abilities for career flexibility.\r\n- Employment organisations: obtaining cutting-edge training material to support unemployed and underemployed HE graduates in developing Work 4.0 related competencies and their career flexibility.", "http://www.inovaconsult.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA204-047188_1"], [2017, "Kaleidoscope: supporting female migrant entrepreneurs", "INOVA CONSULTANCY LTD", 177101.0, 4, 4, "Migrants, especially migrant women, experience higher unemployment and under-employed rates in EU countries than their native citizens (OECD 2013).

They will receive holistic digital media and employability skills training, developed by the Learning2gether consortium.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, about 41.5% of people in the UK aged 55-74 would say they are fairly digitally literate and have used the internet at least once a week, this increases to 65% of older people in the Iceland, and reduces to 33.4% in Belgium, 13% in Spain and 6% in Bulgaria (evidence from Eurostat). Younger generations are better able to use and adapt to the changing technical environment and pick up new skills in this sector. Older workers on the other hand, are less likely to be familiar with the fast-changing technologies and pick up new technological skills needed to successfully run their business as they did not grow up with them or had only limited access to it. In Iceland, according to Eurostat, when asked, 99% of young people (16-24) said they had used the Internet in the last week, 88% of young people in Belgium had, 83% in the UK, 77% in Spain and 58% in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nDuring the project a special training methodology will be used to support NEETs. First, they will be able to take part in hard-skills training sessions which will aim to increase their knowledge about digital media in a professional context and enhance their consultancy and tutoring skills. These training sessions will be face-to-face with an added online dimension through the eLearning Platform where participants can revise the training through webinars and find additional information through OERs provided. NEETs will furthermore be able to connect with SMEs who are looking for extra training in digital media for their older employees.  \r\n\r\nThe methodology of this training is innovative because after the training sessions the NEETs will have the opportunity to tutor at least one older SME worker, recruited by the partners, on how to use digital media. Through this the NEETs will put their training into practice and will be able to test their consultancy skills. \r\n\r\nTogether with the tutoring sessions organised by the NEETs to the older SME workers, the former will come together in Reflective Practice Training, which is based on the Circles\u2122 methodology developed in the UK.

Entrepreneurship is included in national curricula to VET of many EU countries but despite that, according to the Final Report of the Expert Group (Entrepreneurship in VET) there is still a gap to be filled because: teaching methods are ineffective, the practical element of entrepreneurship is missing, Teachers are not fully competent. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the Gamify Your Teaching project is to support professional development of vocational competences of teachers and trainers of entrepreneurship and to enhance ICT teaching through an innovative pedagogy and approach to teaching with the use of gamification.\r\nTo achieve this aim, the project puts forward two general objectives: \r\n- to create and test of simulation game with practical elements covering 7 entrepreneurship subject areas\r\n- to create and test methodology (didactic materials for Teachers) of teaching entrepreneurship with the use of the gamification\r\n\r\nThe project will directly engage VET Teachers from Romania, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, United Kingdom, Spain and Greece. The Teachers will participate in various stages of the project expressing opinions and testing didactic materials prepared especially for them. Also the students will be directly involved in activities. At the beginning they will tell game creators about expectations regarding the game, they will test and evaluate it. Such direct participation is expected at minimum of 578 people. In addition to that, other participants from the area of VET education will be informed about the project results. Minimum of 275 stakeholders will take part in dedicated to the project multiplication events and others will be informed at different occasions and via internet. This number will be about 25000.\r\n\r\nBesides usual activities necessary for implementing a project, the partners will carry out activities leading directly to preparation of main results. In the first phase of the project the needs analysis research will take place in order to find out what are the game requirements (the level of ICT competence of VET Teachers and general characteristics of the game). Research will end with preparation of Needs Analysis Report which will be the base for creation of the game and didactic materials for Teachers.  An attractive addition to the game will be the collection of case studies of successful businesses serving as an inspiration for students for opening up own businesses.  \r\n\r\nAs the project envisages wide dissemination actions, it is expected that the impact will be significant. It will be noted specifically on VET Teachers and the students who will use the products and in effect raise own entrepreneurial and ICT competences. In the long run the project will have impact on increasing sense of initiative and entrepreneurship not only the students who will take part of the project but also other young people that will be reached via different channels. In the long run also ICT competences of VET Teachers will be increased thanks to wide distribution of didactic materials.", "http://www.inovaconsult.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA202-014975_3"], [2016, "SMART PLUS", "INOVA CONSULTANCY LTD", 115402.0, 4, 5, "SMART PLUS aims to develop an innovative system that allows the identification of the mismatch between the needs in terms of competences required by the tourism industry labour market and the training contents offered by the educational institutions. This system will allow institutions to conduct a self-assessment that, together with an ontology-based tool (transfer and adaptation of SMART), provides information for a customised training e-learning solution. Educational institutions have, then, the opportunity to complement their training offer by adapting their contents and curricula to the labour market need through the SMART PLUS training, thus benefiting their students.The project objectives will be attained by implementing the following activities:\u2022 Identification of relevant skills and competences as foreseen in ESCO that are relevant for the tourism industry at EU-level and the definition of the SMART PLUS ontology-based system. The system will transfer, adapt and improve results of SMART (Supporting dynamic MAtching for Regional development - 2012-1-ES1-LEO05-49395) and will allow institutions to identify the mismatch between training contents offered and labour market demand in terms of competences, as well as it will allow students to complete a self-assessment of their competences;\u2022 Definition and design of a modular training that will help educational institutions tackle the mismatch problem and students acquire relevant competences. This e-learning solutions will be composed of 6 independent training modules addressing competences identified by the European Union as key competences for lifelong learning and that students should develop during their training and education. Topics include: intercultural competences, entrepreneurship, soft skills, ICT and communication in foreign languages;\u2022 Creation of the SMART PLUS Online Platform that will give access to the ontology-based tool, to the e-learning solution (training contents developed by the consortium) and also to a repository of additional open educational resources (OER) that allow institutions to customise the training pathway according to the learners\u2019 needs and to the needs identified by educational institutions.Complementary to the project activities, the partnership will employ several tools and resources that contribute to the project dissemination, namely organising 8 events (two per partner country), including a Final Conference organised in Seville at the end of project execution to present the project and final scientific report to an audience of local, national and international participants.Other dissemination tools include the development of the project platform, creation of a Facebook fan page, development of the project visual identity, production of the project brochure, materials for events and other dissemination materials, periodical newsletters and the publication of 2 papers/articles).
