Sports, federative element in any country, will be the vital lead of our project. Each collaborating school possesses numerous cultural, historic and environmental attractive features which will be highlighted and exploited during the project during the realisation of the local \"CIRCUIT\". \r\n\r\n- Approximately 200 students (from 12 to 16 years old) \r\n- 5 countries (France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Great Britain) \r\n- About thirty different teachers in such diverse subjects as\u00a0: PE, Mathematics, Science, History, English and Spanish. \r\n\r\n- 4 transnational meetings between teachers to coordinate the project \r\n- 5 meetings of mobility including all the partners (students and teachers): discovery of every local \"circuit\", presentation of the works, exchanges on the different teaching habits\u2026 \r\n- 4 bilateral meetings of mobility  (students and teachers): exchange between students, discovery of the educational system of the partners, joint training for teachers... \r\n- 2 visits of the bearers of the project with representative students, asked to promote the project with their European partner \r\n- Exchanges of works and realisation (internet, Erasmus + platform, eTwinning\u2026) \r\n- 1 international game in France with all the countries involved in the project\r\n- Creation of brochures commented in several languages with map of the \"circuit\" \r\n- Distribution of brochures to the various institutional partners (General Council, City hall and tourist offices)\r\n- Promotion of the local environment, municipalities, schools involved in the project \r\n- 1 seminar focused on information and presentation of the project to local governments, to general public, tourist offices, schools, \u2026 \r\n- Creation of an evaluation tool specific to the project (including its distribution to the various partners and its publication) \r\n\r\nThis project, through the European mobilities and the meetings with young people of different countries, will allow every student to fight against prejudices and to become aware of his or her membership in different, varied but close and brotherly European Union. It will allow them to make the first move towards their future European citizenship and to take part in a personal project of school or professional mobility more easily when he or she is in high-school or college. \r\n\r\nEvery student will therefore be able to follow his or her own \"CIRCUIT\":\r\n \r\n                  Create an International, Respectful, Collaborative and Universal Interdisciplinary Teaching", "http://www.shottonhallschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002408_1"], [2016, "\"Green Jobs for our Planet Earth\"", "academy at shotton hall", 141471.0, 9, 9, "This multilateral KA2 project entitled \"Green Jobs for our Planet Earth\" takes place in the field of secondary education. The general issues our project deals with are career guidance, job market, sustainable development, IT and linguistic skills and EU awareness. The main challenge our project will try to take up is to make students discover as many green jobs as possible during our 24-month period and present the ecofriendly industries as attractive and dynamic professional fields that should be taken seriously by teenagers. This theme we'll work on is perceptive on the European level but is also relevant on the international level with the UNESCO decision to define 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. We want to strengthen the link between education, the job market and the economic world that is specific to our school areas. We also seek to promote at the international level the assets of the economic sectors located in our schools areas, which are sometimes isolated. The project has three objectives: 1) the promotion of sustainable jobs so as to develop a dynamic image of this type of green industries which are sectors providing more and more job opportunities that are interesting for teenagers' career plans 2) give teenagers the opportunity to behave as European modern citizens and present the green industries of their regions to other European friends by using mainly English as a foreign language and documents created thanks to ICT 3) sensitize teenagers about global issues by advocating 21st century priority ethic values such as decent working conditions for everyone and respect of the environment.This partnership has been coordinated by the Coll\u00e8ge du Carbet in MARTINIQUE (overseas department of FRANCE) and comprises 9 participating schools selected via Etwinning and located in ENGLAND (Shotton Hall Academy), GERMANY (Staatliche Fach- und Berufsoberschule), IRELAND (Eurekaschool), ITALY (Liceo Scientifico \"Camillo Golgi\"), LITHUANIA (Kedainiai Sviesioji Gymnasium), NORWAY (Bremnes ungdomsskule), ROMANIA (Liceul Teoretic \"Onisifor Ghibu\") and SPAIN (Instituto Pedro Cerrada). We form a culturally rich and varied partnership that has been active for almost a year and links countries and schools which are distant from one another but united by several common points. There is also a good balance between middle schools and high schools.We have planned 2 transnational meetings in Lithuania and Germany and 4 learning mobilities in Spain, England, Norway and Martinique where a hundred of participants (students, teachers and headteachers) will visit sustainable businesses, discover other school systems and cultures, and practise foreign languages. Our goal is to open up to the international level and enable students to learn in a non-formal way. We try to raise students'awareness by involving them into concrete educational activities leading to the production of shows, videos, a jobs guide, creative writing pieces, educational brochures and Powerpoint presentations whereby students learn and understand that sustainable industries are interesting sectors for their careers and personal developments. At the local, regional and national levels, the dissemination of our project's programme, activities and outputs will be carried out via our schools' and Local Education Authorities' websites, notices, posters and meetings with staff and parents inside our schools. We'll also resort to the use of local press, TV and radio channels. On the European and international levels, we'll communicate and disseminate about our project thanks to the Etwinning, European Commission and Edmodo platforms.Students will greatly benefit from our project  and form enlightened opinions on sustainable industry and will promote it. They 'll understand the links between their careers and sustainable development. They will have discovered a wide range of professions that might have an influence on their careers' plans. They will be more familiar with ICT and modern languages, especially English. They will also be able to define themselves as European citizens while remaining proud of their national heritages. The school staff will develop new skills, give more sense to  their professional experiences and work with more motivated students. The project will be included in the partner schools' physics, history, biology, geography and modern languages curricula. The recognition and validation of these learning outcomes will be materialized by the creation of own European Language Portfolios and the edition of Youthpass certificates. All our project's outputs can be used and witnessed inside the partner schools in the future, after the project's period, but also outside the schools, for most of them, by other teachers, representatives of our Local Education Authorities and Local Councils or members from the civil society, such as parents, associations and business managers.", "http://www.shottonhallschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-023927_6"], [2016, "Stereotypes: Tackling Adverse representations in School", "academy at shotton hall", 140002.0, 5, 5, "Each of the schools is located in a ethnically homogenous, economically underperforming and culturally traditional  region and many of our students do not have experience of encounter individuals who represent ethnographic diversity. The project is intended to challenge the widely held stereotypes our students encounter and often accept without question.  We intend to focus on students aged between 11 and 14 and integrate the project work within the curriculum. Each school will offer participation in the project to all students within this age group.Because stereotyping and prejudice is such a wide ranging topic, we are going to focus on five key areas with each partner taking the lead in managing the project content, student activities and outputs. The principle stereotypes we have decided to focus on are  Gender stereotypes, sexual identity stereotypes, racial stereotypes, religious stereotypes and migration stereotypes.The first transnational project meeting will coincide with a training event hosted by local authority equalities staff and community leaders who will provide training on strategies we can use to raise awareness of this topic.Each of the partners has a particular area of expertise, the Maltese teacher is experienced in web design and her role is to create a portal for displaying results.The Finnish teacher school are specialists  in inclusive education and have a particular expertise in integrating students with learning difficulties into mainstream education. The Portuguese school has worked in partnership at local, regional, national and international projects (Comenius and LdV).They  have a long history in Multimedia VET courses for high school students. This way they will be responsible for the disseminating the project results through video, audio and other multimedia formats.The Croatian school already have extensive experience of  tackling stereotypes and has established contacts with the Red Cross. They have  highly- developed communication, social and conflict- resolution skills, our teachers challenge stereotypes on a daily basis. These have primarily been focused upon stereotypes relating to Croatia's relationships with countries from the former YugoslaviaThe UK school has extensive experience of managing international projects, of keeping the project focus, of ensuring effective communication between partners. On completion of the project  we will have created a public web site in which we will offer our outcomes to teachers and educators as a learning resource.Each school will collaborate to produce written schemes of work , printed activities, which are to be offered to other schools throughout Europe. This will be publicised on the public events  forum on E Twinning.Public performances of poetry, drama and music which tackle stereotypes will be staged in our schools and recorded The schools will work n partnership with womens rights groups, LGBT groups such as Rainbow schools and Stonewall alliance as well as with local bodies representing diverse sections of our societies.From a project management perspective, all schools will work with local authorities, local employers and will consolidate their existing links with the press.E Twinning will be the means by which we maintain day to day communication and we will be offering participation in the project to schools outside of the Erasmus partnership. The medium term objective is to ensure our students can increase their respect for their fellow citizens.In the longer term we want to create a library resource of work challenging stereotyping, freely available to other schools.During the UK short term student  study visit,  the Academy at Shotton Hall will, in partnership with \"Durham Direct\" , organise a diversity conference.A monthly bulletin/newsletter will be prepared.", "http://www.shottonhallschool.co.uk", "academy at shotton hall", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024386_coordinator"], [2015, "SmartMaths", "academy at shotton hall", 70982.0, 4, 5, "The project\u00b4s main objective is to apply gamification to the educational field, using ludic activities to learn. It\u2019s a perfect cooperative tool which will allow us to bring Maths closer to our students. An active and creative Maths learning facilitates the students incorporation to the labour market, as it helps  our students to make decisions, solve problems and  fosters their creativity. In addition, the student\u2019s communicative and digital competence are essential as it is a cooperative transnational project. It also improves the cooperative ability and promotes respect towards other people. All the activities expect to promote the Intereuropean dialogue and the knowledge of other languages and also promote the introduction of cooperative learning elements between nations. \r\nThe main concern of all the partners is to innovate in the Maths teaching methods in order to contribute to strengthen our students entrepreneur spirit. \r\nThe thematic areas which will be worked are: Numbers, Ratio and Proportion; Geometry and Measure; Algebra, Graphics and Functions; and Probability and Statistics. Each of these will be the topic of an eTwinning project managed by one of the partners. It will be included in many activities destined to their incorporation to our intellectual output.\r\nSMARTMATHS Video Game. The selection of the type of game and the design of the \u201cfour worlds\u201d, each one referred to a Maths field, will be essential activities in the project\u00b4s development. The drawing and short story competition to select the game protagonist and the performance\u2019s plot; The music composition for the game and the performance; the creation of games and questions which will be the trials that our protagonist will have to fulfil; The translation of all the resources in different languages and its publication in our second intellectual output, the education portal. All partners will work on the activities and products in an equitable way during certain periods of time. Each partner will be in charge of its development. \r\n\r\nThe project\u00b4s intellectual outputs will be SMARTMATHS game (digital version, mobile application and board game). It allows us to join all the activities carried out during the project. We will publish all the project\u00b4s development, the resources and the results in the education portal so as to provide the information to any interested people. \r\nThe students will be the most favoured ones, as innovation and creativity in the methodology will contribute to improve Maths teaching. Participating in this project will also improve our students' digital and linguistic competence, as they will communicate and work together on different activities.\r\nTeachers will also receive a positive benefit from it, as it will affect directly the methodology in Maths lessons. Access to different educational resources, new technological tools and the gamification of Maths will lead to a profound change in the way we understand the teaching of this subject.\r\n\r\nMobilities and communication among students, teachers and educational community are a fundamental part in a multilateral project like this, and it will not only contribute to improve linguistic competence but also to acquire a new way of understanding Europe and the society in general. Its impact will affect all families involved and the whole educational community.\r\nThe project will be disseminated online: project\u2019s education portal, schools\u2019 websites, eTwinning and different social networks. Parents, students and educational community will be able to access all information via these publications or through informative meetings, to which other schools in the area and education inspectors will be invited. \r\n\r\nThe impact will be assessed in an objective way at the school through three different evaluations: initial, intermediate and final.  We will take into account the following indicators: increase in the number of students who get good results in Maths; in the interest to get to know other cultures; in the number of teachers and students with an official diploma in a foreign language; in the use of new tools and methodology in the classroom and in the degree of satisfaction of the families. These evaluations will be addressed to teachers, students and families in order to know the real impact of the project.\r\n\r\nThe effort does not end here. European citizenship, teaching of foreign languages and new methodologies that will favour the development of basic competences, new technologies...All these things are necessary nowadays for a student to become a successful professional in  the future. We want all this to be a hallmark of our schools.

The duration of the project is 1 year. The duration of activity is 1 month.The applicant as well as sending organisation is Tallinna Kesklinna Vene G\u00fcmnaasium (Tallinn Central Russian Gymnasium) which is located in Tallinn, Estonia. TKVG is one of the oldest schools in Estonia, which was established in 1923. The school offers 12 grades of secondary education for 1200 students under the guidance of more than 100-member  teaching staff. TKVG is a community of students from different ethnic backgrounds.The receiving organisation is the Academy at Shotton Hall which is located in Peterlee, Tees Valley and Durham, the UK.  The Academy at Shotton Hall converted to become an academy school on 1st February 2011. When its predecessor school, Shotton Hall School, was last inspected by Ofsted, it was judged to be outstanding. It is a designated teaching school. This academy is larger than the average-sized secondary school. A well-below-average proportion of students are from minority ethnic backgrounds, and a similar proportion speaks English as an additional language. The proportion of disabled students and those with special educational needs who are supported through school action is average, whilst the proportion supported at school action plus and with a statement of special educational needs is above average.The aims of the project are to enhance professional skills and competences of the teaching staff of TKVG, to adopt new language teaching methods and innovative approaches to learning, to improve abilities to respond to individual learners' needs and to deal with their social, cultural and linguistic diversity, to familiarise with and adopt the culture and the living environment of the UK through real experience, to improve English and develop skills in training refugee children, inter-cultural classrooms, teaching pupils in their second language, classroom tolerance and diversity.The target group of the project is foreign language teachers of TKVG. The group consists of 20 members. The sending organisation will send one teacher. The placement teacher will be the head of the department of foreign languages, Julia Gri\u0161t\u0161enko, who has been teaching English in TKVG since September 2013. She has a 2,5-year experience in teaching primary, secondary and upper-secondary students. She has participated in KA2  and KA3 exchange programs both in the role of a student (when she was a member of a youth organisation) and in the role of a teacher (Comenius, Nordplus). While working at TKVG as a teacher of English, she was elected as the pedagogical council of pedagogical meetings of the educational institution and in September 2015 she was elected the head of the department of foreign languages of TKVG.The staff mobility comprises a job shadowing/observation period abroad in the partner school. Initially, the tasks will consist of preparation and managing mobility. The tasks of placement teacher during her mobility will consist of observing lessons, assisting English teachers in giving lessons, substituting English teachers, managing international projects (booking flights and hotels, collecting parental consent forms from students and submitting Educational visit forms) and participation in international mobilities and helping schedule Erasmus work (participation in international mobilities will be realised by the receiving organisation). The tasks after the mobility will comprise organisation of open classes, teacher training activities and meetings, development of school curriculum and adopting new experience in classroom activities.The experience of the placement teacher will be shared with her colleagues via open lessons, teacher trainings and meetings. The English language teaching in TKVG will be advanced via implementing upgraded teaching methods and innovative approaches to learning as well as fostering tolerance in a multicultural society.Foreign language teachers of TKVG under supervision of the placement teacher and with the support of colleagues from the partner organisation will contribute to development and modernisation of school curriculum.Students of TKVG will become more interested in the English language learning, will get to know about living environment in the UK, will experience learning in new environment, and as a result, will demonstrate better results.The project activities will contribute to the partner organisation via sharing the teaching experience of TKVG,  representing a foreign culture and fostering tolerance in a multicultural society. In addition, this project will maintain and develop successful and productive partnership between the organisations.Within the framework of present and future international projects in which TKVG takes and will take part, our experience will be shared with our partner organisations further.", "http://www.shottonhallschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-EE01-KA101-017189_1"]]}}, "5UQ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXP", "Peterlee Community Hospital - County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust", "nhs_RXP09"]]}}}}
