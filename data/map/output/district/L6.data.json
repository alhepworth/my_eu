The great number of refugees from many different nations,  cultural, ethnical and religious backgrounds is a challenge to family work in every participating country and is prompting discussions in our nations.  The participating institutions realize, that all of us have to rethink our  concepts of inclusion and family support. The participating organizations from Sweden, England, Bulgaria, Crotia and Germany are working througout  their states and/or countries and develope concepts on how to best support (disadvantaged) families and youth,  also families with migration and flight backgrounds. Because of their very different historical and cultural matrix they have developed varying perspectives and concepts/training programs  in different fields of family work that the partners would like to profit from and prepare for the future tasks.Objectives: The six projected meetings and visitations of best practice institutions in five countries will help the participants to better understand the rationales behind the concepts, reflect them and apply all possible aspects to their own training programms and/or fields of work. These discussions and presentations are meant to be the basis for the reviews of  the curricula of the partner organizations developed for  the target groups.  At the end of the programm  they would like to discuss and publish recommendations to make an impact on curricula in their own institutions and beyond.Number and profile of the participants:1. Sweden, 2 representatives: The President of FEFAF, European Federation of Parents and Carers at Home, an umbrella    organization with 19 member organizations in Europe and at the UN and nationally.

Such a result can just be achieved by combining school and practice in an optimal and comprehensive manner, as it can be seen in this project, which will be expanded on a European level. The project\u2019s impact on the participants is expected to take place on several levels: the expansion of self-competence and social competence by means of personality development, as well as the expansion of professional competence and possibilities to work throughout the EU, which will increase the students\u2019 chances of using their newly acquired qualifications.
