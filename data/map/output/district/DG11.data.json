It is generally perceived that money is hard earned and that basic life essentials, eg. food and petrol are all very expensive.  Similarly on the environmental side, there are global worries about nature, climate change, trade, globalism and agricultural methods which are constantly reported in the news.   Traditional knowledge of making things, growing our own food, land use and agricultural methods are being rapidly lost, even in rural areas where they have been a part of the way of life for centuries.\r\nIn this project we hope to engage our school communities in a real and important exploration of how we are living today.  We want to raise awareness of how our rush to progress and improve has actually lost us many of the basic skills necessary for day to day living and general \u2018life maintenance\u2019.  We aim in this project to re-skill our pupils and educate our school communities with many of the essential life skills and values that we have lost  like making things with our hands, entertaining ourselves with games, dance and songs, grow food and know, where it comes from, improve the land,have small businesses, which care for the environment, recycling, and zero emmissions  and care for the community.. \r\n\r\nOur key objectives involve developing:\r\n1.     enterprise in both individuals and school communities\r\n2.     a connection between the cause and effect of global issues\r\n3.     healthy, active lifestyles to support general health and wellbeing\r\n4.     a 'can do' approach to making things happen in our lives and communities\r\n5.     inclusion for students of all ability levels\r\n6.     exciting 'bigger learning' experiences with real outcomes involving the work of individuals and communities\r\n7.     a sense of our past heritage and of the skills of those who went before us\r\n8.     the learning of a foreign language with a real connection to the country of origin\r\n9.     the linking of confidence, real skills, enterprise and connection to European Citizenship and cultural diversity\r\n10.   innovative, creative teaching and learning experiences with a focus on staff professional development and pupil choice\r\n11.   the use of ICT to link and connect European school communities\r\n12.   motivation, improved competences and confidence in all of our school community stakeholders\r\nThe project is designed to continue the excellent and exciting work of an already established group of ten partner schools (plus one associate partner \u2013 Belarus).   The partnership formed under the Comenius programme and has established a supportive group of stakeholders with different cultural and religions backgrounds who value the work, aims and vision of the group as a whole. There is a strong European Citizenship dimension to our group \u2018thinking\u2019 and whilst the partners all have their own curriculums to deliver we have enjoyed celebrating and exploring our diversity. The challenges faced across the profile of the school group include urban and city challenges and remote rural isolation issues.The schools range from small two teacher rural schools to large multi-stage city schools.The project includes up to 80 teachers / staff and about 500 pupils.\r\nEach school will make a plan for term one in partnership with pupils to take forward the four main skill areas:\r\n    Making Things\r\n       (Making toys, gifts, food, clothes, seasonal produce, art from natural finds, etc  \r\n2.    Growing things linked to Global Eco Work\r\n       (Gardening, nature work and connecting with nature, local and global issues.  Connecting with seasons and seasonal activities.)\r\n3.    Entertaining Ourselves\r\n       (Rediscovering traditional games, songs, dances and hobbies, learning the Greek Alphabet.)\r\n4.    Saving and Trading\r\n       (Bank of Comenius, trading, saving and a reward / value system, Blue Economy  )\r\nThe above plan will be repeated each term with the skill level increasing and connecting with the activities taking place around the project theme and will be referred to as The Four Skills Plan.\r\nThe 7 workshops will give the students the opportunity to exchange their knowledge, work on the topics and grow together into a European community.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA201-001306_7"]]}}, "2AT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "A Tale of many Cities", "Lockerbie Primary School", 79861.0, 8, 8, "Until the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car. Urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low density single family detached houses as the preferred housing option for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people lived from where they worked, shopped and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for efficient transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency.\r\nThrough this project we aim to weigh in with the students vision of how to better the difficulties presented by urban settings of today and how to properly adress the multitude of challenges encountered in order to put these visions into practical use. By letting each partner be responsible for a particular section of the city we further enhance the needs and skills called for in order to make an intercultural teamwork feasible and provide our students with the invaluable lesson that for a project of this magnitude we all have to pull together regardless of cultural and national differencies.\r\nOn a broader scale cooperation between international partners enriches the education system, both for the teachers and for the pupils. Sharing ideas and experience increases the children\u2019s knowledge in order to develop an understanding of the world. Participating in this partnership will broaden pupils\u2019 educational experience and encourage them to interact with their peers across Europe more confidently. With the expanding use of ICT in our schools it is also hoped that pupils will get the opportunity (by participating in the partnership) to enhance their language skills and acquire a vast knowledge of the different cultures spread out across Europe today. Furthermore, the aim to develop links with other schools in Europe, will lead to an exchange of (teaching) materials and ideas.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA201-000698_4"], [2014, "DOC - Docenti oltre i confini\r\n\r\nPercorsi di dialogo, confronto e formazione all'estero per gli operatori dell'Istituto.

The latter offers further differentiation according to the main subjects studied \u2013 Pedagogy, Economics or Sport. It is a well-established school within the local community, which has an international streak: the importance that Foreign Languages are given, as well as the professional profile of the Humanities Course, give our students multicultural and multi-linguistic skills. Over the last few years, the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in a foreign language, CLIL, has been introduced in the Language Course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DOC project proposed by our school has international and multicultural objectives and aims at making these more effective by:\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the teacher\u2019s knowledge of foreign languages (primarily those involved in the CLIL skills), through training and contact with teachers from other countries;\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the teaching staff\u2019s skills through an exchange of views regarding curricular activities and methodology in schools from other countries;\r\n\r\n- reinforcing the international and multi-linguistic culture of the school throughout the various phases of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14 teachers will be involved in the DOC project , of which 10 will be Italian and 4 foreign,  divided as follows:\r\n\r\n- 6 Italian teachers working on a summer training programme; the teachers chosen  (those working on the CLIL area started in the school will have priority) will spend 15 days abroad and go on a full-immersion training course (3 teachers will go to an English-speaking area and 3 to  a French-speaking area) based on the teachers\u2019 personal needs (level of language and subject taught).
