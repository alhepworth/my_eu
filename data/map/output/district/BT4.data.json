Yet, micro and SMEs, which make up 99% of businesses, still lag behind in digital technologies. If the economy is to flourish, micro and SMEs, must develop data skills or risk being uncompetitive.\r\n\r\nThere is an obstacle: today\u2019s entrepreneurship teachers and trainers also face a data skills deficit. The majority entered the workforce before big data existed and there is currently no reliable source of training to help them boost their own skills. In our survey across 28 Local Enterprise Agencies in the Enterprise NI Network, 52% of business advisors said they were completely unaware of the range of data that is available and 70% rated their own knowledge of smart data as poor. (See full report appended). \r\n\r\nTo remedy this situation, Data SET will improve the quality and relevance of entrepreneurship education by improving the ability of VET and HEI policy makers and practitioners to understand, teach and develop smart data, thus providing business owners, early stage entrepreneurs and students with solid smart data skills training which they will use to help grow their businesses.  \r\n\r\nWe will respond to these needs by pursuing the following objectives: \r\n- develop and publish a Guide to Data Skills Development (IO1) to educate entrepreneurship trainers on the current state of data skills and skills building strategies  \r\n- create a smart data skills training model, comprising OERs (IO2) such as curriculum, trainers guide, lesson plans and suggested content and learning exercises\r\n- train the first generation of Data SET Trainers (learning activity) and widely disseminate the OERs to encourage rapid integration of the training into current entrepreneurship and business support provision\r\n- develop and promote an online Data SET course (IO3) to maximise access to the new training and reinforce classroom delivery.\r\n\r\nData SET will involve at least 60 entrepreneurship educators as participants in the testing of these outputs and we will organize a Train the Trainers Learning Activity in Denmark for 14 educators, who will return to their organizations ready to begin training SMEs and early stage entrepreneurs and students in smart data skills. At least 155 representatives of VET organizations providing entrepreneurship education and relevant stakeholders will participate in five multiplier events in Northern Ireland, Ireland, Spain, Denmark and Netherlands. \r\n\r\nAs tangible results of the project, we expect: \r\n-500 entrepreneurship education teachers and trainers download/receive the OERs and use them to understand smart data skills and have effective pedagogic strategies for teaching and assessing them. \r\n-80 entrepreneurship education organizations, principally in VET but also in HE sectors, commit to introducing smart data skills  into their training programme either through direct classroom or small group delivery or by referring  students to the online course.\r\n-30 stakeholder organizations value smart data skills as a key competence within the framework of VET and driver of economic growth and commit to exploring new ways to support and incentivise  organizations who offer training\r\n\r\nOn completion, the project will have made it possible for current and future generations of entrepreneurs to access effective, practical training on generation, management and analysis of digital data as applied to their business model. The long-term result will be improved business growth and higher levels of digital competencies within the small business sector because they will be able to: \r\n- craft and implement integrated data capture activities \r\n- carry out data interpretation and analysis to gain insights into market opportunities, employee performance, revenue streams and customer behaviour and more\r\n- adjust business strategies accordingly\r\nOver the medium term this will manifest itself in improved growth in the local economy as businesses use data-driven insights to innovate, bring out new products and services, and increase productivity overall.  \r\n\r\nAt national and EU  level, we hope for a different impact: a prioritization of data skills education in the field of entrepreneurship education.

This conflict has a high cost:  antisocial and conflictive behaviour impedes the development of the young people involved and affects the wellbeing, education, social and economic progress of other young people and society as a whole.

The elevation of non-formal education methods largely used in international youth works has attracted various kinds of professionals and young people to work in the field of youth. Impactful youth work and sustainable youth organizations needs two key skills domiciled within their organizations which are Advocacy and facilitation skills because youth activities revolves alot around training and advocacy of change for or against status-co or policies. A lot of youth workers and youth leaders in voluntary youth sector are driven by passion and sense of determination to help and make society a better place. But zeal and passion as important as they are in international youth work, they can not replace competence. Youth organizations have conceptualized projects, but only to rely only external professional trainers to carry out the training and facilitations of the trainings. These has ended up in disappointments between what  was expected and the delivery. This arrangement also denies them the opportunity to develop their own skills and the motivation to effectively lead and advocate change or even help upcoming informal groups in their training initiatives. After a recent training project on social inclusion organized by Diversity and Integration Initiatives and the quality of facilitations that were carried out by officers of the organization. There has been overwhelming request from organizations and youth workers to Diversity and Integration Initiatives to put this project together with a view to helping organizations to develop crucial skills of facilitation and advocacy . These skills are so fundamental that not only does it help youth workers , young people and youth leaders in their works at developing internal pool of facilitators and advocates but it is also the foundational skills for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ability to effectively explain your ideas to others for comprehension which you get in facilitation and ability to knock on doors of barriers persistently without fear of rejection with passion which is a bedrock skill of advocacy.
