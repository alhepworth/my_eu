Until recently pupils in Scotland only began learning a second language in the last three years of primary school.   The Scottish Government has now begun a new 1+2 Languages initiative which aims, by 2020, to have a second language embedded in classroom practice for all pupils from P1-P7 and to have a third language taught from P5-P7.   Having previously relied on MLPS trained teachers or Modern Foreign Languages specialists to deliver French, the school now has a need to improve the language skills of as many teachers as possible and to learn new methodologies and pedagogies for delivering the policy. \r\n\r\nThe six participants are all staff at Insch School   Three of the six are class teachers teaching at different levels of the Scottish curriculum:  Early, First and Second.  Of the other three, two are specialist teachers in PE and Additional Support for Learning and the third is a Pupil Support Assistant.  All of the latter work across all levels and areas of the school.\r\n\r\nThe staff all want to attend the Full Immersion Course provided by LFEE in France  as part of a larger project to develop language teaching and global citizenship in the school and cluster.  They would like to attend the course in order to improve their language skills , subject knowledge and confidence to teach pupils and to help train their colleagues.  They would also like to get a deeper understanding of French culture and through the e-twinning project be able to promote the European dimension and internationalism to the school and community.\r\n\r\nHaving the participants attend the course will fulfil several needs of the school and cluster and impact on our pupils and their families as well as colleagues  in the school, cluster and local authority.    Firstly it will provide us with a core group of staff who have received quality training in a relevant context and feel confident and enthusiastic. reasons. The participants will plan and lead workshops for the whole staff, parents and cluster colleagues to share any strategies and resources gained on the course.  In addition, quality up-to-date language-teaching materials are currently scarce in our school.  The plan is to collect a bank of resources that will be available to the school staff and cluster colleagues.   Finally,  there is a need to develop digital literacy and ICT in all subjects of the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nAs the Scottish government's 1+2 Languages initiative is a major priority across the country, it will feature in our school's improvement plans for several years to come.  The participants hope to be able to contribute to the implementation of this policy in our school, cluster and authority.  They also hope to forge long-term links with schools  in other European countries and to develop cooperation between pupils and teachers.", "http://www.inschschool.co.uk", "Insch School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036235_coordinator"]]}}}}
