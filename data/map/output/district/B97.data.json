OUR GROUP CONSISTS OF TEACHERS WHO ARE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING OUR LANGUAGE COMPETENCE AND OUR ABILITY TO FOSTER OUR STUDENTS' MOTIVATION( THROUGH METHODOLOGICAL UPDATINGS AND STUDY VISITS TO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCES WITH STAFF FROM ALL EUROPE) AND BROADEN OUR METHODOLOGICAL GUIDELINES BY WIDENING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF CLIL METHODOLOGY TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF ICT AND COLLABORATIVE WORK IN THE CLASSROOM (VIA SPECIFIC COURSES AND JOB-SHADOWINGS). IN THE NEARBY FUTURE MORE TEACHERS WILL GRADUALLY BECOME PART OF OUR PROJECT.  OUR SCHOOL IS LOCATED IN TOMELLOSO, CIUDAD REAL, SPAIN. THIS SMALL TOWN IN THE CENTER OF SPAIN HAS A POPULATION OF AROUND 38,000 PEOPLE. ITS ECONOMY IS BASED ON AGRICULTURE (SPECIALLY WINE PRODUCTION) AND INDUSTRY. THE INHABITANTS IN TOMELLOSO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS A FRIENDLY AND AMBITIOUS PEOPLE, SO BUSINESS IN TOMELLOSO IS MAINLY LOCAL AND FAMILY BUSINESS. IN THIS PERIOD CHARACTERISED BY THE ECONOMICAL CRISIS IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH A HIGH LEVEL COMPETITIVE EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORK.  OUR AIREN SECONDARY SCHOOL IS WIDELY KNOWN FOR OUR EFFORT TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH AN OVERALL EDUCATION WHICH ENABLES THEM TO SUCCESSFULLY APPROACH TO VERY DIFFERENT CAREERS. OUR MAIN AIM IS TO ACHIEVE A GOOD QUALITY STANDARD OF EDUCATION. FOR THAT PURPOSE WE DECIDED TO JOIN, AMONG OTHERS, A VERY SPECIAL PROGRAMME OF BILINGUALISM. THIS PROJECT WHICH WE ARE DEVELOPING AT OUR SCHOOL IS QUITE A CHALLENGING PROGRAMME, WHEREBY STUDENTS ARE BEING TAUGHT SOME SUBJECTS IN ENGLISH AND SOME IN FRENCH. BESIDES, OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEARN ITALIAN AS WELL AS GERMAN IN THE AFTERNOON. WE ALSO CATER FOR DIVERSITY IN OUR REINFORCEMENT PROGRAMME IN THE AFTERNOON, INCLUDING SUBJECTS SUCH AS SPANISH, COMPUTER SCIENCE, ENGLISH, MATHS OR GRAPHIC ARTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LATTER REINFORCEMENT PROGRAM HAVE TEMPORARILY BEEN PUT OFF THIS SCHOOL YEAR FOR ORGANISATIONAL REASONS FAR BEYOND OURSELVES.  THE MOTIVATING LINGUISTIC ACTIVITIES AROUND IN OUR SCHOOL ARE GIVING OUR STUDENTS THE CHANCE TO COPE WITH THE SECOND LANGUAGE IN REAL SITUATIONS. THEREFORE, THEY START TO THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE AS SOMETHING USEFUL AND THIS FACT IS INCREASING OUR STUDENTS\u2019 INTEREST IN LEARNING AND COMMUNICATING IN A LANGUAGE WHICH IS NOT THEIR OWN MOTHER TONGUE. THUS, WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO CREATE MORE OPEN-MINDED CITIZENS WHO ARE WELL PREPARED AND EDUCATED TO LIVE A WORLD FEATURED BY CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND GLOBALISATION. IT IS SELF-EVIDENT THAT THE EUROPEAN DIMENSION IS PRESENT IN EVERY SCHOOL ACTIVITY. IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THIS IDEA WE HAVE DEVELOPED THIS COMMON TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMME FOR TWO YEARS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES, WHICH IN THE LONG TERM WILL ENHANCE OUR TEACHERS' ABILITIES AND, HENCE, THOSE OF ALL OUR STUDENTS.", "http://www.st-augsutines.worcs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024013_1"]]}}}}
