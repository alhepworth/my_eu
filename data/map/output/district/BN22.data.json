It is also essential that the students realize the benefits of gaining work experience abroad. They will be discovering and analysing a new culture through immersion and a quality support program and encountering local young people through European partners which will help them acquire intercultural experience and behaviour essential to their ultimate satisfaction. They need to master behaviour codes and language registers as well gain self-confidence in the work environment. The various beneficial professional, linguistic, cultural, professional, and personal factors make this an enriching experience that reinforces their skills and ensures their professional success. After two successful projects (2013-2014 and 2015/2017), the program would like to lean away from expertise to focus more on exchanges and European mobility in order to portray an attractive and enriching experience while using an international approach in teaching and educational practices.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 13 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organisations in different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities.

This is a continuation of the development of the action plan that the international mobility service today offers its services and collaboration in the implementation of this action in the service of the 155 Local Missions (4489 employees). \r\nTo meet the different needs identified among professionals, the international mobility department wants to develop a training course of a week abroad that combines two aspects; language instruction and participation in professional development activities to meet four objectives: \r\n- European dimension: broaden its vision and professional practices: \r\nTraining abroad is an enriching and educational experience for the participants themselves, but not only. Indeed, professional practices of the participants are diversified and enriched by best practices and know-how developed abroad. On a more global level, the confrontation with new approaches and methodologies in an unfamiliar professional context facilitates questioning practices and promotes a fresh look at their craft. \r\n- the development of language skills: \r\nInsufficient language skills, real or perceived, deters many personnel from abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed among employees who have less systematically used to practice a foreign language in their professional environment. It is therefore desecrated learning foreign languages so that it is not an end in itself but just a vector in the service of access to the culture they carry. Learning foreign languages can not be confined to merely transmitting linguistic knowledge, but must be complemented by experience and cultural knowledge. It is in this light that the Consortium in collaboration with partners ensures the implementation of language courses integrating a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, language training based on the daily realities). \r\n- Developers of the network of mobility: \r\nMobility is rarely considered a professionalizing experience of strategic objectives service. A variety of means is available yet to value the developers of mobility and action: There is no doubt that it is on the implementation of youth mobility as the impact of personal mobility is most visible. Indeed, participants employees are better equipped to advise young people who want to go on the move Thanks to the time spent in a foreign country (language school, cross-cultural experience, meet different partners (job center, youth hostel. ..)), professionals are more familiar with the specifics and partners can refer finer young people to the most relevant foreign devices and programs. \r\nThus, the training of professional social integration networks can meet the following innovations: \r\n- to optimize answers for young people: \r\nThe Consortium has always had in mind the need to better tailor benefits for different categories of audiences, but this objective to be achieved requires to implement actions to support mobilized for employment counsellors and social and professional integration. These guidelines form the basis of an intervention that in the adaptation perspective and improves the quality of service for the public in search of a job. \r\n- a better understanding of transnational mobility actions to provide more opportunities for access to quality training at any time of life they accompany the public in order to promote their personal and professional development in the idea of \"Work First \" \r\n- Encouraging adaptation to the needs of the territories through a local presence strengthened AMILAURA services, with the development of employment opportunities, notably in the transnational space, by supporting geographic mobility. \r\n- Enhance the quality of service provision for young people and contribute to improving the transparency of the supply of services linked to mobility \r\n- The professionalization of counsellors so that they can cope with a wide range of situations.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. The Region itself is also an active partner in the project: its involvement since our foundation, \u201cguarantees\u201d the quality of our services and will help us to enlarge still further our partnership networks to other teaching organizations or local authorities.

However, it suffers from difficulties to integrate in the local companies a significant portion of its population:  younger, less graduated and overall more impacted by unemployment than the average Paris suburb population. The major challenge is therefore to facilitate to this local population the access to the jobs opportunities generated by this dynamic labor pool.Studies managed by the \u201cGIP Emploi Roissy\u201d and its partners have identified 4 structuring professional sectors able to generate jobs: logistics & transport, tourism related to business trips, international business and airport services. For these sectors, jobs related to customer interaction are highly important and able to generate professional opportunitiesIn order to get access to these jobs, due to the international context of this area, it requires foreign languages knowledges and the ability to work in a multicultural environment.To manage this specific challenge, the \u201cGIP Emploi Roissy \u201cis leading a dedicated consortium of 4 structures specialized in supporting Job seekers.

With this in mind, IThe CONSORTIUM offers today its services and collaboration in order to set up this action.\r\nIn order to answer the professionals\u2019 different needs, The CONSORTIUM wishes to develop one-week training abroad  which will involve 2 aspects : some language tuition and some professional activities. This training is set up to achieve 4 objectives:\r\n\r\n- A European dimension in order to widen vision and professional practice :\r\nA training abroad represents a fulfiling experience for the candidates getting involved. Their professional practice will become diversified thanks to what they learned abroad. On a wider point of view, new professional visions and methods will help the candidate to see their career differently.\r\n\r\n- the development of linguistic skills:\r\nA poor linguistic level can put off a lot of people going abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed by professionals who are not used to speak a foreign language at work. Therefore we need to focus on making the learning of foreign languages a way to access to different cultures and to the mobility. Also the learning of languages must be completed  by experiences and cultural knowledges. It is with this in mind that The CONSORTIUM and its partners will set up some linguistic tuition involving a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, training on expressions used on a daily basis).\r\n\r\n- Set up a network of actors engaged in mobility projects:\r\nMobility is not enough considered as a professionalising experience. Many ways are however available to put forward actors promoting the mobility and their action : it is obvious that the impact of the professionals\u2019 mobility will be seen through the mobilities of young people. Indeed, partners getting involved will have a better knowledge to advise young people who wish to go abroad thanks to their own experience in a foreign country (language school, intercultural experiences, meeting with various partners (job center, youth hostels...)) , the professionals will know each partner better and will be able to guide youngsters towards programs that are suitable to their requirements. \r\n\r\nThis way, the training of professionals within the social integration network will answer to the following innovations:\r\n- towards an optimisation of answers for young people:\r\nThe CONSORTIUM has always in mind to adapt its services to its public. But to reach this goal, actions need to be put in place to help advisers but also any actors getting involved in the mobility and in the social and professional integration.

The targeted public is students in healthcare. We want to give them an International experience on their CV, which will be a great asset for their professional future and recruitment\r\n\r\nThe Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon, the GIPAL, 9 French vocational high schools and more than 35 receiving partners in Europe are involved in that project. Motivation and involvement of all them show their willingness to work in team and share skills and practices. It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus and a new dynamism in the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Reiterating this initiative, we confirm our commitment to international mobility of young people and staff with the support of Erasmus Program\r\n\r\nThis innovative consortium reflects the variety of our Acad\u00e9mie with a representative panel of 9 schools in the field of healthcare.

It also aims at strengthening the european dimension of this Baccalaur\u00e9at which needs to improve its image and which hasn\u2019t developed any motilities so far. This internship abroad will give an international dimension to the participants\u2019 CV, a genuine added value when they look for a job in the near future. Within two years 68 staff members & 196 students aged 16-18 will work in 13 European countries. These students will be selected on their motivation to invest themselves in their formation. They will receive a linguistic and cultural preparation, which will be evaluated by CERL test on OLS\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their EU recommendations. All of them are eager to discover new cultural and professional horizons. We have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving company lists, this is a real asset because it will create an efficient partnership network and give a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the local and European scenes\r\nThe content of the working program has been agreed on by all the partners and they are committed to respect the stages of the project: selection and common preparation of the participants, mobility and internship and finally evaluation and sharing of the impacts and results. These stages will imply a vast panel of people: staff, vocational schools, companies, academic authorities, families, associations, consulates, language assistants in France but also abroad. Each of these step is essential so that the impact felt by all of actors is in line with initial objectives\r\n\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly clear. The GIPAL carries the project. The Acad\u00e9mie manages the project with the members of the consortium. The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the participants.

The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and knowledge and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills of the teachers. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2018-2020.

With this in mind, IPM offers today its services and collaboration in order to set up this action.In order to answer the professionals\u2019 different needs, IPM platform wishes to develop one-week training abroad  which will involve 2 aspects : some language tuition and some professional activities. This training is set up to achieve 4 objectives:- A European dimension in order to widen vision and professional practice :A training abroad represents a fulfiling experience for the candidates getting involved. Their professional practice will become diversified thanks to what they learned abroad. On a wider point of view, new professional visions and methods will help the candidate to see their career differently.- the development of linguistic skills:A poor linguistic level can put off a lot of people going abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed by professionals who are not used to speak a foreign language at work. Therefore we need to focus on making the learning of foreign languages a way to access to different cultures and to the mobility. Also the learning of languages must be completed  by experiences and cultural knowledges. It is with this in mind that IPM and its partners will set up some linguistic tuition involving a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, training on expressions used on a daily basis).- Set up a network of actors engaged in mobility projects:Mobility is not enough considered as a professionalising experience. Many ways are however available to put forward actors promoting the mobility and their action : it is obvious that the impact of the professionals\u2019 mobility will be seen through the mobilities of young people. Indeed, partners getting involved will have a better knowledge to advise young people who wish to go abroad thanks to their own experience in a foreign country (language school, intercultural experiences, meeting with various partners (job center, youth hostels...)) , the professionals will know each partner better and will be able to guide youngsters towards programs that are suitable to their requirements. This way, the training of professionals within the social integration network will answer to the following innovations:- towards an optimisation of answers for young people:IPM has always in mind to adapt its services to its public. But to reach this goal, actions need to be put in place to help advisers but also any actors getting involved in the mobility and in the social and professional integration. These actions represent the foundation of an intervention addressed to a public looking for a job, with the perspective of improving the quality of service. - better understanding of the actions of international mobility to offer more access to continued quality training to the public they deal with in order to maximise their personal and profesisonal development within the concept \"work First\"- Maximise the tailoring of the territories\u2019 needs through the strong set up of IPM services, with a development of work opportunities, transnationnally particularly, with the support of geographic mobility.- Stenghten the quality of the services addressed to young people and contribute to improve the transparency of the services related to mobility.- Professionalising advisers so they can face any type of situations.

All this makes it difficult to cope with the mobility program because the adaptability abroad is very poor. The consequences are: difficulties to take part in selling and social activities, to communicate with the staff and customers as well as with the host family due to the very poor English.\r\nThe European section members can change along the three school years.

Indeed, at the origin of our initiative to apply for Leonardo fundings, the section \" Administration\" was the only one to be concerned. Then, gradually, the students having benefited from these work placements in England showed a great interest among the other students from the school. Hence, a great demand from the students from the section MRCU arose to benefit from the work placements abroad in the same way. Therefore, we decided to enlarge our work placement opportunities abroad (to Italy) and to involve students from the section MRCU as well. We are strengthening our partnership with Tempo Libero in Italy in the region of the Garda Lake where the tourist and sales business is thriving. The work placements are therefore suitable for our students from the section MRCU. These 3-week placements will involve 10 students in my 2017, precisely at the beginning of the tourist season.

As the years pass, we realize that these work placements abroad have a strong and positive impact on our students: some of them returned to visit their host families during the summer, others had the opportunity to carry out another working period within their company.   Another one enrolled on a Btech HND in International Trade. We also have a former student, now in BTS HND who is applying for a work placement in Great Britain. In September 2016, The team of teachers involved in the project Erasmus has enlarged with the involvement of a new DNL teacher in sales techniques, a math teacher having a good command of Italian and an extensive knowledge of the Italian culture and a native Spanish teacher.Thanks to this new Spanish teacher we will have the opportunity to develop two projects in Spain : -We got in touch with Mrs Marisa Cano, the manager of an association of shopkeepers in Murcia \u00ab Comerciantes Plater\u00eda y Traper\u00eda \u00bb which has close links with the Murcia shopping area MUAC (Murcia \u00e1rea comercial).

This teacher seems to be highly interested to work with us next year in a mutual collaboration on the platform e-tweening. These projects are essential if we want to perpetuate our willingness to With the aim to reach an efficient organization the teachers interact with each other but also specialize in one of the 3 projects (England, Italy and the new emerging one, Spain). It means :- Working closely with the existing partners : Breakaway and Tempo Libero for the preparation of the stays in England and Italy (accommodation , work placements, assessment grids, objectives, Skype discussions )- taking part in the likely creation of a second European section in MRCU (sales techniques and reception skills).- Developing and fostering cultural and language projects within the school inherent to each country- Initiating the two recent projects in Spain (partnership with a high school near Barcelona and cooperation with an association of shopkeepers in Murcia).This collaboration leads to a better anticipation of the mobility which will encourage thestudents' motivation for this experience abroad and will have an incidence on their education as they feel valued.

This lack of maturity and the lower educational level make it difficult to select the students because of their incapacity to adapt abroad. Students find it hard to live with a host family.

The entire educational team is in charge of training to help broaden the European exposure. The vocational part of the program proposes selling situations ; the English assistant plays an important role in this. The individual training course is used as individual help. Each student may receive personal help in making their mobility report. The aim is to develop their capacity to adapt, to encourage the youth to be more mobile, to improve their language skills and make them more confident.

It is more and more common for retailers to conduct their job interview in English. Therefore it has become an absolute necessity to master the different steps of selling in that language. Furthermore, we will raise awareness to sustainable development among the students involved in the mobility. Indeed, most of them will fulfill their training period in charity shops, which is why we fostered thoughts on that subject. The fair trade shops also known as charity shops collect donations from people and deal with the sales of these products to the benefit of the school association : AVEC (association meant to enhance the commercial learning).These shops are very popular in England. We wish to show our pupils the idea of charity shops, a concept which starts to develop in France. The goal is to adapt that innovative concept to our school. Our students will have to take charge of surveys and enquiries both in France and in England in order to measure the feasiblity of the plan. Back in France, the final-year students will have to convey the gathered information to the second-year students and mentor them. The possible financial benefits will be donated to an organisation as it is the way in the British charity shops.After many unsuccessful attempts we have managed to set up a link that seems to be promising with the Eastbourne Sussex Downs College. Our contact (on site) has suggested to welcome our pupils on a-2-afternoon basis according to the schedule of the school at that time of year.There will be 2 departures for students in their final year of BTEC. The first group will go from 3rd march to 3rd april 2017 whereas the second will be in Eastbourne from 16th March to 16th April 2018.

Their english level will be assessed thanks to an interview led both  by teachers and Mrs CHEVALLIER in charge of the placement agency we work with.On site, a 2-teacher-team will make sure everything is all right all through the first and last weeks but also the in-between weekend in order to steer the outings and make pupils organise the various cultural activities so that a team spirit will arise. The final training evaluations being part of the BTEC exam  will have to be conducted by both an english teacher and a sales teacher.Back in France, all of the students will have gained greater independence and self-confidence  which will allow them to undertake studies no longer according to the distance but rather in agreement with their future professional career.We wish to create a dynamic within the school and thus we plan on opening a european section in the \u201cARCU\u201d (welcome and reception of customers) BTEC.

We will still maintain and pursue last year project which consisted in including 8 students from the speciality \"sales techniques and reception skills\". But the idea of this project is to diversify geographically the work placement opportunities. For various reasons, cited upstream in the project, we have selected Italy , more precisely Lombardy, the region around the lake Garda, where tourism and shops are booming. For this first experience in Italy, we will suggest this destination to the students from the section \" sales technique and reception skills\", whereas the students from the section Administration, requiring a denser and more precise professional vocabulary will go to England as they already have a quite good command of English in the administration field . Nevertheless, the students heading for Italy will have the opportunity to attend courses of basic Italian, from September up to their departure for Italy. The latter will be accomodated in a youth hostel; Indeed, it will be easier to communicate with young people there in English,Italian or Spanish and even to improve  these foreign languages. There will be a French teacher on the spot all through the period, in England, as well as in Italy.

Indeed, we had already done this task in the previous years with Breakaway. Regarding the evaluation of the training period in Italy we have decided on a common evaluation in collaboration with a member of Tempo Libero.  Indeed, as the French accompanying teacher doesn't speak Italian it is recommended that a member of Tempo Libero , speaking French, should assist the French teacher  with the evaluation of the student. The interest of this willingness to expand to Italy is,  in the first place,  that this new destination brings a note of originality to the project and to our school. It is definitely more commonplace and less troublesome to send our students to England (as they speak this foreign language and proximity of the country ).

In this way, for several years we have been receiving Slovakian, Italianand Portuguese pupils who we accompany throughout their work placement.Working in close collaboration with colleagues in our establishment who successfully coordinate Comenius has allowed us todevelop partnerships with the hotel establishments hosting these ongoing programmes. We are therefore now in a position to offerour pupils the chance to go to Belgium, Portugal, England, Romania, Italy and Spain. All of this collaboration equally allows us tooffer our pupils hotel establishments which are more appropriate for the skills expected in their assessment booklets for their workbasedtraining period. Thus we now offer work placements for pupils with the \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel\u201d, but also to those withthe \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at technologique\u201d.This mobility programme is vital to us in order to pursue our politics of opening up to Europe. It allows us to place pupils abroad inexcellent conditions, all the while consolidating their professional skills, giving them professional experience and allowing them touse a foreign language daily, without forgetting providing them with an extremely enriching human experience.We intend to open this possibility of mobility to pupils of the final year of Vocational high school \" Hotel business \" for their autumn internship in the field of the accommodation.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA116-023039_2"], [2016, "Deep Immersion in the United Kingdom 16-18", "Breakaway Agency Limited", 17346.0, 2, 2, "DIUK 16-18 : Deep Immersion  in the United Kingdom is Jules Siegfried Vocational highschool project for the period going from June 2015 to June 2017.This project concerns students preparing their vocational Baccalaureate in Digital Electronic Systems and studying in the European section and also students in Industrial Design and in Machining Technician classes.
