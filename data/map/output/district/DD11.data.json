Getting the right information is complex and must consider all alternatives and special factors like time and cost related user preferences, number of hops, and other. Moreover, information about dynamic conditions (delays, traffic, weather) that affect the trip are also necessary for the user on time. Existing systems are providing such services at a single transport level, but the combination of multi-level (urban and interurban) information at wider scale and the delivery of dynamic personalized data has not been addressed. Complexity arises when either city/nation or transport network system boundaries have to be crossed, to form a path that includes destinations, intermediaries, transit points, types of moves and changes of transport mode. This project aims to co-ordinate systems which provide journey planner services to cooperate and form complex answers, produce real-time personalized information and deliver it at crucial points during the trip. The project will: -Design/implement a network of interconnected Journey Planner systems to combine urban and Long-Distance Transport information services. This will be a Wide-Scale Journey Planner that unifies multimodal transport data and provides a one-stop-shop for complex answers combining all involved means. -Define a uniform information delivery service with personalized features via multiple devices for information push and pull. Personalisation will be achieved with rule-based processing of the data based on a trip cycle model and personal editable preferences. -Combine information delivery with transactioning for personalized needs including booking &amp; payment, definition of alert rules and profiles for automated suggestions on selected trips and frequent traveler profiles. -Demonstrate the service.

As well as this, it is vital the staff and children have an awareness and an understanding of Spanish culture to allow them to make links with their own culture and essentially have an appreciation of other global citizens. The immersion course would provide a deep understanding of Spanish culture and language as well as provide practitioners with teaching resources in order to effectively deliver quality Spanish. \r\n\r\nIt would therefore be the hope that we not only meet the Scottish Government's target, but inspire children to enjoy learning a new language, utilising it throughout the school on a daily basis.

TRUE is underpinned by science excellence in the natural and social sciences, and humanities. The main aim of TRUE is to identify and enable transition paths to realise successful legume-supported production systems and agri-feed and -food chains. This is achieved via: a true multi-actor approach that balances environmental, economic- and social-securities by minimising environmental impact; optimising diversity and resilience in commercial and environmental terms throughout the supply chain; and delivery of excellent nutrition to ensure the highest possible states of health and wellbeing for people and animals. TRUE will achieve this using a series of 15 farm networks and 7 supply chain focused innovation Case Studies to characterise key mechanisms and associated ecosystem services indicators. This will empower the production of popular and novel legume-based products on the basis of improved market perspectives and capabilities, including short supply chains. Advanced mathematical approaches using Life Cycle Analysis, and socioeconomic and multi-attribute modelling will create unique Decision Support Tools to identify optimal transition paths to ensure legume supported systems are profitable from \u2018the push\u2019, of production, to \u2018the pull\u2019 of upstream supply chains, markets and consumers.

As the uptake for Spanish courses has increased over the years and with the introduction of the Modern Languages 1+2 approach in Scotland, educational bodies are encouraging staff to develop professionally in this area and this would be an opportunity to help implementing long term benefits in the school I work in. For instance, the teaching of Spanish would develop students' cultural awareness and understanding of another European country, it would benefit high-achieving students in terms of National Qualifications but the teaching of Spanish would also benefit students who would prefer continuing their education through a vocational course as they would be provided with skills for learning, life, and work.
