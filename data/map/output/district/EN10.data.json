Learners with SEN frequently leave school with few qualifications and are much more likely to become unemployed or economically inactive. The European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education (2013) formulated recommendations relating to the four \u201cpatterns of successful practice\u201d that are likely to improve VET system effectiveness and the transition to employment of learners with SEN. These patterns focus on the perspectives and roles of key stakeholders within VET, namely (1) head teachers/managers of VET organisations (management pattern); (2) teachers/trainers/support staff (VET pattern); (3) SEN learners (learners\u2019 pattern); and (4) current and future employers/labour market representatives (labour market pattern). \r\n\r\nNowadays, VET managers are challenged daily to implement innovative and tailored solutions targeting SEN learners. At the same time, VET educators are requested to design learning activities in cooperation with companies to meet the labour market requirements.  To face this reality, participating organisations in HANDSON project \u2013 United Kingdom, Cyprus, Greece, Finland, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden - have expressed common difficulties to face these challenges and recognise the importance of having new approaches and tools to improve their VET and WBL practices in order to increase out work placement opportunities for SEN learners.\r\n\r\nIn this frame, HANDSON is designed in response to such evidence. It aims to develop an inclusive production-based learning model and innovative didactic resources to support SEN learners to complete VET cycles and successfully transit into the labour market. To achieve this, the following objectives are defined:\r\n- to undertake an extended national and Pan-European study and map success factors related with SEN and production schools in order to define the key elements to be included in the model;\r\n- to develop a set of multilingual innovative approaches and ICT-based didactic resources to support the efficient implementation of the model;\r\n- to create local workshops and apps for each one of the vocational areas target in each country, in line with future employers\u2019 needs and job opportunities;\r\n- to do practical implementation, testing, validation and fine-tuning with end-users and final beneficiaries during the pilot trails;\r\n- to mobilise a multi-disciplinary board of experts to participate in developments and provide legitimacy to the foreseen outputs;\r\n- to boost peer learning, exchange of experiences and continuous professional development of staff participating in the short-term joint staff training even;\r\n- to engage associated partners, key-stakeholders and carried out dissemination and exploitation actions including the multiplier events in all participating countries, ensuring networking opportunities and a smooth appropriation and sustainability of the project and its outputs.\r\n\r\nHANDSON will provides a set of tangible products for better support VET managers, educators, SEN learners and employers: a tailored inclusive production-based learning model, and supportive didactic resources - eManual, eKit, digital learning space and app generator. The project will benefit from the direct participation of 34 educators, 80 SEN learners and 72 key-stakeholders (VET managers, employers, experts) in activities related with the development of the outputs, including research, contents development, piloting, external validation. Moreover, 300 VET providers, educators, schools, universities, associations supporting SEN, municipalities, chambers of commerce, employers, employers\u2019 associations, public bodies, decision and policy makers, will attend the eight multiplier events in partners\u2019 countries. And more than 1000 stakeholders across Europe will be reached through the project dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nHANDSON envisages to become a reference innovative model offering a successful path to improve VET system effectiveness, promote even more inclusive education and WBL programmes, and in this way to enhance the transition to employment of learners with SEN. We strong believe that across Europe, other VET providers, but also adult provides, schools, high educations, institutions hosting SEN people and employers with SEN workers will felt inspired and interested in appropriate the project outputs. In addition, decision and policy-makers will also be invited to have a close look into HANDSON outcomes and challenges to mainstream at national level in specific initiatives and programmes.", "http://www.hrc.ac.uk", "Hertford Regional College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048117_coordinator"], [2017, "Broaden your World", "Hertford Regional College", 98894.0, 12, 18, "The importance of competences obtained from the international mobility period is increasing in the current employment markets. The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems. We have new partner schools or organizations in Italy, Poland, Malta and Sweden.  We will be offering the possibility of participating in international mobility for a larger target group as well, as we include also students and staff of Adult learning and recently graduated students.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. \r\n\r\nStaff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy. This project increases the reciprocal co-operation and develops both the sending and the receiving VET institution. After the mobility periods, participants will write a report which will be used with the future international co-operation and dissemination both inside and outside of the organization. Teachers will share their development ideas also at the feedback and evaluation discussion. Student blogs and travel reports will be published at our public website to strengthen the visibility of our international activities and our image.", "http://www.hrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034402_4"], [2015, "MOVE - merkonomien ja datanomien liikkuvuutta lis\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4ss\u00e4", "Hertford Regional College", 35452.0, 8, 13, "The skills obtained during exchange periods in foreign countries (on-the-job learning and student exchange) are increasingly more important in today's working life. According to the research conducted by the European Comission, released in 2014, HE students, who had participated in an exchange program aborad had more chances obtain a work placement and they we less likely to be unemployed after graduating. This analogy can be applied also to VET education. \r\n\r\nExchange periods in a foreign country enhance the students' self-imposed abilites in independent work and an entrepreneur-like way of working, they, furthermore, give a larger perspective in working life, enlarge networks and improve students' language skills. Abilities to work in a multicultural environment get better, since the experience abroad enhances the students' self confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help to recognise their own strengths and weaknesses. This ensures better employment and helps in reaching our college's vision, which is to educate competent professionals of ICT and business and administration to the needs of the Helsinki metropolitan area. \r\n\r\nWith this mobility project we want to ensure a possibility to experience internationality also for the students, who need more encouragement and support in their studies. A period aborad can be a life-changing experience, which opens the student's horizons to new possibilities that he/she did was not aware of before. Apart from our students of business and administration we also want to focus on our students of ICT in order to improve their graduation and empower them. Our task is to ensure they will continue to work after graduation or continue in further education. We also take into consideration the new curricula that include even longer on-the-job learning periods. That is also one of the reasons, we are applying for more funding. \r\n\r\nWith the help of our foreign partners we want to learn new practices and pedagogical models. In the modern working life a project-like way of working is ever more common and that is why we want to develop a model of project learning in our education, which we already have to some extent carried out with the Scrum model for project learning in ICT teaching, where the students form project groups and they work independently while the teacher mainly coaches them in probelmatic situations, but the learning is mostly spontaneous. We will seek to improve our collaboration in the field of project learningf with our new project parter from Ludwigshafen, Germany and on-the-job learning periods in the field of game industry with our Irish partner BCFE. \r\n\r\nThe students have normally two on-the-job learning periods during their studies, the first lasts 10 weeks and the second longer, in most cases one semester. We send our students for their exchange periods for 6 weeks, which suits better our German partners, who mostly offer teaching in the dual model. We will agree on the time frame with the partners well in advance. The partner school offers support for the student during the on-the-job learning period aborad, if needed. The teacher responsible for the on-the-job learning period keeps in contact with the student and the work place. The teacher visits the work places for councelling and on-the-job evaluation. During the same time the teacher can get to acquainted with other work places depending on how many students there are to visit. The aim is to demonstrate and evaluate the students' skills in the work place abroad in most cases as per the ECVET model. \r\n\r\nOur staff has the possibility to participate on a job shadowing -period in a partner school. During the period they will follow a foreign colleague's work, such as guidance, teaching, work life cooperation and student administration and they discuss about different practices. Teachers can, if possible, combine their job shadowing trip to an on-the-job evaluation visit. The students will benefit from the staff's job shadowing periods indirectly as the new methods will inspire the students and the school staff will have a more positive outlook on internationality and they will encourage students to go abroad, too.\r\n\r\nThe college's aim is to increase international activities as per the strategy. The project will increase reciprocity and further develop both the sending and the receiving organisation. After the period the participants will write a report, which will be used in dissemination both inside the college and externally. Teachers and experts will tell about ideas on how to improve our activities. Blogs written by our students while abroad will be tagged to the school's website and on social media. In this way we will promote all international activities and improve our brand as an international college. We will also disseminate our international activities to pupils on 9. grade in comprehensive schools and enlarge our target groups.", "http://www.hrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008891_3"]]}}, "6GD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "LET'S DREAM BIG", "Renegade Talent", 16609.0, 2, 2, "This project is a bilateral exchange by an informal group of young people Renegade Talent  from London UK and a public body from Spain Xunta de Galicia.
