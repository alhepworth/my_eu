In Africa, the unpredictable blood use, severe blood shortages and difficulties in reaching remote hospitals means that research from wealthy countries may not apply to transfusion services in Africa. Therefore if African countries are to improve their blood transfusion services they need to generate their own evidence.\n\nAfrica\u2019s transfusion professionals have a wealth of technical expertise but almost no research experience. Several European institutions have expertise in building research capacity among health professionals in Africa. This project will coordinate EU and African collaborations to transfer research skills to the African partners. EU partners will benefit by enhancing their own blood transfusion research skills. To do this we will support three research training schemes (PhD, under/post graduates, in-service) in each of two African partner transfusion services. All partners will contribute to disseminating information about the project to both academic and non-academic audiences, promoting the uptake of research into policy and practice and in seeking long-term support for building transfusion research capacity in Africa.

In this framework,  the project is born from a new network of schools (ITC \u2018CESARE BATTISTI\u2019 , Fano ;  IIS \u2018LUIGI DONATI\u2019 , Fossombrone; - IIS \u2018NEBBIA-EINSTEIN\u2019 , Loreto;  ITCG \u2018PIETRO CUPPARI\u2019 , Jesi  - IIS \u2018 FILELFO\u2019 , Tolentino) wishing to test ways of territorial and international  cooperation about the development of staff and learners competences. The beneficiaries of  biennial learners mobility are 130 students attending the fourth and fifth classes of the following fields of study: Economic, Social, Food and Wine, Hospitality and Tourism. Mobility will last five weeks, and will be placed within an educational path that aims to develop: - linguistic knowledge; -  professional  and transversal competences, required to operators of the tourism industry; - the sense of European citizenship and intercultural openness ; - self-knowledge through processes of self-analysis and strengthening of personality thanks to the management of new situations that require flexibility, responsibility and problem solving attitude. ECVET methodologies  will be used for assessing learning outcomes in apprenticeship. The project will involve 10 staff members too. Mobility will last two weeks and will aim: to promote -through exchange and sharing of experiences- teaching methodologies useful to internationalize the curriculum of the students; to create the foundation for future exchanges and activities among Italian schools and Italian and foreign partners and companies; to collect information about the different dual systems; strengthen language  competences and project management skills to develop further opportunities for mobility. The selected countries of destination are Czech Republic, UK, Spain, France, Germany. They refer to different cultural and tourist contexts, offering the possibility of a complex reflection by participants. This reflection will be reported and then transferred after the return, both in schools net and among the consortium partners. As for the impact, the project can develop its effects within a territorial framework that is mature to welcome the strengthening of skills of young people into account of: - the consolidation of other economic sectors; - the dissemination of knowledge that operate within partnerships and networks is the only winning option for businesses and professionals in the territory. This also allowed the identification of suitable Consortium partners to provide guidance with complementary points of view on the real needs of the area and training needs in the tourism sector: intermediary bodies ( Camera di Commercio e Provincia di Pesaro Urbino, Fano Solidale); entities active in the field of initial and lifelong  training of young people and entrepreneurs in trade, tourism and services sectors (Formaconf - Consortium for Training and Employment, sponsored by Confcommercio Pesaro Urbino); companies operating in consulting, strategy and training of SMEs (Sida Group); local media (We Mondo TV, operating within the associational galaxy MIlleVoci, promoting interculturalism).", "http://www.lse.uk.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004469_13"], [2018, "E-TOURISM 2018", "The Liverpool School of English", 288578.0, 8, 10, "E-TOURISM 2018 edition is aimed at 130 students of the last two years of a network that on one hand involves schools with economic and tourist addresses (Sansovino, Alberti, Mazzotti, Lazzari Institutes), hotel and catering (Maffioli Institute) and IT, graphics and communication on the other (Scarpa e Volterra Institutes).\r\nThe project renews its action to consolidate it and improve its qualitative characteristics: it pursues the theme of the development of territorial marketing as a tool for promoting and stimulating local development in an international key, also promoting the growth of skills related to the use of tools and techniques of IT communication based on the web and on e-commerce tourism.\r\n5-week experiences abroad are planned in 2019, with internships in selected companies located in linguistic and tourism-related countries: Austria (Vienna), Germany (Berlin) France (Lyon), Poland (Wroclaw) , United Kingdom (Liverpool, Brighton, Torquay), Ireland (Letterkenny) and Spain (Valencia).

Before the departure, the participants will receive accurate preparation activities. The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit. Together with the enhancement of linguistic and professional \u201ctools\u201d, the project highlighted the intercultural consciousness as one of the essential competences to start up a revival processes which might favour the employment linked to the potential touristic attractiveness of the territory.The touristic offer can be innovative if it is gifted also on a human level personalisation, which requires the operators to master some competences to be improved through the transnational mobility. These competences concern some soft skills such as ability to have an open vision towards society, relational skills, self-entrepreneurship, flexibility personal organisation as well as specific technical skills.  The professional profiles involved are related to Tourism and other linked sectors: services (marketing and administration, information technology, restaurants and hotel accommodation), agri-food and environment management.The common goals to the different professional profiles are aimed at the acquisition or enhancement of the following skills:1-To interact by using Foreign languages 2- To positively face new cultural contexts, 3- To adapt to unfamiliar situations, to be flexible, mindful and interested towards new experiences and to live them as a learning opportunity 4-To practise personal autonomy by means of daily training of self-organization and of stress management5- To build-up constructive relationships and to take charge of responsibilities at work  6- To acquire or develop some professional skills The mobility is integrated in the sending school curriculum and it is recognised as equivalent to the school-work Alternance (work based learning); therefore, the application of ECVET procedures in organizing and implementing the work experience abroad will enable the recognition of credits. The participants will also receive the Europass Mobility Document, the Certificate of Competencies, in addition to the other certifications foreseen, which will enrich the personal portfolio for entering the labour market.The continuity with the previous Project editions strengthens the collaboration of the members of the national and international partnership, and it improves the shared practices applied to organize, manage and evaluate the mobility. This continuity is also a condition for the success of the Mobility experience, whose impact will be measured by a follow-up Observatory of the sending schools in the three years after the conclusion of the Project.

The focus then becomes polarized toward the handicraft sector and SMEs, with attention to the construction sector, green technologies for energy conservation, rehabilitation and restoration. The training contents of the project include the following topics a) the growth of professional skills in relation to recovery, maintenance and reorganization of the territory and its redevelopment (primarily energy and sustainable one) b) the development of awareness about the need for interaction among different profiles. This is true within a single sector and among different sectors. Transnational mobility is an opportunity for the development of key competencies as digital competence , communication, self-learning, as the basis of a vocational path and personal growth.

The different sectors are integrated in the knowledge that the tourist reception 2.0's needs on the one hand to strengthen operators\u2019 behaviours that have to become more and more engaging and customized, and on the other to optimize the management aspects of the front office, back office, business organisation, and the application of strategic, territorial, commercial marketing techniques. Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field.

They will spend two weeks in the UK, in the first week they will go to a language course, and the following week they will do shadowing activities either in schools or in companies whose work is pertinent to the staff. In so doing the staff will better understand how  the companies work, and at the same time they will improve their knowledge of the professional language. Each school will manage a greater number of mobility scholarships  than in the past.

Despite English is the language used in the work place, all the schools aim at improving German learning too as DE is one of the most important trade partner for our local companies, for this reason German courses, addressed to both students and teachers, have already been organized.\r\nThe schools will also improve collaboration with local partners by organizing conferences in English held by Federmanager and by a EU official on international issues (Industry 4.0; Brexit and the implications for European Trading), for students of the 4th and 5th year of study, other conferences will be held for students of the third year on work-linked training issues. On \u201cCities for Life\u201d Day in collaboration with Saint Egidio Community, the schools organize a conference in English to debate on death penalty.\r\nAll the projects arise from the shared vision of the importance of multiculturalism and from the wish to enhance the feeling of belonging to Europe which will also lead to the participation of 40 students to the annual competition called EuroMaster organized by the Center for European Relationships and the  city hall of Schio.", "http://www.lse.uk.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006432_9"], [2015, "Training, Human Resource, European Education  2015", "The Liverpool School of English", 225754.0, 6, 15, "The project THREE is addressed to 100 students of a network of Secondary schools located in the area called \u201cBassa Padovana\u201d, in Veneto Region.

The mobility will take place in different phases from May to September 2016 and will last five weeks.\r\nThe macro area of vocational reference relates to the industry including from the typical agro-food production to the integrated  touristic products. The focus is given to services, including those aimed at personal care and wellness. The same macro area includes marketing and administration functions and the integration of cross-curricular competences in the linguistic field as well as in the management of the territory.\r\nThe reference contexts are characterized by the economy affected by the strong impact of economic and financial crisis in terms of decrease in jobs.\r\nAt the same time, statistic surveys highlight the difficulty of small companies to modify behaviours and organization models. This is due to very rooted historic and cultural conditioning which limit the necessary innovation processes.

There will be teachers of languages and professional subjects who will follow a program of professional and linguistic formation and job shadowing in the UK to enhance their competences in the CLIL teaching. The beginning of the VET mobility for CLIL teachers represents a real opening towards the internationalization in the field of the professional formation of the teachers.\r\nTherefore, following this experience, it is foreseen that the participants will start up a network working CLIL group that will be increased with future mobilities to capitalize the results of the project.\r\nThe countries of destination for the students are Germany, France, Spain, United kingdom and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe receiving partners confirm the network built in the past and which is operating in the on-going project.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing.

Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017.

The Public Vocational School Hospitality and Nutrition (G11) entails three different parts adding up to about 2.722 students. It is the only college within the city of Hamburg educating in the fields of catering industry and meat processing industry. It covers all aspects starting from occupational orientation and preparation, dual apprenticeship to qualifications earned at professional schools and master classes. The main focus lies on dual apprenticeship and vocational preparation. Dual training will take place for the following fields of occupation: specialist within the field of hotel management, specialist within the field of restaurant management, specialist within the field of catering industry, specialist within the field of hotel and restaurant industry and culinary chef. Also found under the same roof are the vocational college for the meatpacking industry which offers two fields of occupation - butcher and specialist within the field of meatpacking industry \u2013 as well as the vocational business and economics college which is widely known as a school of hotel management. Classes at the vocational college(s) have been set up due to the elected concentrations and not because of former education or working experiences. Our mission statement reads \u201cAbout practical experience, with practical experience, for practical experience\u201d.All participants of this project are mostly within their second out of three years of their apprenticeship. The apprenticeship syllabus shows a general studies based working experience for the first part whereas it intends a joined specialization plus demands a specific concentration for each individual apprenticeship type during the second part. The G 11 apprentices are being trained in class as well as at their training properties and companies (=dual system). Classes are being held en block meaning two blocks of five to six weeks per year. About 48 apprentices are being able to receive grants for this programme each year.Training facilities and G 11 have to approve the application process. The G11 as well as the participant(s) have to inform the chamber of commerce and the German hotel and restaurant association (DEHOGA). Goals and learning agreement have especially been tailored to the participants needs. The hotel and catering industry situated in the city of Hamburg is widely recognized and of highly international importance. Its international focus is the figurehead of the cities tourism industry. Outgoing mobility arrangements usually does not exceed three weeks length. This way more willing and interested participating apprentices are attracted while a too long absence from school is avoided. No harm in regards to a later reintegration into the former class as well as the curriculum or mid term is being done. During the first half of the first week the participants will be taking language skills and area studies classes. They will also be having the opportunity to join industry based excursions, tours and site inspections in order to compare and discuss the differences to their home company.

In this project, using a controlled-intensity exercise training model and novel genetic fate mapping of CSCs, I will answer the much debated question of whether CSCs are the direct source of new myocyte formation in the adult mammalian mouse heart. Following this, through gene expression array I will determine whether myocyte-dependent growth factor release drives the exercise training induced cellular adaptation of the heart.

Many researchers struggle to develop their potential within the academy, or to articulate their skills to non-academic employers, and so their potential is not fully realised.\r\n\r\nCurrently, entrepreneurship programmes tend to be targeted at undergraduates, rather than postgraduates or early career researchers (ECRs).  There is also considerable variation in how different countries\u2019 HEIs support the professional development of ECRs. Work from the European Research Area (ERA) has highlighted that ECRs are often poorly informed about non-academic career paths and are not equipped with the skills needed to gain rewarding wider employment. While ERA policies to address this through greater innovation-focused doctoral training have been in place since 2011, progress remains slow. Results of a recent large survey on European doctoral programmes ('The European Higher Education Area: Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies', A. Curaj et al, 2015) indicated that in doctoral programmes where training was provided, the mandatory component was focused on subject-specific skills. Transferable skills that might promote personal development or be more useful outside of academia were mostly voluntary, and thus participation was much lower. The survey results also highlighted that many doctoral supervisors did not feel equipped to help their students develop a career plan, especially if that career was non-academic.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the proposed project is the creation of a programme to enhance the skills awareness and employability of a cross-disciplinary cohort of 36 participating researchers, drawn from the partner institutions. The programme focuses on ECRs, but participants will also include doctoral candidates and supervisors, to encourage students to consider these issues at an early stage, and to ensure that supervisors have the tools required to support them. The same participants will attend all training, enabling the development of an international cohort, who will benefit both from the training, and from their interaction with each other. In addition to enhancing the skills and knowledge of researchers, the project adds to the professional development of the support staff involved, through their exposure to the different areas of expertise and methodologies of the other partners. \r\n\r\nEach partner will design and host their own training event for the full cohort at their home institution (with ITQB NOVA and IPSantar\u00e9m combining for theirs). The foci for these events will be:\r\n\r\no KAU: innovation, value-creation, conflict management.\r\no INN: private and public sector co-operation.\r\no LJMU: personal effectiveness, research impact.\r\no ITQB NOVA/IPSantar\u00e9m: engaging policy-makers, career development; supervisor/mentor best practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme covers academic and wider careers, benefitting from the transnational nature of the project consortium. While many elements of research support are recognisable across Europe, the focus often varies from country to country, with the result that different areas of national expertise are developed. A transnational project allows the sharing of best practice in these areas, with the creation of a programme stronger than one based on a single, national experience. The intention is that the programme would be embedded in the training provision of the partner institutions. It would be advertised through several channels, including national multiplier events, and be reproducible at other universities after the project\u2019s end, through the dissemination of high-quality course materials.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s key objectives are threefold, to:\r\n\r\ni. create an effective and reproducible skills development programme;\r\nii. enhance the international competitiveness of participating researchers;\r\niii. enhance the reputations of the HEIs delivering the programme.

This experience will develop through a five week abroad mobility which provides, after an initial preparatory stage during the first week stay, work placements experiences similar to those of the Alternating School Work project, performed by the member schools of the consortium. The project emphasizes the focus on the changes that are affecting the tourism sector: the first condition to attract tourism to areas located inland, and at the same time to face the change of tourism 2.0, it is to act on future operators\u2019 education and training.

The students come from the following different high secondary school courses of study: technical economic (Administration, Finance and Marketing, Tourism); technological (Graphic and Communication, IT), vocational (food and wine and hotel hospitality). The different sectors are integrated in the knowledge that the tourist reception 2.0's needs on the one hand to strengthen operators\u2019 behaviours that have to become more and more engaging and customized, and on the other to optimize the management aspects of the front office, back office, business organisation, and the application of strategic, territorial, commercial marketing techniques. Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field. Web technologies and social instruments are in fact necessary to the whole chain to communicate and promote new flows, to intercept, to organize accommodation, to manage tourism industry.

The countries of mobility destination are the United Kingdom, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic. The decision took into account the offer of various but complementary types of tourism, and the impact that the development of IT has on this economic segment sector. The majority of the foreign partners is part of the ECVET network, and all project partners have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which regulates the implementation of ECVET procedures in internships. This will enable the validation and recognition of learning outcomes from sending schools according to the principle of educational equivalence training. The fallout of the project outcomes within sending schools, besides strengthening existing network ties and the sharing of methodologies (in particular on the definition of the learning paths in non-formal contexts, on validation and recognition of the results) will contribute to raising their internationalization, fueling the interest and willingness to carry out projects with foreign countries (language studies, exchange experiences).

The OBJECTIVE is to provide pedagogy, to enable our target group of practitioners to engage and support their beneficiaries i.e. socially excluded adults, to achieve validated competencies supported by distance travelled methodology, by engaging in non-formal learning via participatory arts projects.\r\n\r\n24.2% of the population (EU27) is at risk of poverty or social exclusion and reduction of this number is one of the five headline targets of Europe 2020.  Learning can directly provide the skills, knowledge and qualifications that are important in social and labour market participation. \r\n\r\nThe Council recommendation of 20.12.12 on non-formal/informal learning stated that \u201cthe validation of learning outcomes acquired through non-formal learning can play an important role in enhancing employability .. as well as increasing motivation for lifelong learning, particularly in the case of the socio-economically disadvantaged\u201d. \r\n\r\nSILO will tackle those issues by providing new pedagogy for practitioners to:\r\n\r\na.

Disabled individuals\u2019 need of getting a profession and employment is a basic human right that has to be regarded with the principles of equality of opportunity and full inclusion. This fact has been emphasized in international platforms for many years. Naturally, hearing impaired individuals also have these same rights as a subgroup of disabled individuals. There are many international models and regulations organizing hearing-imparied youth\u2019s vocational education and employment. These young people have been getting vocational education in areas which needs labor force and afterwards their employment has been granted by transition programmes. However, it is known that only 40% of disabled graduates could be provided with jobs. Another problem in vocational education of disabled people is that the fact that educational programmes of vocational schools of special education are not up-to-date and not oriented to answer the needs of profession areas with employment opportunities. Consequently, graduate youth is having problems of employment; since their education programmes are not accorded to needs of business world. Moreover, hearing-impaired young people\u2019s inability to acquire occupational competence later in business life because of important problems encountered  in social harmony, peer acceptance, participation to educational processes and academical success, despite the fact that they continue to inclusive vocational schools as educational environment. When you add language and communication problems brought by hearing disability and negative attitude of employers against hearing-impaired people to the situation, employment of these young people is clearly a problematic area. Above mentioned problems are not only hampering employment of disabled people, they also should be regarded as  obstacles for hearing-impaired youth to be productive and participate in social life as a whole. Since it is impossible to solve disabled people\u2019s employment problems with a single project, Turkey\u2019s construction sector\u2019s need for qualified labor power and hearing-impaired youth\u2019s potential to answer that need could be a solid base for solid steps to a real solution to this problem. This project, with reference to the abovementioned thoughts, involves development and implementation of a vocational education program to train hearing-impaired young people as construction technicians and employment and observation of those trained technicians. In this context, construction planning programs (eg. Primavera, MS Project), quantity take-off calculations and bid documents preparation used in construction firms\u2019 project offices will be adapted and taught in a way that disabled young people can use. To realize that goal:- A vocational education program and modules will be built- Vocational education and transition phases will be implemented- These young people will be provided with jobs in partner companies and large construction companies. A total of 15 people will be employed in these companies- This employed group will be monitored and majors will be taken for their improvementIt could be said that this suggested project will be an example model of a bridge involving vocational education and transition program with a perspective of \u201cfull inclusion\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d and guaranteed employment in Turkey and partner countries. It could be fair to predict that this model can be implemented not only for people with hearing disability but also for other subgroups of disabled people. As a result, realization of this project would be an example model of building bridges between vocational education and employment in Turkey and reinforcing that bridge in international context.This project is formed of 7 partners from 4 different countries. The project is composed of ten work packages and these work packages will be executed by Anadolu University (Turkey), AHENK Special Education and Rehabilitation Center (Turkey), TAV Construction (Turkey), University of Minho (Portugal), Liverpool John Moores University (United Kingdom), Vilnius College of Technologies and Design (Lithuania) and Erbil Project Consulting Engineering (Turkey).

These learning opportunities will also be of benefit to the wider community, for example health promotion days. The CLCs will provide further support and guidance to enable the adult learners to recognise the skills and competencies that they already possess and are using within the learning activity and new skills that they are developing.

Thus, the project contributes to \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy to reach employment rate of 75% as well to achieve benchmark of 15% of learners\u2019 participation in lifelong learning as defined in European agenda for adult learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives are: to contribute to a reduction of number of low-skilled adults; to increase motivation of people with disadvantaged background and fewer opportunities through participatory approach; to facilitate access for learners to employment-related training by offering tailored for individual learners learning opportunities based on Open Educational Resources (OERs); to increase motivation of people with disadvantaged background and fewer opportunities to learn by providing information on validation of non-formal and informal learning; to strengthen the capacities of AE organisations active in employment-related training to offer high quality ICT-based training tailored for individual learners with disadvantaged background and fewer opportunities; to enhance the professional development of AE staff by introducing new innovative educational methods: reversed training, Open Educational Resources (OERs), blended-learning approach with new role of trainer as facilitator, and to increase the adaptability of employment-related learning to the nowadays labour market\u2019s needs by reinforcing social partnership  between AE organisations, labour exchange offices and world of work (enterprises).\r\n\r\nSeeking to address these objectives two main intellectual outputs will be developed for two main project\u2019s target groups: \r\n\r\n\u2022 people with disadvantaged background and fewer opportunities - Innovative model for integration into labour market (IMILM model) based on ICT-enabled solutions and OERs; \r\n\r\n\u2022 AE organisations and their staff \u2013 AE organisation modernisation model (AEOM model) to ensure the effective implementation of the new educational methods and tools proposed within the IMILM model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology for developing IMILM model is based on participatory approach and use of online tools tailored for learners. The main results are: Self-need analysis tool, Set of employment-related OERs, Knowledge portfolio, Action plan, User guide for learners. Piloting of IMILM model will be done with 75 learners with fewer opportunities. The website part for learners provides them with open access to the learning tools of IMLIM model.

The methodology of AEOM model is based on applying reversed training, Open Educational Resources (OERs), new role of a trainer as facilitator to ensure the learners\u2019 participatory approach. This output consists of interrelated methodological materials: e-Guidebook for AE organisations for implementation of the IMILM model; Collection of good practices with learners\u2019 success stories; Framework for social partnership between AE organisations, Labour Exchange Offices and Employer\u2019s organisations.

Most of them have very low literacy skills, thus limiting their possibility of integration and their exercise of citizenship rights, with evident risks also for the security within society. \r\nAccording to Eurostat 3.4 millions of immigrants reached the EU in 2013 and the majority of them went to Germany, UK, France and Italy. The number has increased in 2015 (not so in 2016) due to the huge number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe.\r\nThe situation the project is addressing seems to be common all over Europe and that is the reason why we think it should be tackled it at a transnational level. These issues highlight the need to provide, at national level, an always rising number of literacy courses in L2  while, at European level, to establish an encompassing and shared reflection on the current learning and teaching models. In fact, traditional methodologies are not always adequate or sufficient to respond to the growing need of migrant people, while ICT in such courses is generally not used to their full potential (if used at all).\r\nIn the EU High Level Group of Experts on Literacy \u2013 Final Report (Sept. 2012), the European Commission raises alarm on the risks arising from growing illiteracy among young and adult population and called for a structural and systematic commitment on the part of national Governments and Institutions.\r\nThe OECD invites developed countries to fight illiteracy and to improve reading, writing and calculating skills among adults.\r\nMoreover, for the target group addressed by the project (adult immigrants and refugees) a new element of marginalization consists in the digital divide. This is a new challenge for teachers and practitioners; in fact, ICT need be embedded and taken into account when developing educational plans or new social policies in order to have a real impact. In developed countries and societies, new technologies are becoming essential parts in citizens life. Despite this, many practitioners and teachers often lack the necessary competences or haven\u2019t found adequate instruments to cope with this new challenge.\r\nThe objectives of this project proposal are:\r\n   1) exchanging and comparing experiences and case studies carried out in the partner countries about the  ICT supported teaching methodologies used in L2 with illiterate or low educated adult migrants. \r\n   2) Developing an Analytical Gridwork which, starting from best practices identified and using the case study methodology, will evaluate innovation elements, similarities and differences, strong points and weaknesses, compare their methodologies and highlight their possible development also in technological terms (which  tools, application , etc.) for the use of ICT in teaching to adult migrant people at risk of social exclusion. From the research will be developed methodological model and guidelines for teachers and practitioners, and a video-tutorial, on how to use ICT in literacy courses and in teaching languages as L2 to adult migrant people with low - or no - educational levels.\r\n   3) Piloting the methodological model and guidelines in 7 partner countries\r\n   4) Developing a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) for teachers to facilitate their training on the use of ICT in language classes with the above mentioned target group.\r\n   5) Disseminating the methodological model and guidelines and the MOOC  through the implementation of a European Conference and national events in all partner countries addressed to adult education staff, researchers and  stakeholders so as to promote the use and the potential of ICT in education.\r\n   6) Evaluating the impact the analyzed case studies can have on the process of social inclusion of illiterate or low educated migrant people. This will be possible by highlighting those elements which should be further developed to guarantee good learning results (ex. The development of dedicated software applications) and to reduce the digital gap (ex. an integrated system or urban policies).\r\n   Target groups are: migrant learners with low or no education, researchers, adult teachers, trainers, local/national decision makers.\r\nThe project idea is in line with the priorities stated in the \"declaration on Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education\" of Paris, point no. 2 \"ensuring inclusive education for all children and adult people which combats racism and discrimination on any ground, promotes citizenship and teaches them to understand and to accept differences of opinion, of conviction, of belief and of lifestyle, while respecting the rule of law, diversity and gender equality\".", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA204-036811_2"], [2015, "European Incubator for Bussines Ideas", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LTD", 109551.0, 6, 9, "Since 2008, the most severe economic crisis provoked in Europe over 25 million unemployed.

Europe needs more entrepreneurs. In Europe, just over a third (37%) of workers prefer to be self-employed, whereas in the USA and China are more than 50%.\r\n \r\nThe \u201cEuropean Incubator for Business Ideas\u201d project is focused on people who  have to face  the main challenges of the today economic world such as unemployment, economic stability and growth, young people finding a job, seniors 50+, women,  adults  from disadvantaged area or with special need \r\n\r\nThe project is aiming to enable students and adults to acquire and develop skills and competencies needed for their employability, to turn their business ideas into concrete actions and foster further learning, active citizenship and intercultural dialogue.   \r\n\r\nEight partners from six  European countries,  Edunet Organization and Teachers Training Center Dolj from  Romania, Organisation for European Issues  and Paphos Chamber of Commerce from Cyprus, Insignare from Portugal, CESO from Italy , Delado from Spain and Merseyside Expanding Horisons from UK bring relevant and complementary skills and human resources  to create an innovative  European Training Model,  aiming to promote knowledge and skills of  intercultural communication, working in MMHTs and patient safety and develop training content,  learning and evaluation  tools,  which will be available on the project  website.\r\nThe partners will build a European Training Model based on the blended learning.   The main output of the project is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) based on co-learning and co-creation, containing learning and self-assessment activities and tools. \r\nAfter training 60 facilitators from the participating countries to support and guide the learners\u2019 communities on the MOOC, 150 participants from the project\u2019s partner countries and approximately 500 from across the world will be recruited to participate in the training on the created MOOC.\r\n \r\nThe  MOOC will mainly be provided in English with some translation and the students will be able to conduct their discussions, write their blogs and prepare their outputs in Romanian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese or Greek languages. The multilingual aspect of this MOOC will promote cooperation, communication, team working, and respect of diverse opinions, sensitivity and tolerance to people from different cultures, backgrounds and increase language competence, digital skills, flexibility and creativity. \r\n\r\nAfter finish the learning on the MOOC,  150  the participants from disadvantaged groups,  unemployed, young people finding a job, seniors 50+, women,  adults  from disadvantaged area or with special need , will attend  the five days  in different workshops organized in partners\u2019 countries,   to   apply acquired competence and skills   in practice,  working  together   with their colleagues from the host country to  make  a business  plan. \r\n\r\nThese workshops are real \"incubators\" of business idea.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the training, participants will present their projects, their business idea and plan in front of colleagues and representatives of business, which will give them feedback.

The reason why these young people leave their country are: escaping from persecution or serious damage, and thus seeking \"physical protection\", economic reasons and future expectations, and eventually reunion with their familiar.\r\nPsycho-social support actions are, therefore, relevant to understand their stories, the reasons that pushed them to migrate, their needs and their future aspirations. Such actions may also enhance, understand and develop their cognitive and affective behaviors, and protect them from the risks they may be exposed, thus facilitating their inclusion process within the hosting society.\r\nYouth workers and youth organizations can play, in these terms, an important role. Through informal and non-formal activities, they may provide the PIN-code, the access key to enter within the host societies, if they are trained and equipped with the appropriate tools. Starting from these considerations, the project \"PIn for ME\" aims at:\r\n- Improving the quality of the socio-educational animation for young migrants through cooperation among youth organizations and youth workers \r\n- Increase the capacity and improve the strategies of youth workers and organizations, addressed to the young migrants\u2019 support/inclusion\r\nThe project includes three complementary activities: a training, six study visits and a final seminar. In all the activities, a non-formal and informal approach will be used, based on confrontation, discussion and field experience and aimed at learning new practices and methodologies. In addition, the project's activities will address three main aspects of young migrants\u2019 inclusion: listening, participation and orientation. On one hand, the youth workers will develop good skills in listening to young people, and on the other hand they will have the opportunity to develop and acquire educational tools and techniques to propose structured orientation and participation to the young migrants. Each country group will consist of three youth workers (18 in total) from 25 years old (without age limits) who will be selected among the staff of the participating organizations or between their local network. These will participate in all phases of the project, supported by their organizations and the applicant.\r\nThrough the activities foreseen, participants will have the opportunity to acquire important cross-cutting skills (identify, prevent, counteract, experience, relate) useful in their personal and professional growth path in an increasingly complex and multicultural society where the phenomenon of migration is increasing. They will improve their attitude towards confrontation, listening, intercultural exchange, interpersonal communication, developing a self-critical attitude. As consequence, participating organizations, besides strengthening their operational capability and their European network, will benefit from the experience, skills and competences acquired by their participants in order to improve the quality of their work towards young migrants.\r\nIndeed, the project will also have a significant impact on them. Emotion management, empathy, self-awareness and knowledge of others, critical thinking, conflict management, are key skills for a positive inclusion that they can acquire thanks to the support of youth workers and organizations involved. In addition, educational programs and the activities carried out by these actors will help to prevent violent radicalization and spread European values such as tolerance, cultural diversity and non-discrimination not only among young migrants, but also among young people in general.\r\nLastly, long-term impact is expected at European, national and local level, both through a well-planned dissemination strategy of the project results and output, of which organizations and youth workers may benefit; and through the designing of a new project I the framework of the Ka.2 of the Erasmus + program, which will improve the quality of project follow-ups at European level and strengthen the partnership.", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012273_4"], [2017, "Identity in movement", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 12518.0, 4, 5, "Identities in movement\r\n\r\nPractical information - Exchange\r\n\r\nDates: September 18 - 23\r\nVenue: Talentenhuis and other locations, Amsterdam \r\nHost: DW-RS \r\nNumber of participants: 30 (including 5 group leaders)\r\nParticipating countries: France, Portugal, UK, Netherlands\r\n\r\nThe exchange\r\n\r\n\u201c\u201cIdentities in movement\u201d project aims to raise awareness of young people living in multicultural areas regarding their own abilities and positive identity strategies they can develop in order to face stereotypes and prejudices. \r\nThe project will involve 6 people per country from across 5 European countries (30 in total):  5 young people per country living in a multicultural area and with low chance to travel (25 young people in total) and 1 youth leader per group.  \r\nThe project will last 6 days and will take place in Amsterdam (NL) where participants will be involved in a 6-day workshop focussed on Film making as a tool of skill and personal development.

The best example is found in the northern countries in Europe, where they have an individualised system of follow-up and counselling for unemployed.\r\n\r\nThis situation makes us to reflect about innovative and creative ways of follow-up for adult people in vocational retraining; ways to import good practises from other European countries, also called benchmarking.\r\nThis mobility programme consist of mobility of professionals with strong experience in the organisation (consultant and labour counsellors specialised in the support of unemployed adult people) to other European entities that may contribute with a wide expertise in United Kingdom, France or Poland in order to learn and understand good practises and afterwards apply them on the work procedures. The power of the programme is based on consultants and counsellors get the chance of experimenting, learning and monitoring by themselves how counselling and vocational retraining (vocational training for adults) are performed in another countries whose counselling and support system is taken as best practise model.
