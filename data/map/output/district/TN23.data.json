The model questions; \u201cWhy do some people stay healthy, both mentally and physically, and why others don\u2019t during a stressful situation?\u201d According to Antonovsky this is dependent on three factors; to have a greater understanding of one\u2019s life, receiving a greater meaning from life and being able to manage life. Sports has the potential to support young people\u2019s understanding of their situation through purposeful activities and physical exercise. Sports is also a positive way to engage with the local community, create networks and cooperate while encouraging a positive community response. Sports projects with young people is a common tool to increase integration and the individual needs of the young people involved. This project will be informed by Antonovsky\u2019s approach as participation in sports is a way to promote health despite the presence of stress in a young person\u2019s life which will stabilise young people. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are; \r\n1.

The expected impact is to give young people the possibility to participate in more sports and to give a sense of both awareness and empowerment about gender issues in relation to sports.

At the end of the project this dictionary is marketed to parents and the wider community.\r\n\r\nThere is a final Seminar in the UK to disseminate project results and to debate the future of language learning in a wider, united world, led by a cohesive Europe, promoting mobility of opportunity, equal opportunities and social justice for all.\r\n\r\nIn a widening Europe it is essential that schools offer the most effective social and educational integration for newly arrived pupils.

Despite its significance, measuring metastatic potential as well as potential indicators of therapy efficacy remain unmet clinical challenges. Recently, it has been demonstrated in vitro, that aggressive metastatic cells pull on their surroundings suggesting that metastatic potential could be gauged by measuring the forces exert by tumours. Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is no non-invasive modality that can directly image these forces in vivo.\nOur objective is the non-invasive measurement of both IFP within tumours as well as the forces they exert on their surrounding environment. This will be used to predict a tumour\u2019s metastatic potential and importantly, changes in these forces will be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy of drug therapy. To attain this goal, the biomechanical properties of the tumour and its neighbouring tissue will be measured via MR-elastography at various measured deformation states.  Resultant images will be used to reconstruct images of the internal and external forces acting on the tumour. We call this novel imaging modality Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) imaging.\nWe will calibrate MRF via cell cultures and pre-clinical models, and then test the method in breast, liver, and brain cancer patients. Thereby, we will investigate whether MRF data can predict metastatic spread and measure IFP in patients.  We will also investigate the potential to non-invasively modulate the force environment of cancer cells via externally applied shear forces with the aim of impacting cell motility and proliferation.
