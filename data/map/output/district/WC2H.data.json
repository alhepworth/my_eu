It would be possible to use this insight to information at multiple stages of the policy-life cycle to support the definition of the political agenda, the creation, the implementation and the monitoring of policy proposals.In this context, modern politicians could test, detect and understand how citizens perceive their own political agendas, and also stimulate the emergence of discussions and contributions on the informal web (e.g. forums, social networks, blogs, newsgroups and wikis), so as to gather useful feedback for immediate (re)action. In this way, politicians can create a stable feedback loop between information gathered on the Web and the definition of their political agendas based on this contribution. The ability to leverage the vast amount of user-generated content for supporting governments in their political decisions requires new ICT tools that will be able to analyze and classify the opinions expressed on the informal Web, or stimulate responses, as well as to put data from sources as diverse as blogs, online opinion polls and government reports to an effective use.To this end, NOMAD aims to introduce these different new dimensions into the experience of policy making by providing decision-makers with fully automated solutions for content search, selection, acquisition, categorisation and visualisation that work in a collaborative form in the policy-making arena.", 217728.0, 2818719.0, 6, 9, "NOMAD", null, null, null, "fp7_102148_964716411"], [1385856000000, 1448841600000, "Enabling Linked Data and Analytics for SMEs by Renovating Public Sector Information", "Critical Publics Ltd", "As public sector information data sources and initiatives have proliferated over the last years, linking and combining datasets has become one of the major topics for information managers of SMEs.

The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market. The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship. We are convinced that the implementation of this project and its further repetition will clearly increase the chances of our pupils to succeed in the labour market while also attracting other potential candidates to study at our school.", "http://www.avalonschool.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SK01-KA102-045975_7"], [2017, "Te\u00f3ria v praxi", "Avalon School of English", 28988.0, 2, 9, "The applicant of project is The Secondary School of Business in Vranov nad Top\u013eou, one of the most successful and most famous educational institutions in the field of vocational training in the region. Currently, 228 students attend the school. The four-year study programme provides education in economics, such as accounting, business administration and applied informatics. It also provides training in foreign languages (English, German and Russian). Most of our students are interested in the English language. The added value of studying at our school is emphasis on the necessity of connecting theory with practice through training companies in which students have the opportunity to test their knowledge and skills practically in a simulated foreign business environment. \r\nFurthermore, students in grades 3 and 4 must undergo mandatory vocational practice in agreed workplaces. Here opens up space for our identification of the need to deepen linking theory with practice so that we produce not only theoretical professionals for the labor market, but especially experienced and highly flexible professionals with active communication in English.\r\nTherefore, we defined the project objective: To increase the applicability of our students in the labor market through the implementation of foreign professional mobility by the improvement of professional and language competences of pupils.\r\nThe situation regarding employment after graduation is steadily worse, and finding a job is a difficult process, so we decided to respond to the situation and increase the chances of our students for employment by supplementing our educational process of implementation of international mobility, the content of which would be passing job training in foreign companies.\r\nIt concerns the implementation of foreign mobility, which will take place in England, in London, for a period of two weeks, 10 working days, 14 days along with the journey and weekends and involves a total of 15 students from the 4th grades of school. They will be accompanied by two English language teachers, active in our school. The selection of these 15 students will take place according to the results of professional language tests.\r\nThrough cooperation with the educational institution ADC College, which in this project plays the role of facilitator, our students, based on test results, will be placed in companies operating in Business Administration - Companies of ADC College, AS Accountancy, Adolphus Group, Age UK Westminster, Avalon School, Big Choice Group, Century 21 Chiswick, Central School of English. All listed companies are in a contractual relationship with ADC College and respect the evaluation within ECVET.\r\n To ensure the quality of the project, its implementation will take place under the supervision of the project team composed of a project manager, a project coordinator and a financial manager.\r\nTaking part in foreign mobility, students will gain insight into the functioning of the labor market in England, business opportunities, rights and obligations of economic operators, the principles of operation of the real estate business, they will get information about career opportunities and support of young people in employment, about social policy and social system in England, about the operation and its conditions as well as the system of financing charities, brief overview of the subsidy policies, they will acquire information about the methods of teaching English language, the importance of marketing, whether in personal life or in the working business environment.\r\nThe impact of the project on participants:\r\nIncrease and improvement of key competences of students:\r\n- learn to evaluate their own work independently, find reserves,\r\n- learn to convert weaknesses to strengths and threats into opportunities.\r\nIncrease and improvement of professional competences:\r\n- obtain an overall view on the issue of the private sector market functioning\r\n- obtain information about the social system in England and its use by socially disadvantaged citizens\r\n- obtain information about the operation of the third sector in the marketplace - (nonprofits, charities)\r\n- acquisition and improvement of technical skills (ICT skills, working with feeds, databases)\r\n- improve communication skills in English\r\nContribution of the project: to increase the quality of vocational education and training students for the labor market to withstand the competitive environment and to demonstrate the knowledge and experience which other applicants miss, possibly to show their greater sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, which would be supported by the experience acquired in the foreign market.

The action begins with a review of the market, which is necessary during the current economic crisis: a lack of employment coexists with a lack of specific skills. Hence the need to train updated professionals with digital and language skills. Learners ask for synergies with the market, especially in Europe, and contacts with the outside world, along with forms of creative learning, informal, close to the world of young people suitable to awaken interest and creativity.\r\n\r\nGiven digital natives' skills, it is productive to exploit and hand over them to the vocational field in order  to create jobs. Moreover nowadays it's essential to be present in the market, to promote our image: a future professional must know the importance of social media marketing especially in our society where making others speak about us is fundamental and in which social media are necessary to create a brand identity and a brand reputation.\r\n\r\nThe group is made of 65 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing), 15 recent graduates from our school and 25 VET staff (teachers and employees).

The elimination of the risk of downtime and the reduction of maintenance costs are precious for the industry, because it is currently a barrier for increasing the production and accelerating creation of better products that can provide higher profits. Therefore, the industry has strong need to adapt an easy-to-implement and easy-to-use solution. This led NEURONSW LTD. to the concept of prediction of mechanical malfunction of machinery by mechanical sound analysis. \n\nNeuron soundware (NeuronSW) is an innovative breakthrough solution combining advanced algorithms, machine learning and big data analysis to emulate the human auditory cortex enabling the early detection and prediction of mechanical malfunction of machinery. Through NeuronSW, manufacturers achieve intelligent audio diagnostics to monitor the key machinery equipment using the sound they generate. The integrated hardware and software platform automatically gathers sound of machines in real time and continuously assess the equipment health and operates similarly how experienced technicians use their ears to diagnose broken machines. It works offline and online and can be integrated into existing software or third party IoT platforms. This effectively transforms data into knowledge and actions. Sound and vibration sensors (microphones) can be quickly and cheaply installed on all types of machinery, enabling assets without digital interface or operated by legacy systems to be digitalized without expensive upgrades.", 43956.0, 62795.0, 1, 1, "neuronSW", null, null, null, "h2020_213675_916548636"], [1470009600000, 1485820800000, "MONOMA: B2B Feasibility Study", "Filisia Interfaces Ltd", "Monoma is a patent-pending cloud-based Software as a service (SaaS) solution integrating (i) modular, sensor based controllers (Hardware) and (ii) a platform with several therapy modules (Software), which (iii) collects and aggregates data insights to train people that have moderate-to-severe cases of Autism and other SEN.
