Taking into account that one more year the Tourist Observatory of the Valencian Community confirms that our community received approximately 5 million foreign tourists last year (together with Andalusia, the two autonomous regions with a greater average stay) and being the United Kingdom the main market of origin with an expenditure on catering services above the average (17.1)has made understand the Central Administration, the autonomous, as well as the hospitality sector that gastronomy is one of the main claims and attractions when planning a trip, and gastronomic experience perceived by tourists greatly influences the final perception of the destination.\r\nA3.-Second year students in training in work centres TWC\u2019S (2 months and 3 weeks) and newly graduates (3 months) in France, Portugal:\r\nSustainable and lasting employment, the performances of a job suitable to the abilities acquired by young people, and ultimately, provide that they have the opportunity to develop their skills in a European labour market freely and outside their place of origin, are some of the objectives that integrate European priorities.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE TYPES OF MOBILITY TO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS:\r\n-STUDENTS\r\nFollowing the guidelines compiled by the EDP approved by Faculty of professors in September 2014, and in line with the objectives already in the first mobility for teachers project approved \"Gastronomic Profile of our Prior Market\": English tourists, which are summarized in this way:\r\nWe want this 2 week stay to be preparatory and decision-making so the student can choose responsibly, perform the training module in work centres TWC\u2019S workplace (2nd year) in a European country, experience that we consider fundamental to the future of students and today is an election that represents neither 1% of the students of our Centre; We continue as a fundamental objective of this application:\r\na \u2013 Our aim is that the training module in work centres TWC\u2019S (in the form of stage, TWC\u2019S , or as training for the graduates) can become a normal practice among the students of the Centre and the dynamics to be integrated into the process of teaching and learning as part of the curriculum.\r\nb-  That students have the opportunity to choose responsibly to spend a training period abroad, through a prior stage supervised by teachers.\r\nIn this way we propose two initiatives aimed at two profiles of students in the Medium degree of Hospitality Studies:\r\nA1 - to first-year students: 2 weeks at a European centre stage.

The LFEE courses have a strong focus on teaching methodologies and encourage the use of engaging and stimulating resources (which would support our school\u2019s delivery of the \u201c1+2\u201d language initiative). We consider that the participation of our teachers on the LFEE immersion course in France is an important step in working towards our goal of improving the teaching and learning of languages in our school. The aims of the LFEE Europe immersion courses are as follows -\r\n\u2022 To improve methodological expertise in the teaching of French to young learners;\r\n\u2022 To provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French at primary level; \r\n\u2022 To develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France;\r\n\u2022 To improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in French; and\r\n\u2022 To use Internet and other ICT resources in classes.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, West Dunbartonshire Council introduced a new initiative with the objective that every child in primary education learns two foreign languages (in addition to their mother tongue). This initiative is in response to the Scottish Government report and guidelines on the teaching of languages in Scotland (which, itself, is based on the \u201c1+2\u201d model recommended by the European Union and adopted by many countries in Europe and beyond). The main goal of the initiative is to create a new model for language acquisition in Scotland. This is an ambitious and challenging pursuit, however, we believe that with the right approach and resources, it is achievable. \r\n\r\nWe plan to send two participants (fully trained primary teachers) to the LFEE 1 week immersion course in France. The LFEE immersion course is a foreign language training course for primary school teachers. The course focuses on teaching methodologies and use of innovative resources in the classroom. The course encourages participants to fully immerse themselves in French culture and to speak the language at every opportunity, thus furthering their own language skills whilst developing knowledge of a different culture. The LFEE course allows participants to meet teachers from other European countries and therefore results in access to a wide network of European teachers (as well as providing opportunities to make links with a partner school). The participation of two of our teachers in this course will equip them with the skills and knowledge to support and train other staff members, effectively improving the teaching and learning of foreign languages in our school. This will support our school in delivering the new \u201c1+2\u201d language strategy, as advised by our local authority.\r\n\r\nThe chosen participants have shown a particular interest and commitment to the teaching of languages within the school. Both participants are qualified teachers with 5+ years of experience (each) at various stages and are delivering weekly French lessons to classes in line with the \u201c1+2\u201d language strategy. Both participants are very keen to enhance their skills and increase their confidence in teaching French and, prior to applying, both participants fully researched their chosen courses and attended the relevant information evenings. Currently, one participant is teaching at second level and the other at first level. By training staff members from upper and lower stages, it is intended that the innovative teaching methodologies / resources and knowledge digested will thereafter be applicable for all learners (and, of course, staff) in our school. \r\n\r\nAfter the week of intensive training (and in a French environment), the participants will be more confident and comfortable in the spoken language of French. Participants will spend their entire training communicating in French and in the company of French nationals, which will give them an enhanced (and less artificial) experience.  Participants will then assist directly in reaching the French targets in the school\u2019s Strategic Improvement Plan. With the experience gained by participants being fully shared amongst colleagues, the whole school community will work together to promote the school vision of appreciating other cultures and delivering the \"1+2\" Language strategy successfully. This vision will be embedded in the everyday running of the school. Upon return from the LFEE training course, both participants will also lead in-service training for other staff members and share teaching resources / strategies via regular peer observations and CPD opportunities.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of the LFEE immersion courses on the young people in our school will be highly significant.", null, "St Patrick's Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013248_coordinator"]]}}, "3PU": {"esif": {"data": [[1427846400000, 1546214400000, "West Dunbartonshire Pipeline", "West Dunbartonshire Council", "The operation will deliver a five stage pipeline with a particular focus on over 54s and long term unemployed.
