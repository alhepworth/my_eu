There is a need for Accent MEH to address progression and legacy programmes and a need for the Czech Republic and Danish partners to build links with local primary schools, through the establishment of a tuition programme modelled on the English National Curriculum and English Whole Class Vocal and Instrumental Tuition Strategy. Through the participation by key colleagues in a reciprocal visit to Warrington and Nachod in 2016, and the strength of the current partnership between Charanga and Denmark, it has been identified that each partner has a great deal to learn from the practices of the other, and that the development of these practices will have the impact to be realised locally, regionally,nationally and internationally.\r\nThe project will involve primary age children and we will track progress over 3 years. Accent  MEH will study the way in which children in Nachod learn Music Theory and Musicianship and transpose this into a new Music IT Programme which will be commissioned by Charanga (a nationally recognised  English company in the field of digital Music education) for use in Warrington, Halton  and Nachod  and Danish classrooms.\r\nCzech colleagues from our partner organisation (Arts School Police nad Metuji) will learn the fundamental pedagogy linked to the successful delivery of Music tuition to whole classes of children, and link with 1 regional primary schools in order to devise a teaching programme, which will track musically gifted and talented children and generally raise standards in the delivery of Music education.\r\nIt is hoped that outcomes will lead to children being able to articulate their thoughts about Music both verbally and through writing / appraising, which will lead to increased standards in the use of English in both countries. English children aren\u2019t exposed to the Czech language or culture and we hope to address this by incorporating folk songs and nationalist compositions into the project. In addition, we would want to promote British Values in both countries and encourage mutual respect and citizenship.\r\nBoth partner countries wish to promote new materials in a modern, dynamic setting, which will be tailored to the needs of pupils, and will allow colleagues to link and share good practice.

Upon completion of the course the participants will then return to school where they will be able to put into practice their new language skills.  They will then, later, be given the opportunity to visit our link school, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a in Mijas and spend some time there, observing the Spanish teachers and working alongside them.  They will also be able to have face to face discussions with the staff in the link school about possible future joint projects.\r\n\r\nThose staff already idenitfied as participants are a good cross section of staff who will make up the team of participants and these include the following people.\r\n\r\nThe head teacher who already has some basic Spanish knowledge, having previously worked in a local school that, like ourselves,   had an established link with a school in Spain. He took part in cultural exchanges between year six children whilst employed at that school.  He is very keen to promote the speaking of Spanish in our school and encourages others to have a go by using some Spanish commands with the children during assemblies and on the playground.  He therefore, wishes to improve his language skills to give him the confidence to build upon what he already does.\r\n\r\nThe Year Six class teacher, whilst not having any real knowledge of Spanish, is very enthusiastic about learning it alongside the children and using it in the classroom. At present he is working on using a few basic command words with the support of the language coordinator.   He is also keen to nurture our friendship with our link school.\r\n\r\nThe language coordinator who is an HLTA, works in year one during the mornings and then teaches Spanish throughout the school over three afternoons per week, covering PPA time.\r\n\r\nShe has a good command of the Spanish language and expects that the immersion course will give her more fluency and the ability to use her skills to teach other members of staff and the children  with greater competence.  At present she is solely responsible for maintaining the link with the Spanish School and has been allocated funding from The British Council/Comenius on two occasions previously for job shadowing experience at the link school. ( Her last visit was in 2013)\r\n\r\nThe PE assistant has only a basic knowledge of the Spanish language and is enthusiastic about using the resources on the Primary Languages Network website to deliver the bilingual PE lessons to all year groups.  He also works to support the teachers in years three and four and hopes, that attending the immersion course will enable him to have a better command of the language and also give him the confidence to use it as part of the everyday routines and activities in the classroom as well as more specifically in PE lessons.\r\n\r\nThe Early Years Support assistant is a young, recently qualified practitioner who, in common with the other participants, wishes to improve her cultural understanding of Spain and her language skills. She will then be more able to support the non-Spanish speaking teachers in the Reception Class by using commands and with singing songs and learning Spanish games to enhance what the children learn during their thirty minutes of discrete Spanish, taught by the language coordinator each week.\r\n\r\nThe participants are  from different backgrounds and with different roles within the school but all have a common aim, that is, to improve their language skills and cultural understanding in order to contribute effectively to our long term aim, that of becoming a bilingual school.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the results and impact of our project will serve to raise standards in linguistic ability of our children and staff, in their cultural understanding, and will also impact on attainment of other areas of the curriculum.  In order to underpin all of the language learning taking place, displays throughout the school will, wherever possible, be bilingual.  Furthermore, our relationship with Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a will be strengthened.\r\n\r\nIn the long term we expect that most children will leave our school and move on to Key Stage Three with a sound knowledge of Spanish, the necessary skills to be able to learn any other foreign language, and meaningful relationships with pupils from another European county.", "http://www.bradshawcps.org.uk", "Bradshaw Community Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035372_coordinator"], [2016, "Experiencias europeas", "Bradshaw Community Primary School", 9133.0, 2, 3, "The CEIP Virgen de la Pena school is located in an area  with a  high tourist volume during  the Summer months.

The CaaS project aims to facilitate configuration of business services and development of executable software to monitor the fitness of purpose of these services to evolving business contexts and where necessary to adjust these services according to the context. To this end, the CaaS project will deliver the Capability Driven Development (CDD) approach that will allow digital enterprises to exploit the notion of 'capability' as a means of both designing for services and with services.<br/>The CDD will be in the form of (1) modelling languages for representing enterprise designs, context models, and patterns, (2) a methodology for detailing how capabilities may be specified and how these may be used for designing new services, (3) reusable best practices and capability delivery patterns, (4) algorithms for dealing with business context awareness and service re-configuration, (5) a tool environment for modelling, design and delivery, and (6) a set of case studies demonstrating the applicability of the CDD.<br/>The project is driven by three use cases from different business domains namely, energy, compliance, and e-government. These use cases act as the means of guiding the development of CDD, validating CDD and revising CDD in a project lifecycle involving three major iterations.<br/>It is expected that on completion, the CaaS project will deliver results that will be theoretically sound and practically relevant with the potential for making a big impact on the delivery of software for the digital enterprise of tomorrow.", 111701.0, 2974737.0, 7, 11, "CaaS", null, null, null, "fp7_109917_954724441"], [1467331200000, 1483142400000, "\u201cAnimal-Free Testing for Acute Toxicity\u201d", "Xcellr8 Limited", "XCellR8 Limited aims to offer the first completely animal-free test for human acute toxicity.
