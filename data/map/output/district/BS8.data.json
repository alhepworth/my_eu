I will do so using state-of-the-art vibration measurement technology, biologically-relevant electric field generation, sensitive Ampere-meters and electrometers, and behavioural methods.

Major advances have been recently made in (i) determination of polymeric structures formed by human (yeast) CHMP4 (Snf7), CHMP3 (vps24) and CHMP2A; (ii) membrane splitting activity has been attributed to the sequential binding of the yeast proteins vps20 (CHMP6), Snf7 and vps24, (iii) vps2 (CHMP2), which binds vps24, recruits a AAA ATPAse vps4 which then recycles the membrane bound ESCRT-III.  Several models have since been proposed where protein polymers constricting the membrane neck for fission is the common theme. However, there is considerable debate over the essential molecular mechanism of the process. Therefore, I will address: 1. How do CHMP2, 3, 4 and 6 assemblies form on membranes and dissociate in a VPS4 dependent manner? 2. What are the structures, composition and direction of growth of ESCRT-III assemblies as they mature on lipid membranes? 3. Since ESCRT-III polymer must form through the central pore of a membrane tubule, thereby posing a steric hindrance for fusion, how does pore closure followed by scission take place? 4. As CHMPs are predominantly cytosolic, how do their binding partners such as VPS4, AMSH (deubiquitin isopeptidase), and Alix (adaptor molecule) get selectively targeted to the membrane-bound fraction of CHMPs to exert their membrane proximal function?\nAnswering the posed questions will not only advance our understanding of HIV egress from cells, it may also help open new therapeutic intervention points for several ESCRT-III related dysfunction. These studies will further form the basis for in vivo investigation of the mechanism by which ESCRT-III functions.", 1221534.0, 1221534.0, 1, 1, "MEM_FIZZ", null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", null, "fp7_95814_999974262"], [1317427200000, 1475193600000, "Silicon transport proteins in biological nanoscience and synthetic biology", "University of Bristol", "This interdisciplinary proposal will investigate whether the activity of a unique family of membrane transport proteins can be harnessed to develop novel strategies for the bioinspired fabrication of nanoscale materials and provide new directions in synthetic biology. Silicon transporters (SITs) are integral membrane proteins that were first identified in the diatoms, single\u2013celled eukaryotic algae that surround themselves with a cell wall of hydrated silica. The biosynthesis of this \u2018glass house\u2019 depends upon the uptake of silicic acid, the soluble form of silica, from the environment. The SITs bind silicic acid with high affinity and transport it across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cell. Under this proposal the SITs will be recombinantly expressed and purified before being reconstituted into synthetic liposomes. The resulting proteoliposomes will be energized to drive SIT-dependent transport of silicic acid into the interior lumen. Since the lumen has dimensions on the nanometer length scale and attolitre volume, the proteoliposomes will act as discrete nanoreactors for the synthesis of silica nanoparticles. Using SIT proteins to deliver silicic acid to the growing nanoparticle offers an unprecedented degree of tunable kinetic control over the synthetic conditions that, together with the lumen microenvironment, may induce novel particle morphologies or properties. This principle will be extended in two further directions. First, encapsulating preformed inorganic nanoparticles in the liposome lumen will lead to the formation of core-shell nanoparticles with a functional core and passive silica shell. Using SITs to control the supply of the synthetic precursor will provide unparalleled tight control over the thickness of the silica shell. A second element will create a diatom protocell by incorporating silica-condensing peptides into the lumen in order to generate silica nanostructures.

Inequalities in training for reasons of geographic, ethnic or social origin, and in job opportunities, salaries and incomes are critical dimensions of social. The development of policies, including\r\nthose concerning education, that extend access to opportunities, is essential in order to combat the permanent nature of the exclusion.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nIn this sense, within the framework of the Bologna process and considering the Prague communiqu\u00e9 of 2001, which emphasised the\r\nneed to work towards the inclusion of students and the need to promote the possibilities of mobility for all, and the successive declarations and communiqu\u00e9s which insist on the need to promote the social dimension in constructing and consolidating the\r\nEHEA, the aim of our proposal is to promote the educational and social inclusion of underrepresented groups as well as of nontraditional learners, thereby broadly satisfying one of the main priorities being called for (i.e. the improvement of the capacities of organisations active in the fields of education, training and youth, notably in the areas of strategic development, quality of learning provision, equity and inclusion, qualitative and targeted activities for specific groups) and addressing clearly one of the important features of the Erasmus+ programme: \u201cpromoting equity and inclusion by facilitating the access to learners with disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities compared to their peers\u201d (p.13, Erasmus+ programme guide). This main aim is specified in 4 specific objectives: (1)to establish a map with the institutional policies for attending to vulnerable groups in relation to academic access and success; (2)to establish a plan for the higher education organisations with initiatives aimed at promoting the access and successful development of students who are under-represented in university centres; (3)to develop solutions for the phases embracing the access, permanence (and success) of vulnerable students and non-traditional learners in the institutions of higher education; (4)to create a laboratory for reflection on and the promotion of the social commitment of Higher Education institutions in relation with the most vulnerable student groups.\r\n\r\nN\u00b0 and profile of the participants:\r\nThe consortium is made up of six partners from six different countries. It comprises six HEIs with extensive experience and running international projects. ACCESS4ALL is also endorsed by several stakeholders in each partner country. The managing partner, the UAB, has staff with experience of successfully developing national and international projects in relation to Higher Education institutions, tutoring, student dropout, access by vulnerable groups and non-traditional learners to university, among others (for more information: http:// edo.uab.cat).\r\nThe partners have been carefully selected because of their previous experience, their University curriculums and their links.

The main objective of the project was to carry out these two training cycles by focusing on practical problems from the real world, which would represent a significant technological challenge, dealing with issues related to renewable energy solutions, environmental sustainability, ecology, health sciences, Civil security, etc.\r\n \r\nEach cycle consisted of a first module of four intensive training courses in mathematical research, a second module dedicated to mathematical modeling workshops, an intermediate period between both modules dedicated to the development of an online project and as the last phase of each cycle, a final project. The two modules, the intermediate project and the final project were duly coordinated, so that the training received in the intensive courses was necessary for the preparation of the intermediate project, for the mathematical modeling workshops associated with each intensive course and for the development of the final project. In each cycle a group of approximately 20 postgraduate students were trained.\r\n\r\nThe conceptualization of the MODCLIM project has in itself been a novel approach to postgraduate training in the field of industrial mathematics. The project has assimilated and combined characteristics of previous experiences and models that have been successfully developed in Europe, such as the \u201cMathematical Study Groups with Industry\u201d (University of Oxford), \u201cStudy Groups with Industry and Modeling Weeks\u201d (ESGI and ECMI); Together with innovative and non-European successful models, as is the case provided by the \u201cResearch in Industrial Projects for Students\u201d (RIPS) developed by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (University of California). With it\u00b4s new approach, MODCLIM was able to interconnect several stages of research training and managed each cycle to form a much broader training period, approximately one semester, than that of the models that preceded it. In addition, it managed to extend its activities to the Sub-Mediterranean region. These advances place MODCLIM as a successful model that could serve as a reference for future similar initiatives, and represents a guarantee of sustainability of the results and intellectual outputs of the project.\r\n\r\nThe most important intellectual outputs of the project are those related to the final MODCLIM Manual, in which each team described the methodology applied and the conclusions obtained. The recipients of these results are both institutions and professors and postgraduate students interested in activities related to mathematics and industry, and who may be interested either in the problems themselves or in organizing activities / initiatives similar to those developed during the MODCLIM project.\r\n\r\nAnother outstanding intellectual result is an article that describes the MODCLIM project and its results, which have been admitted for publication in the Proceedings of the \u201c19th European Conference on Mathematics for Industry \u2013 ECMI\u201d, held in Santiago de Compostela from June 13 to 17, 2016, and published by the Springer Journal.

By including the reduction of revenue loss through increased downtime, overall savings can be greater. In addition, project SMEs will have enhanced access to the EU wind turbine maintenance market, set to reach 42\u20ac billion, i.e., 30% of renewable sources revenue by 2020.", 141078.0, 997224.0, 5, 9, "AutoWinSpec", null, "http://www.stirling-dynamics.com", null, "fp7_185465_997663237"], [1364774400000, 1427760000000, "In-Line Service For Internal Inspection Of Unpiggable Buried Oil Pipelines Using Long Range Ultrasound Guided Waves In Fifty Metre Segments", "Stirling Dynamics Ltd", "This proposal will aim to develop the enabling technology that will enable existing pipe crawling robots (pigs) to provide internal inspection of pipe walls using long range ultrasound guided waves (LRUG) deployed in pipe segments of about fifty metre length.\n\nThe aim is to perform total volume inspection far more rapidly, accurately and cheaply than is presently achieved with magnetic and ultrasonic pigs by developing a circumferential collar of LRUG sensors and novel time reversal focussing to produce a map of the circumferential and axial pipe corrosion and cracks. As LRUG sensors detect all significant corrosion in oil and gas pipelines within typically 50 metre of the sensors in a few milliseconds, long lengths of pipe can be scanned very rapidly with sample wave echo patterns obtained only every 50 metres thereby data storage requirements will be orders of magnitude less than present inspection methods. The speed of travel through the pipe could thus be faster than pigs that gather data with ultrasonic compression probes.\n\nTo test the technology developed by the project, the LRUG collar will be deployed initially by a mechanism to pull the collar through a pipe full of water at different constant and also varying speeds.\n\nA prototype robot will be developed that is intrinsically safe for operation in explosive environments and that is lightweight (neutrally buoyant) to investigate how best to deploy the LRUG technology in a real pipeline with faster travel and cheaper robots.", 116515.0, 855176.0, 4, 8, "PIGWAVES", "http://www.pigwaves.eu/", "http://www.stirling-dynamics.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149322.jpg", "fp7_107498_997663237"], [1327708800000, 1380240000000, "Control and Alleviation of Loads in Advanced Regional Turbo Fan Configurations", "Stirling Dynamics Ltd", "A novel adaptive winglet concept will be developed to enable controlled cant angle orientation and twist throughout the flight envelope whilst also providing a passive gust loads alleviation capability.

In fact the total energy cost of a few years of operation can almost equal the cost of the hardware infrastructure. Energy efficiency is already a primary concern for the design of any computer system and it is unanimously recognized that Exascale systems will be strongly constrained by power.<br/>The analysis of the performance of HPC systems since 1993 shows exponential improvements at the rate of one order of magnitude every 3 years: One petaflops was achieved in 2008, one exaflops is expected in 2020. Based on a 20 MW power budget, this requires an efficiency of 50 GFLOPS/Watt. However, the current leader in energy efficiency achieves only 1.7 GFLOPS / Watt. Thus, a 30x improvement is required.<br/>In this project, we believe that HPC systems developed from today's energy-efficient solutions used in embedded and mobile devices are the most likely to succeed. As of today, the CPUs of these devices are mostly designed by ARM. However, ARM processors have not been designed for HPC, and ARM chips have never been used in HPC systems before, leading to a number of significant challenges.<br/>The Mont-Blanc project has three objectives:- To develop a fully functional energy-efficient HPC prototype using low-power commercially available embedded technology- To design a next-generation HPC system together with a range of embedded technologies in order to overcome the limitations identified in the prototype system- To develop a portfolio of exascale applications to be run on this new generation of HPC systems.<br/>This will produce a new type of computer architecture capable of setting future global HPC standards that will provide Exascale performance using 15 to 30 times less energy.", 160062.0, 11570496.0, 5, 14, "Mont-Blanc", null, null, null, "fp7_100076_969692414"]]}}}}
