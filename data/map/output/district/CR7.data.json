Today we are found in a big health landscape characterized by large volume, versatility and velocity (3Vs) which has led to the evolution of the informatics in the big biodata domain. AEGLE project will build an innovative ICT solution addressing the whole data value chain for health based on: cloud computing enabling dynamic resource allocation, HPC infrastructures for computational acceleration and advanced visualization techniques. AEGLE will:\n- Realize a multiparametric platform using algorithms for analysing big biodata including features such as volume properties, communication metrics and bottlenecks, estimation of related computational resources needed, handling data versatility and managing velocity \n- Address the systemic health big bio-data in terms of the 3V multidimensional space, using analytics based on PCA techniques \n- Demonstrate AEGLE\u2019s efficiency through the provision of aggregated services covering the 3V space of big bio-data. Specifically it will be evaluated in: a)big biostreams where the decision speed is critical and needs non-linear and multi-parametric estimators for clinical decision support within limited time, b)big-data from non-malignant diseases where the need for NGS and molecular data analytics requires the combination of cloud located resources, coupled with local demands for data and visualization, and finally c)big-data from chronic diseases including EHRs and medication, with needs for quantified estimates of important clinical parameters, semantics\u2019 extraction and regulatory issues for integrated care \n- Bring together all related stakeholders, leading to integration with existing open databases, increasing the speed of AEGLE adaptation \n- Build a business ecosystem for the wider exploitation and targeting on cross-border production of custom multi-lingual solutions based on AEGLE.", 291503.0, 4983433.0, 8, 14, "AEGLE", null, null, null, "h2020_194261_951232150"], [1383264000000, 1509408000000, "WELCOME - Wearable Sensing and Smart Cloud Computing for Integrated Care to COPD Patients with Co-morbidities", "Croydon Health Services National Health Service Trust", "WELCOME is an ambitious project aiming to develop an integrated care approach for continuous monitoring, early diagnosis and detection of worsening events and treatment of patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with comorbidities Chronic Heart Failure, Diabetes, Anxiety and Depression.<br/>The WELCOME solution for the patient will be based on:1. An adjustable, wearable and washable vest providing continuous monitoring of a large number of sensors each one measuring various physiological signals, like chest sounds, pleural effusion, tachycardia or arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation etc,. The vest will be comfortable, inconspicuous, and easy to put on by the patient, it will require simple maintenance (simultaneous sensor recharging, normal washing procedure) and can be modified according to each patient's individual needs.2. Wearable sensors for measuring blood trends like glucose, cholesterols, triglycerides, potassium, serum creatinine, blood pressure etc in a periodic basis.3. Inhaler devices for measuring and evaluating the medical adherence of the patients.<br/>Remote, continuous monitoring and analysis of patient multi-parametric data, such as physiological, environmental, emotional and genetic data, will be used for designing the personalized integrated care programs ranging from self-care guidance and regulation (e.g e-coaching) at home and outdoors to professional primary and secondary health-care support (e.g including telemonitoring and remote support or comprehensive expert support at the clinic). The process will be facilitated by a cloud based Decision Support System, providing statistical/intelligent analysis of the therapy policies and patient conditions enhanced by multiple patients' data fusion and discovery of patterns on the patient's disease progress.<br/>Great attention will be paid to the small-scale validation of the project and its impact on healthcare in five countries (Greece, UK, Ireland, Germany and Nethelands).", 187689.0, 6641759.0, 8, 13, "WELCOME", null, null, null, "fp7_111360_951232150"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["RJ6", "Croydon University Hospital", "nhs_RJ611"]]}}}}
