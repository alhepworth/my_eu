A working farm provides healthy outdoor activity for children and brings balance to the activities that take place in the classroom, however there are many obstacles that hinders activities in farms/with farmers. In particular there is a high need of increasing the collaboration between farmers and teachers. Teachers need to be more aware of the potential of farms in terms of learning contexts, while farmers need to be more aware of their role as pedagogues. Both of them need to plan, design, and implement together the educational activities in order to increase their quality and effectiveness.\r\n\u201cDEveloping interdisciplinary Methodologies in Education Through Enhanced Relationships between schools and farms\u201d is a project aimed at improving the quality of school education provision by an increased collaboration between schools and farms. Its acronym DEMETER is related to the ancient greek of agriculture as reminder of the relation between man and agriculture.\r\nThe partners have defined the following specific objectives on the basis of common needs of participating schools and organisations:\r\n1. To increase the integration of experience of farms into the school curriculum in the framework of a wider path of education to food, respect for the environment, health\r\n2. To improve the teaching skills among school teachers and educational farms operators by exchanging, consolidating and developing methodologies appropriate to a farm experience\r\n3. To create synergies among education, institutions, business and research for the improvement of education.\r\nIn order to achieve the above mentioned objective DEMETER will be devoted to develop 2 intellectual outputs:\r\nIO1: An interdisciplinary teaching methodology based on the collaboration between schools and farms.\r\nIt will be a physical and virtual toolkit containing all the practices divided for subjects that can be carried out in a school year with the collaboration of farmers. It will be in 4 languages: English, Swedish, Italian and Portuguese in order to facilitate the use.\r\nIO2: Guidelines aimed at facilitating the use of the interdisciplinary methodology in other schools and countries. They will contain step-by-step procedures to set up educational activities between schools and farms, including, the preconditions necessary, the practical/operative instructions and quality indicators to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of activities.\r\n\r\nTransnational activities will take place in 6 project meetings aimed at steering the project activities and evaluating the results, and one joint  staff training event participated by 26 teachers and technicians aimed at preparing the practitioners involved in the testing of the interdisciplinary methodology developed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the activities carried out DEMETER will: deliver two innovative outputs which will be mainstreamed thanks to the creation of networks of stakeholders; increase the collaboration among farmers and teachers; strengthen the participation of the local community (in particular the business sector) in school education.\r\nHowever one of the most relevant impacts of DEMETER will be increased collaboration among teachers in school through the interdisciplinary methodology that will link learning outcomes of multiple subjects to teaching in farm or with farmers. Last but not least, pupils will be the final beneficiary, the project will create more interactive teaching practices that will increase their participation and performance in all subjects, especially science and maths, which are a priority at European level. By studying in farms they will also learn transversal competences such as: raise awareness on environmental, food related issues, and the resources of their rural community. All these elements will contribute to raise more aware citizens of tomorrow.", "http://www.washingboroughacademy.org/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA201-039146_4"], [2017, "European healthy pupils and skilled educators via integrated school food systems [EPESS]", "Washingborough Academy", 137829.0, 3, 10, "This will be a collaborative project spanning 26 months years across 10 partners in the UK, Denmark and the Czech Republic to strengthen cooperation between organisations working towards a common goal to promote health, learning and sustainable development.

However EPESS presents the opportunity to formalise these relationships and maximise the work that all partner organisations are doing to improve attitudes towards health and food within schools and the relevant education. Led by FFL and supported by LOMA, SZS and UWE, this programme will follow a pattern of blended mobility incorporating school staff exchange programmes, training webinars and following evaluation of the teaching methods, best practice learnt and confidence gained.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of the programme is to elucidate best practice in improving health and attitudes to food in the school community in order to increase capacity of the partner organisations and empower the partner school participants. The results of EPESS will cover new techniques to encourage whole school participation, implementing food activities in schools, the use of IT in encouraging healthy attitudes, sustainable development in schools and new ideas on the role of food in areas of socio-economic deprivation. These results will then be widely disseminated in all three countries through school networks, online portals and websites, academic publications, social media and government steering groups.\r\n\r\nThe immediate beneficiaries will be the partner organisations and schools included within EPESS but in the longer term, EPESS will impact schools interested in improving the welfare of their pupils and quality of food activities, as well as policy makers and other organisations also working towards improved efficacy, health and development amongst schools.", "http://www.washingboroughacademy.org/", "THE SOIL ASSOCIATION LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036801_1"], [2016, "Read, Write, Eat", "Washingborough Academy", 35983.0, 3, 3, "\u2018Read, Write, Eat\u2019 is a two year project with the main focus being on improving the attainment of Literacy through creating opportunities for all three partnership schools to write, for a given purpose, through a wide range of genres. A theme that underpins the project is 'food'. As during communication we discovered each school shares a love and passion for food and it is something that our pupils engage with. In addition, food is a topic that connects all cultures and at the current minute is a fundamental issue within the curriculum. The three chosen partner schools have been chosen due to previous good, strong communication links and previous eTwinning projects. Number 8 School in Elblag have previously visited Washingborough Academy in February 2016 and the Slovenia partner school have worked with Number 8 School on a number of eTwinning projects. The focus group of children, who will be tracked and assessed, will be chosen from one class from each school; aged between eight and eleven. However, more children within each school will be involved in the Literacy activities planned, as they can be accessed by a wide age range. Participants will learn, analyse and develop their understanding of a wide range of genre types with a general theme of \u2018food\u2019 \u2013 a fundamental topic across the world (child obesity, healthy living etc). Examples of genres include: formal letter writing, persuasive writing, instructional texts, poetry and narratives. Six activities have been planned, one per term of the two year project, with a specific reading and writing focus.  Alongside each of the classroom activities planned there will be a transitional project meeting. This will follow on from the classroom activity, with the sharing of work that has been produced by the children, in preparation for each meeting. In addition, at these project meetings staff will share their own expertise and good practice, both at school level and at national level. Each project meeting will also have a specific focus for example: planning, assessment, classroom resources and writing moderation. Furthermore, these project meetings will be carried out in a four phase approach: review of previous meetings and impact of activities so far, professional debates and discussion, classroom observations and an opportunity to plan the next activity together. Overall, the two year project will lead to improvement in the attainment of both writing and reading and developing the international work within the three partnership schools. Due to the age range of the children involved, the activities will be delivered and carried out in the mother tongue of each partnership school. However, various pieces of work from each activity will be translated so that the children can share and compare their work. This sharing of work will help raise the standards of the children and also the participating teachers.", "http://www.washingboroughacademy.org/", "Washingborough Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024404_coordinator"]]}}, "1LH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Managing for @ School of Success", "Branston Junior Academy", 180710.0, 6, 7, "The decentralization of Public School Systems in Portugal, which was approved by the following legal document: Dec.

The partnership will focus on Literacy, a basic skill. The innovation is in the development of writing skills through a range of international cooperation activities as a platform to raise standards across the four participating countries. The British and Polish partners have worked together since 2008 when the Guadeloupe connection started. The Italian school joined more recently and provides another different perspective and expertise. \r\n\r\nThe core activities will initially be undertaken by one class of approximately 30 pupils aged nine and ten in each school from September 2015. Participants will learn about a number of international concepts and issues, whilst maintaining a focus on writing in different genres for different audiences. Examples of genres include persuasive writing, fiction and non-chronological reports. Five activities have been planned, one per term in the typical three term year, each with a specific writing focus. Examples of international themes include the study of local environmental issues  and a study of traditional tales and legends local to each partner school.  However, this pattern and the exact themes may be varied where appropriate because of each school\u2019s organization, and local and national priorities  e.g. the co-ordinating school will link outputs to the International School Award.  In September 2015 the first cohort in each school will progress into the second year while a new cohort enters the cycle from the beginning. Modifications to content and approach will be made as deemed necessary through on-going evaluation by class teachers, peer review through transnational meetings and progression levels judged through outcomes scored through each school\u2019s national assessment criteria. \r\n\r\nAlongside each each of these classroom activities there will be a transnational project meeting. This will follow the classroom activity with work being produced by the children in preparation for this meeting.  Staff will share expertise and practice, both at a school level and at a national level.  Each of these project meetings will have a specific focus, for example planning, assessment, classroom resources, writing moderation, and each will include three phases, a review of decisions made at the last meeting and the impact these have had in the classroom and on children's learning, professional debates and discussions and classroom observations based on the planned theme, and an opportunity to think ahead as to how these will impact on our next planned classroom activity.\r\n\r\nOverall, the two year project will lead to both improved writing and also the embedding of international work in each of the schools. The age range of the pupils is such that each class will use its mother tongue for the majority of its work.  However,  samples will be translated so that the children themselves can share and compare. This will enhance not only the performance of pupils but also raise the professional profile of all participating teachers.  As the project evolves and more good practice linking international dimension themes with enhanced writing skills can be identified, the techniques and outcomes will be written up as case studies. These exemplar materials of high class learning opportunities will be disseminated to wider local, national and international audiences through a variety of approaches to provide long-term benefits to audiences inside and outside the partner schools.", "http://Www.branston-junior.lincs.sch.uk", "Branston Junior Academy", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013447_coordinator"], [2017, "Dream a Little Dream: Developing reading skills  and inspiring readers in an ever increasingly technological world.", "Branston Junior Academy", 37157.0, 3, 3, "Our project, entitled 'Dream a Little Dream: Developing reading skills and inspiring readers in an ever increasing technological world', aims to do exactly this!  Inspiration for the project comes initially from a magazine article entitled 'Dream a Little Dream', written by British children's author Michael Morpurgo in the November / December  2016 edition of the ATL teaching union magazine. In this article he addresses the concept of encouraging teacher to give children 'the love of a story first and the rest will follow'.  He suggests we 'Invite in parents and grandparents, people from the local community and from the world community to come in and tell their stories..'  From this, our project ideas of a transnational project based on reading, was formed. \r\n\r\nPartners are all in agreement that inspiring children to read for pleasure is essential in the development of this key skill.  In the modern world, where technology plays such a part in almost everything we do, we want to explore ways of developing reading skills further and embrace the age of technology in supporting us to do so.  This will be at the children's level, in terms of the use of e-readers, apps and computer tablets to inspire reading skills, but also by creating blogs and using video conferencing to encourage and promote 'book talk', and for staff of each partner school to communicate to support each other and share best practice. \r\n\r\nThree partner schools are involved in the project. The Polish and British partners currently work together on a KA2 Schools only project and have worked together since 2008. The Spanish partner school is new to this particular collaboration but are familiar with working together with other schools local to them who are involved in Erasmus+ collaborative projects. Each school has one named coordinator, in order to provide consistency, and also has an additional named member of staff to ensure sustainability of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project is made up of four classroom-based phases, exploring different elements of reading; Phase 1: My favourite book; Phase 2: Traditional and Cultural Stories; Phase 3: Poetry and Phase 4: Reading and Technology.  Transnational meetings are planned in at strategic points, either to evaluate the project so far, or prepare staff for further planned activities, and in many cases, both.  Staff will work with children in the hosting school to deliver a range of reading activities and also to write contributions to a joint story book - which will be one of the outcomes at the end of the project.  We will also spend time sharing best practice in the teaching of reading and considering how we can each adapt and improve teaching methods in our own schools, within the constraints of specific curriculum requirements.\r\n\r\nOne of the intended outcomes of this project will be the greater enthusiasm that children will show in the discussion of reading and in the development of this key skill, which in turn, will have a positive impact on other areas of their learning.  This will be measured in a number of ways, including eading assessments undertaken by individual partner schools, and by staff and children surveys to measure the 'softer' impact on learners. Collaboration with children in partner schools will drive children forward and inspire them further, giving them the platform for communication beyond their own school and local area.  The joint ownership of the story book written by staff and children during project meetings, will further inspire children.  This book will be available beyond the project to be used by future children of the partner schools, therefore maximising impact of the project as a whole.  Online communication between students set up for this project will be continued after the two years is over, therefore providing an additional long term benefit.  Teachers will learn from each other in terms of developing their own classroom practice; another example of a long term benefit of our project.", "http://Www.branston-junior.lincs.sch.uk", "Branston Junior Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036536_coordinator"]]}}, "4SJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "School EU Professional Development Project", "Coningsby St Michaels C of E Primary School", 35809.0, 1, 1, "Coningsby St Michael\u2019s Church of England Primary school is a school for children aged four to eleven with approximately 330 children on roll. Our school is organised into 14 classes with 2 classes in each year group.  The majority of our children are of White British ethnicity and a significant number of our children are \u2018forces families\u2019 with one or more parent serving in the Royal Air Force. With such a high proportion of \u2018forces families\u2019 mobility of our children is quite high. We are a Church of England school and have strong links with our local church and community. The Church School values we teach the children are the foundations to our school and underpin our curriculum. \r\n\r\nOver the last three years our school have grown in size and we have experienced a high volume of staffing changes. The school has generous grounds but due to these staffing changes are not being used to their full potential to impact on learning for the children. Our Senior Leaders are concerned that although we have a new and well designed outdoor learning area, few of our staff are confident to use it to encourage learning. Additionally, 50% of our teaching staff are within the first 3 years of their careers, the chance to train in different teaching methods and strategies which would encourage them to use the resources we have available with greater impact on pupil outcomes. To benefit our pupils, we need to increase the flexibility, creativity and confidence that \r\nour staff have when  approaching  their teaching.\r\n\r\nObjective 1: To lead and deliver a creative curriculum within our school.\r\nObjective 2: To develop teacher confidence and proficiency in leading outdoor learning.\r\nObjective 3: To increase the language proficiency within our school to fully meet the needs of the curriculum. \r\n\r\nTo meet our objectives, we will send 7 of our learning leaders to Sweden and to Portugal on outdoor learning courses. This will allow them to learn new strategies in different educational settings, which can be used in our school. These strategies will then be delivered as in school training and twilight sessions to the rest of our teaching staff. In addition, we will send 7 teachers in the first year of our project to France during October half term on French immersion courses.  The French Immersion Course providers have been offering similar training for teachers from London, Essex and Warrington for several years and they have been recommended by British Council Ambassadors supporting our school.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this training by 2019 we aim to have a creative curriculum, which all children in school can access and benefit from. Our staff will feel more confident in delivering creative lessons and will have gained experience in different teaching strategies and methods to employ within their own lessons. All children will be able to regularly participate in outdoor learning, which compliments the teaching of the national curriculum and makes the most of our new outdoor environments. We also expect evaluations to show that our  teaching of French has much improved and that as a school, we have not only a much more confident and creative approach to learning but that we have significantly increased our reputation as a  learning school with a Global outlook.", "http://www.coningsbyprimary.co.uk", "Coningsby St Michaels C of E Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036015_coordinator"]]}}}}
