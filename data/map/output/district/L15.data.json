AquaMMS will be suitable for use primarily in land-based aquaculture industry, but other markets are also relevant including environmental monitoring sector and the water supply industry. This technology will provide the fish farmer with advance warning of a broad range of potential pollutants, like toxic metals, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, hydrogen sulphide and geosmins. These pollutants can otherwise inflict chronic stress on the farmed fish resulting in disease outbreaks and/or poor product quality, which means lost profit to the fish farms. Most of these parameters are at present technically challenging to measure accurately on a regular basis and may only be analysed when problems arise on the farm and samples are sent for more comprehensive analysis at external laboratories. Q-technologies (UK) has successfully developed miniature mass spectrometry (MMS) technology for the oil and gas industry, and has seen the need and potential in developing and marketing a similar system for the aquaculture industry. Therefore, they have taken the initiative to propose the AquaMMS project by combining forces with the  SMES, Faaltech (Ireland) and BAMO (Germany). Together, these SMEs will form the production and distribution chain of the product post project. Anglesey Aquaculture Ltd (UK) and Telemarks Roye as (Norway) will take part in the project representing the end user community and will act as a test sites for the developed technology. Anglsey Aquaculture and Telemarks Roye will benefit from improved production by using AquaMMS ahead of its competitors.

It will detect a range of substances, including but not limited to people, drugs, explosives (including weapons) and CBRNe. The technology will complement trained sniffer dogs.  The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability \u2013 critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility. Sniffles has the potential to significantly impact on National Security and border control and enable exploitation of International Markets. Performance will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art conventional MS system and security sniffer dogs \u2013 within the context of a border security checkpoint.

This will enable high throughput screening of soft targets such as vehicles, people and their personal effects.  \n\nThe technology is based on a linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer (MS) operating in a non-scanning mode. A non-scanning LIT allows selective ion monitoring of target threat molecules using optimal voltages for each ion mass without performing a full mass spectral scan. This result is higher sensitivity, simpler control electronics, smaller size, lower power consumption and cost. The limits of detection of LIT-MS instrument are in low parts per billion (ppb) with parts per trillion (ppt) levels achievable with suitable analyte enrichment provided by a pre-concentrator. Once the MS fingerprint of an unknown substance is measured, it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. \n\nIn 2014 pre-prototype instrument was demonstrated in FP7 Project SNIFFLES.

From a European perspective, the traditional signalling is one of the most conservative parts of the railway system strongly bound to the national traditions by all involved parties.Since 1990 the EU is promoting the reformation of parts of the signalling subsystem under the ERTMS programme.However this covers not the whole signalling system.The implementation of ETCS could be hampered, in areas of the conventional European rail network, where interlocking will need to be replaced, if this cannot be carried out in an economically and technically efficient manner. Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles.
