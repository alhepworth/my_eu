We will establish a French Club for extra curricular activities which will be open for Key Stage two children with a particular interest in learning French.  We will begin to teach French to a Year group, with a view to incorporating other year groups as our confidence grows in delivering a foreign language.

It will be monitored for its impact by the project team and governors.  We are expecting to see a rise in the cultural understanding levels of the children taking part in these activities and the acquirement of high frequency words by those learning the language.  The intercultural awareness of our extended community should also be improved.  \r\n\r\nWhen we are successful the school will be poised to reap the longer term benefits of shared good practice, confident teachers of a foreign language, children who love learning and an effective language curriculum that is being embedded into the life of the school, as well as the capacity to maintain it.", "http://www.st-teresas.bolton.sch.uk", "St Teresa's RC Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013036_coordinator"]]}}, "1JG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Mytham French Language Development Initiative", "Mytham Primary School", 13098.0, 1, 1, "At Mytham we have been teaching languages for many years and have had a good relationship with the local high school who were able to help and support us in language teaching.
