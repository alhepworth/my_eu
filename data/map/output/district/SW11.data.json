At the same time, the efficient use of energy is becoming increasingly important. The Answer for all these is the technique KNX.What is the CNC?CNC Machining is a process used in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. Tools that can be controlled in this manner include lathes, mills, routers and grinders. The CNC in CNC Machining stands for Computer Numerical Control.In the project entitled \u2013 \u2018Training of Teachers in KNX (Advanced Level) and in CNC\u2019, 12 teachers will take part, divided in 2 groups, from the sectors of Electrical, Mechanical, Electronics and Computer Science of the 2nd LC of Magnesia Region in Central Greece.The first group consists of 7 teachers who will be trained and certified for 5 days in the Advanced Level course of KNX and the second group consists of 5 teachers who will be trained and certified for 5 days in field of CNC.  The main objective of the program is the acquisition of certificates by the two groups. The 12 teachers participating in the project are all from technical disciplines, with recognized expertise in education policy, expertise and guidance in the labor market, and willingness for continuous training. The 12 teachers have a university degree and some of them have postgraduate specialty. All the activities will take place in the facilities of the \u2018HOT\u2019 daily from 09:00 to 18:00 for five days.The following topics are covered during a KNX Advanced Level course:- Fail-safe planning- Flags- HVAC control with KNX- Integrated applications- Interworking - Couplers- Lighting control- Security technology- Logic operations- Visualisation Systems- ETS Apps- KNX and Multimedia- KNX and Smart Metering- At the end of the KNX Advanced Level course, there will be practical exams- Award Confirmation and CertificatesThe following topics are covered during a CNC course:-  Machining terms - CNC Controllers- General programming terms for CNC - Programming using the G-Code- Advanced topics for programming CNC - Practical applications - optimum cutting strategies, concerns - Multi-axis programming - Subroutines- Management of subroutines in CNC Controller- CAM App- Parametric programming- Creating and calling macros- Managements of CAM parameters- Probing - Award Confirmation and CertificatesThe first group of teachers will be monitored \u2013 evaluated by the Director of the 2nd LC. Mr. I. Beretas and the second one by the Head of the Sector of the Mechanical Division I, Mr. A.

As a fully organized and equipped public authority, LC can meet the current educational needs in technical and professional entities and can support actions on qualified certification of their members, as well as on the harmonization with existing European practices.Through this session of training, the staff of the 2nd LC will be trained, certified and develop skills in modern technology areas, allowing them to meet on equal terms with their European partners.At the same time, this training of the two groups in English language, besides improving the use of the language, will add to the significant understanding of the technical terms they already use, sometimes incorrectly or without knowing their exact meaning.Upon completion of the program the educational processes that the 2nd LC will provide will be updated and in tune with their respective European organizations, which is a national criterion, commitment and obligation.As stated in the information note of CEDEFOP (March 2015), \"...

The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.\nTangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free.

It is a two form entry Primary School in the borough of Wandsworth and for children aged three to eleven years old. Children at Chesterton belong to a diverse multicultural Wandsworth community in this economically deprived (39.2%  free school meals) inner-city London area. \r\n\r\nTwo thirds of pupils (62%) are EAL when they join Chesterton, speaking 36 languages.
