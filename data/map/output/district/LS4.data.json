Turkey is capable of manufacturing %20 of whole world\u2019s carpet need while whole Europe\u2019s manufacturing share is approximately over %45. It is estimated that the number of employment in the carpet manufacturing sector is over half a million people across European countries such as Turkey, Belgium, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. Although being a great sector, it suffers from several issues such as the lack of qualified technical staff. Furthermore, although carpet manufacturing is very widespread in Europe, there is not an existent definition of some carpet related vocations such as carpet operators. Accordingly, ISCED, the main catalogue of vocation definitions and curriculum, do not have required competency definitions for such mentioned vocations. Therefore, graduates of relevant institutions do not have the required practical experience until they are employed in a sectoral enterprise. They have the required competencies informally through practical experience and few number of in-service training facilities in the company. This causes several negative results such as increase in overhead costs, reduction in the effectiveness of the operations, economic losses and diminish of the competitiveness of the companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo address the above mentioned problems, the consortium will develop a novel curriculum that adopts a new pedagogical aspect. And secondly, ICT-based learning tools such an e-learning platform and interactive DVD based software will be constructed to present the content. The benefits of interactive online and offline system will help overcome the major issues caused by the lack of practical experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project consortium that will implement the project is a multi-character team constituted of different types of foundations including VET institutions (university, vocational school), a SME in the relevant sector, a chamber of sectoral companies and a commercial company with expertise on e-learning and its applications on VET systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation of the project, the consortium will mainly focus on seven main tasks through the project activities: \r\n\r\n1) Analysis of the sector and related vocations by inclusion of the target groups into the project via a two-phase survey system \r\n\r\n2) Development of an innovative curriculum that utilizes the ICT-based learning tools which will be developed in the project\r\n\r\n3) Development of the learning content and video production.\r\n\r\n4) Transfer, adaptation and development of e-learning infrastructure (online learning tools)\r\n\r\n5) Development of the offline derivative of the e-learning software which will be a DVD-based software (offline learning tools)\r\n\r\n6) Testing, feedback, data collection, evaluation and improvement step\r\n\r\n7) Dissemination and exploitation of the project outcomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the project is implemented as planned, there will be six tangible outputs of the project:\r\n\r\n1- A web platform that provides a meeting point for relevant stakeholders and project partners\r\n\r\n2- A survey report that analyzes vocational status of carpet manufacturing related jobs in partner countries.\r\n\r\n3- A novel curriculum for machinery carpet manufacturing related vocations that adopts innovative approaches\r\n\r\n4- An e-learning platform that implements the novel curriculum\r\n\r\n5- An offline solution specifically built for easily distributing and working in DVD format.\r\n\r\n6- Relevant documentation for project products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected impact on target group(s) are as follows:\r\n\r\na) Trainers / Educators of the relevant VET institutions including project partners and institutions that will be reached within the project lifetime will have a proper curriculum for carpet production process. Thus, graduates will be more competent for their jobs. Relevant sector will overcome difficulties in finding qualified technical staff. Then, overhead costs related to product deficits, production ineffectiveness will be removed.\r\n\r\nb) Difficulties in training related to the expensive and continuously advancing hardware/equipment will be tolerated and overcome. Therefore, VET institutions will be enabled to offer training on machinery based carpet manufacturing. This option may also activate independent VET courses that specialize on carpet manufacturing by use of project products as blended learning material.\r\n\r\nc) Companies that use the e-learning environment will have a good in-service training material. This will also contribute to the effectiveness of the sector companies.\r\n\r\nd) New graduates and unemployed individuals that are planning to enter into the carpet manufacturing sector will have the opportunity to get a free service that enables them to perform self-paced, fast and effective learning.", "http://www.elearning-textiles.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-TR01-KA202-012983_2"]]}}, "2JT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Learn English Through Signs", "Domi Domingo LTD", 96810.0, 3, 4, "The project Learn English Through Signs (LETS) will develop the approach of Learning English through using signs in the area of early language learning with children from 2- 6 years old) It will also develop and test  training materials and courses for child care practitioners and early years teachers courses.  The same methodology will be used in all countries but the target groups will be different.\r\nWithin the United Kingdom, the project will be targeted at early years education settings and children (2-6) whose first language is not English. This project therefore aims to develop a new model where all children in the educational setting can support the children whose first language is not English in learning new English words.\r\nElsewhere the project will however also aim to develop innovative methods of language learning in early years which can develop a holistic approach to language teaching and build on the diversity of todays multilingual classrooms. This will be done by introducing a new model of English to early learners between the ages of 2 and 6 in Slovenia and Poland.\r\nThe project will  and implement several intellectual outputs:  training courses for  child care professionals in preschool education  to equip them with the knowledge and skills of how to incorporate sign supported language use/learning into their existing educational settings and to enhance the early second language development of the children in their care. We therefore aim at \u201cstrengthening the profile of teaching profession\u201d, by providing  training materials for sign supported English language instruction aimed at parents as well as child care professionals and language teachers, they will be available via on line learning community. The activities will be developed through networks and open dialogue among all involved categories of stakeholders; linguists, child care professionals, experts in the field of early years education, in special needs education, curriculum authorities, schools and kindergartens, parents and others.\r\nOur further aim is to create a more meaningful dialogue between home and early childhood settings to support language learning. We will do so through the increased participation of parents in both the development as well as the implementation of LETS  curriculum. We will benefit from the wealth of cultural and linguistic experience which the early childhood professionals can draw upon.  In addition we aim to engage parents into teaching  their children also at home, and will therefore prepare and implement the parents/children sign supported English language activities with the basic English  signs  vocabulary which can be used with the mother tongue as well as second language. In this way we will stimulate children\u2019s natural condition to code switching from one language to another using the signs as a common denomina.\r\nWe are therefore aiming at enhancing the quality of early childhood education and care (ECEC) and are introducing the method of early English language learning which  will be accessible to all also on line. \r\nThe project mobilises appropriate institutions from 3 European countries bringing together a critical mass with complementary educational expertise, a diverse number of learners in countries with different early language learning policies and different needs in  second language learning given their geographical location, affiliations and culture and specialists from disciplines such as foreign language learning ,  linguistics, inclusive education policies, pre-school education, teacher training of child care professionals and also project management.", "http://www.domidomingo.co.uk", "Tiny Signers", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036731_2"]]}}}}
