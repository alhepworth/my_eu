Moreover the training masters and the teachers in charge of the mobility project in each school write the work experiences \u2018purposes in order for each student to discover the business, its way of working, the work progresses and the responsibilities assigned.\r\n\r\nThe MFR are associative schools which have contracts with the government and the Breton council. They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded. It should also allow a higher creativity to grow up in our European and citizen society.\r\n\r\nThe European mobility is accessible to all vocational or technical A level students and should allow them to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Practice a foreign language and to improve it\r\n\u2022 Gain new Professional skills\r\n\u2022 Meet new people and discover their culture, their way of life  and their traditions\r\n\u2022 Push themselves\u2019 limits and to take responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the students could, after their studies become involved and proud European citizens able to create their future jobs and to increase the European competitiveness.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035440_9"]]}}, "9DE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1383177600000, "Overcome failure to Publish nEgative fiNdings", "Elizabeth Wager (Sideview)", "Full information about completed and ongoing clinical trials is the indispensable base for decision making about medical therapies and diagnostic procedures by patients and doctors. Equally, researchers and research organisations, ethics boards, governments and health system agencies, courts for social justice, pharmaceutical companies and all professional groups of the health care system are dependent on unbiased information.\nResearch projects have consistently shown that for approximately 50% of all launched trials results or reasons for their failure are never published. Not only pharmaceutical industry, but also researchers and their organisations, ethics boards and scientific journals are actively contributing to the general failure to come close to a 100% publication rate. An obvious reason is the complexity of the system as well as the limitation of resources, giving ample space for all stakeholders to avoid appropriate changes and draw attention to deficiencies outside their responsibility.\nThis project is based on the assumption that the existence of broad publication bias with seriously harmful impact has been accepted by all stakeholders and does not require further evidence. The current knowledge on publication bias and its impact will be summarized by systematic reviews of the relevant literature, with emphasis on the situation in the EU.\nOPEN focuses on the investigation of attitudes and handling of stakeholders involved in the whole knowledge translation process. Surveys, case studies and analyses of policies to reduce publication bias will be conducted to describe the current views and practice of stakeholders who are involved in knowledge translation.

An integral part of the training is an internship in a company in another European country which is supposed to last several weeks. As many trainees as possible will take part in the Erasmus+ project in their second year of training. Some companies already have partners with whom they exchange workers frequently outside Europe and therefore do not participate in this project.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce considers an internship lasting several weeks as a prerequisite to achieve the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management\u201c. This experience as an intern in another European country is essential for the course \u201cEuropean Business Administration and Economics\u201d as part of their curriculum.\r\nTheoretical knowledge gained during the first two years of study will be improved by gaining practical working experience.\r\nDifferent consumer types, product and assortment strategies, market communication strategies, service and price strategies (as in unit 4.3 of the curriculum) should be experienced and put to the test during the internship. \r\nOther topics, which will be experienced first-hand and then reassessed after being thoroughly prepared in the lessons, are personnel quality management (curriculum unit 3.3) and the difficulty of acknowledging different training qualifications (curriculum unit 3.6). \r\nThese issues should be dealt with within the topic \u201ccontinued education in companies\u201d. \r\nThe curriculum explicitly asks for an internship in a foreign country for the trainees: \u201cEuropean exchange programmes for young employees\u201d and \u201coptions for an internship abroad\u201d should be shown and discussed according to curriculum unit 3.7. \r\nIn general the trainees should have acquired high intercultural and social skills during their training, which should enable them to deal with European business partners adequately and competently. \r\nThis can be best achieved by doing an internship of considerable length abroad. \r\nOne goal is to enhance their personal experience, language skills and knowledge in their field of business and with respect to the curriculum. Another very important goal is to share the gained experience with the other trainees of this programme. From July to November 2018 the trainees should do their internship in different EU-countries. To gain an even wider picture it is important that as many participants as possible go to different places to gather different insights and share those with their classmates once they are back in school for their final year.
