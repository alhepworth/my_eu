The methodical frame of this technique has been elaborated by Mrs. Pam Schweizer (UK) who has revealed great potential which arises from the connection of reminiscence work with some branches of art, especially with theatre. The method of reminiscence works with autobiographies, is interested in life stories of people and thus supports the process of recalling. Shared remembrances are employed to support elderly person\u00b4s self-esteem and to establish or strengthen relationships with members of the reminiscence group or family members. To picture remembrances and stories from elderly people\u00b4s lives using dramatic techniques also enables seniors to utilize other than verbal resources. Senior citizens with dementia are often able to communicate verbally only with great difficulties, but motoric memory (which includes also texts of songs and poems) usually remains preserved much longer. Reminiscence theatre tries to work with retained potential of elderly people, enables them to experience that there are still areas in which they are competent and able to express themselves. Showing memories in the form of dramatic performance also makes use of emotional level of remembrances which can be revived through dramatic format and enables to transfer past experiences to present participants (both actors and spectators).    \r\n\r\nReminiscence theatre is a creative method whose goal is to bring better support to social inclusion of elderly citizens, especially elderly people handicapped by dementia and lack of family ties, or elderly immigrants. This technique enables senior citizens (even very fragile ones), children, young people, members of families and communities to cooperate and interact socially. \r\n\r\nMain goal of the project is the training of Reminiscence Centre (RC) employees during the mobility in London where they will attend training course of reminiscence theatre led by Pam Schweizer that will broaden the existing skills of the RC employees in this technique and enable them to gain new competences. \r\nOther activities are aimed at using, sharing and disseminating the reminiscence theatre technique in the course of various activities so that the knowledge and competences gained at the training course will be handed on to both professionals working with elderly people and other interested persons in the Czech Republic. \r\n\r\nPlanned disseminative activities:\r\n\u2022 to make up a training course called \u201cReminiscence Theatre \u2013 Living Memories Across Generations\u201d which will be accredited at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MPSV), and then use for training of professionals working with elderly people and other interested persons;\r\n\u2022 to include a chapter about reminiscence theatre into the prepared textbook \u201cReminiscence in practice\u201d;\r\n\u2022 to use the reminiscence theatre technique more professionally and competently in the course of other running projects, for example projects \u201cRemembering Yesterday Caring Today\u201d (for elderly people with dementia and their family carers) and \u201cTreasure Chest of Memories\u201d (for basic school children and their grandparents);\r\n\u2022 to give a report about reminiscence theatre at the conference called \u201cReminiscence in practice\u201d that will take place on 25th October 2018;\r\n\u2022 to present a practical example of the use of the reminiscence theatre technique created by the young participants of the training course in London \u2013 those young people will regularly meet with elderly people and they together will create reminiscence theatre scenes based on the life stories of the elderly people which will be performed at the conference \u201cReminiscence in practice\u201d on 25th October 2018. This practical example of the use of the reminiscence theatre technique will serve as an example of good practice and should become an inspiration for the participants at the conference so that they can get acquainted with this technique and could use it in their work with senior citizens. \r\n\r\nThe description of these activities clearly shows that most of them is planned in the way that enables all the trained participants of the project to use their skills and competences in reminiscence theatre in the long-term. The participants work in varied fields and environments (health services, social services, education) where they can transmit the reminiscence theatre technique to multiple target groups. \r\n\r\nA European dimension could be also counted among the great benefits of this project. The Reminiscence Centre is a representative of the Czech Republic among the partners in the European Reminiscence Network, and so the training course which the RC employees will attend can strengthen mutual connections with other European partners, enable to meet in person with other people working on this field and plan further possibilities of cooperation.", "http://www.europeanreminiscencenetwork.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA104-047516_1"]]}}, "7QD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1483142400000, "Platform for sharing best practices for management of rare diseases", "Jamarau", "RARE-Bestpractices will develop a sustainable networking platform, supporting the collection of standardized and validated data and efficient exchange of knowledge and reliable information on rare diseases (RD).\nRD are characterized by low prevalence (EU \u2013 5:10000 persons).

An international (work) expererience can contribute to establish this. By living and working in an international, multidisciplinary environment, students will have the space to gain knowledge of innovative ideas and changes and will ask for a flexible and an independent attitude. Increasing understanding of (people in) other cultures and being able to adapt to their attitude. This gives better chances of finding work and functioning well in an international or internationally oriented company. Increasing independence and in particular independent (life long) learning. Learning and gaining work experience in a different (company) culture. This is a much more powerful experience than reading about it or seeing it on television. It provides the student with the opportunity to translate his/her impressions and questions into personal learning objectives.The estimated number of students that will complete an international internship in this project amounts to 635.  This amount of students shows 15% growth compared to the last application, Call 15-17.
