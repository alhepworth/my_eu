To adapt teaching and learning techniques to be accessible by all regardless of prior qualifications,.\r\n2. To influence the design of Sustainable Communities across Europe - Sustainability in all its senses, environmental, social, economic and practical with specific emphasis on Sustainable Construction.\r\nBackground:\r\nAcross Europe rural areas are in decline. Young people move away from remote areas to be educated, then to find work. This decline has significant impact on local services & on the environment. Keeping communities diverse and inclusive is a challenge that must essentially be met to maintain equality of opportunity for those people continuing to live and work in rural areas. Rural buildings are often difficult to maintain as traditional skills die. Thus alters the face of our villages which threatens our cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThis project builds a Model for Sustainable Communities. There is a bespoke training programme incorporating flexible, participative vocational training in traditional construction techniques alongside the essential ingredients of personal and professional development and empowerment. The resulting ECCE Build Certificate is recognised in both VET & HE. sectors.\r\n\r\nThe Objectives include:\r\n1. Discovering old & new techniques of Sustainable Construction. Learning together with partners to design & deliver the ECCE Build Certificate with recognition of qualifications so that vocational training is measured to be equal to that of academic study.\r\n2. Understanding how better use of natural materials brings community benefits and can influence future design of buildings.\r\n3. Creating a series of exhibition example community buildings as a legacy to the project activity and as a focus for further work.\r\n4. Establish a Network for Sustainable Communities across Europe.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nUsing the expertise of University of Jaime 1, Castellon Spain and their experience of the e-Brick House, alongside the traditional construction industry vocational training experts of Concept Training, Ashford, UK, the partners design and deliver the new training course using the ECCE Methodology developed in an earlier Erasmus+ programme. Each partner contributes specific expertise & develops the innovation further.\r\n\r\nThe new course consists of 6 Learning Modules with each partner leading on their specialist area and the focus is on sustainability in all its forms throughout the project. This includes Sustainable Communities.  The project examines constraints in the town-planning processes in each country as well as environmental issues relating to social housing and alternative construction methods. \r\nBut the project is not just about buildings and construction, the partners show that in designing Sustainable Communities the keys lie within techniques of empowerment, communication, open informal learning and pride of place.\r\n\r\nThe project trains 24 trainers who then cascade their learning to train local participants. Practical sessions are endorsed by distance-learning. One new environmentally sustainable building is created by each partner. Using different local building materials the training Modules include ancient skills and traditional construction methods alongside environmentally friendly technologies for the conservation of energy and efficient use of natural resources. Trainee participants are previously unqualified in construction and in most cases will be drawn from disadvantaged groups. \r\n\r\nThe Partners:\r\nLed by La Colporteuse, a Community Association and Popular Education Centre in rural France, the project leaves a legacy of environmentally-friendly community buildings created by joint training workshops. Ongoing local action groups continue the work.  The University of Jaime 1, Castellon, S.E.Spain works alongside Concept Training, Ashford, Kent UK to oversee the training and to work towards parallel recognition of vocational and higher qualifications. The Lammas Eco-village in Wales UK, ProVita a Social Enterprise Community in rural Romania and the Living Museum of Fundacion Uxio Novoneyra in Galicia, N.W.Spain completes the partnerships. Each building uses local expertise and traditional skills, augmented by partner experience and contributes towards the Model of Sustainable Communities.\r\n\r\nThe Results:\r\nOne new training course - ECCE Build Certificate recognised as a vocational qualification with recognised credit transfer value for European use.

The volunteering focusses on activities that are related to people who need extra support. The volunteers in Rotterdam work for a great diversity of organizations, like a women shelter, an art gallery that educates less priveleged youth, a production kitchen where housemade products are made, together with special education students, a primary school with a coloured population of children, a gym for people with limitations, and an organization that supports people with mental and physical limitations. \r\nThe volunteers in the Zutphen area work at a biodynamic farm (De Vijfsprong; Vorden) or residence for children with limitations (de Kleine Koning, Vierakker). \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nThere are different objectives. From the organizational perspective, the aim is to support local organizations that aim to support local people in need. From the volunteer's perspective, the aim is to let volunteers get to know social work and the different ways how social work can be organised and how this is done in the Netherlands. Besides, volunteers learn to work and live with a multicultural group of people and how to can grow in their role as active citizen. \r\n\r\n17 volunteers are involved in this project (one volunteer will participate in a short term project (2 months lasting) and long term (3 months lasting). \r\n\r\nDescription of activities: All volunteer support activities that aim to help people that are in need of extra care. The content of the work is diverse: the activities consist of playing activities with children, educational activities, art and cultural activities for less priveleged young people, production of food products, farm work, household chores, administrative activities and sports activities, . \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: \r\nThe volunteers learn while doing. They execute operational activities and collaborate with professionals that are trained and educated in the social field. By watching how professionals work, the volunteers learn to know different working methods and strategies that are relevant in the social field. In case volunteers show a motivation, they can set up their own project that aims on a social goal and that is in line with Erasmus+ objectives. \r\n\r\nResults and impact: volunteers learn to know about social work, their role as active citizen and what type of work they like and dislike. The learn to adapt by living in an apartment/house with other volunteers and running a household. Local community benefits because of the structural support that is received by the volunteers: this is beneficial for the individual people in need but also for the organizations that support these people. Volunteers bring new cultural input in the organizations that can give input for the organization that they support. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits: volunteers learn about working ethics, like being reliable, work according to the rules, coming in time. These general competencies that are helpful for their future careers. This is especially true for volunteers that are over 25 and have very little working experience. Volunteers also learn to develop their skills to live and work with a diverse group of people. Also this is an important competency for their future life. \r\nLava Legato learns new things from a group of volunteers each time: rules change, activities are adjusted, mentors are replaced, accommodation is changed, all to optimise the organization of EVS. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged: \r\nThe main result is related to broadening the horizon of people involved: professionals learn to work with young people (from abroad) who might have a different view/approach on a working strategy, clients/students/children learn to know people from abroad, the volunteers bring foreign influences inside their organization. Last but not least, volunteers learn about working strategies, habits, norms and values of a country which is foreign for them. This makes them (more) aware of their own cultural background, but they also learn to know the Dutch culture from the inside.", "http://creativeashford.org/tag/the-creative-collective", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001625_4"], [2017, "Employability for all!", "The Creative Collective", 23409.0, 6, 6, "Employability for all is a  youth exchange project aiming to bring together 30 young people (18-30 years) and 6 group leaders  (no age limit), who is ready to try themselfs in a field of enterpreneurship, to share experience and knowledge of their countries, willing and able to work together with other youth regardless of their nationality, social status and disabilities.\r\nAll partner countries have long working experience with youth (also with disabilities) and, therefore, are well aware of how acute is the issue of lack of knowledge and information about social enterpreneurship.\r\nCommon for all partner oragnisations goals are:\r\nTo rase legal awareness of social and contribute to formation of civil society\r\nTo promote responsible and organized young generation, which will retain their cultural identity.\r\nThis project will bring together the young people from different countries with different social background including the young people who faces social, economical and educational difficulties.
