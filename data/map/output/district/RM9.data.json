The proposed idea will be able to give a solution to this problem by providing a mono-material tray in virgin PET (for food contact) and RPET for the rest of the tray. The necessary barrier properties will be guaranteed by an active oxygen barrier.\nThe second objective of this project is: the study, designing and dissemination of a dedicated recycling model, inspired to replication and spreading of the recycling model of the 100% PET soft drink bottles, in the post-consumer phase, adapting its characteristics to the specific food package features. The recycling model will focus on the management of a 'cradle to cradle' loop, from and to the starting manufacturing process, promoting the reduction of manufacturing costs and the carbon foot print of PET packaging for food.\nAlthough PET packaging solutions currently on the market fully satisfy the required performances, with respect to each single application, there is still a lack of these performances to be bridged respect to the basic need of the PET trays recycling. The main drawbacks of the current solutions for the PET trays manufacturing are due essentially to the presence of different plastic materials in the packages. In other terms they are manufactured by sticking different layers of different plastic materials, PET included. The multi-material feature poses severe limitations, and sometimes the impossibility, to the effective recycling of manufacturing scraps and of the trays at the end of their life. The major outputs and results of the project will be exploited by the participant SME-AGs on the following markets: 1) PET additives; 2) PET film production; 3) PET packaging production; 4) PET recycling.'", 433221.0, 2286358.0, 6, 9, "GREEN PACK", null, "http://www.closedlooprecycling.co.uk", null, "fp7_111084_953702158"], [1388534400000, 1490918400000, "Novel Identification Technology for High-value Plastics Waste Stream", "Closed Loop Recycling Ltd", "The POLYMARK consortium represent the SME communities of Polymer Recyclers. The EU polymer recycling sector forms a vital part of the polymer sector and has an estimated annual turnover of \u20ac2,500 million generated by over 1,000 SMEs. However, our members have a major problem. Within the EU legislation exists (EC/282/2008) that states that plastic containers that have been used in a non-food application cannot, subsequently, be recycled and used in an application where it will come into contact with food. This is not true for other major world markets (including the US) putting Europe at a significant disadvantage and therefore a solution is urgently required.\nAdditionally, the food packaging industry is under pressure to use more recycled content but has difficulty accessing sufficient volumes of food contact approved recyclate. In our industry recycling employs a combination of techniques that have been used for particular applications with varying degrees of success.\nHowever, they are all inefficient and expensive because there are no easy, reliable, rapid, low cost methods of distinguishing one plastic from another.\n\nTherefore an opportunity exists to capture this, to date, untapped market by undertaking the project we propose. Our solution is different. Our idea is to develop a food container marking and identification system that will allow reliable separation of food contact approved from non food contact approved post consumer plastic waste. The novelty is that the plastic itself is coded for easy identification. The technology will also be applicable to other plastic identification challenges.\nAs well as benefiting the recycling community and the food packaging industry, it will also have a positive environmental impact.", 60957.0, 1763511.0, 5, 11, "POLYMARK", null, "http://www.closedlooprecycling.co.uk", null, "fp7_111431_953702158"]]}}}}
