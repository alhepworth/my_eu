We are a small school and often don't have the time, opportunities or capacity to observe good practice from one another. By taking part in this project we will aim to improve the teaching and learning throughout the school, improve pupil outcomes in a variety of areas (academic and non) and make the necessary changes across the school to enhance the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe have identified specific needs that will be addressed by this project:\r\n\r\n- To develop staff expertise and competencies to ensure all staff members are confident in securing learning for all children across the school. This needs to be a priority because we want our children to succeed and for them to be able to do this all staff must be confident in the content and approaches that they are using. \r\n- To improve teaching and learning using a wider range of teaching strategies. This will improve and extend staff skills and enable all to use a variety of strategies rather than focusing on ones they were most comfortable with previously. \r\n- Enhance the provision in the EYFS enabling all children to flourish and become independent and confident learners for life. As a result of this children will become more independent and therefore not only in the EYFS but further up the school children will become independent, life long learners. \r\n- Develop staff ability and awareness of the growing range of needs of all children in our school community. As we have many children in our school with very specific needs  this will ensure that staff are confident with helping them achieve their full potential. . \r\n- Develop and enhance the provision by creating more innovative approaches to teaching and learning . As the modern world is changing we need to ensure we keep up to date with relevant changes at home and abroad and what works best for all children to support their learning needs. This also needs to be through engaging and enriching activities. \r\n- Learn from observation of other practice in Europe. This will enable us to enhance all areas of the curriculum and build on staff awareness, skills, knowledge and confidence.\r\n\r\nTo help us meet our needs we envisage that 10 members of staff will be given the opportunity to attend courses in Italy, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Spain. The staff are key members of our school and are motivate to learn from this experience in order to enhance and develop our school curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe learning outcomes are:\r\n\r\nDevelop staff expertise and competencies \r\nEnhance the provision in the EYFS \r\nDevelop staff ability and awareness of the growing range of needs of all children \r\nDevelop and enhance the provision by creating more innovative approaches to teaching and learning\r\nEnhanced cultural awareness\r\nEnhanced European dimension in our school\r\n\r\nThe impact and long term benefit of the project will therefore be on staff, pupils and the wider community as we will provide a curriculum that supports and meets the needs of all children preparing them for the future", null, "Loddington CE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036224_coordinator"]]}}, "1NB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Professional Development of Staff within a European Dimension.", "Broughton Primary School", 17981.0, 1, 1, "Our project 'Professional Development of Staff within a European  Dimension', is a key part of our school improvement plan as we work towards becoming an 'outstanding' school. \r\nOur objectives are:\r\nTo Improve the teaching of French through developing the knowledge, confidence and expertese of staff who have responsibility for teaching French\r\nTo integrate the use of ICT in to the classroom to enhance the learning of all pupils with diverse needs so that they are prepared for a future with a European dimension\r\nTo develop our new staff responsible for Early Years pupils so that ne methods and teaching styles are part of outstanding provision in the Early Years.\r\nTo provide for the wellbeing of pupils so that their individual needs can be met and to have access to their educational entitlement.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have selected attendance at structured training courses in France, Spain and Italy, where 11 learners (staf members) will take part in this project, which will include the lead members of the school community.

In fact, the dropout rate of apprenticeships is relatively higher than that of other sectors. One of the key challenges identified and associated with these issues is that apprenticeship mentors in the construction sector often lack themselves modern digital skills required to match the sector\u2019s and young workers\u2019 expectations and requirements. Construction apprenticeship mentors appear reluctant to introduce new digital methods during their teaching practices, and sometimes also find that their role as trainers is not specified well enough to allow for such approaches. It is thus essential to develop professional development opportunities of high quality, and to train workplace mentors on how to introduce new digital methods and innovative content during their teaching practices, in order to make training effective, address misalignments between VET offerings, skills demand & learners\u2019 realities. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nCONDAP aims to: \r\n- Upskill in-company mentors in construction apprenticeships with digital, sector-specific professional skills and competences and upgrade their training through the development of OERs,\r\n- Enrich their teaching ability through the development of innovative pedagogical approaches, \r\n- Form a strategic partnership to continuously support the professional development of mentors in construction apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nTHE CONDAP PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe partnership comprises 5 partners with high capacity, qualifications and complementary skills from the world of WBL, VET and the construction sector, to align mentors\u2019 training with specific labour market needs and apprenticeship particularities.  INSTRUCTUS is a leader in the development of apprenticeship programmes. VSRC is a specialised VET provider in the construction sector, experienced in initiatives improving skills of the building workforce. UPV carries specialised R&D related to digital opportunities in the construction industry and has expertise in OERs. EXELIA has extensive experience in R&D and delivery of innovative ICT-based methodologies. EBC represents occupational interests at EU level and has experience in projects targeting apprenticeships. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES & METHODOLOGY\r\n- Analysis of training requirements of workplace mentors in construction apprenticeships to develop learning outcomes for their professional development and their upskilling with digital skills and innovative teaching practices. \r\n- Development of VET learning units for workplace mentors, focusing on sustainability & digitalisation of construction, and innovative pedagogical orientations for teaching digital construction methods.\r\n- Creation of pedagogical materials to be offered as Open Education Resources.\r\n- Development, testing, and delivery of learning materials and the Vocational Open Online Course (VOOC) infrastructures on the digital skills & competences of in-company mentors involved in construction apprenticeships.\r\n-Development of a systematic approach to support the enhancement of the digital skills of mentors in construction apprenticeships, and the integration of CONDAP learning outcomes into VET.\r\n- Sharing and validation of outputs with multiplier events, inviting target groups to uptake CONDAP results and to act as further disseminators.\r\n\r\nRESULTS & IMPACT\r\n- CONDAP validated learning outcomes for training of workplace mentors in digital construction (to reach 200 mentors).\r\n- CONDAP learning units & teaching methodology for in-company mentors in construction apprenticeships (to reach 200 mentors).\r\n- Pedagogical resources supporting in-company mentors digital skills, offered as OERs and the CONDAP VOOC on digital construction methods (to reach 200 mentors, 200 VET providers).\r\n- 2 pilot sessions to validate CONDAP learning outcomes and additional pilot testing organised remotely (to reach 200 mentors, VET providers & employers).\r\n- A road-map for the systematic integration of CONDAP learning outcomes into VET (80 stakeholders reached).\r\n- A MoC to support the enhancement of the digital skills of mentors in construction apprenticeships and to establish a relevant EU strategic partnership (40 stakeholders reached).\r\n- 2 demonstration workshops & 3 information days to promote project results and validate educational resources (400 participants).\r\n\r\nPOST-PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY\r\n- Use of CONDAP learning materials, OERs and VOOC, and the methodology for teaching digital construction methods by and increased number of in-company mentors involved in construction apprenticeships \r\n- Uptake of project materials and OERs from relevant VET providers and construction companies across the EU\r\n- Expansion of the EU strategic partnership supporting digital skills of mentors in construction apprenticeships and increase of the initiatives targeting quality of in-company mentors VET", "http://www.instructus.org/", "Instructus", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048122_coordinator"]]}}, "4BX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1322697600000, 1385769600000, "Adaptive Tip dress Control for Automated Resistance Spot Welding", "Fisher Smith Llp", "High volume automotive production (such as body-in-white construction) operations rely heavily on RSW (resistance spot welding), and suffer significant losses of output (and resulting revenue) as a consequence of frequent production line stoppages.
