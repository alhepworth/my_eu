We aim to embed and integrate the teaching of French across the school stages and build on the foundations already laid by current staff and French Language Assistant. \r\nThrough a school audit and professional discussions, we have identified that we are 4 teachers with differing levels of French language and confidence in teaching this subject area. Therefore it was concluded that the knowledge, skills and cultural experiences we would gain from an immersion course in France would allow us to both develop professionally and inspire our learners in a memorable way. In addition, we hope that the experiences we gain will inspire and enthuse our colleagues to undertake a similar course. We would embrace the opportunity to network with other teachers from across Scotland and France, and would relish the opportunity to share teaching experiences and resources.\r\nDuring the course, we will learn French key phrases, vocabulary and grammar and have the opportunity to discuss cultural aspects and the French education system with native speakers. We are looking for opportunities to imbed French language more fully and engage and assist learners through the use of ICT, including the development of our e-Twinning project, \u2018Modestine Meets Nessie\u2019. By observing and participating in modelled activities, the course allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of our learners and immerse ourselves in an unfamiliar and daunting environment. We will therefore experience first-hand the difficulties some of our learners face every day and we feel that we will be better equipped to deal with their struggles or concerns.\r\nAll activities will be shared with school staff on a communal drive, and we will run a session with all staff, including Learning Assistants, to teach them how best to use the resources to support our learners. We will also teach our senior pupils appropriate French games and songs which they can teach to younger pupils in the playground, as well as share with their parents and members of our local community.\r\nAs a result of this opportunity, we will have an increased awareness of the methodologies of language learning. This will allow us to develop and deliver high quality French lessons which embrace the principles of a Curriculum for Excellence while following a natural progression and allowing for a consistent language-learning approach across the school.\r\nThe anticipated outcomes resulting from this project are an increase in language capacity, for our staff and learners, improved confidence in teaching French and the acquisition of high quality resources which can be differentiated and adapted to meet the needs of our learners across the school stages. We hope to use ICT and various forms of media more fully in the teaching of languages, and seek opportunities to develop our e-twinning project. \r\nIn the longer term, we seek to raise attainment in language learning, ignite enthusiasm for learning about other languages and cultures and therefore see an increased uptake of modern foreign languages at secondary school. With the current uncertainty over Scotland\u2019s place in the European Union, we want the young people of Midlothian to appreciate the value and benefits of learning another language and ensure that they are provided with the tools, skills, knowledge and opportunities to broaden their horizons and travel freely and confidently within Europe.", "http://www.tynewater.mgfl.net", "Tynewater Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036052_coordinator"], [2016, "Language Immersion Course", "Tynewater Primary School", 1697.0, 1, 1, "Whilst this application is for one primary school teacher from Tynewater Primary School to take part in a Spanish language immersion course, our whole staff team are committed to raising attainment in language learning, in line with the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 Languages Approach. As a Pilot School in Midlothian we are well on our way to embedding French as our L2 from Primaries 1-7. This has been achievable through staff undertaking language refresher courses, using documents and resources available to us and accepting the support of our Development Officers. Spanish will be our L3 and will be taught from Primaries 4-7. By taking part in this project I will have an increased understanding of the methodology of language learning.The course activities will include learning Spanish vocabulary and grammar with native speakers, gaining greater understanding of Spanish culture, learning about the Spanish education system, developing new methods of teaching languages and using ICT to motivate and assist learners. The activities, resources and materials I receive will be shared with colleagues in my school and across Midlothian.As a result of this project we anticipate an increase in language capacity, improved confidence when teaching Spanish, the acquisition of teaching ideas to provide stimulating and engaging language lessons and ICT being used more fully in language learning. This will allow our learners to access foreign languages more fully and provide scope for links to be made with European schools. In the longer term, we hope to raise attainment in language learning, ignite enthusiasm for learning about other languages and cultures and therefore see an increased uptake of languages at secondary school. We hope that this project will open doors for our learners and allow them to travel freely and confidently within Europe.", "http://www.tynewater.mgfl.net", "Tynewater Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023787_coordinator"]]}}}}
