The internship is an important part of this dual education (school and occupational training) during the five years at this school.\r\nThe internship can be completed at any kind of business, preferably in the hotel or gastronomy sector.\r\nBy completing this internship in the hotel or gastronomy sector and the associated work fields (kitchen, service, reception, bar, catering), the students acquire professional advantages and paves the way to self-dependence.\r\nGoals:\r\n*Application and expansion of knowledge, skills and qualifications learned at school.\r\n*Improving employability on a national, European, and international level.\r\n*Improving mobility and flexibility.\r\n*Strengthening of life skills, personality and autonomy.\r\n*Growth of self-dependence and self-determination.\r\n*Coping with challenges and assigned tasks in a foreign country and unfamiliar surroundings, using a foreign language, and learning to live and work in a multicultural environment.\r\n*Improvement of language skills in English, French, Italian and Spanish\r\n*Promoting intercultural dialogue\r\n*Forming new friendships\r\n*Getting to know different organizations and cultures, different company structures and operational procedures\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\n30 students  will complete their internship abroad in summer 2018.\r\nFor 2018, our target countries and regions are: France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.

IT-Teacher: Martina Owsaneki.\r\nActivities:\r\nThe compulsory internship complements the knowledge and skills gained in the relevant school subjects (Kitchen and Service, Business organization, Business Administration) with expertness at the workplace in a company. This expertise is a requirement in the following job fields:\r\ncook, restaurant specialist, hotel and restaurant trade commercial assistant.\r\nThe participants will gain experience especially in the fields of kitchen, service, bar, reception, housekeeping.\r\nMethods of project implementation:\r\nFor the implementation of this project, ECVET elements (learning agreement, cooperation agreement) will be used.\r\nThe cooperation agreement is the frame for cooperation between the sending and the receiving institutions. In this document, the specific tasks and criteria for successful cooperation are regulated.\r\nThe learning agreement aims to improve transparency and to ensure that the intern will be assigned tasks commensurate to their level of competence and the educational goals.\r\nAn internship contract will regulate the employment. The receiving institution will issue the internship certificate and voice their feedback in a form.\r\nWorkshop to prepare for the stay, compilation of a final report.\r\nResults, effects and benefits:\r\nLearning life skills, improving self-confidence and self-management, expansion of the horizon will have positive effects on class instruction. The participants realize the importance of foreign languages and gain more motivation in learning English, Italien and French.\r\nThe internship abroad is an important advertising vehicle for our school and is becoming more and more popular.

They have the chance to experience a non-German-speaking working environment on the European labour market and to use and strenghten their acquired skills. \r\nThe aim of doing an internship in an EU-country outside Austria is to give our students the opportunity to \r\n- use their aquired knowlegde from school in subjects such as Business Studies, Accountancy, IT, Cooking and Service (which are important subjects in our type of school)\r\n- get some insight into the corporate structures of other countries \r\n- gain some job experience on the European labour market\r\n- improve their foreign language skills \r\n- improve their social skills and their sense of intercultural understanding\r\n- foster their personal development. \r\nThe target group for this programme are 17-year-old students (for the compulsory internship between years III and IV) and 18-year-olds (for the voluntary internship between years IV and V) who at this level have a fair knowledge of Business Studies and Accountance.

Being unemployed, too many young people are at risk of poverty or exclusion. This is especially accurate for young people with a migrant background, including newly arrived immigrants and young refugees. \r\n\r\nProject aims to enable 18-30 unemployed youth who are at risk of poverty or exclusion (including immigrants and young refugees) to gain organic gardening and basic entrepreneurship skills in order to improve their employability and foster their inclusion. Trough this project, it is our intention to bring 20 youngsters coming from different cultures and religions to meet in a stimulative, creative, challenging and natural surroundings such as a community garden, hoping to inspire a sense of initiative among them. \r\n\r\nProject objectives:\r\n- To support youth personal development and their employability in the European labour market and beyond\r\n- To provide youth with the necessary skills to participate actively in their community building, using the gardening as a tool\r\n- To raise youth awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts\r\n- To enhance youth English language competences\r\n\r\nDuring 6 days, youngsters will gain practical skills on organic gardening (such as planting, mulching, composting) and basic entrepreneurship. Trainers will use a variety of interactive indoor and outdoor activities, as well as discussions and games. Program also includes Garden cinema, Fair of Countries and Cultures and mingling with members of the community garden.\r\n\r\nAt the end, participants will be provoked to start own food production enterprise, find a job in raising organic food production sector or to start a community garden as a small enterprise. In a sentence, participants will improve their employability lower the risk of poverty and marginalisation while having their awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries raised.
