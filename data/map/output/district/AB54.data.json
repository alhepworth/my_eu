She wants to attend the Erasmus course in France to further develop her French language and improve her teaching of French in her classroom through understanding different pedagogies.  Donna would also like to improve her understanding of French culture and current affairs and how best to teach this in a relevant context.  As 1+2 is a major priority on our Cluster Improvement Plan and will feature heavily in future School Improvement Plans, we feel that this experience will support our development for several reasons. Firstly, due to previously teaching German as the MLPS at the school staff are less familiar with the French Language.  Donna will plan and lead workshops for the whole staff, parents and cluster colleagues to share any strategies and resources gained on the course. A bank of resources is planned to be developed alongside colleagues at Insch school should all applicants be successful which will be made available to staff that did not attend through the Local Authority Development Officer as well as Glow pages. She will also make links with practitioners in Europe, which will, in turn, develop our Global Citizenship. By attending this course, Donna is hoping to further develop her skills in speaking and reading the French language and increase her cultural knowledge of France. Her hope is that this will make her teaching of the language more relevant and she can share this knowledge and skills with the rest of the staff in our school.  She also hopes that by engaging in a more relevant context this will lead to more enthusiastic teachers as well as more enthusiastic learners.", "http://www.gartly.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Gartly School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036112_coordinator"]]}}, "4SE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Get a Grip!", "The Gordon Schools", 69486.0, 4, 4, "Human beings are changing the earth at a very high speed. The impact on our planet is so large that some scienctists call the current era the anthropocene. On a global level we are facing huge challenges. These enormous global challenges may give individuals the feeling that they do not have any influence at all.\r\nThe \u2018Get a Grip!\u2019 project aims to build bridges between thinking globally and acting locally. Gaining insight into the ways in which local actions affect global processes, can help us to better understand and deal with these global problems, such as climate change, food supply, resource depletion, overfishing, biodiversity loss, migration, etc.\r\nOn main focus will be on how individual choices affect global issues.\r\nMany projects have already been written about  sustainability and environment. Many of these projects focus on decreasing the use of energy and the amount of waste. A large number of school has joined the Green Schools and ECO Schools movements, which try to mkae schools more aware of  topics like waste and energy. However, progress seems tob e made more slowly than expected, as initial fervour and enthusiasm slowly wane. Why is it so hard to realise prjects regarding the environment?? The 'Get a Grip' project triest o answer this question by choosing a different approach, as the primary focus of the project is on global understanding. The project links local actions and global consequences. For example, how are eating a hamburger and migration streams connected?  Becoming more aware of this interconnectedness may fundamentally change our personal attitude. To enhance awareness students need to understand global processes better (global understanding).\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for  the project was found in the aims of the IYGU organisation (International Year of Global Understanding (http://www.global-understanding.info/.): \u201cSustainable development is a global challenge, but solving it requires transforming the local \u2013 the way each of us lives, consumes, and works,\u201d said former ICSU President and Nobel Laureate Yuan-Tseh Lee.\r\n\r\nThe international partners have been chosen because all of them are connected to an organisation that aims to stimulate sustainability in the schools. All partners have noticed that meeting sustainability targets is rather hard. All partners differ with respect to their approach of sustainability and environmental issues. In addition to cultural differences the partners have geographically different climates which come with different issues, possibilities and solutions. For example, Iceland has geothermal energy, but the Netherlands faces earthquakes in the province of Groningen due to natural gas extraction. On the other hand, Spain has a large amount of solar energy, but faces problems like desertification. In Scotland local initiatives are of central importance.\r\nThe project will start with a knowledge phase in which the major emphasis will be on activating prior knowledge, analysing facts and increasing global understanding. Students will determine their own impact on the environment. This impact will be monitored during the project. At the beginning of this phase several expert groups will be created (energy, water, food, waste). In addition, innovations in the field of sustainability will be looked at.", "http://www.gordonschools.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA219-035293_2"]]}}}}
