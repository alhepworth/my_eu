In case of not being late, we may determine a new strategy, products and services, which should be qualified enough to respond the global needs, must be produced by using the determined strategy. The main purpose of the Project is to motivate young population living in Turkey about innovation and creativity.\r\nOur aims are to innovate the vocational and technical education programs for both raising highly qualified workforce that sector desires and facilitating the availability of youth grads; and to improve the quality of our school and the students' knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nSocial economy is an important pillar of the European economy. More than 4.5% of the active EU population is employed there. At the same time the digital economy sector is the main alternative for the development of many rural regions in Europe. But digital entrepreneurs face challenges, among which lack of modern and easily accessible training resources. \r\n\r\nThe project aim is to contribute to the development of entrepreneurial, industrial and digital skills in VET, to the enhancement of digital integration in VET and the promotion of easily accessible continuing VET, including for the rural areas, by creating three intellectual outputs: Curriculum and e-repository.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the above, at least 750 participants will be involved among whom: would-be and acting digital entrepreneurs, VET learners, NGOs and decision-makers in the digital sector, VET providers, authorities and policy-makers, VET teachers and trainers, teacher training institutes and providers. \r\n\r\nManagement, monitoring and evaluation activities, as well as a wide range of dissemination and exploitation efforts and events will accompany the development process of the Curriculum, e-repository.\r\n\r\nThe project is actually merging Information Technology teachers' expertise, digital entrepreneurs' expertise, industrialists' expertise and ICT expertise to achieve an important synergy: an innovative, open-access, easily-recognizable, learner-centered, time-saving, cross-curricula VET solution with value added. Such a solution is supposed to bring significant short and long term benefits within and outside the partnership, as well as on VET systems of the participating countries. \r\n\r\nThe project capacity to use and build on the project results after the end of the funding period is considerable. The outputs will be widely disseminated among the relevant targets and policy-makers and will be created in a way to allow for easy transferability and adaptability to different contexts and targets.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of our Project is examining and exchanging the best practices by using Industry 4.0 in EU countries.Therefore, we, as actively-working teachers, believe that we will be able to reach the most accurate need analysis and make contributions that may be needed in the sector for the curriculum renewal studies of Ministry of National Education.", "http://www.mbmtraining.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-TR01-KA202-046292_3"], [2018, "CALE PENTRU CARIERA", "MBM Training and Development Center", 145526.0, 6, 6, "The  project \u201dPATH FOR CAREER\u201d is the result of the collaboration between 6 partners from Romania, Spain, Italy, France, Malta and the UK. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe project started from the need to find a solution for a faster insertion on the labor market of adults and the achievement of career goals by harmonizing the competences of graduates with those required by employers. According to European Commission statistics and research studies, the share of higher-education graduates without a job in2016 was: 15% in FR , 20% in ES, 9% in MT, 19% in IT, 12% in RO, 14% in the UK. Many of those who completed higher education worked in 2017 in lower-skilled jobs. A major importance in aparance this situation is the lack of a career plan, job experience and soft skills that are not taught at school and that have become increasingly important in the recruitment process for a job.\r\nThe solution to this complex problem is the involvement of graduates in training activities that will lead to the development of career management skills and the development of soft skills. To achieve this goal, the need for partner trainers to improve their skills to be able to provide such adult training was first identified. Following the training, the partners will develop the PATH FOR CAREER Guide that will include theoretical notions, educational methodologies and educational digital games. This guide will be used to form a target group of 90 graduates who will also include people with fewer opportunities. This target group will also contribute to testing the guide to be launched on the adult education market and the development of a PFC network.\r\nThus, this project has been born with three objectives:\r\nOB1. Improving the skills of 16 trainers from partner organizations to deliver quality training in career management, soft skills (complex problem solving, critical thinking, people management, coordination with others, analysis and decision-making) and internship for graduates.\r\nOB2. Development of soft skills (listed in OB1) and career management skills for 90 higher education graduates following the use of  intellectual output PFC in 9 workshops to facilitate them access to a job and career progression.\r\nOB3. Developing a European network of organizations involved in adult education to introduce  PFC output into their training.\r\nThe PATH FOR CAREER project is organized in three parts.\r\nThe first part is where trainers of the 6 partners are improving, exchanging good practices in 3 transnational learning activities. Following training and collaboration, the partners will develop the \"PATH FOR CAREER\" guide structured in 3 modules consisting of supports of training and educational games. The 3 modules are: \"The Proactive Management of Career \" associated with the \"Plan Your Career!\" Game, \"Soft Skills for a Job\" associated with \"Teamwork!\" And \"Internship - a Step towards Your Career \"Associated with the game\" Recruit with your boss! \".\r\nIn the second part, the partners will conduct 3 training and testing workshops with the target group members for each of the 3 modules. The purpose of the workshops is to train the members of the target group to be able to conceive and manage a career plan that is based on a practice internship and soft skills required by employers. They will also test the guide by providing feedback to the creators.\r\nIn the third part, the partners will carry out  transfer activities of the project results . The central activity of this stage is the multiplication events in which PATH FOR CAREER will be popularized at European level. Our goal is to develop a European network of organizations involved in adult education to use and improve PFC.\r\nThe \u201dPATH FOR CAREER\u201d Guide is structured in 3 modules and represents the answer to 3 important career success requirements: a career plan tailored to new needs, software skills that help you in the workplace and the internship that has become a mandatory requirement for employers . Innovative is the idea of \u200b\u200bconceiving course support as a result of exchanging best practices between partners in 6 states and associating each module with an educational game. The digital games created in the project bring as novelty the compatibility with all the platforms where messaging can be seen. Users can return to them when they need to use Facebook, Messenger, Viber or Whatsapp. We chose this option based on the reality that people do not like to learn, but they like to play. Learning through the game has proven to be one of the most effective learning methods even for adults.", "http://www.mbmtraining.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-RO01-KA204-049513_2"], [2016, "Catch the BALL - Create a Dynamic Third Age", "MBM Training and Development Center", 144107.0, 3, 4, "Context and backgroundAn increasingly larger part of the population in industrialized countries is spending longer time in retirement than before. Increased life expectancy will lead to a steady increase in the number of  people in their latter part of life. Consequently, it is of utmost importance for future Europe to guarantee the highest quality of life for this large group of citizens and to ensure that they have the opportunities to use the years after 50, their third age, to full extent and for society to use their valuable experience and knowledge. ObjectivesThe main objective of the project is to create an integrated system for enhancing and facilitating access to opportunities in lifelong learning for people in their latter part of life. The three steps proposed to be implemented in the project are an action to raise awareness, creating and test personal development courses for trainers and build a virtual \"warehouse\" of opportunities for individuals developed and tested with respect to specific needs in the partner countries with a view to generalisation to the whole of Europe.Number and profiles of partnersFive organisations cooperate in the project. Evris foundation is the applicant organisation responsible for management and organization. U3A Reykjavik provides learning and cultural ambiance and activities for its \u201ethird age\u201c members. Personal Development Foundation and Organization (FROiO) is a nonprofit organization conducting business activity and supporting people in the process of self-realization and personal development with emphasis on lifelong learning. Kaunas Science and Technology Park has more than 15 years of experience in assisting and supporting innovative and start-up and spin-off companies in Lithuania. The Career Center in Nord-Tr\u00f6ndelag region, Norway provides counselling to individuals and labour market.Description of activitiesThe project, Catch the BALL,  is an implementation of ideas, guidelines  and recommendations resulting from the work carried out in the Erasmus+ supported BALL project (Be Active through Lifelong Learning), now coming to an end. These results suggest a three step model to provide the aging generations of Europe with opportunities to prepare for a changing situation in the third age. The work to be undertaken in this project will bring these results forward to implementation. The three steps proposed are:\u2022 A model toolbox for a European Awareness Raising Campaign on a Dynamic Third Age will be designed. This concerns awareness raising in the society and among individuals on the opportunities, value and resource, inherent in the generation aged above 50, the third age. The campaign is aimed at the society as a whole and not the least the individuals themselves.\u2022 The \u201cPersonal Development Program\u201d will be further tested through pilots and training events for trainers. The program is aimed at fulfilling the needs of people to enable them to find new ways and means to develop themselves for an active and dynamic third age. The output will be a tool for trainers and others engaged in adult education, coaching and counseling.\u2022 A Warehouse of Opportunities will be realized and tested, providing individuals and stakeholders with tools to find and to offer products to accommodate the needs and wishes identified, through the Personal Development Program or by other means. A web portal will be created  gathering relevant and appropriate information for individuals on opportunities available in the partner countries with a view to Europe as a whole. Description of the results and impact envisaged The three steps present a new dimension in integrating all aspects of how best to prepare for changes in the third age. Implementing the personal development ideas through the course program testing and training of trainers will have an impact by presenting a new way of preparing for changes on the labor market in the latter part of life and for active retirement. The innovative idea of the Warehouse of Opportunities as a \u201cvirtual one stop shop\u201d will have a large impact on the individual\u2019s possibilities to find the best way to ensure an enjoyable future, be it a career change or a life in retirement. These tools will in combination with the awareness raising methodology have a large impact on how the society values the resource inherent in the third age.Potential longer term benefits.The material will be of use in arranging future activities in a long-term perspective. The project partners themselves and the sounding boards, the social partners, will be guided by the results of the project. It is expected that the Personal Development Program will be used as appropriate in each country.  National or regional Warehouses of Opportunities are expected to be running in partner countries.

A preschool (also nursery school, pre-primary school) used to be a popular concept in the Czech Republic before the Velvet Revolution. The nurseries used to be run as healthcare facilities and children were taken care of by healthcare personnel \u2013 nurses.  Currently, the so called children\u2019s groups are designated for children in the age of 1-3 years and are complementary to kindergartens which accept children from the age of 3. There is demand for the services of children\u2019s groups from parents who are willing to return to the labour market soon after the child's birth. The demand is expected to rise after the new law on state social support comes into effect, which will enable the parents to get the parental benefits in shorter time as it is standard in more developed EU states (Nordic countries, Germany, Austria etc.). The problem we are facing now is that there is lack of qualified nurses who have competencies and experience needed for taking care of children so young. In the present project we have formed a partnership with partners who already have experience in this field, and we will exchange the know-how and create a new educational programme (including a curriculum and a set or worksheets for nurses-to-be).\r\n\r\nThe project involves 7 partners from 6 countries who represent preschool facilities, NGOs, university and entreprises.

High unemployment, social exclusion, religious and ethnic inequalities and differences, further marginalization of certain social groups remain major social and economic issues in almost all countries regardless of their current level of development and status. This project is intended for the staff of partner institutions and silent partners: analysis showed that no partner country has a vocation that is the result of this project, which is of great importance due to the need for linking education and the labour market in relation to the secondary target group of asylum seekers, migrants and the Roma. This has initiated the idea to create an innovative curriculum for educating and training employees of educational institutions to increase their skills in working with migrants, asylum seekers and the Roma, thus also contributing to the inclusion of secondary target groups in the processes of education and employment.

How are we doing this? by standardizing student learning models, methodology approaches, and evaluation criteria.  These learning models will be approached from an analytical perspective analyzing aspects like learning styles, learning paces and personality traits, but also from a holistic perspective taking into account aspects like age, socio-cultural and educational background and how their reality as a whole can affect their learning process.\r\nWe want to create a kind of standard and, at the same time, flexible approach from which we can personalize student profiles attending to their individual needs, making them conscious of what type of learner they are.\r\nThe activities of the Project have been organised into two different stages:\r\n1. Analysis and Training\r\n- Good practice exchange workshop, not only examples of good practice to attend diversity in the classroom, but also of any other aspect regarding the organisation and management of centres, considering the hetereogeneity of our association.\r\n- A training activity that will provide the theoretical framework from which we can standardize learning models, tools for their identification and those of self-assessment and materials to be implemented in the classroom.\r\n- Elaboration and asessment of those tools and materials that will be used in class during the implementation stage.\r\n2. Implementation, Assessment and Dissemination:\r\n- Case studies as a didactic technique: teachers will select a practice group and a control group, which will serve as a comparison group when results are assessed.  Those results will also be included in a comparative research study.\r\n- Progress analysis and methodology comparison: with the objective to learn how the work is adapted to the different realities and situations experienced in the different establishments.\r\n- Assessment of results, which must be in line with the indicators of achievement applied to objectives and results of the project as a whole.\r\n- Dissemination activities: a Manual for teachers, a comparative study research, and the creation of a website and mobile app containing information about the project, its objectives and results and from the Manual can be downloaded.\r\nThe  methodology applied is characterized by a respect towards diversity, and values the aspects and experience of such an heterogeneous team as ours and the enrichment that it brings to the Project.

Evidence suggests that Member States that have seen the highest numbers of arrivals are the most likely to face racist and xenophobic incidents (FRA 2016 Report). Another worrying aspect is the rise of hate crime and online hate speech.

With these in mind, it is crucial for different stakeholders that work with youth to come together and have a holistic approach to tackle discrimination, xenophobia, hate speech, racism and what derives from them. \r\n\r\n\u201cNEw CHapter: Network of Cooperation against Hate\u201d is a 15-month and 4-country (Greece, Italy, Denmark and UK) project that aims to provide space and support for cross sectoral cooperation of organizations and institutions that work with young people in formal/non formal education on combating hate speech and promote human rights education (HRE). More specifically, NEw CHapter will bring together Youth NGOs, an international network, 2 schools, a counseling body and a municipality in order to strengthen their capacities in international cooperation and develop competences on identifying and combating the different forms of hate speech and discrimination and promote the human rights education. \r\n\r\nNEw Chapter\u2019s objectives are:\r\n\u2022to encourage and strengthen transnational cooperation among the participating organizations  and support their staff\u2019s capacity building on  how to tackle hate speech, bullying and discrimination through joint training with the use of non formal and formal education methodologies\r\n\u2022to explore and share experiences, tools and methods among the partners in order for both direct participants and institutions to get new insights and knowledge on HRE, and gain social, intercultural,critical thinking competences for a more inclusive education, training and youth field\r\n\u2022to create a cross sectoral sustainable network of inclusion ambassadors that will spread the ideas of \u201cNo Hate Speech Movement\u201d on organizational and community levels through local and online activities to reach a wider audience supporting the promotion of inclusive and peaceful societies\r\n\u2022to generate synergies and partnerships between the participating organizations and support the exchange of effective methods, opportunities and challenges in local and European youth work in reaching out to marginalized young people and in preventing racism and intolerance among local youth\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are people from each partner organization that work with youth from different sectors such as youth workers and leaders, ngo members, teachers, educators, municipal staff and policy makers. \r\nNEw CHapter has 2  transnational meetings and a staff training (28 participants, 4 per each partner organization) in Greece and local activities in each partner country. \r\nDue to the complicated nature of the issues that the project deals with, such as the combat of hate speech, discrimination, segregation among youth and the reaching out and social inclusion of marginalised youth we will apply a variety of methodologies throughout the execution of NEw CHapter for its successful implementation : non formal and informal learning, cross-sectoral synergy, networking, best practice knowledge management methodology, creative and critical thinking and human rights education methodology. \r\nOur project\u2019s has intangible results such as: participants\u2019 increased knowledge, capacities and skills development on the themes of the project, creation of cross-sectoral network of inclusion multipliers, bridging of public-private sector with the creation of partnerships between stakeholders of youth work, education and local authorities. The tangible results of NEw CHapter are a handbook of cross-sectoral good practices against hate speech, discrimination, violence among youth  and an open-learning platform, which will be accessible from public. \r\n\r\nBy implementing this project,  we expect to have a positive impact in a local and European level by raising awareness, and by bringing together different key stakeholders to share effective mechanisms on how to tackle the rise of hate speech, violence and discrimination between youngsters and reach out to marginalised young people.", "http://www.mbmtraining.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EL02-KA205-003082_6"], [2016, "Powr\u00f3t do \u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego kobiety po mastektomii", "MBM Training and Development Center", 48383.0, 5, 6, "Breast cancer is the biggest oncological problem in developed countries and also a growing problem in developing countries. In 2008 more than 330,000 women from Members States of the European Union were diagnosed with breast cancer and  about 89 000 women died. Statistically nearly \u00bc of Polish women were diagnosed with breast cancer (22,8%). The number of deaths from breast cancer in Poland remained at the same level. It means that more women live probably with cured breast cancer, usually after bilateral mastectomy. Amazons, the younger and older do not allow themselves to resign from active, professional, family and social life. Taking into account aspects mentioned above, they key issue is about putting an emphasis on mental, physical, social comfort and quality of life of women who have won the fight against breast cancer. This aim may be achieved mainly by increasing: awareness of medical personnel about the need of long term care of patient and the qualifications of medical personnel in this area. The spread of awareness among women after mastectomy and new solutions of medical rehabilitation play an important part of the goal. The main aspect contributing to the improvement of quality of life before and after mastectomy in the physical and psychological rehabilitation. The care system of women after mastectomy has become one of the fastest developing topics in the field of health in recent years, but there is a lack of specialized medical staff who is sensitive to this problem. In most cases, the care ends at the moment of completion of cancer treatment and breast removal.  The aim of the project is to raise an awareness and sensitivity of medical staff as well as their qualifications in the field of new psycho-medical solutions, \u201csoft\u201d interpersonal skills, but also improvement of quality of women\u2019s life after mastectomy, including their total back to active, fully fledged functioning in society. Further development of the vocational training and model care will allow to perform their professional skills in a better way, what will have an influence on the comfort and the quality of life of patients, not only after surgery and during the convalescence, but also in later time relating back to a normal life.

Access to vocational training and extending of complex knowledge on breast cancer and physical and psychological rehabilitation of women after mastectomy will allow for better performance of professional activities and hence efficient return to life of women after mastectomy.  Partners from different countries, sharing experiences will carry out courses to improve the quality of care for patient after mastectomy i.a. the implementation of the innovative treatment using new methods of rehabilitation. During monthly video conferencing and international 3 days of workshops, specialists, psychologists, couches and psychotherapists pathomorphologists and dieticians engaged in the project will share their experiences and will propose the introduction of intensification of rehabilitation care of women after mastectomy. Trainings for the public (workshops and research picnics) will also be organized. It will affect the development of new personalized therapy in women with cancer and will actively engage relatives, co-workers and employers. Exchange of practices with foreign partners, mainly from the psychological and couching field is the perfect solution, contributing to the strengthening of the project idea.

The project titled \"Advancing culinary workshops\" was designed by the Museum aiming to provide to its adult educators the chance to get trained in different cooking workshops around Europe, to gain and bring back to the organisation the new knowledge and expertise needed to organise successful cooking workshops in Cyprus. \r\n\r\nThe concept of culinary workshops was selected as they are considered the best way for people not only to gain useful knowledge and skills about the local cuisine, but also to get interactively involved, stimulate their senses, get familiar with the local ingredients, tastes and smells, and also to appreciate the value of a healthy homemade meal. Cooking workshops also respond to one of the Museum's basic aims, to promote knowledge on local gastronomy using applied research and encouraging an interactive relationship between the general public and the organisation. Additionally, since the inclusion of Cyprus in the UNESCO list with the representative cuisines of Mediterranean Diet the Museum has been committed to organise and coordinate actions that would justify and maintain this important position. On these terms, the Museum is also involved in the Cyprus Tourism Organisation's plan for the development of gastronomic tourism, and the organising of professional cooking workshops would respond to this effort.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are for the participants to acquire new knowledge and develop new skills on managing successful culinary workshops. Also, to contemplate on their educational knowledge and skills and to further develop especially towards adult learning. Other objectives are for the participants to make new acquaintances in the European Community and get familiar with other European cultures and to develop their skills in other European languages. The main objectives of the project regarding the organisation are to meet its aims by providing to the public high quality activities that will help them sense the Cypriot gastronomic culture and help the Museum's recognition in the local and European cultural scene. An additional objective is to establish new partnerships that will help the organisation to develop life long collaborations with organisations around Europe and to raise opportunities for further collaborations in the future.\r\n\r\nEligible to participate in the project will be all the individuals that work for the Museum and they are involved in the adult education activities.
