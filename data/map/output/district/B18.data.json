There are 2 main techniques that dominate the protective coatings sector: hard chromium (HC) plating and thermal spray (TS). However, HC plating faces a series of issues with most important the extremely negative health and environmental impact leading to the EC restriction of this method for using Cr\\6 by the end of 2017. Similarly, recent toxicity studies concerning Co-WC cermet applied by TP have revealed that Co-WC particles are toxic in a dose/time-dependent manner. Consequently, there is the necessity of finding new, less hazardous methods and materials exhibiting the same or better performance compared to existing ones. \nThe PROCETS project will took advantage of the use of nano-particles for production of composite coatings with superior properties compared to those of HC produced by electroplating or to Co-WC produced by TS. These novel nano-particles will be incorporated into existing production lines after appropriate modifications. The new procedures will be easily transferred by minor adaption to the present electroplating and TS facilities, and will combine flexibility and mass customization abilities, restrict environmental and health hazards and finally be available at acceptable cost.

This project will create Online tools, manuals and recommendation how municipalities (local governmental bodies and institutions) can involve young people in to decision making process. This project will create new ways that decision makers would not only consult with youth, but that the ideas of youth would get priority status and provide young people with power, legitimacy and tools to monitor that their ideas are being implemented. With this project we want to shift youth participation from the concept of tokenism to active participation in advocating youth needs. The project will provide overview of local realities from Norway, UK and Lithuania in the field of participatory decision making. Project will provide tailored tools which are suiting for different realities, recommendations will be created how these tools could be used in different environments involving other social groups (senior citizens, young parents, unemployed, migrant background, disabled and etc.).This project will help civil servants, youth workers, community workers, NGO members to develop cooperation competence.

The Online tool will serve as mean to assure efficient youth participation and will allow to supervise the situation in the community and inform about needed changes and improvements.

Participants will become more self-aware through active participation in the planed activities, interactions with colleagues and reflection sessions. They will build confidence and competence while working in cultural and age diverse group, thus develop further skills of oral and written self-expression through English. Critical thinking will be raised then engaging in group discussions. The time, task and project management issues will be addressed and get introduction into new non-formal education methodologies.

Youth\u201c was born from the actualities of these days \u2013 religion, different changes, influence of technologies in everyday life, as well, about opinion on different aspects, such as emigration, immigration, refuges, terrorism, which are formed by media. Unfortunately, people, especially younger ones, believes everything whats on the hot-line and as result of that, they are commenting or just forming wrong opinion while linking religions to different countries and their cultures. When the world becomes more and more mixed, nationalities have been no longer equal to religions, and various religions becomes only one of the index of national identity, which sometimes is a positive indicator, but sometimes it may frighten. Now-days youth often is less religious, than previous generations, but paradoxically, between suicide victims inspired by religion, they are dominating. While implementing this project, we want to introduce religion from a various angle, to analyze reasons and results of globalization world and other different issues, which are really in the center of the attention.  During the project it will be very important to cooperate,find links with other participants, to deepen knowledge about different religions, discuss hot topics, conflicts and wars, which happen from the variety of religious beliefs, to talk about processes of emigration, immigration, globalization, terrorism, crisis of refugees. All methods will be based on non-formal education, learning to learn principles and working in intercultural groups. Only by working and learning together, participants will break stereotypes, overcome prejudices. Young people will be encouraged to speak and freely express their opinion, as well to listen the others speakers and respect them.

The project will last for 10 days and includes groups of 6 young people (5participants + 1group leader) aged 17-26 per team from Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, United Kingdom, Cyprus and Turkey. Priorities of the YE project:- To create community of young people, who will be tolerant and without any advanced prejudices, who will be able to evaluate changing context of the world and realizes differences between religion and culture;  - To foster sense of toleration and respect for diversity;- To deepen knowledge about different religions and traditions;- To get to know other cultures, understand similarities and differences between them;- To think about possible solutions for problems, which are caused because of misunderstanding between different religions;- To objectively evaluate refuges crisis; - To gain more knowledge what causes globalism and what are the results which we see in everyday life;- To learn how not to judge religious people and their religion because of the fault of some terrorism attacks;- To break stereotypes about religious people;- To share good experience with community members from Lithuania and other, participating and not participating countries;- To evaluate media influence on young people.Participants will improve following competences and skills: to work in a group or team; develops their social skills in mother tongue and foreign language, improve their decision making, time management, argumentation of their opinion skills. All these competences and skills will help them to faster adapt to different situations and teams in the future. Furthermore, while working in international teams, their will make strong friendships. The youth exchange project will provide intercultural environment, in which young people can learn, as well their learning process will be acknowledged by \u201eYouthpass\u201c certificate and learning badges system. Therefore, participants will get acquainted with the ERASMUS+ program and its opportunities.We plan, that after this project more people will be able to feel the differences between Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodoxy and Islam believers and becomes more tolerant to other religions. Moreover, more people will understand impact of emigration, immigration, globalism, will not be afraid of refuges and will not form discriminative opinion about them, but vice versa, will explain difficult situation of refuges.
