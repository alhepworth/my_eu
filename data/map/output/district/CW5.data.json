Aiming to reinvigorate those traditional forms that shaped a European identity for a digital age the project will enable emergent composers selected from across Europe via the international network of Music Information Centres (present in 20 EU states) to work with professional-standard ensembles in Iceland, Norway and the UK through a series of production-based residencies. The project will develop 6 new contemporary classical works and performance formats inspired by regional musical, lliterary, poetic and artistic traditions, interpreted through the eyes of an outsider working in each host region.

This will focus on the Network for New Music which enables production staff working with those composers and ensembles to develop knowledge networks to increase mobility, share audiences, strategise marketing, and develop opportunities across international borders in a sustainable fashion.Created with the intention of engaging modern audiences that may not have experienced contemporary classical music (believing it to be elitist, exclusive and demanding) the project will seek to reshape the perception of taught musicianship by showing its role in a shared European identity, embracing the emergent experience economy and moving the performance space from the concert hall to found spaces and the public realm.", "http://www.curatedplace.com", "CURATED PLACE LTD", "creative_552296-CREA-1-2014-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"]]}}, "6DF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Laboratorn\u00ed a ml\u00e9k\u00e1rensk\u00e1 praxe student\u016f, absolvent\u016f a pracovn\u00edk\u016f VO\u0160P a SP\u0160M Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e ve Spojen\u00e9m kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed", "Reaseheath College", 35974.0, 2, 4, "Our project \"Laboratory and dairy practical training of VO\u0160P and SP\u0160M Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e students, graduates and staff in the United Kingdom\" has emerged from our previous excellent experiences with Leonardo da Vinci programme (individual placements in the Netherlands) and on the grounds of our need to offer a good quality practical training abroad not only to our students, but to our graduates and staff as well. Since the target groups have changed we started to look for new partners in the UK. During her professional training in the UK the project manager managed to obtain contacts to our partners and since 2012 we have been discussing the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to enhance vocational and language competences of the participants and, introduce them to common laboratory and technology practice in British schools and professional companies. We intend to practise professional terminology of our students and to verify and enhance their key vocational skills (laboratory and technology). Further on, we plan to compare various dairy producers and milk processing facilities in the UK and the Czech Republic, raise self-confidence and language fluency of the participants, their interest in the branch and establish need for lifelong learning. Finally, we feel the urge to motivate young people, attract new students and regain lost credit of the school.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 20 participants divided into 3 groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

There is a lack of strong individuals who would participate in an individual foreign practical training. However, they uttered need and interest to carry out vocational training abroad as a group for a short period of time. Thus, we have planned a14-day training with 2 accompanying teachers at schools focused on the same branch. The 1st week (29/06-06/07/2014) has been arranged with Reaseheath College (lab training, excursions and a trade show in Birmingham).For the 2nd week (07/07-13/07/2014) we plan to verify lab and technology skills in Duchy College. With regard to the profile of the group and the fact that there is a hearing-impaired student with learning difficulties and 2 students who will turn 18 within July, we assume that presence of 2 accompanying persons is necessary (enlisted within activity 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The 2nd target group is made of 5 experienced adult participants with excellent moral and personal background. They are students and graduates of both secondary and higher vocational schools, who have been indicating true interest, have mastered English and experienced a stay abroad. We have planned a 3-week individual training in food labs, which will verify and develop their key vocational and language competences. We assume they will be more self-confident, start to think of their job prospects on labour market, confirm their need for lifelong learning and understanding general matters in context. The training will be provided by our partner agency Europa Training UK Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The 3rd target group is formed by a lab assistant, our 2011 higher school graduate, who has got relevant language knowledge and vocational skills, excellent moral and job profile. She has been showing deep interest in the branch and admits need for further education and training. We have planned a 3-week job-shadowing activity with Europa Training UK Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology of the project realization includes a preparatory phase (organizational matters, vocational, cultural and language seminars) followed by the training courses themselves and finally there is a dissemination phase, which will result in series of articles published in local and professional media, information posted on school website, an interview for a school magazine Fresh Milk, CD with photos and presentations, discussion with students.

Our primary target markets are the industrial cheese sector for chilled and frozen pizzas and ready meals.

Therefore we will introduce new innovative starter cultures for improving the flavour and texture of low-fat Mozzarella-type cheeses and optimize appropriate processing conditions of temperature, pH, milk fat and casein-to-fat ratio in the milk. Furthermore, we will develop an innovative oil coating process for improving the meltdown of the low-fat cheese after it is shredded in the meal in preparation. Based on the scientific findings of the coating process, we will then develop an oil coating device which will successfully coat cheese shreds.\n\nWe will enhance our knowledge of starter cultures and oil coating of cheese and hence provide the end consumer with a cheese displaying desired texture, flavour and melting profiles.
