It draws on the researched and tested technologies and pedagogical models of previously successful EU co-funded projects and contemporary business development models to provide long term sustainable Open Education Resources and services  that underpin progression to nationally and internationally accredited qualifications in Computing at Level 4 and above of the European Qualifications Framework.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are \r\nTo provide teachers with a \"big data\" tool  for automating progress measures, reducing time spent on administration and transfering it to teaching informed by empirical data from testing.\r\n\r\nTo raise levels of digital literacy in schools in order to make people more self-sufficient in their use of technology and less dependent on formal retraining every time there is a shift in the technological ecosystem.\r\n\r\nTo develop a strategy to  support the development of Open Education Resources, including free services founded in a sustainable business model that is self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nTo gather empirical evidence of what children know and can do in computing in order to feedback to and develop the curriculum based on direct evidence.\r\n\r\nThe project partners are from UK, NL, CZ, BG, ES and Si.  They represent small business enterprise, a university and a national network association. They have a wealth of technical and pedagogical expertise and share a collective enthusiasm for practical methods of reducing costs and improving efficiency through the use of free software, OERs and free services supported by a contemporary \"fremium\" business model. \r\n\r\nIn this project the focus is on the integration of new pedagogical methods, technical infrastructure and business methods associated with the contemporary internet. disruptive innovation and evidence based pedagogy.  Big data provides very clear opportunities to contextualise improved learning through empirical research and we have a proven method of doing this that can scale at low cost to every country in Europe.  Activities are focused on collecting evidence from testing what children know and understand about digital technologies before and after formal teaching.  In order to take this beyond simple empirical data collection on a large scale we will provide the support and infrastructure for free to enable learning and hence improvement in knowledge, understanding and skills. We will sustain the project by establishing a low cost on-line certification of attainment and progress for which there will be a charge to the end users of 1 Euro per certificate after the funding period ends. This will be sufficient together with committed private sector sponsorship to maintain the free services that the project will extend from the UK to the partner countries.  There will be progression routes for students to gain new qualifications, nationally accredited, directly referenced to levels in the EQF, and supporting ECVET and EQARF principles. The associated training and guidance for teachers will have a multiplying effect and can be extended to all STEM subjects. \r\n\r\nThe project management is based on the principles of Prince2.  The pedagogical method is assessment based on learning outcomes and competence based criteria supported by comprehensive open source collaborative technologies running in the Cloud.  This is complemented by on-line exams to provide grading.  All are OERs and provided with free sustainable support.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will have immediate impact by providing free and open education resources as soon as they are developed or linked to the project web site.  The project consortium will strengthen further in its already considerable knowledge of the OER field, testing and assessment pedagogies and technologies and the EQF, EQARF, ECVET and qualifications model. The potential benefits for the longer term are to establish a European standard for assessing attainment and progress based on \"big data\" sourced and supported using OERs and leading to valued qualifications in computing that shift the expectation to the underlying transferable skills, knowledge and understanding of digital technologies needed in the 21st Century.", "http://www.thelearningmachine.co.uk", "NAACE TRADING LTD", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013582_7"]]}}, "7XE": {"esif": {"data": [[1443657600000, 1525046400000, "Get on Track", "By Design Group", "Get On Track will engage, empower and enable 225 disadvantaged young people to access education and training opportunities through a 14 month inspirational sports and athlete driven programme.

This training will consist in a pedagogical project gathering all the elements that form the movement (music, dancing, and graphic design) so as to comprehend this culture as a whole, and not only as separate disciplines.\r\nIndeed, the different elements composing the hip hop movement are too often taught separately, and not enough as a whole. Yet, in order for people to understand its values and get the best out of it, it seems necessary to show the youth leaders the impact an artistic and pedagogical project gathering all the disciplines can have.\r\nThe training will be based on the complementary skills of the participants, in order to create a shared artwork which will be filmed and showed to the public, on stage.\r\nThe video can then be used as a pedagogical resource for the partner organizations\u2019 works.\r\nThe main theme of the training will be solidarity.
