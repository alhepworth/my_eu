The development of direct HC SOFCs still meets lot of challenges and problems arising from the fact that the anode materials operate under severe conditions leading to low activity towards reforming and oxidation reactions, fast deactivation due to carbon formation and instability due to the presence of sulphur compounds. Although research on these issues is intensive, no major technological breakthroughs have been so far with respect to robust operation, sufficient lifetime and competitive cost.\nT-CELL proposes a novel electrochemical approach aiming at tackling these problems by a comprehensive effort to define, explore, characterize, develop and realize a radically new triode approach to SOFC technology together with a novel, advanced architecture for cell and stack design. This advance will be accomplished by means of an integrated approach based both on materials development and on the deployment of an innovative cell design that permits the effective control of electrocatalytic activity under steam or dry reforming conditions. The novelty of the proposed work lies in the pioneering effort to apply Ni-modified materials electrodes of proven advanced tolerance, as anodic electrodes in SOFCs and in the exploitation of our novel triode SOFC concept which introduces a new controllable variable into fuel cell operation.\nIn order to provide a proof of concept of the stackability of triode cells, a triode SOFC stack consisting of at least 4 repeating units will be developed and its performance will be evaluated under methane and steam co-feed, in presence of a small concentration of sulphur compound.\nSuccess of the overall ambitious objectives of the proposed project will result in major progress beyond the current state-of-the-art and will open entirely new perspectives in cell and stack designs.", 113792.0, 2714684.0, 7, 8, "T-CELL", "http://www.tcellproject.eu/", "http://www.mantisdeposition.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/161259.jpg", "fp7_104881_999535337"], [1283299200000, 1472601600000, "Advanced Gratting for Thin Films Solar Cell", "Mantis Deposition Limited", "The minority carrier diffusion lengths are small in polycrystalline or amorphous materials used in thin film solar cells, requiring thin layers to maximize charge collection. This is contradictory for the requirement to maximize solar energy absorption. The optical design consisting in increasing solar cell\u2019s light-trapping capability is of prime importance. In order to provide total internal reflection, both randomly textured surfaces and regularly patterned surfaces have been investigated. No one of these approaches provides optimal light trapping because no one is suitable for the broad solar spectrum.\nRecent approaches involving new TCO layers show that double textures provide improved scattering. The AGATHA project aims to realize an advanced light trapping design by combining micro-texturing of glass by hot embossing and nano-texturing of the top TCO layer by etching. The parameters of this \u201cmodulated surface texture\u201d can be adjusted to maximize the light scattering in all the solar spectrum to provide a significant increase in both short-circuit current and EQE. Suitable for high production throughput, the new texturation process chain developed in AGATHA fits with the intrinsic low cost nature of thin film solar cells\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of this optical trapping design, the modulated texture concept will be implemented in a-Si:H based, \u00b5-c-Si:H based and CIGS based thin films technologies. The objective is to reduce the active material thickness, from 250 nm up to 150 nm for the a-Si:H, from 1.5 \u00b5m up to 1 \u00b5m for \u00b5c-Si:H and from 2.5 \u00b5m up to 800 nm for the CIGS, when increasing the short circuit current of 15 % The choice of these technologies aims to maximize the impact by addressing 70% of the thin film market.

This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains.
