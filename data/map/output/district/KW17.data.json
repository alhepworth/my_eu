European and American lobster are cannibalistic in nature, and are therefore kept in individual housing cells demanding individual handling, which without automated technology has proven to be too labour consuming. The LobsterPlant project will by making large scale farming of lobster a reality, contribute to filling the gap between market demand and market supply of lobster and reduce the need to harvest natural lobster, whose population is already low due to over harvesting. There is currently no competing technology on the market which makes large scale farming of lobster feasible, so the proposing partners are hence creating a new market for themselves.    Abstract:  The demand for European lobster exceeds supply. Current European lobster landings can only supply 2\u20137% of the market demand as the natural stock is simply insufficient to sustain an annual harvest required by the market due to over fishing which has depleted stocks. Large scale aquaculture of lobster is an alternative method to provide the supply to the market, but has not to date been feasible due to lack of automated technology available. The LobsterPlant project will make large scale farming of lobster possible by developing of:  \u2022 automated feeding and imaging technology for feeding and monitoring of the lobsters \u2022 cleaning technology for removal of waste in raceways  \u2022 feed of right stability for the automated feeding technology and \u2022 determine optimal methods for control of water quality in lobster plants", 111778.0, 1192772.0, 7, 11, "LOBSTERPLANT", "http://www.lobsterplantproject.com", "http://www.northbayshellfish.co.uk", null, "fp7_95474_999424660"], [1385856000000, 1543536000000, "EnviGuard \u2013 Development of a biosensor technology for environmental monitoring and disease prevention in aquaculture ensuring food safety", "NORTH BAY SHELLFISH Ltd", "The objective of the EnviGuard project is to develop a highly specific and precise (i.e. quantitative and qualitative) in situ measurement device for currently hard to measure man-made chemical contaminants and biohazards (toxic microalgae, viruses & bacteria, biotoxins & PCBs) that can be used as an early warning system in aquaculture and as an environmental monitor to assess the good environmental status of the sea in compliance with the MSFD.
