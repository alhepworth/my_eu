In line with European Commission priorities, the general objectives of the project are:- to ensure a good start in education for all children, by enhancing the quality of ECEC and by ensuring that the benefits of ECEC are carried through to other school education levels; - to support teachers to adopt new methods and tools for dealing with complex classroom realities and diversified groups of learners. In the context of the needs identified at local and transnational level by the partners involved, the project proposal aims to DEVELOP INNOVATIVE APPROCHES, METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS FOR FACILITATING CHILDREN\u2019S TRANSITIONS across home, ECEC services and school institutions. Within this framework, the specific objectives of the project are:1) to examine existing transition practices with different focuses at each project location in order to take into account the diversified needs of target groups in each context; 2) to involve teachers, families and local stakeholder in designing innovative practices for smoothening transitions, with special attention paid to the school success of children facing complex situations (eg. socio-economic disadvantage) and to the engagement of families at risk of social exclusion (eg. Roma);3) to increase the competence of ECEC/school professionals by involving them in action-research and experimentation projects, with the support provided by experienced researchers;4) to promote the educational innovation of ECEC and school institutions by experimenting new pedagogical approaches and educational methodologies that support children \u2013 especially those who are most at risk of school failure \u2013 in facing successfully transition processes; 5) to identify principles of good practices that could contribute to trans-national exchange and learning as well as to the improvement of educational policies at local, regional, national and EU level.The partnership consists of 10 partners - university/research/training organisations as well as ECEC/school institutions \u2013 located in 4 countries:- ERI and OS Tisina (SL),- UNIBO and DD Vignola (IT),- Pen Green Research Base, Rockingham Primary School, Studfall Junior Infant and Nursery School (UK),- VBJK, Mezennestje day care centre and Kolva kindergarden (BE).The International Step by Step Network (ISSA) and the \u2018Mensen voor mensen\u2019 poverty advocacy group are associate partners to the project. The project methodology builds on participatory action-research and on international research evidence showing that continuing professional development interventions that are integrated into professionals\u2019 everyday practice are the most effective in enhancing educational quality and in improving children\u2019s learning. Transnational training activities stand at the very core of the START project as they lay the foundation for the design of effective action-research and experimentation projects within ECEC/school settings and - at the same time - build a solid framework for the exchange and transferability of good practices (SUSTAINABILITY OVER TIME).   The main areas of activities and outputs carried out within the project are:1) desk research pertaining early years transitions and educational continuity (Output: literature review);2) development and experimentation of innovative pedagogical approaches and educational strategies for improving transition practices in contexts of socio-cultural diversity (Outputs: 4 case studies);3) elaboration and diissemination of educational resources and training materials (Output: Training Kit);4) elaboration and dissemination of detailed guidelines contributing to the advancement of transitions practice in Europe and beyond (Output: Recommendations for policy and practice).         It is expected that the project will impact at national and international level contributing to the IMPROVEMENT of EDUCATIONAL TRANSITION PRACTICES and POLICIES.

In this sense, the sustainability and environmental accounting transverse in today\u2019s economy, in which the life cycle assessment and services resulting from its implementation (European Product Declaration, Eco-design, Product Carbon Footprint) stand as a platform of great value to achieve these objectives. Using this context as starting point, partner organisations from six different countries meet together in order to carry out \u201cEcotextyle: Vocational Education and Training on Product Enviromental Management for the Footwear and Textile Sector\", a 24-month partnership at European level coordinated by the Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico del Calzado de La Rioja (CTCR) (Spain) with the cooperation of Neo Sapiens (Spain), BATTI (Bulgaria), Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche (UNIVPM) (Italy), Institute of Leather Industry in Lodz (IPS) (Poland), Zavod IRCUO (Slovenia) and SATRA Technology Centre (United Kingdom). Funded under the Key Action 2 of the Erasmus+ programme for strategic partnerships for vocational education and training, this development of innovation project aims to gather organisations from different countries but working on the development of programmes to train and educate on product environmental footprints (PEF) on the footwear sector and the production of textile complements related to it. According to this, the main objective of this partnership will be to establish the appropriate training within SMEs or training centres to be able to implement the PEF methodology, in line with the future European policies. The environmental assessment methodologies defined in Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) footwear should be properly applied for quantifying the environmental performance of products, thus a specific theme of a training pathway shall be developed. The idea is to work together and exchange good practices related to the training of those responsible of the product environmental management inside their SMEs and to provide them the curricular skills and competences needed for an appropriate development of their professional profiles (at local or international level). To achieve this, partner organisations will create an online training platform and face-to-face workshops on different languages dealing with issues such as product life cycle analysis, ecodesign, environmental footprints, environmental labelling, environmental product declaration, etc. and combining both, formal and  non formal methodologies.  The project will also offer a coaching service for those interested on using the learning materials previously mentioned and that will give them the support to apply the knowledge acquired to their everyday work environments on the footwear sector. To make all this possible, partner organisations will carry out different transnational meetings, training courses, pilot tests activities, on the field researches and multiplier events on each partner country to disseminate the project results. Thanks to all of this, \u201cEcotextyle\u201d will be able to  develop self assessment and training tools that could provide all the skills needed and certificate at the same time the qualifications demanded on the footwear sector for both, environmental sustainable products and producers.", "http://www.satra.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA202-038667_4"]]}}, "8UZ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RNQ", "Kettering General Hospital", "nhs_RNQ51"]]}}}}
