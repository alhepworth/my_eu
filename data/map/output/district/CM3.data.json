It is evident in the inefficiency and installation problems with coaxial transmission of the ever-increasing number of  terrestrial and satellite broadcast channels available to individual homes and Multiple Dwelling Units. The distribution of signals from DBS Low Noise Blocks to Set Top Boxes is currently based on IF signalling on multiple coaxial cables. In the UK, BSKYB alone installs around 10,000 multi-way switched systems p.a. into Multiple Dwelling Units with 100s of coax cable runs in each. Across Europe there are several 100 million individual installed satellite TV systems with each STB requiring connection of 2 or 4 cables. DBS is also threatened by the growing availability of TV over cable and internet links. The aim of this project is to develop a new high-bandwidth optical technology able to transmit multiple, full satellite data bands on a single fibre cable assembly link with essentially  unlimited future capacity. Our proposed technology will also enable the full integration of Sat-TV with very high bandwidth home networking in a single solution, providing future proof connectivity and high quality coomunication at reduced costs.

Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_215"]]}}}}
