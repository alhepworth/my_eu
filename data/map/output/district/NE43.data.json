The range of research spans from feedstock improvement, through innovations in pretreatment and saccharification, the generation of added value products, especially from lignin, and innovations in fermentation. The project brings together world-leading scientists with innovative new industries working in the biorefinery and renewable products areas. Our work is focussed on C4 grasses as these encompass maize, miscanthus and sugarcane, and these closely related species are major bioenergy crops in Europe and Brazil. The programme of work aims to: (1) Improve the feedstock quality of lignocellulose in biofuels crops to allow truly cost-effective ethanol production; (2) add value to the overall process of conversion in biomass biorefining by upgrading residues and by-products and producing new value streams in addition to bioethanol; (3) improve the conversion process by which we produce sugars; (4) improve fermentation efficiency; (5) develop integrated processes that capture maximum value from lignocellulosic biomass; (6) ensure that the new processes developed fulfil sustainability requirements by reducing GHG emissions, cutting other forms of air pollution, have minimal impacts on local environments and biodiversity, build sustainable rural industries, and do not impact on food production and prices. Our cooperative partner in Brazil, CEProBIO, brings together almost all of the leading research centres for second generation bioethanol production in that nation, along with a number of key industrial partners. The cooperation between SUNLIBB and CEProBIO represents an opportunity to bring together some of the best researchers in our respective regions to work on a globally important issue.", 88752.0, 3913772.0, 5, 14, "SUNLIBB", null, "http://www.northenergy.co.uk", null, "fp7_95909_993978013"], [1320105600000, 1383177600000, "Integrated Design for Efficient Advanced Liquefaction of Hydrogen", "North Energy Associates Limited", "'Hydrogen is an important energy carrier as a viable future clean transport fuel. H2-fuelled vehicles are affordable, infrastructure investments are manageable and H2 and electric mobility are required to meet future CO2 emission targets. Plans are made to implement H2-refuelling infrastructure in Germany followed by roll-out over Europe by 2015. Logistically, liquid H2 appears the only viable option to supply the larger stations in the medium term. Without developing a liquefaction capacity, there is a serious risk to H2-infrastructure development and implementation. However, at present liquefaction of H2 is expensive, energy intensive and relatively small scale. Reduction of liquefaction costs via technology development and increased competition is crucial.\n\nIDEALHY is an enabling project for viable, economic liquefaction capacity in Europe, to accelerate rational infrastructure investment, and enable the rapid spread of H2-refuelling stations across Europe. The IDEALHY project researches, develops and scales-up data and designs into an optimised design for a generic liquefaction process at a scale of 30-50 te/day, representing a very substantial upscale over proposed and existing LH2-plants. The project also develops a detailed strategic plan for a prospective large-scale demonstration of efficient H2-liquefaction with options for location. The focus is to improve substantially efficiency and reduce capital costs of liquefaction through innovations, including linking LH2 production with LNG terminal operations to make use of available cryogenic temperatures for pre-cooling. Supporting economic and lifecycle assessment of the resulting gains in energy efficiency will be made, together with a whole chain assessment based on near term market requirements.\n\nIDEALHY will be undertaken by a partnership comprising world leaders in H2 distribution and liquefaction technologies, research institutes, academic partners and pioneering SME suppliers to the liquefaction indus'", 62646.0, 1762733.0, 5, 8, "IDEALHY", null, "http://www.northenergy.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-10/56904.jpg", "fp7_101479_993978013"]]}}}}
