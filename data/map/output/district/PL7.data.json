And this affects our way of teaching and meeting our pupils. \r\nIn our classes we also have a lot of pupils with special needs. They are integrated in the regular education.\r\nBecause of all these circumstances we need to find different and new ways in teaching and we take all these different aspects and turn them into something good. We are always looking for unconventional ways of reaching out to our pupils. \r\n\r\nOften geographical or historical projects are restricted to a region, a period or a theme. Consider the historic building as a witness of our history allows us to cross the different parts that make up our history : the political, social, environmental and landscape parts, how human influence the history and how history influences human life. In our current project (In fact they are biosystem wonders - http://www.biosystemwonders.eu) we  find out that the priority of social insects is to maintain the species. We, as human, we must reflect on our past and our present life so that we can choose if we want (as now) give priority at our personnal confort life or if we want to save our species.\r\n\r\nThe research result will be a website (and/or a wiki), a documentary movie, a book or a e-book\r\nAn educational resource pack on the internet (database) (where all the teachers involved in the project will put their didactical work about the project to share our teaching experience)\r\n\r\nPractical :\r\nWe propose a 2 year project\r\nEach year, in september, a meeting only for teachers...in those meeting, the coordinator and/or one of the partner shares a specific skill with the others...making a prezi or power-point presentation, to build and share a wiki, to build and share a internet database, to make a movie.....\r\nEach year in winter and in the beginning of the summer, a pupils and teachers meeting ( pupils exchange) will be organized where the results will be shared....about \r\n- a objectief regard on the building\r\n- how this building was build (technical) and the evolution ot those technieks till ours\r\n- the history (political) where this building could be the witness\r\n- the social life arround this building through the ages\r\n- how this social life had an influence on the surrounded landscape\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, each partner will organize a event to share our common movie (documentary), our website and our crazy book", "http://www.yfps.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE01-KA219-013204_3"]]}}, "1XQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Ocean Citizens of the Future", "Yealmpstone Farm Primary School", 323538.0, 2, 12, "The cities of Plymouth and Brest have been twinned successfully for over 50 years with a strong background of successful joint initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to strengthen understanding of the importance of the maritime culture in the lives of our young people and what their responsibilities will be, growing up as Ocean Citizens of the Future. Activities will directly address targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy to promote youth, employability of young people, lifelong learning, the countering of social exclusion and the promotion of active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe theme, \u201cOcean Citizens of the Future, has been selected because Plymouth and Brest are both experts in the maritime field and the project focuses on the integration of this environment into the social and economic well-being of both cities, while raising the awareness of their citizens to well qualified jobs and recruitment opportunities within the maritime sector. This fits in well with current major developments to reinvigorate the regions\u2019 marine and advanced manufacturing sectors, significantly increasing job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will be coordinated by the two regional education authorities, working closely with eight schools, covering a range of demographic profiles from socially deprived to more economically-advantaged across the whole age range i.e. 3 \u2013 18 years. Teachers in these schools have already been involved in extensive project planning, designed to make the fullest possible use of the outstanding coastal environments, as well as contacts with local businesses and industries accessible to the partner schools in both countries, including tourism, commerce, port industries and military bases. \r\n\r\nThe schools and education authorities will work together with other key organisations with international reach, including Brest'Aim -Oc\u00e9anopolis in Brest and the UK\u2019s National Maritime Aquarium (NMA) in Plymouth. Both have major roles in research and educational provision and will play a strategic part in project support, multiplier events and dissemination of results. Other more local groups and small scale organisations with entrepreneurial approaches likely to appeal to young people will also be involved. Both cities have a vibrant range of major cultural activities and events which draw on the cities\u2019 maritime histories and environments. These will be fully integrated into opportunities for all involved in the project i.e. 5000 +.\r\n\r\nShared collaborative activities will bring an added value to the competences of the partners through meeting clearly identified needs of young people, who need support and encouragement to appreciate and develop the skills needed to succeed in the wider environment of today\u2019s Europe.\r\n\r\nEcological, economic and social challenges for the regions will be explored in ways designed to generate real impact and meaning for students, teachers and the wider communities.  Ocean Citizens of the Future will encourage the young people involved to appreciate and interact with ecological and environmental issues within their shared European environment, through their joint international activities, communication and integrated mobilities. This will encourage them to become more proactive citizens with a heightened development of initiative and increased language skills.\r\n\r\nProject results will include:\r\nYoung Reporters of Arts and Sciences . Activities and events with Oc\u00e9anopolis and the NMA.\r\nExhibition: Compendium of Good Practices. Developed as a continuing resource and online facility throughout the project, to include pedagogical approaches and successful professional practice.\r\nEnhancing the Cities.  Comparison of maritime worlds of Brest and Plymouth.  Audio and video guides by students for students. [Some translation].  A pedestrian circuit / rally will be organized.\r\nPanel of Maritime Jobs.  Exhibition of recorded work, promoted through key events [ STEMFEST etc. ]\r\nFull regional Media Coverage.\r\n\r\nThis work will also provide significant opportunities for the professional development of teachers engaged in creating and delivering the programme. They will gain experience from different pedagogical approaches and create bonds with their pupils and other colleagues by working together in a different environment.  All partners will gain a better knowledge of how to maximise the use of resources, working collaboratively, and building on the effective relationships formed. They will also develop more sophisticated, practical knowledge and expertise of IT skills appropriate for extending international collaborative partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of the project are that Plymouth and Brest will be able to collaborate more effectively as they will have increased awareness of each other\u2019s backgrounds. By creating bonds between the pupils, teachers and other professionals we hope to raise European consciousness and favour the mixing of social classes and cultural origins as well as fighting prejudice.", "http://yfps.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA201-015311_10"], [2017, "Chanson et Inclusion", "Yealmpstone Farm Primary School", 87942.0, 4, 5, "The Belgian association \"Muza\u00efka - Les Productions du plaisir\", regularly organizes workshops centered around singing in primary schools.

Our Erasmus + project will allow the different partners to sing these songs, to create new songs that they will share with the children of other partner countries. This will not only give the children and the educational teams involved the opportunity to develop skills around these songs, but also open the door to emotions and be a formidable vehicle for inclusion and openness to others Cultures, other religions, and the artistic worlds. Indeed, the songs created will be exchanged between the children of the different countries who will sing them at local and regional concerts at first.

These academics are working together with industry to develop a circular economy solution to create wealth from waste.\n\u00a0\nWhy is the project necessary?\nThere is an urgent need to develop sustainable food and farming. \u00a0\nNorth West Europe is a densely populated and intensely agricultural area. It thus contributes disproportionately to food and farm waste produced in the EU each year.\nIncreasing amounts of food and farm waste are processed using anaerobic digestion (AD). AD converts waste to biogas used for energy and a liquid nutrient rich digestate, most of which is returned to land as a biofertiliser.\nHowever, there are strict limits on the amount of digestate which is allowed to be put back on agricultural \u00a0land. Strict limits are imposed with EU legislation and so-called Nitrate Vulnerable Zones.\u00a0This is increasingly creating excess unwanted nutrients.\u00a0\nThe ability to use these excess nutrients to produce new products presents a circular economy solution.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow can ALG-AD help?\nALG-AD combines algal and AD technology.\u00a0 Microalgae, mainly photosynthetic microorganisms will be cultivated, converting the unwanted nutrients into biomass. The cultivated algal biomass is rich in protein and other useful compounds, and can be used to generate sustainable animal feed products and other useful bio-products.\n\u00a0\nWhat will ALG-AD be doing?\nALG-AD is building three pilot facilities at 3 distinct \u2018real life conditions locations in North West Europe: Devon, Ghent and Brittany. \u00a0Each facility will use local conditions to grow the algae and record results. Information from the three pilots will be used to generate Decision Support Tools. These tools together with demonstration to stakeholders will promote adoption of the new technology.", 1483228800000, 1640908800000, 63317.0, "nweurope_3_5"]]}}}}
