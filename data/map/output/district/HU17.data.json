Especially in the case of customised products which are unsuitable for testing in laboratories. There is a lack of expertise, experience, and resources available across Europe for such kind of testing. An increasing concern is that new regulations addressing these products risk being unenforceable. The aim of the INTAS project is to address these concerns and provide technical and cooperative support, as well as capacity building activities, to MSAs charged with enforcing these regulations. The need for the INTAS project arises from the difficulty that MSAs and market actors face in establishing and verifying compliance with energy performance requirements for large industrial products subject to requirements of the Ecodesign Directive. The focus of the project is to support compliance for very large industrial products, specifically transformers and industrial fans, with the requirements of the Ecodesign Directive. The energy consumption of transformers and industrial fans is very significant and thus the risk of losses due to poor compliance cannot be ignored. The project aims to:\na. support European Member State MSAs deliver compliance for large products (specifically for transformers and large fans); \nb. support industry to be sure of what their obligations are under the Ecodesign Directive and to deliver compliance in a manner that will be broadly accepted by MSAs; \nc. foster a common European approach to the delivery and verification of compliance for these products.\nThe INTAS project involves 16 partners among them  there are 11 organisations, which are National MSAs or cooperating closely with the National MSAs, targeting 10 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Italy).", 84039.0, 1640068.0, 12, 17, "INTAS", null, null, null, "h2020_200067_938682484"]]}}, "9BA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Nature In Cooperative Education", "EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE COUNCIL", 111540.0, 4, 5, "Project NICE (NATURE IN COOPERATIVE EDUCATION) wants to link the central idea of the relationship between man and nature and the ability of teachers to transfer their pupils these values by a new training methodology which will develop a \u201ctraining path\u201d among this central idea and a stronger awareness among young generations. \r\n\r\nTo do this, project will develop actions and activities involving teachers, as tools to transfer knowledge, to develop critical skills. \r\n\r\nInvolved teachers belong to primary schools of the four participating countries (Italy, Great Britain, Slovenia and Malta) and they will be pointed out in schools or they will be able to voluntary choose to participate.
