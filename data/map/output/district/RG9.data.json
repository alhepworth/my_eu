The objective of RISCS is to provide fundamental research on environmental impacts, necessary to underpin frameworks for the safe management of CO2 storage sites. To achieve this, RISCS will quantitatively assess environmental impacts from exposure to known CO2 fluxes. The assessments will be based on field laboratory experiments, measurements at natural leakage sites and numerical simulations, for both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This will provide new constraints on the impacts of CO2 leakage on humans and onshore and offshore ecosystems. RISCS will provide the underpinning information necessary to: 1. Rigorously evaluate the safety of different storage sites 2. Carry out Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) over different timescales 3. Design storage sites to minimise hazards 4. Help to design near surface monitoring strategies 5. Refine storage licence applications and conditions 6. Develop a framework to communicate the safety of storage to key stakeholders This approach will meet the requirements of OSPAR and the EC Directive both in ensuring environmental protection and the planning of near surface monitoring programmes. The US EPA has recently published rules for CO2 storage, and a \u2018Vulnerability Evaluation Framework for geological sequestration of CO2\u2019. RISCS will build on this approach, creating a similar framework addressing European needs. In order to meet these objectives we have assembled a team with very specific and focussed expertise, enabling us to assess both northern and southern European impacts scenarios, onshore and offshore. To maintain a full external perspective on the research, from both scientific and public acceptance viewpoints, we have enlisted leading CCS experts from CSLF partner countries, two NGOs, the IEA GHG programme and industry.", 250117.0, 4458870.0, 11, 23, "RISCS", null, "http://www.quintessa.org", "/docs/results/images/2015/153755.jpg", "fp7_93462_996752407"], [1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Bentonite mechanical evolution", "Quintessa Limited", "The overall objective of the project is to develop and test the tools necessary for the assessment of the hydro-mechanical evolution of an installed bentonite barrier and its resulting performance. This will be achieved by cooperation between design and engineering, science and performance assessment. The evolution from an installed engineered system to a fully functioning barrier will be assessed. One of the challenges is to take into account initial heterogeneities introduced in the system by conception with a combination of block and pellets or due to the size of the bentonite component (several 100 m3). It will require a more detailed understanding of material properties, of the fundamental processes that lead to homogenisation, of the role of scale effects and improved capabilities for numerical modelling. The goal is to verify the performance of current designs for buffers, backfills, seals and plugs. The overall driver for the project is the assessment cases that will be defined at the onset of the project (WP1). The quantitative models currently available are not fully able to represent all the complexities of the evolution of an installed bentonite. A substantial effort is needed to improve both the conceptual approaches and the numerical solutions in the current models (WP3). The updated/newly developed models need to be tested and verified using available data (WP5).  There are some areas where fundamental data and the understanding of materials are incomplete. An efficient experimental programme will support model development and testing (WP4). There is already a large database from experiments performed within EC projects and national programmes, both laboratory and Underground Research Laboratory (URL) experiments. Many of the tests have been performed with other purposes in mind, but the results can be used in the Beacon project.
