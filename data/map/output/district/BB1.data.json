The Foreign Languages curriculum is a new challenge, and we understand the importance of ensuring that our pupils have access to the opportunity to develop their skills and fulfill their academic potential. It is no longer possible to merely dabble in foreign language teaching, as the subject now has a much higher profile. We want to ensure that all staff have the necessary knowledge and confidence to equip our pupils with the skills which will vastly improve their life chances and employability. Many of our pupils have disadvantaged backgrounds, and we want to ensure that our children see the benefits of learning a new language, and see it as an essential part of their education. Whilst some of our children may have limited opportunities to travel and broaden their understanding of the world, the project would give them a chance to learn about life for children in another country, and observe similarities and differences in another area of the world. This can only serve to help foster positive attitudes, and stimulate a further desire to learn more.Whilst applying for eight places on the project, the whole staff would benefit from the dissemination of the skills developed on the course and embedding improved methodology. There are also over 239 pupils in our School, who would be able to take their first steps in fulfilling Erasmus's vision of learning a new language and learning about other cultures. By bringing alive language learning in the Primary School, and ensuring that it is a stimulating and exciting subject, pupils may also be encouraged further develop their language skills in their years at Secondary School, with further study in French or learning additional languages such as Italian, Spanish or German.

Distinctions are made because of skin color, ethnic background, sexuality or religion. The current refugee / migrant crisis in Europe adds another dimension. Many people fear the arrival of newcomers. People get treated in a certain different way, without thinking. Usually it is based on stereotypes and prejudices. There is a clear lack of knowledge and interaction between different people, who just move around in their own \u2018circles\u2019. With this training course we want to promote an exchange of personal stories, to overcome prejudices. During the training, the attending youth workers will first learn what the root causes of prejudices are in our societies and analyze the situation in different countries. The next phase is about exploring and mastering online tools to promote an exchange of information between different people. One particular example will be given: publishing articles and matching photographs at \u2018Humans of \u2026\u2019 pages on Facebook and Instagram. The idea originates from the hugely successful \u2018Human of New York\u2019 page, which has gathered over 16 million likes on Facebook by now. It presents street portraits and interviews, collected on the streets of New York. With the initiative, the subscribers of the page can read short stories of people they would perhaps normally never speak to. It offers a unique insight into the lives of others, broadening your own viewpoint. The power of social media is that it can reach a lot of people quickly, and it offers an easy space for interaction afterwards as well. Moreover, as most young people are active on social networks, it is good way to reach them. In this training course the youth workers will learn the basics of publishing such articles, including interviewing people, writing the story and shooting matching photographs on the street. The focus would be on subjects with a particular minority background, with a certain interest to tell their story. By the end of the training, every participating city should have a page. In case a page of a city already exists, we count on that the forces can be joined. In the weeks after the training, the youth workers should transfer the skills to the youngsters in their organizations, creating more impact and ensuring a sustainable flow of articles on the pages, written by youngsters. The main aim of the project is to empower youth workers with essential competences to promote exchange and understanding, using online tools. The objectives are:\u2022 To understand the root causes of prejudices and its role in our societies;\u2022 To analyze the situation in different countries regarding prejudices and minorities, with special attention to migrants and refugees. \u2022 To explore \u2018Humans of \u2026\u2019 pages on Facebook and Instagram as a contribution to promoting exchange and understanding;\u2022 To acquire competences (attitude and skills) to do street interviews, to make a short article about it and to shoot and edit street/portrait photographs;\u2022 To brainstorm and to investigate more online tools to promote an exchange of ideas;\u2022 To learn how to maximize the impact via online tools; \u2022 To gain skills on transferring competences to youngsters. There will be in total 25 youth workers involved, and a team of 5 trainers and organizers will guide the process and manage the logistics. The working methods are based on non-formal education, with brain storms, group discussions, inputs, learning by doing, theatrical methods etc. The project will have a big impact on several target groups and fields: on the participating youth workers, on the participating youth organizations, on the youngsters in those organizations and on the general public. The participants will learn about prejudices, about the situation in Europe, about setting up online activities and on transferring knowledge and skills to youngsters in their organizations. The youngsters will be actively contributing to the society (and acquiring very useful skills and attitudes) by going on the streets to interview persons from a certain minority background, shooting photographs, writing articles and publishing them, with the knowledge on how to create a maximum impact. The readers, the public, will be invited to actively contribute and discuss as well, via the social media pages. In the end, it will contribute to a better informed society, overcoming prejudices and with respect for differences.", "http://www.slyncs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL02-KA105-001279_8"], [2014, "1st Summer ART Academy - Portraits of a Generation", "STRENGTHENING LINKS BETWEEN THE YOUTH AND NETWORKS COMMUNITIES AND SPECIALISTS", 19405.0, 6, 6, "In the \u201c1st Summer ART Academy \u2013 Portraits of a generation\u201d groups of young people from Germany, Poland, Latvia, Spain, Great Britain and Macedonia will come together to work together for one week in different art workshops.

The main characteristics of the project are to be found in its simplicity and positive approach. It is created by members of the Danish youth organization Stop the violence in 2000 and it is now operational in more than 60 countries. The Human Library is a public event, where interested people can come to challenge their prejudices. The idea is to have a conversation with a Human Book: a person who has experienced prejudices due to issues such as race, sex, age, disability, sexual preference, gender identity, class, religion/belief or lifestyle choices. Just like a real book, it is important to watch over the safety of the Human Book. Many volunteers could be involved, as 'Matchmakers', 'Librarians', 'Matchmakers' and 'Dictionaries'. \r\nThis training promotes the Human Library  in youth organizations and to train youth workers from youth organizations to empower youngsters to organize it their local realities. There is a clear need to gain expertise to work locally with subjects such as diversity in the society.

By gaining organizing skills and developing the right attitude for organizing a public event, they will gain competences which are valued highly by employers. The central themes of the Human Library are active citizenship, intercultural dialogue, social inclusion and solidarity. The training will improve the quality of youth workers in those areas. \r\nThe training will offer a space for 27 participants, guided by 2 senior trainers, 1 junior trainer and two persons will be responsible for logistics.
