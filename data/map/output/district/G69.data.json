However presently there are very few specialists that have been trained to analyse ancient proteins, in stark contrast to the study of ancient DNA. The growing demand of information provided by mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing will require highly specialised profiles with a multidisciplinary background in analytical chemistry, engineering, molecular biology, archaeology and art restoration.\nWithin the TEMPERA network, a team of talented young scientists from both experimental sciences and cultural heritage conservation disciplines will be created and prepared to become a group of highly qualified specialists.\nThe TEMPERA network aims at:\n(i) forming, through research-based training, the professional profiles behind tomorrow\u2019s state-of-the-art analysis of ancient proteins from cultural heritage materials,\n(ii) consolidating existing constructive interaction across disciplines to focus different expertise and backgrounds into the common aim of safeguarding and enhancing European cultural heritage,\n(iii) stimulating, through the right set of specific research-related and transferable skills, the development of\n application-oriented mind set for direct or indirect exploitation of TEMPERA R&D activities.\nAs a key TEMPERA feature, the unique contribution provided by each participating institution will be integrated in a strong partnership to achieve valuable complementary research-specific and widely transferrable professional competence.", 238604.0, 1909418.0, 6, 11, "TEMPERA", null, null, null, "h2020_205549_922874588"]]}}, "7NS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "Bannerman HIgh School", 2672.0, 1, 1, "One teacher from Bannerman High School shall attend the three week immersion course in Malaga in order to meet the GTC Scotland standard residency requirements in a foreign language in order to achieve full registration as a Spanish teacher in a secondary school.\r\n\r\nAs part of the school development plan we are expanding the teaching and learning of Spanish. In order to deliver this development goal we encouraged Mrs Kelly to complete the three year CCEd Spanish course as an additional teaching qualification at the University of Strathclyde. This course was funded by our school and Glasgow City Council. We want Mrs Kelly to teach Spanish at all levels to pupils in S1 to S6 and to encourage as many pupils as possible to achieve SQA certification in Spanish. She needs to have full GTC Registration as a Spanish teacher in a secondary school in order to teach Spanish at SQA certification level.\r\n\r\nThis course offers the opportunity for Mrs Kelly to form partnerships with colleagues and with schools in Spain. Pupils will be able  to use ICT in order to communicate with pupils in schools abroad.\r\n\r\nIt will improve Mrs Kelly's fluency in Spanish by updating her language skills. The course will also enable Mrs Kelly to develop cultural awareness of Spain and enhance her methodological expertise in the teaching of the Spanish language. Mrs Kelly will share teaching methodologies and resources with the all of the languages teachers in the MFL Department in our school and with the languages teachers in our seven feeder primary schools. The course will give Mrs Kelly an opportunity to develop her own skills and expertise in the Spanish classroom by sharing ideas and by considering how Spanish is taught in different countries in order to improve the teaching and learning experience in Bannerman High School and to find new ways of motivating our pupils to succeed.", "http://www.bannermanhigh.glasgow.sch.uk", "Bannerman HIgh School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013200_coordinator"]]}}}}
