The ITIDE project (Inclusion Training in Intellectual Disability for Educators in Europe) aims to address this  underperformance by tackling deficits in training amongst educators through making  a suite of practice leading interactive open access training materials available in six states (UK, Republic of Ireland, Spain, Turkey, Bulgaria and Austria) . The project will support progress towards the Europe 2020 targets on reducing early school leaving and improving adult qualification levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants in this project will come from higher education and specialist agencies in six states: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom: Leeds Metropolitan University (lead partner), National Association for Special Educational Needs (the leading national education charity)\r\n\r\nRepublic of Ireland: Limerick University, Profexcel (a private SME, a market leading provider of online special education needs training)\r\n\r\nSpain: Universidad Complutense de Madrid\r\n\r\nAustria:Dr Pretis SINN (a private SME dealing with research and training in the field of persons with disability, specifically with children)\r\n\r\nTurkey; Andalou University\r\n\r\nBulgaria: Marie-Curie Institute ( a non-profit, NGO providing support and services to disabled people)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe ITIDE project will develop these resources by building on an existing excellent set of materials previously developed in the UK. Following an initial review of research, practice The materials will be adapted,  translated and piloted in each partner country. Each set of materials will then be accredited by local HEIs. The materials will be built into instructionally-designed online platforms and an App will be developed to allow mobile access. User guides will be developed to help learners access and structure their learning from the materials.\r\n\r\nThe result will be a flexible, high-quality suite of open access materials which can form part of HEI portfolios, but could equally be accessed by learners of an informal basis or be used by small and medium institutions to structure their own training. The target audience for these materials will be educators in schools and other institutions whether educationally focused or not.\r\n\r\nThe three year project will conclude with the production of an evaluation and a set of policy recommendations. We expect the legacy of these open access materials to have a continuing direct and indirect effect on raising the level of vocational education in this area across Europe.", "http://www.nasen.org.uk", "LEEDS BECKETT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA200-001529_7"]]}}, "5ES": {"cordis": {"data": [[1225497600000, 1304121600000, "Strategic Pan-European Ballistics Intelligence Platform for Combating Organised Crime and Terrorism", "Forensic Pathways Limited", "The threat from organised crime and terrorism can undermine the democratic and economic basis of societies through the diversion of investment into crime, money laundering and corruption by international cartels, organised gang culture and corruption. The result is often a weakening of institutions, an undermined economy and a loss of confidence in the rule of law. This project will undertake research to create and develop secure interoperable situation awareness platform for the EU to combat organised crime and terrorism. The project will use technical (non-personal) ballistics data and crime information initially but will also demonstrate how migration to other data sources can take place. The project will automatically combine data from disparate high volume data repositories for cross correlation and automated (and semi-automated) analysis with data from different cultural/domains with multiple reference models using real-time data feeds and historical databases. Intelligence will be extracted using advanced semantic knowledge extraction and data-mining to facilitate appropriate, fast and responsible decision making and alerts. The platform will develop and demonstrate a trust management and security system, controlled access and an automated reporting tool for cost effective operations as well as providing the policing of existing information systems. The platform will enhance mutual co-operation, security and sustainability across the EU and is supported by EUROPOL, the police and other end users as a being urgently required.

Building on the complementary expertise of the participants, the consortium aims to pursue two major lines of investigations: Device fingerprint based forensics and hidden data based forensics. The first line of investigation requires the formulation of a set of \u201cfingerprint\u201d left in the images/video by the hardware components or in-built signal processing algorithms of the imaging device and involves the study of its forensic applications. The applications we are aiming for include device identification, technology/licensing infringement detection, device linking, automatic media classification, tampering detection. To guarantee the value of the these techniques, anti-anti-forensics measures will also be devised to detect/prevent removal or substitution of the fingerprint set. The second line of investigation is about the use and analysis of hidden data in the host image/video for authentication, content integrity verification, copyright protection (including ownership identification, proof of ownership, copy control, traitor tracing), and the use and detection of covert communications. Although data hiding is a relatively mature research area, their applicability in the real world is yet to be fully explored due to the fact that the security issues are often interleaved with multimedia processing issues and requires addressing. Therefore this line of research requires the formulation of specific security requirements and attack modelling for specific applications. Overall, both lines of research require a wide variety of expertise such as multimedia signal processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, and optimisation theory. Therefore it is expected that this project will also take the soundness and applicability of these theories to a new level and lay a solid foundation for wider lasting collaborations in the related areas.", 310638.0, 1313102.0, 3, 4, "DIVEFOR", null, "http://www.forensic-pathways.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159356.jpg", "fp7_95060_998897174"]]}}, "5HH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1609372800000, "Metallisation of Textiles to make Urban living for Older people more Independent  Fashionable", "Printed Electronics Limited", "Urban areas are seeing an increasing population of older people and existing approaches to care for them are becoming unsustainable creating a European wide societal challenge. Assistive technology can provide them with security that will enable them to live independently e.g. wearing alarms and tracking devices around the arm or neck to alert carers to falls or their location if they wander. However such technology is often unsightly and stigmatises the user resulting in high abandonment rates.\nThe MATUROLIFE project will integrate creative artists and fashion designers into the research team to facilitate design-driven innovation. The project will build on existing technological advances in materials which have produced a highly innovative selective metallisation process that utilises nanotechnology, electrochemistry and materials science to encapsulate fibres in textiles with metal and thereby provide conductivity and electronic connectivity. In this way, better integration of electronics and sensors into fabrics and textiles will be possible. This will give the fashion designers and artists the tools to produce AT for older people that is not only functional but is more desirable and appealing as well as being lighter and more comfortable.\nBuilding on exiting best practice the consortium will include societal stakeholder groups representing end users (i.e. older people) who will be heavily involved in the design process as well as giving feedback and direction on the development of AT prototypes contributing significantly to end-user acceptance. The prototypes will demonstrate proof of concept and the industrial scalability of the selective metallisation process will be validated.
