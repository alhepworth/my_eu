We noticed that Europe citizens are very frustrated because of current changes and new wave of discrimination, hate and anger is starting in the continent again. Huge number of racist crimes in Europe has risen as well, especially hate crimes against Muslims following Paris attacks. UK exprience clash between natives and immigrants and regional division after the BREXIT. There is an urgent need to reduce social tensions, to raise the level of tolerance, to promote the understanding and accepting each other despite the cultural and religious differences.\r\n\r\nOur aim is with the help of sports (hiking, running and mountain hiking), as development tool, to foster solidarity and social inclusion.\r\n\r\nOne very important question might arise: how sport is related to the inclusion? We believe that sports (we will use various sports and outdoor education methods, but hiking, running and mountain hiking as the core) through its universality, can transcend cultural, socio-economic and political barriers, which is very important in a international context. Sports are extremely powerful tools for development, especially within international communities. Moreover, sport reflects on different values and can create a bridge between different social groups forming better mutual understanding. The answer could be reaffirmed by quoting United Nations, which \u201crecognize that sport, as a tool for education, development and peace, can promote cooperation, solidarity, tolerance, understanding, social inclusion and health at the local, national and international levels\u201d. We will start all days with morning sports, most of non-formal education methods will be done in outdoors and we will do hiking (sometimes over the night), running and mountain hiking.\r\n\r\nAnother question could be: why hiking, running and mountain hiking and why Wales, Northen Ireland and Scotland?\r\nFirst of all, hiking is a big individual and group challenge, when instincts of self-preservation disappears. It becomes easier to analyze sensitive topics, people do not hide under the masks, therefore, better results could be reached. Youth also learn faster in such environment. Running is inspired from a book \u201eBorn To Run: A Hidden Tribe, the Ultra-Runners, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen\u201d, written by Christopher McDougall, where author analyses human roots and essential capacity to run long distances. Lastly, mountain hiking is a kind of outdoor meditation that youth need to discover as soon as possible, so that it could later serve as a medium/method to restore the balance after urban challenges.\r\n\r\nSecond, we do directly relate it with current situation whereas a lot of refugees had to walk or run over mountains, cross the sea and borders to reach peace in Europe. We will do similar thing in order to step in their shoes (and thus comes the name of the YE) for a while. We believe that this correlation will help us to reach even better results and will help to start thinking about the current situation.\r\n\r\nThird, the concept \u201eStep In Their Shoes\u201d attempts to search connecting points from (1) a regional perspective, thus implementing three youth exchanges in different UK regions, (2) value perspective - we will combine sports and hiking with special methods, where we will analyse own behaviour and important values particularly related to our topic: \r\nKnowledge\r\nInvolvement\r\nNature\r\nGrowth\r\n\r\nWe are combining every days active lifestyle with non- formal education methods in youth work. The specific objectives of this project:\r\n(1) To reach personal development which helps to understand ourselves and reflect on own behavior and behavior of others;\r\n(2) Challenge the perception of the structures within our society that undermine social inclusion or foster discrimination;\r\n(3) Overcoming the stereotypes of different religions;\r\n(4) To raise awareness on the topic of discrimination;\r\n(5) To build a broader understanding of what an inclusive attitude means and to start inter cultural and inter- religious dialogue;\r\n(6) To understand the connections between culture and sport and to understand the inter cultural aspects of sport;\r\n(7) To raise the sense of empathy towards other people.\r\n\r\nProject consists of 1 APV and 3 youth exchanges to be held in Wales (13-22 March 2018), Northern Ireland (24 April \u2013 3 May 2018) and Scotland (31 July \u2013 9 August).

The coordinator of the project Subtiluship CIC is a non profit social enterprise with background in outdoors, media, social entrepreneurship, sustainable development, healthy lifestyles and personal development.\r\n\r\nIt is a project that unites a total of 96 participants from 6 European countries: UK, Romania, Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Croatia in 3 youth exchanges across 2018, all taking place in London, UK. The theme \u201cHow to live healthy, active and fresh\u201d comprises of 3 main topics: healthy food, active outdoor physical activity and self-leadership. Each exchange focus on one of these topics, reshaping approaches and behaviors of young people and subsequently improving their inner ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe methods used are practical and hands-on, with direct inputs and outputs from participants themselves - starting each morning with physical activities, having each meal health-oriented and working on personal development on a daily basis. This approach is designed to give a momentum to the lives of young people, leading to sustainable incremental changes. We believe the healthier the life is, the more productive and fruitful results can be, enriching employability & entrepreneurship potential and performance.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of the three phases in one location and 2 months phase after each exchange in 6 different countries:\r\n#HealthyHabits #1 \u20137 days - 8-16 May 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #2  \u2013 7 days - 19-27 June 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #3 \u2013 7 days \u2013 21-29 August 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #Follow-up of 2 month after each exchange \r\n\r\nThe follow up is an integration phase of 2 months after each exchange, in which participants take charge of their own lives and implement personal healthy campaigns, with online posts that eventually results in awareness among friend network.\r\n\r\nWe expect:\r\n- 20-40% increase in knowledge about healthy food, diets, preparing food;\r\n- 30-40% more active youth on the fields of outdoor and sports;\r\n- 96 participants with a plan - vision, objectives, values on what they want to change in their lifes;\r\n- 20-40% rate of implementation of the integration plan;\r\n- 10-12 NGOs where participants can implement their follow-up;\r\n- over 800/participant reach on Facebook after the healthy campaign;\r\n- over 12 tools contributed by participants to the workbook of healthy lifestyle.", "http://abroadship.org", "Subtiluship C.I.C.", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046395_coordinator"], [2016, "Media Creator", "Subtiluship C.I.C.", 47896.0, 7, 7, "The project \"Media Creator\" has it basis on the on-going raise and importance of self branding and digital skills in the modern society, while the youth unemployment is at rising stakes. The project efficiently combines the two aspects in learning self-branding exchanges, while developing practical skills that employers or entrepreneurial paths are looking after, through involving youth directly as media creators. Youth represent a quarter of the world\u2019s workforce, but on the other hand they also represent half of the unemployed population all over the world. Therefore, a special focus should be placed on overcoming the difficulties youth face when entering the labour market and the issues they encounter when trying to remain there. \r\n\r\nOur objective is to bring 105 young people representing 7 countries: UK, Lithuania, Italy, Romania, Greece, Poland and Czech Republic in 3 different, but connected themed exchanges. The participants are young people between 16 to 30 years old, interested in learning about media, branding and accessing digital tools for learning, in order to get employed.  Another objective is to create a online platform with shared knowledge about self-branding and ICT tools, that can support any English speaking youth to connect and replicate products and ideas in order to promote themselves and their qualities easier, faster and with more impact.\r\n\r\nMethodology used is a combined form of \"learning by experience\" - as a form of learning from experiencing different activities and putting it into practice in the daily life and routine, \"learning to play, playing to learn\" connected with learning from games, from actions and playful environment and \"media practices\" a method we developed in having youth as media creators.\r\n\r\nThrough the 3 exchanges focused on: Social Media & Branding , Design & Creativity and Photo & Video, 2 of 8 days and 1 of 9 days we bring the participants in an intercultural context in London, UK to increase their competences and abilities in the practical creational side, the self-branding side, but also through leadership, communication and intercultural activities that will give 60-80% increase in their digital/ICT competences and 50-80% increase in possibility of getting employed in the next 12 months. Moreover the impact and results replicate also in the partner countries, where the participants are going to follow up their exchanges with the creation of their own self branding campaign, that could be a start of an entrepreneurial career in digital/ICT world or an attraction for possible employers.\r\n\r\nThe sustainable part of the project is through the development of an online platform for gathering shared knowledge for self-branding for employment, that can be used by any youth at any time - containing tools for self-branding, by any NGO - containing program activities and methods, by any community in order to replicate in their own language, or by any employer to look for young, productive and creative people.", "http://abroadship.org", "Subtiluship C.I.C.", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035210_coordinator"], [2016, "Think Like Nature", "Subtiluship C.I.C.", 47477.0, 8, 8, "The ultimate goal of this project is to equip and inspire youth workers and youth leaders, educators, partners and other involved parties (for instance, communities) with a set of innovative methods and tools as part of the \u201cThink Like Nature\u201d framework, so that they could develop competences, enhance their work with target groups and further spread the non-formal methods. We want to deconstruct, reconstruct and test with the participants the framework, which is based on non-formal nature- and community- inclusive methods.\r\n\r\nThink Like Nature is an intergenerational project, with the scope to create a framework that would capture/involve/educate a person of all ages: from a three years old child to a pensioner. Consequently, this project would offer three training courses, which would address three generational shifts in life, at the same time connecting the individual path through nature:\r\n(1) \u201cEmotional Intelligence with Forest School\u201d training course in Wales, UK is aimed to develop emotional intelligence in a non-formal setting, using the forest school methodology. Youth workers should experience themselves and transfer the learned outcomes for 3-18 year old children/pupils/students.\r\n(2) \u201cSustainability with Permaculture\u201d training course in Aurora Circle community, in the county of Hunedoara, Romania is aimed to develop competences through applied permaculture ethics and principles and other sustainable practices. Youth workers are supposed to be immersed in the permaculture philosophy, learn, apply the methods themselves and then transfer them to their target group, which we see are mostly students and adults.\r\n(3) \u201cLifestyle with Alternative Sustainable Communities\u201d training course in Barcelona, Spain is designed to experience and learn from the existing alternative sustainable communities in Spain in order for youth workers and youth leaders to create and run local community projects. The ultimate target group of this training are all ages, especially mature persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is unique for its hands-on, experiential, clearly defined elements \u2013 adopting existing and successful methodologies (\u201cforest school\u201d and \u201cpermaculture\u201d) with certified experts (Martin, Morgan and Ionut). The project is multinational, taking place in three distant places: Wales, United Kingdom in May 2017, Romania in August 2017 and concluding in Spain in September 2017. The project is designed and delivered by an international team of trainers with extensive experience in non-formal education, intercultural team work, leadership development for young people and experiential learning. All three countries have local representatives, who are capable of arranging logistics in the best manner. The project is authentic to connect and build innovative methodologies and practices into one framework that has potential to become an officially accepted path to person\u2019s off-curriculum development.\r\n\r\nThink Like Nature project is a long-term approach to education for children, young people, families and adults, maximising the benefits of learning with the help of nature. Whilst its roots are planted firmly in the theory of how children learn, Think Like Nature puts the learner at the heart of their learning experience. From this fundamental platform, we want to offer children and young people the opportunity, over repeated visits, to engage with the rich natural diversity of the woodland environment to help build confidence, sensitivity, resilience and curiosity. We believe in the holistic learning process that aims to raise self-awareness and self-esteem in participants. As a result, regular sessions take place in a woodland environment, where the landscape itself adds to the experience of learning. An outdoor element offers leadership and team problem solving challenges that allow to practice new behaviors in a supportive collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nThink Like Nature framework has a measurable effect. A research* of 24 children from 7 different Forest Schools in UK over 8 months period shows improvements in the children\u2019s confidence, motivation and concentration, language, communication and physical skills.

For a searching mind the whole World Cultural Heritage is open to be explored and exploited, but this outstanding opportunity sometimes is causing more confusion than clarity in minds and hearts of the people.Intercultural challenges appear on individual and organizational level. It is evident that societies face the extensive internationalization of businesses.There is a lot of work done on developing intercultural communication skills of the people, there are several legislative and program frameworks which are aimed at raising the efficiency of integration and communication processes, but in reality it is clear that it is not enough. Youth was, is and will be always on the frontiers of all the processes. On one hand it is one of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable parts of the society (which is especially relevant for several aging societies), but on the other hand due to its natural flexibility, youth energy and huge potential can be also one of the major forces for transforming the potential Clashes to fruitful Dialogues.This Training Course is aimed at developing efficient strategies and methodological approaches to address the aforementioned issues through our day to day work within our communities.
