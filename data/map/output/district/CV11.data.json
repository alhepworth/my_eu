The project aims at developing a set of computer tools to assist a podiatrist in achieving the best therapeutic prescription for a patient. SMARTPIF will provide them with a tool to obtain a prediction of pressures to be exerted in whatever point of the foot during a gait cycle by means of a particular shoe-insole combination and a specific set of materials. Moreover, the patient will be able to virtually try-on the selected shoes (not yet manufactured/not available at the podiatric clinic). The system will produce technological products and devices to be commercialized and the full integration system: 4D scanning device to digitise the patient's foot in dynamic conditions; software to predict foot pressures and visualise in 3D (over patient's digitised foot); insole design software and a virtual mirror for visualization of selected shoes, superimposed onto the real image of the patient. 4 RTDs will lead the RTD activities, under the perspective of the (user and/or market) needs and application possibilities of 5 SMEs that connect the project with the market. They bring together expertise in all required areas: biomechanics, clinical health care treatment, footwear and insoles design and customisation, software development, 3D imaging and scanning neural networks. The challenge will be to provide podiatrists with tools that will allow them to create a footwear-insole prescription suitable for the specific pathology of patients, in a user-friendly environment, without requiring complex technical operations. The podiatric sector will be the focus. Lack of awareness by podiatrists regarding footwear-insole needs of their patients and poor availability of tools to assist them create a significant barrier for SMEs trying to access these markets.", 172632.0, 1022484.0, 4, 9, "SMARTPIF", "http://www.smartpif.eu/", "http://www.salfordinsole.co.uk", null, "fp7_108385_971430460"]]}}, "5HX": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYG", "Pembleton Unit", "nhs_RYG12"]]}}, "5TS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1506816000000, 1601424000000, "Laser surface engineering for new and enhanced functional performance with digitally enabled knowledge base", "Ats Applied Tech Systems Ltd", "SHARK will unlock the potential for laser texturing for the generation of functional surfaces by boosting the productivity, efficiency and flexibility of the process. This will provide the European industry with a highly robust, cost effective and environmentally friendly system that is capable of producing a broad range of functional surfaces at industrial scale throughputs, and place Europe in an unassailable lead in this key area of manufacturing.\nSHARK will advance laser surface texturing from the current \u2018trial and error\u2019, lab-scale concept into a highly predictable, data driven industrial approach by developing a digitally enabled knowledge management platform with a comprehensive database of process parameters and functionalities. SHARK system will be configured as an Open-platform independent of the laser source manufacturers, which for long, has been one of the main limitations for the process. SHARK\u2019s system will be underpinned by a number of technology advances. Two laser surface texturing technologies will be developed, both based upon nanosecond fibre lasers. Pseudo Random laser texturing and Direct Laser Interference Patterning will be employed, offering complementary techniques to yield a highly flexible tool capable of delivering wide range of functional surfaces with exceptional productivity and excellent process efficiency. The project will develop surface texture predictive modelling to rapidly define key process variables required for specific surface functionalities. This will be combined with inline surface characterisation to enable rapid feedback and inbuilt quality assurance.\n    \nThe project will deliver the following benefits:\n    \n\u2022 The capability to deliver surface functionalities into real products for less than 10% of the cost of the conventional part.\n\u2022 Greater than 20% improvement in product performance based on the surface functionalities deployed.\n\u2022 Accelerated product development.\n\u2022 Strengthened global position of European manufacturing.", 392710.0, 3871736.0, 7, 11, "SHARK", null, null, null, "h2020_211331_923844782"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "ATS APPLIED TECH SYSTEMS LTD", 392315.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_9328"]]}}, "5TW": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "PAINTING AND DECORATING ASSOCIATION", 25289.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_35434"]]}}, "6QL": {"nhs": {"data": [["RJC", "Bramcote Hospital", "nhs_RJC56"]]}}}}
