Geomaterial waste represents half of the waste volume generated in EU-27. These waste geomaterials generally exhibit poor engineering characteristics that prevent their direct reuse on construction/mining sites. However, if adequately treated, they could represent an excellent resource for construction purposes with significant money saving and reduction in the environmental footprint, thus contributing to the establishment of a circular economy. To achieve this, GeoRes will develop protocols, software and tools to improve the engineering characteristics of waste geomaterials, and to guarantee the level of performance over the service life of geostructures built from waste geomaterials considering site-specific conditions. The fundamental concern of the research in the GeoRes network is thus to develop strategies and tools for sustainable reuse of waste geomaterials generated by geoengineering activities, and to determine how to turn a waste geomaterial into a valued durable material, with a positive revenue stream. The proposed network is at the interface of two domains of engineering; geotechnical and geoenvironmental.

However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology.

It is necessary they become aware of the importance of lifelong learning and training as Europe offers excellent opportunities for international cooperation, networking and exchange of expertise. Student mobility experience has so far - according to our long-term experience - immensely contributed to their strengthened self-confidence, improved self-worth as well as their linguistic and digital competences. In majority we are developing entrepreneurial skills and competences but as we also carry out other educational programmes within our respective schools, the students of the latter have also been involved in the project. \r\nThe project is of utmost importance for all partner schools of the Consortium as mobility activities raise our international profile and attract a greater number of students who want to enrol in our schools. At the same time it provides invaluable new experiences for all of us, including accompanying persons.

These skills are increasingly seen as being among the top skills required to succeed in an every changing job market (WEF 2016).  It is the focus on developing EI skills in particular, which sets this training experience apart from other programmes. Our host partners already deliver innovative training activities for young people in this area and have built up a strong expertise in innovative practices. Being shaped by their unique approaches, this programme therefore responds to the need to radically transform and modernise educational approaches that equip young people with relevant skills in entrepreneurship (see BCC2014, CB2014). \r\n\r\nThe vocational startup training programme developed by Corkscrew, IEP and UP! will engage learners and staff in a practical learning journey, developing the creative skills to spot business opportunities and identify the feasibility of an idea.  The process of lean startup will be introduced, and how to take an idea to market (website creation, social media marketing and testing). All training is conducted in a real working environment, in a live context, and directly related to the course curriculum, allowing the transfer of credits onto specific modules through the ECVET framework.  Coursework and vocational training will be enhanced and extended by the online resource developed by Corkscrew (2017), which provides access to resources, ideas and an international community of innovative thinkers throughout and beyond the duration of the programme for all stakeholders involved.\r\nThe work experience element of the programme, conducted at the cowork spaces in Barcelona and Dublin, enables learners to work on business projects for residents of the space, while UK staff shadow entrepreneurs in their daily working life.

Although this is only the second application by IEPC, its members have vast experience in mobility projects and combined sent over a thousand students abroad in the past 5 years through European funded mobility programmes.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project is to effect change in the attitudes and behaviours of participants. Due to the relatively short timeframe of the project, a focus on changing behaviours is key. Workplace experience is essential and the longer the experience the more beneficial for the participant; a fact that is created by our job market and the global economy. However a longer work placement period is not suitable for our participants. What we can achieve in a shorter space of time is a change to attitudes and behaviours that can have a ripple effect and create greater lasting change in a student's career and personal life and in turn, what they can contribute to those around them locally and in time at a national and potentially at an international level. Both activities in Exeter and Barcelona aim to develop entrepreneurial attitudes such as creativity, confidence and leadership.\r\n\r\nLearners will work in groups on a project for their host company and be given a brief of the project. Projects can vary from company to company but a lot will be based around research, content creation and delivery of reports. The reports tackle business areas such as marketing, social media analysis, website analysis, improvement and creation of content and strategy, competitor analysis, customer analysis and other topics that relate to each business. In order to increase the entrepreneurial acumen of the learners, the host company and project partner will continuously reiterate the value these Startup companies have for the entrepreneur, employees and their impact locally and nationally. They will be encouraged to think of their own business ideas and access their own creativity.\r\n\r\nIn the second week of the programme, the students will be finishing their research and analysis for their host company and completing their project. From everything they have learned working for their host company, the student will then be tasked with presenting their own business idea on the last day of the programme. This final day will be a culmination of all they have learned in their host companies and the added training. It is the perfect way to display the objectives of the project by a student showing creativity in coming up with a new business idea, displaying leadership by leading, improving others or being part of a team idea and finally displaying confidence in presenting that idea in front of a group of people.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project and it's planned activities abroad we hope will show a clear change in the student's attitude and behaviours both during and after the main activities.

We will see more creative participants with the ability to spot opportunities, come up with ideas and be able to reflect and examine those ideas to determine their value and viability. This is a cornerstone of entrepreneurship but is just as valuable to potential employers to have an employee who shows entrepreneurial traits within their organisation, an intrapreneur. Further down their professional careers we see this as being a valuable trait to possess and one that will help advance their careers.\r\n\r\nFor IEPC members, we can show our students in workplaces in Europe and working with some of the most dynamic Startups in each destination country which will have an impact on how our college is viewed locally nationally and internationally.

This innovative 2 week mobility in Dublin and Barcelona aims to address this issue by blending practical training in the field of startup with relevant work placements with local startup organisations.The Training in Entrepreneurship and Corkscrew Thinking (TECT) mobility will take 14 learners enrolled on BTEC business and Enterprise Courses and 2 Enterprise staff from each of Homewood School, York College, Huddersfield New College, Wigan & Leigh College and North West College and place them in two of the most entrepreneurial cities in Europe (Barcelona or Dublin) and immerse them in the world of startups at respective cowork spaces Makers of Barcelona (MOB) or the Guinness Enterprise Centre (GEC). Over the duration of the mobility they will develop the 3 main pillars of their entrepreneurial mindsets; creative problem solving, initiative and confidence in leadership, as well as more specific technical skills in business startup including social media marketing, branding, finance and project management.The vocational startup training is based on a programme developed by Corkscrew, IEP and MOB to introduce the key aspects of entrepreneurship to learners and staff in a practical learning journey. Learners and Staff will develop creative skills to spot business opportunities and how to identify the feasibility of an idea. The final part of the training will train individuals in the process of lean startup and how to take an idea to market (training in website creation, social media marketing and testing). All training is conducted in a real working environment (cowork spaces MOB & GEC) and put in a live context, not a classroom. The training is directly related to their course curriculum in the UK and through the ECVET framework will allow the transfer of credits onto specific modules.The work experience element of the programme will also be conducted at the cowork spaces in Barcelona and Dublin as the Learners work on business projects for residents of the space and staff shadow entrepreneurs in their daily working life. The projects will have a direct implication to the host organisations providing a tangible work project for the learners to develop confidence and experience in a working startup environment, and ultimately making them more employable on their return to the UK.Another key stakeholder to highlight is that of the accompanying staff from the four sending organisations within the consortium. It is these key staff that will assess, evaluate and ultimately implement the learnings of the mobility to have the targeted impact of introducing more entrepreneurial activity within education.  Staff will work closely with all stakeholders of the mobility from consortium members, receiving partners and learners in validating the entire lifetime of the project and how best to influence curriculum, not only within the selected BTEC Business and Enterprise courses, but the institutions as a whole. The staff will be instrumental in assisting future mobilities and enhancing entrepreneurship in education, again in line with UK and EU proposals.It is important that the TECT Mobility is successful for a second year, therefore, the consortium has spent time and effort in developing a clear methodology to carry out the project from understanding all stakeholders needs and impacts and also a project life-cycle appraisal from preparation to completion (including recruitment, learner agreements, delivery, assessment, evaluation and dissemination). It has also been important to ensure clear MoUs with all relevant parties to ensure clear guidelines during the implementation of the mobility.From our first KA1 mobility in 2015 we have seen results that have exceeded our expectations in the level of impact on the learners professional and personal development and on the staffs potential in delivering higher value course structure in the UK with EU dimensions. We also feel the impact has been felt at institutional level as we gain interest in future EU mobility partnerships and opportunities.

The UK consortium is made up of 4 sending organisations, including Homewood School, York College, Huddersfield New College and Wigan & Leigh College (all of whom have begun movements to create more vocational and enterprising opportunities for learners and staff) and Corkscrew StartUp School, the lead applicant and VET organisation focusing on developing entrepreneurship within education. The consortium and receiving partners in Ireland (IEP & GEC) will use the EU mobility as a way to develop standards and practices that can be used for future partnerships. The mobility will increase the European dimensions of the consortium and will allow further submissions in following years to increase the opportunities for learners across multiple disciplines.\r\n\r\nWhilst the consortium members and partners have clear objectives on an institutional basis, the main focus of the mobility is on the selected learners and how the unique experience will allow them to develop critical core competencies in their professional and personal development, ultimately leading to them becoming more entrepreneurial & employable. The vocational training is focused on key practices in the creation, launch and operations of a startup business including relevant technical skills such as business development, marketing, web creation and lean startup methodology. The training is directly related to their course curriculum in the UK and, through the ECVET framework, will allow the transfer of credits onto specific modules. In respect of the real time work experience (from the startup business located at the GEC cowork space) the learners will get first hand work experience within true startups that will boost relevant tech skills and other core competencies for increased employability options and entrepreneurial understanding. By working in Dublin (one of the top startup cities in the world and the best in Europe) they will get an unrivaled experience to further develop startup understanding and qualities through tangible new enterprise experiences.\r\n\r\nThe third key stakeholder to highlight is that of the accompanying staff from the three sending organisations within the consortium.

The five students of office management would do two-week work placements. \r\nThe project topic includes both health promotion at the workplace regarding the project participants, and health promotion regarding their clientele (e.g. children, people with the need of specialized care). Health promotion is integral part of main subjects in each of these courses\u2018 curricula. The stays abroad will be prepared and reflected upon in several learning arrangements and/or educational science classes. Furthermore, our co-operations with Vuxenutbildning in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, and City of Glasgow College, Scotland, are bi-directional. In September 2018 and 2019, we expect three Swedish students at our school, doing a three-week work placement at a local hospital. This type of peer-to-peer support is also to be installed with the office management clerk students this time. \r\nWe expect that the work placements abroad prepare our students better for their professional future, e.g. by providing a broader perspective on relevance and possibilities of mental health promotion for young children and people with special needs. Furthermore, we hope for impulses on the level of our own school development. Our school\u2019s work groups for health and Europe have already composed an action plan for health promotion among students. One of the expected results is that project participants get to know communication structures and methods that may be useful for improving student feedback at our school. \r\nWe hope that connecting these two aspects of our school\u2019s program, namely health and Europe, through this Erasmus+ project will prove to create more positive effects. In the long run, we aim to have as many main points of our school\u2019s program as possible to mutually support each other.

The Vocational College Castrop-Rauxel (\u201eBerufskolleg Castrop-Rauxel\u201c, abbreviated BKCR), Germany, is the institution applying for this KA1 Erasmus+ project. Both the organizing and managing of the project are to be BKCR\u2019s responsibility. The BKCR is an upper secondary school with courses leading up to the university entrance qualification (\u201eAbitur\u201c) with a vocational focus.The European project the BKCR is applying for is the continuation of several previous Leonardo da Vinci projects and especially the previous Erasmus+ project. The new project addresses and elaborates on the topic of the 2014 project (participation) with a new focus being on inclusion and \"the right to take part in society.\" The project activities are to be expanded to all three main departments of the BKCR (i.e. education/social pedagogy, health, and business/administration).      Goal: The BKCR is dedicated to achieving integration through education. This is embodied by this Erasmus+ project \"The Right to Take Part in Society\" on a school level. Every BKCR student should be enabled to actively take part in their educational processes, i.e. teachers and students together determine the content and design of their learning processes.In 2015, the BKCR was awarded the title \u201eEuropaschule\u201c by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, acknowledging our various international endeavours over the past decades. We believe that the main objective of our school \u2013 enabling personal and professional self-sufficiency intertwined with ethical responsibility \u2013 can only be achieved with an international perspective. For the first time, this mobility project would give students from all three of our departments the opportunity to do an internship abroad. This time abroad would enable us to prepare our students even better for their professional lives. The internships for the remedial/therapeutic educators in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, would provide a hands-on comparison of the basic principles of remedial/therapeutic work in Sweden and Germany. This would enable our students to have a significantly broader perspective on the German system of inclusion. The elementary principles of facilitating education in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are \u2013 together with curricula and regulations \u2013 the central point of reference for educators and child carers in training. The concept of early childhood education has the goal of \"taking part in society\" (participation). The state of NRW recognizes that the foundations for societal participation are laid in the area of elementary and primary education. Other EU countries pursue this goal using different approaches.The above-mentioned fundamentals are valid for the field of business/administration as well. In the competence-oriented guidelines for the subject \"business administration\", for example, this is put into action through the topic \"human resources.\" In this project, office management students research possibilities for participation within a company. While in Glasgow, the students would analyze how the different national regulations they researched in class are put into practice. We expect the students in this project to significantly expand their competences regarding their discernment of job migration options and their ability to deal with diversity in the workplace.  The number of students taking part in this project would be 34. They are studying to be state-certified child carers/educators (including A levels), remedial/therapeutic educators, or office management clerks. All of these students will do the internships in their last year of training. The project topic, participation and inclusion for people with and without special needs (both in and outside of professional life), is an element within the main subjects in all three courses. Going abroad is prepared in class and also through numerous other activities. A Swedish language class is obligatory for all students doing their internships in Sweden, regardless of their course. This provides an interdisciplinary platform for this European project. Other examples are intercultural activities students prepare for other students at the \u201eEurope day\u201c celebrated at our school.Our co-operation agreements with Borl\u00e4nge and Glasgow are bi-directional.

It is situated in the north-eastern part of the Ruhr metropolitan area, next to Dortmund. Currently, about 2,500 students are attending the college, which offers full-time courses, part-time courses (part of vocational training on the job), and evening classes.\r\nThis project has multi-level objectives. On the institutional level, this mobility project is one element of our international activities which are supposed lead to the BKCR being a certified \u201cEuropaschule\u201d. One objective of our school is to enable students to be responsible and independent individuals. Work placements in other EU countries are a pillar of this endeavor and cannot be substituted by anything else. \r\nBelow the institutional level, there is the training of educators and child care workers. This mobility project enables our students to prepare for their future jobs in an even better way by seeing how other countries approach their field of work and what their concepts mean in theory and practice. The principles of the Bildungsf\u00f6rderung in North Rhine Westphalia are \u2013 together with curriculums and guidelines \u2013 the central point of reference for educator trainees. The concept of early childhood education aims at \u201cpartaking in society\u201d which the Land NRW intends to implement in the elementary and primary sectors of education, following other EU countries that have already made substantial progress in this endeavor.\r\nThis project is designed to give 16 of our BKCR students the opportunity to do this.

The first eight students are scheduled to depart for England, Poland and Sweden on October 11, 2014. The second group should begin in the middle of their autumn break 2015. \r\nThe project\u2019s topic, participation and promoting autonomy of pre-school children, is dealt with in the core subjects of the educator trainee course. Aside from preparing it within the subjects \u201ceducational science\u201d and \u201cdidactics/methodology\u201d, the stays abroad are prepared by numerous workshops and classes \u2013 for example language classes (Swedish and Polish) and intercultural training. \r\nDuring their work placements abroad, our students will observe how participation and promoting autonomy is achieved at their pre-school institutions. The students will document their observations and discuss them with their respective pre-school institution\u2019s advisor.\r\nAfter returning to the BKCR, the project\u2019s participants will enrich the subjects \u201ceducational science\u201d and \u201cdidactics/methodology\u201d by presenting their newly-acquired knowledge to other students. Their whole classes will analyze and assess the various methods for promoting autonomy of pre-school children. The students of the past years have proven to be highly motivated and qualified to initiate and implement alternative innovative concepts in the child care institutions they worked at after completing their training. \r\nThis embodies an important positive and lasting impulse for these institutions.
