A large, unmet, and growing patient population will require treatment for Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and revenue in this market will continue to grow driven by the aging population and the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most widely used non-surgical treatment, however when used in areas of long calcified stenosis, PTA does not show satisfactory results at long term follow up. Stenting has become the most obvious choice to overcome the limitations of PTA. Unfortunately, long term performance of stents appears to be problematic as they do not prevent (and may to a certain extent even cause) a failure mode known as restenosis. Whilst covered stents have tackled the problem of restenosis within the stent the stent itself interrupts the bloods natural spiral laminar flow (SLF) and increases laterally directed forces and wall shear stress downstream of the implantation causing downstream disease progression. Re-institution of the bloods SLF reduces the forces and turbulence caused by stenting, and reduces neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) distal to the stent which can lead to occlusion distal to the stent.\n\nThe global objective of the project is to develop an innovative endovascular stent that will reintroduce the natural spiral laminar flow both through the stent and distal to the stent that can be manufactured to be deployed using standard delivery system profiles.

One member is an experienced teacher of nine years who has promoted and exclusively taught modern languages within the school.  One member is a middle stage teacher with four years experience and is enthusiastic to develop the 1+2 programme within her classroom. One member is an infant teacher who has nine years teaching experience who is confident but would like to continue building upon her relative knowledge of French. \r\n  \r\nDescription of activities\r\nIt is the aim for participants to share their new experiences of a range of classroom based practical activities with all Ancrum Road teaching staff, surrounding topics including: The French alphabet, French pronunciation, getting to know each other, giving personal information, asking/answering questions, giving information about others, vocabulary for physical description, incl. parts of the body, colours, verbs in the present tense, introduction to past tenses and practice, numeracy in French, the French calendar and festivals, use of songs in FL teaching, giving/understanding instructions, increasing fluency in French, exchanging ideas for activities, examples of good practice / professional dialogue, group work and use of ICT in FL teaching.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe initial stage for participants will include course preparation and forming a staff based support network, participating in the immersion course, completing a logbook, collaborating with other participants, asking questions, professional dialogue and thinking about implementation, reflection and establishing next steps. On return to the school, the dissemination of learning with the staff will include sharing learning collegiately with staff, applying learned experiences within the classroom, participating in observing good practice, establishing working group with responsibility for updating School improvement plan, creating and managing physical and electronic resources. The next stage for implementation with pupils will take the form of events and activities such as; classroom based learning activities, whole school assemblies, peer educating, school French cafe, French signage around the school, French Fridays, e-Twinning and ICT based learning.  The follow up course will allow the participants to share and extend on and develop a sustainable change in our French teaching practice.

An important observation is that aphids spend a considerable time on nonhost species, where they probe the leaf tissue and secrete saliva, but for unknown reasons are unable to ingest phloem sap. This suggest that aphids, like plant pathogens, interact with nonhost plants at the molecular level, but potentially are not successful in suppressing plant defenses and/or releasing nutrients. To date, however, the plant cellular changes and the involvement of immune response, such as ETI and PTI, in aphid-host and -nonhost interactions remain elusive. The aim of the proposed project is to gain insight into the level of cellular host reprogramming that takes place during aphid-host interactions, the cellular processes involved in aphid nonhost resistance, and the role of aphid effectors in determining host range. We will compare interactions of two economically important aphid species, Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) and Rhopalosiphum padi (bird cherry oat aphid), with host and nonhost plants.

Thus, the use of Microbe-induced Resistance (MiR) to reduce pest losses in agriculture has emerged as a highly promising possibility to improve crop resilience and reduce use of harmful pesticides. European companies have therefore started to develop and market beneficial microbes. However, MiR appears to be strongly context-dependent, with reduced benefits under certain biotic and abiotic conditions and in some crop varieties. Further, it is a challenge to deliver and ensure stable associations of beneficial microbes and plants, and avoid undesired effects on beneficial insects. Thus we absolutely must improve our understanding of MiR mechanisms and  context-dependency, in order to improve context stability of MiR and promote the use of MiR for crop protection. Our MiRA project will train 15 ESRs in basic and applied research on context-dependency of MiR, mechanisms, and impacts on plant performance and other biocontrol organisms. We will use this understanding to improve our ability to predict the effectiveness of MiR under different conditions, to select plant and microbial strains with improved context-stability, and to develop better methods for the formulation of microbial inoculants and their application in agriculture. Finally, we will analyse economic prospects and constraints for MiR development and use. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a consortium of 11 academic institutions and 6 companies, including microbial inoculant producers and agricultural advisors, with complementary skills in basic and applied research and innovation.

To deliver improvement and sustainability in crop production it will be necessary to harness a broad spectrum approaches. Crop improvement will be crucial and a major part in the delivery of this will be based on classical breeding. This harnesses the genetic variation that is generated by homologous recombination during meiosis. Meiotic recombination creates new combinations of alleles that confer new phenotypes that can be tested for enhanced performance. It is also crucial in mapping genetic traits and in the introgression of new traits from sources such as wild-crop varieties. Despite the central role played by meiosis in crop production we are remarkably ignorant as to how the process is controlled in these species. For example, it is not known why recombination in cereals and forage grasses is skewed towards the ends of the chromosomes such that an estimated 30-50% of genes rarely, if ever, recombine thereby limiting the genetic variation that is available to plant breeders. Moreover, as many crop species are polyploid a further level of complexity is added to the meiotic process. Over the past 15 years studies in Arabidopsis, many conducted in the laboratories in the COMREC consortium, have provided both insights into the control of meiosis in plants and generated the tools to analyze this process in crop species.

The appearance of six-rowed types provided a major yield enhancement in early agriculture and although the gap between two- vs. six. row types has narrowed through breeding, it is clear that considerable potential remains for exploiting the development of up to three times as many grains per inflorescence as a route towards increasing yield.
