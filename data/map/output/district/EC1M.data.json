The seminar will be held in Tallinn Estonia and run into the annual General Assembly of YMCA Europe.\r\nThe main topic of the seminar is to give  young people the training and confidence to take part in a high-level discussion and decision making, as well as being taught the basics of creating a long time strategy for an international organisation. \r\nThrough the seminar, participants will get the opportunity to influence the future shaping of YMCA Europe by directly taking part in creating the zero document for the organisation's 2016-2020 strategy.\r\nThere will be 50 participants in the seminar, from 27 organisations within 24 countries around Europe. All participants will be aged 18 to 30, experienced in any sort of youth work and familiar with their local/national YMCA. The working language is English and one requirement is that all participants speak English. The seminar will mainly be facilitated with workshops, presentations and smaller working groups and the methodology will be based on the principles of participatory and bottom-up decision making processes. Additional value is self-development of participants where the indicators are based on increasing competences specified in the Youthpass instrument.\r\nGiving young people the opportunity to influence such high level discussions and giving them the training to take active part in it, as we are doing with the seminar, is also likely to empower them to take part in similar discussions on their local/regional/national level. Returning home with this experience will make the participants feel more confident and inspired to put themselves in that situation again. All this will bring their views and a young voice to discussions on all levels. \r\nAs a long term benefit, participants are expected to take equally active part in the future discussion on YMCA Europe's strategy making after returning home, as well as they will be encourage to take part in similar discussions and decisions on their local levels.\r\n\r\nMain objectives:\r\n\u2022 To train and prepare young leaders to take part in high-level discussions and decision making.\r\n\u2022 To get the voice of young people through to YMCA Europe's 2016-2020 strategy making.  \r\n\u2022 The creation of a Youth Empowerment Core Group within YMCA Europe\r\n\u2022 Increasing the impact and visibility of YMCA  Europe\u2019s International activities in the field of youth\r\n\u2022 Reflection on the Youth Leadership Consultation that has been carried out by individuals within the YES network since early 2014 and aims to finish before the GA in 2015.", "http://www.ymca.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-EE01-KA105-013103_7"], [2015, "Empowering youth - Strengthening communities", "National Council of YMCAs Inc", 15741.0, 11, 11, "The Young Men\u2019s Christian Association is one of the oldest and largest youth organizations in the world.

However, over the recent years several of our partners have been complaining of having difficulties in maintaining their staff and members motivated, efficient and qualified. We believe this is due the abundance of youth organizations \u201ccompeting\u201d for the same causes, which raises the standards of the programs offered, the lack of trained youth workers on the market and the lack of qualitative trainings for youth workers in all countries, the leading structures have just a few youth involved .The project has been born out of a common need and concern of all 11 partners involved, related to the quality of the human resources involved in their organizations. We have found that a new approach towards youth empowerment, development of skills, competences and motivation is needed, and therefore we have decided to create this training.\r\nEmpowering Youth-Strengthening communities  is a 9 days (except the traveling days) training course designed for 29  youth workers, leaders in 11 organizations from Europe.

Furthermore, we empower them to actively deliver programs for young people , to participate in the governance and decision making of their organization. Through empowerment young people are able to transform their lives. For transformation young people organize themselves and self organization leads to creating a caring, responsible and safe space in order to create fulfillment.

Two key aspects of the Strategy: 1) the promotion of a \"sustainable, smart and inclusive\" economic growth; 2) the reduction of early dropout in charge of young people. The overlap between the current economic crisis and the data, that emerge from ISTAT surveys on training poverty of young people, give us a complete inescapable picture: in Italy there are more than 113.000 young people between 14 and 17 years old out of the school\u2013training channels and they represent 5% of the resident population in the same age group; there are more than 2 million young people who do not work and do not study, representing 22% of the population, the incidence is significantly higher than in other European countries; the proportion of NEET is prevalent in the South, where the incidence of the phenomenon reaches 30,9%, although in recent years is also growing in the Central-North, especially the Northeast, where the crisis has intensified the phenomenon of non-employment. Let's Go is coherent with the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and taken back by the Italian government document \"Italia 2020: piano di azione per l\u2019occupabilit\u00e0 dei giovani attraverso l\u2019integrazione tra apprendimento e lavoro\"; the project would promote the development of techniques skills (compared to the demand of enterprises) through the creation of an internship period, carried out during the course of the studies - as advocated by the Italian document - to develop the culture of work and enterprise, of language skills and citizenship skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Let's Go promotes 300 mobilities for the realization of internship in enterprises, pointed towards young people of the circuit of Education and Vocational Training. These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua. The beneficiaries are: - the second and third annual paths of regional qualification (in some cases fourth annual path where required under regional regulation); - neo-qualified of qualification paths of not more than one year; - young of the4th and 5th class of technical professional institutes; - the graduates of not more than one year from the education pathways and technical professional. The young beneficiaries come from 17 Italian regions (from North to South Italy). Let's Go is a \"multi- sectorial\" project because it involves young people from different professional backgrounds (33% catering, 20 % mechanical, 17% agro-alimentary transformation, 7% of electricity, 10% of thermo-plumbing, 10 % well-being, 3% graphics). The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing). Lets'Go project also provides for the use of ECVET tools (learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding) for the personalized design of transnational mobility, in view of the enhancement of learning outcomes, acquired in the individual experiences of mobility.

The project foresees the allocation of 50 grants for the realization of traineeships in European companies operating in the Fashion industry and located in the United Kingdom, Spain and Lithuania. Beneficiaries of the mobility action will be 20 recent graduates and 30 students in the third and fourth year of studies in the sector \"Clothes and Fashion/Textile production\", coming from the Institutes members of the Consortium.

The traineeship performed by students will last 21 days (plus 2 days of travel) the presence of 4 accompanying persons  is foreseen. The promoters desire to realize this project to address the training and employment needs of the territories in which they are set, where the Fashion industry represents a relevant driver for the local economy and has got a huge potential of development. The fashion sector is composed by highly innovative companies with a great economical potential and it is one of the most dynamic in Europe, contributing for the 7%  gross national product of EU. It has high development rate and offers employment to almost 5 millions of people in Europe (Study on the economy of culture in Europe, 2006, \u201cCreative Economy \u2013 the Challenge of Assessing the Creative Economy \u2013towards informed policy-making\u201d, 2008).Anyway, the fashion sector requires highly qualified operators, with adequate practical and operational competences, transversal competences, including linguistic ones. So it is essential to provide young people  entering the labour market with practical skills and soft skills, to tackle unemployment, to allow companies to have adequate labor force, and, finally, to strengthen the productive capacity of territories. So, the objective of the project is to better qualify local human resources through the carrying out of international mobilities, focusing on the acquisition of technical and transversal skills required by the fashion industry, in order to make the professional profile of the participants more competitive on the labour market, contributing to increase their employability and to takle the phenomenon of massive migration of young people from the areas of origin. Carrying out a traineeship in European companies operating in the fashion industry will enable participants to integrate theoretical studies with practical activities, according to the philosophy of \"learning by doing\". During the traineeship they will be constantly monitored and supported by tutors who will assess their progress, and- at the end of the experience- the learning outcomes achieved, releasing the appropriate certifications.The experience will contribute to achieving the following results in the participants:- Improvement of practical and operative skills in the fashion sector and consolidation of technical and professional knowledge- Improvement of language competences, including the sectorial language of the fashion industry- Knowledge of different labor markets and other economies, new methodologies and practices in the fashion sector- Familiarization with social and cultural contexts of other EU countries, and strenghtening of European citizenship- Development of transversal communication, organizational and problem solving competences- Acquisition of  national and European certification expendable in the labor market- Upgrading and integration of the CV with new competences and experiences- Opportunities for recognition of competences acquired abroad (ECVET)- Improvement of the capacity of identification and evaluation of employment opportunities in the labor marketThe project will have a positive impact on the members of the Consortium, in terms of: capacity building of the organization and management of international activities with local and foreign partners; strengthening of strategies for internationalization and development, introduction of transnational mobility activities as \"systemic\"; updating of curricula to the needs of the area and the world of work.

One target is to enhance their personal experience, language skills and knowledge in their field of business and with respect to the curriculum. Another very important target is to share the gained experience with the other trainees of this programme. From July to October 2016 the trainees should make their internship in different EU-countries. To gain an even wider picture it is important that as many participants as possible go to different places to gather different insights and share those with their classmates once they are back in school for their final year.

To increase knowledge, active citizenship and engagement on pressuring issues (such as employment, health, migration, human rights and environment) affecting young people at community, national, European and global levels.\r\n\r\n3.To promote the active citizenship, social inclusion and solidarity of all young people.\r\n\r\n4. To equip young leaders networks/relationships across cultural and religious boundaries as part of a youth empowerment process in increasing multicultural societies and promote European values such as diversity and tolerance.\r\n\r\n5. To strengthen a European network of young leaders who can share best practices and experiences.\r\n\r\n6. To give participants and, through them, society a better understanding of advocacy work and why it is so important for the reduction of poverty at the european and global levels.\r\n\r\nThe activities will provide participants with tools to better themselves in the filed of advocacy and contribute to poverty reduction, using a variety of tools of non-formal education, including Subject to Citizen and Human Library.\r\n\r\nThe participants will develop their abilities in advocacy and will become more aware of how it can be used to diminish resolve a wide spectrum of problems, including poverty, youth exclusion and radicalization.\r\nThey will take all these new skills back to their communities where they will use them, and teach others how to use them, in order to solve at least some of the problems that are present there.

We believe that young people have the capacity to be active citizens implementing policy empowerment of other young people with the aim of engaging in policy advocacy. Hence, by addressing policy gaps in areas where young people experience injustice in our society, we are able to mobilise youth workers and young people in a non-violent change process aimed at creating justice for young people.

The project is a trilateral youth exchange with a strong inter-cultural European ethos between YMCA Ireland, George Williams Youth association in Kosovo, and YMCA England. Two key areas of learning focused on throughout the project are Cultural Awareness and Youth Work Practice.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to give 20 young leaders the opportunity to:\r\nDevelop cultural awareness \r\nDevelop their knowledge base and best practice of youth work \r\nAchieve a Youthpass Certificate \r\n\r\nProfile of Participants:\r\nSix participants from YMCA Ireland, three from Northern Ireland and three from Republic of Ireland\r\nSix participants from George Williams Youth (GWY) association in Kosovo, all residents in Kosovo\r\nSix from YMCA England, all residents in England\r\nAll participants are young people aged 18-25 and have faced barriers, obstacles and disadvantages in education and training, economic status, and/or living within divided societies. \r\nFour project managers will oversee the implementation and evaluation of the project. One from YMCA Ireland, one from YMCA England and two from George Williams Youth association in Kosovo. Project managers are aged 18-30 and together have an impressive range of experience in international youth work and management of youth organisations.\r\n\r\nThree main activities make up the framework of the project\r\nActivity One - Six day Youth exchange in London, England. The theme of this activity is 'Past'. Participants will visit the place where the organisation they are part of, the YMCA, was birthed in 1844 by George Williams. They will learn about the groundbreaking work of the YMCA from it's humble beginnings as well as looking into the development of youth work practice over the years. Alongside this participants will learn and share some of the history of the countries represented as well as reflecting on their own past and key moments in their lives so far.\r\n\r\nActivity Two - Six day Youth Exchange in Pristina, Kosovo. The theme of this activity is 'Present'. Participants will learn and share about the present realities facing young people in their countries and some of the cultural traditions that continue today. Alongside this, participants will engage in discussion and debates about current youth work values and principles, issues facing young people in Europe today, and the kind of work YMCA Europe is engaged in as a response to the issues and challenges faced by young people. \r\n\r\nActivity Three - Six day Youth Exchange in Newcastle, Northern Ireland. The theme of this activity is 'Future'. Participants will share their hopes and dreams for their own futures as well as the kind of future they want for their country. Learning will occur around the role of youth work in driving positive social change.\r\n\r\nProject activities will be facilitated by both project managers and participants to ensure participant directed learning can take place and young people can develop communication and facilitation skills. Non-formal learning methods will be employed at every stage of the project with an emphasis on experiential learning including cultural excursions and visiting youth work projects in each country; informal conversational times to foster the development of positive relationships; group work and group discussions giving voice to participants and encouraging them to direct the course of learning; scenario based activities; personal reflection activities allowing space for reflection on learning; group presentations; and outdoor activities with an emphasis on team building and having fun.\r\n\r\nEnvisaged results and impact\r\nThe project will result in participants being more competent and confident youth work practitioners with enhanced cultural awareness and a desire to promote values of acceptance and understanding. Participants will have developed personal and interpersonal skills making them better equipped to access further and employment opportunities. The skills and attitudes developed by participants transferable to all areas of personal, social and professional life include; increased confidence and self-awareness; enhanced communication skills; renewed sense of achievement, thorough understanding of the principle 'learning to learn' and taking control of own learning; aspiration to be active citizens and work for positive social change. The impact at local level will be an improved quality of youth work being delivered with an ethos of acceptance and understanding promoted by more competent youth work volunteers supporting paid staff.\r\n\r\nThe potential long term impacts include participants accessing leadership roles on local and national YMCA boards and all partner organisations establishing a structure to support ongoing youth exchanges to maximize mutual learning of youth.", "http://www.ymca.org.uk", "National Council of YMCAs Ireland", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA105-012501_2"]]}}, "6EZ": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING LIMITED*COS", 2158.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20226"], [2016, "THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING LIMITED*COS", 1949.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18752"], [2017, "THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING LIMITED*COS", 880.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_58207"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF SHIPPING LIMITED LBG", 672.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_19889"], [2017, "THE CHAMBER OF SHIPPING LIMITED*COS", 428.0, "Improving the proper functioning of the taxation systems (14.03.01)", "fts_2017_53428"]]}}, "7AD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1254355200000, 1443571200000, "Understanding chronic pain and improving its treatment", "Neuroscience Technologies Limited", "We will establish an international team of leading researchers and clinicians (EuroPain) to undertake multidisciplinary translational research which will: 1) increase the understanding of chronic pain mechanisms; 2)facilitate the development of novel analgesic drugs; and 3) improve the treatment of chronic pain patients.\nNineteen researchers drawn from the London Pain Consortium, the Danish Pain Research Centre, the German Pain Network and a Spanish research-intensive SME centre will form a \u2018meta\u2019 consortium with complementary expertise.

European Islands share one specific trait that restrains their access to these opportunities. For their isolation and lack of human capital in general, islands are faced with lower socio-economic conditions and an underdeveloped educational system, experiencing a greater student disengagement and school dropout. Measures to improve European islands development include the promotion of new ICT technologies in education and the shift of human aspirations toward quality.\r\n\r\nIDiverSE is an innovative project that builds up on a previous Erasmus+ project (PLATON) where members of this team also collaborate together. It uses previously created and validated as well as new innovative methods for Inquiry Based Science Learning activities.\r\n\r\nThe pilot stage of this project will include interdisciplinary collaborative Inquiry and a new methodology for the investigation of local culture. Components of ethnoscience will be applied throughout the whole project to enable students to find connections between the ancestral knowledge embedded in their cultural heritage and the classroom curricular contents thus participating in a more meaningful and valuable learning experience.\r\n\r\nInterdisciplinary and collaborative inquiry, local culture, ethnoscience and personal geography will be integrated to create a Science Trail where students will explore their natural environment starting from the Water, continuing to the Land and ending with the Skies. Altogether the results will provide students with a holistic view of the factors that influence their lives, as their culture, their environment and their geographical conditions. Working in cooperation with schools from different islands in Europe and worldwide, through an online platform, students will also realise that each island has a different network of influences creating a diversity that brings value and uniqueness to each student\u2019s homeland. \r\n\r\nIDiverSE also stands for \u201cI Diverse\u201d and as such it aims to include an even deeper view of Diversity, integrating each student\u2019s internal world as unique and precious, promoting awareness for civic and ethical issues for the respect of difference. In the end the Science Trails will become available to each island\u2019s community and students will share their findings as well as raise their community\u2019s awareness for the Diversity concepts learnt. The whole process will be transparent and inclusive, raising their community\u2019s understanding of the importance of development and innovation in education. The project team will then produce a Roadmap handbook that will include the IDiverSE methodology, tools and Science Trail mapping as well as the lessons learnt during the pilot implementation phase, making it freely available to other European countries.\r\nIDiverSE is in line with the key competences for the 21st century skills for students and teachers. By promoting real scientific research and Inquiry Based activities, it challenges students to become more independent and proactive, developing their critical thinking and the capacity to find problem solving solutions. For the international cooperation component it promotes the development of social and communication skills, as well as tolerance and global citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project foresees the involvement of at least 20 Portuguese schools, 10 Spanish schools and 10 Greek schools, divided across Madeira, Azores, Canary, Balearic islands, and distributed over several other Greek islands as part of the Rural Wings network. The project is estimated to directly reach at least 120 teachers and 1000 students living on the islands.\r\n\r\nTeachers involve in the project will face a shift in their teaching practice, making it more student-centred and with a greater sense of interdisciplinarity and contextualization. They will be motivated to work in cooperation and to create a better and more meaningful relationship with their colleagues and students at a local and international level. By the end, teachers will be left with the project\u2019s know-how and an enriched professional curriculum. Students, being the main target of this project will benefit from a better environment at school where cooperation is supported and motivated and with an increased feeling of involvement in the classroom. Students will discover new skills and strengths and at the same time learn to respect their own weaknesses. They will finish the project with a greater sense of self-efficacy and pride while at the same time having their work shared and recognised in and outside of their home islands. The creation of a network through ICT will be left as a bridge that stands in place of the physical connections that islands lack increasing the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 international connections and opening their multicultural horizons.", "http://www.ilaet.com.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA201-035919_8"]]}}}}
