More specifically : 1. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial  attitude and  behaviour:Our students of level 4+EQF are more and more aware of the fact that they need to make their own choices in life in order to be economically and financially independent in an early stage of their life. The situation in Europe requires a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals. Our objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region . Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies as start-ups or pop-ups while studying.

In addition, the consortium will perform phase 1 and phase 2 studies, including extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies, with a new beta\u2010lactam \u2010 AIC499 \u2010 with enhanced beta\u2010lactamase stability and in vitro/ in vivo activities against MDR-GNB, including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Alone, or in combination with a beta\u2010lactamase inhibitor (BLI), AIC499 is active against MDR isolates producing a wide range of beta\u2010lactamases, and therefore, offers the real prospect of a new treatment option for patients with life-threatening infections due to MDR GNBs. The COMBACTE-MAGNET consortium brings together 5 pharmaceutical industry partners and 36 academic partners, and is a true nexus of world class researchers from 10 European countries with expertise in (i) designing and executing observational and interventional studies related to antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria; (ii) conducting high\u2010quality research in the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of infections caused by MDR\u2010GNB, (iii) identifying novel biomarkers in critically ill patients; (iv) performing Phase I PK/PD studies; (v) performing Phase 2 studies enriched for PK/PD endpoints; and (vi) performance of large definitive Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) for regulatory purposes. The two European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) project sponsors, MedImmune and AiCuris, will provide all required study\u2010related expertise in clinical development of monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics with MEDI3902 and AIC499 plus BLI as Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs), respectively. Key strengths of the COMBACTE-MAGNET consortium is its direct links to the ND4BB Topic 1 COMBACTE network (Clinical Trial Network [CLIN\u2010Net], Laboratory Trial and Research Network [LAB-Net], and Statistical Trial and Research Network [STAT\u2010net]), the ND4BB Topic 5 COMBACTE-CARE consortium, participation of the Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS and Infectious Diseases (PENTA-ID) network for pediatric infection studies, and the European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP), a not\u2010for\u2010profit, Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)\u2010 and FP7\u2010funded, organization specialized in delivering tailor\u2010made, practice\u2010relevant Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training activities in European Union (EU) countries. The clinical studies related to MEDI3902 and of AIC499 will be supported by innovative epidemiological studies, including mathematical modeling of the consequences of P. aeruginosa infections. Furthermore, detailed biomarker studies will be performed to explore associations of host biomarkers (e.g., pre\u2010existing antibodies against P. aeruginosa virulence factors, protein biomarkers, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules) and infections, disease severity and outcome, which will enhance the successful execution of clinical trials.

SUPPORT is aimed at building on these achievements by engaging representative stakeholders to guide the development of next generation solutions for upgraded preventive and remedial security capabilities in European ports. The overall benefit will be the secure and efficient operation of European ports enabling uninterrupted flows of cargo and passengers while suppressing illegal immigration and trafficking of drugs, weapons and illicit substances all in line with the efforts of FRONTEX and EU member states. SUPPORT will deliver public formal specifications and open standards based tools that will aid security upgrade in EU ports and will be complementary to and usable by other EU projects and initiatives in this area. Emphasis will be given to bring together advances from research on security with results from the main EU projects in maritime and intermodal transport, specifically those concerned with security and interoperability issues. Thus, SUPPORT will address \u2018total\u2019 port security upgrade solutions encompassing legal, organisational, technology and human factors perspectives.

In Europe, 1 one out of 40 pregnancies is affected by a congenital anomalies that can result in medical, social and/or psychological disabilities throughout the lifespan for the affected individuals and their families. When it come to children with disabilities there are often negative consequences in their education, which can have a detrimental effect on their future.  One of the most common congenital anomalies is orofacial cleft that requires treatment from birth to adulthood.  Besides from the obvious medical perspective, studies have reported poorer performance trajectories in educational settings for individuals with orofacial cleft in comparison to their otherwise healthy peers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the resources in our health care system across Europe are quite varied and the demand on resources is increasing rapidly. This result in that children do not get the access to the necessary care provision, especially in screening for diagnostics or treatment implications that can have a negative impact on their education.  The idea of the project was shaped at the European parliament meeting \u201cThe challenges of health inequalities in the treatment and prevention of birth defects in Europe: An information workshop for MEPs and NGOs at the European Parliament\u201d in Brussels and further strengthening and supported by the on going networking project COST Action IS1210 funded by the EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020. \r\n\r\nBy having a consortium of psychosocial (UK), public health (SE) and pedagogical experts in vocational training in accordance to the EQF, ECVET and EQAVET frameworks (NO) together with hospitals (BG, LT, RS, SE, TR) and NGO\u2019s that works directly with individuals with congenital anomalies and their families (BG, NL) ensures that a functional training program can be delivered.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to develop a training package for health care professionals that has limited or no access to psychological input about the medical and psychosocial variables that can influence educational achievement. They would also be trained to deliver this information to the parents of the children with orofacial clefts. The parents would be trained to recognise behavioural symptoms and other psychosocial aspects that could negatively influence educational outcomes. This would result in that the parents can feedback to the health professionals in a systematized way.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory work by the consortium validates that this is a project that meets the focus of the European commission (European Commission Communication \u2018European Disability Strategy 2010-2020: A Renewed Commitment to a Barrier-Free Europe\u2019, November 2010; European Commission Communication \u2018Early Childhood Education and Care: Providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow\u2019, February 2011; European Commission Communication \u2018The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019, December 2010) and that each partners is highly motivated to allocate resources since there is an established need and consequently implementation and sustainability of the project is assured.\r\n\r\nThis will be accomplished by to develop a training course in modular form that will be piloted on 50 \u2013 100 health professionals in the following partners countries (BG, LV, RS, SE, TR) in order to ensure the effectiveness and cultural adaptation.

Those with disfigurement also experience social discrimination that negatively impacts on personal aspirations, education and work opportunities.   As medical advances improve the survival rates of those born with or who acquire a disfigurement, and the demand for cosmetic interventions and psychological support increases,  professionals from diverse health and social care areas are increasingly being exposed to the challenges of identifying and addressing the needs of patients burdened by complex and unique psychosocial issues.  These professionals are perfectly placed to ameliorate these issues but report that they often lack the necessary expertise to help and therefore patient access to expert support is inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA consortium led by the internationally renowned Centre for Appearance Research in the UK with university partners in IT,  LT, SE and TK and the European Cleft Organisation (NGO) in NL, who have collaborations with health professionals and patients in various healthcare settings, will execute an innovative project to design, test and implement a multi-modal, evidence-based course for use in higher education that will equate to 2.5 credits (75 hours required to achieve learning outcomes). It will have extensive and culturally specific materials to enable health and social care trainee and qualified professionals identify and manage patients and clients affected by disfigurement  and body image concerns. The need for action in this area is further validated by the current COST action IS1210 of which most partners are members, that highlights the negative psychosocial impact of appearance concerns and the importance of these issues within health settings (http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/isch/Actions/IS1210) and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPartners will form strategic regional working groups and will be allocated tasks to suit their strengths and expertise. University partners will survey at least 100 multidisciplinary health professionals in each partner country to  determine the current state of training for health professionals involved in the care of people with any disfigurement,  their  awareness and understanding of the issues facing those affected,  their confidence in supporting patients with appearance-related concerns,  their  training needs and views on the best way to deliver and promote educational materials.   The European Cleft Organization will also produce a European report on health professionals' current awareness of appearance issues and training needs. Reports from each partner will inform the development of multilingual material for a 6 module course, that will adhere to the European Quality Framework and provide education on the psychology of body image and disfigurement, risk factors for body image dissatisfaction and its psychosocial and health impact across the lifespan, the impact of disfigurement for the individual and family with reference to protective and risk factors for adjustment,  the development of skills to the promote positive body image, assess and meet the needs of people with disfigurement  and skills to manage professional issues related to instigating and sharing best practice around this subject.  Materials and their mode of delivery will be pilot tested in each country by potential users and reviewed by the NGO and if necessary adapted further. A course handbook providing guidance to course administrators and course website with down-loadable multilingual  materials will be developed and the course will be widely advertised using the many contacts and networks provided by the partners. National exploitation multiplier events in each country and via the  COST action above, will ensure dissemination to hundreds of multidisciplinary health professionals from a minimum of 30 countries and 50 relevant organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short term this project will provide a unique, cost-effective , widely available and internationally transferable course, informed by a UK partner with extensive expertise in the field that addresses educational and skill deficits identified by multidisciplinary health professionals across the UK and EU.  We expect this expertise will improve health care provision for people affected by disfigurement and more general body image dissatisfaction, which in the longer term has the potential to improve associated physical and mental health-related outcomes. It will also challenge poorly informed attitudes that can lead to discrimination, by raising awareness of these issues to health professionals and contributing to a social dialogue about stigmatization and the social exclusion of individuals/families with disfiguring conditions and appearance-related concerns. .", "http://www.uwe.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA203-001631_coordinator"], [2017, "Sustaining Teachers and Learners With the Arts: Relational Health in European Schools", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", 164985.0, 5, 10, "The project name STALWARTS stands for \u2018Sustaining Teachers And Learners With the Arts\u2019.  The subtitle of the project is \u2018Relational Health in European Schools\u2019.  The STALWARTS project will operate in 5 European countries: Estonia, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and the UK.  It is a cross- sectoral project that involves a University and a school working in partnership together in each country. The group of schools comprises one residential special school, two 'second chance' schools and two mainstream schools that \u2018prioritise inclusive practice\u2019. The diversity of classrooms, educational settings and European regions represented will enrich the experiences of and learning from this inter-professional development project. \r\n\r\nThe STALWARTS project aims to promote relational health in schools.  It builds upon the achievements of the current complementary LINK project (Learning in a New Key) through facilitating collaboration and learning between teachers and music and other creative arts therapists to support vulnerable young people in their transitions into learning. The STALWARTS methodology is based on UNCRC principles that encourage teachers and therapists to investigate the impact of sensory and relational aspects of music and arts experiences on the executive functions of the brain and to explore creative activities that support the development of positive attachments to which vulnerable young people have a right.   \r\n\r\nThrough the STALWARTS training programme teachers engage themselves in collaborative music making with the young people while conducting classroom enquiries that draw on observable physiological phenomena.  It is through the development of such evidence bases that the promotion of young people\u2019s relational health in the school context becomes recognised as a concern that teachers can address. In this emerging field of interest, practice-based evidence from the STALWARTS project will support shared reflections between teachers and therapists in a way that helps both groups to find synergies between their different professional ways of working.  Through discussions like these the LINK project teachers have been developing new knowledge, understandings, skills and ways of being that support them to become music/arts-based therapeutic teaching practitioners.  During the STALWARTS project these methodologies and classroom enquiries will be incorporated into new accredited university study programmes.  \r\n\r\nThus the first STALWARTS objective will be to transform these professional learning experiences into learning outcomes for new Masters level modules in therapeutic teaching practice so as to accredit teachers\u2019 enhanced competences in this field.  A common Post Graduate Certificate in \u2018Relational Health in European Schools through Music and the Arts\u2019 will be accredited in each of the 5 participating Universities and will recruit teachers and other professionals working in the 5 partner schools during the second year of the programme.

The second document \u2018Relational Health in Schools in Context\u2019 provides a European-wide policy context for these initiatives.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the main beneficiaries will be vulnerable young people within the classes of the teachers who will engage in the university-based study programmes.  Some will have had adverse childhood experiences that will have resulted in developmental trauma that is not restored or repaired through the prevalent behaviourist approaches of many schools. It is intended that the teachers of such vulnerable children who comprise up to 15% of general school populations in Europe, will have accredited professional recognition for the enhanced competences that underpin their therapeutic teaching practices and be respected for their capacities to incorporate dimensions of relational health into their new educational rationales.

Young people in this category continue to face  exclusion from social and educational opportunities due to personal conditions that result from their trauma\r\nhistories, including abuse and neglect within the family, experience of warfare and human trafficking.   High levels of such psychological distress exist within school populations in each of the partner countries in this application.   We have called the project 'Learning in a New Key' to emphasise our realisation that this group of vulnerable young people need to experience newly attuned ways of learning in classrooms and educational institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe multi-professional partnership comprises 4 schools and 5 supporting institutions from 4 different European regions with a spread of proven expertise in teaching, social care, therapeutic intervention, music therapy training, educational intervention, education management and educational research. The partnership has developed a participatory 2 year project strategy to create relevant and usable products that can engage and sustain teachers as active agents of change in educational settings on behalf of vulnerable young people that they are supporting. The products comprise 4 inter-related entities: a school-based teacher training programme, a first step toolkit of therapeutic practice for use in the classroom, a competence framework and narrative impact studies. These products will resonate with the realities of the classrooms where participating teachers are exploring how to frame learning within a relational process that draws deeply on cultural and psychological resources.  \r\n\r\nA main project activity is to use resources that have been developed to pilot and implement a school-based training programme for teachers in class-based therapeutic teaching practice. This will run concurrently in the 4 participating schools. The teachers will have opportunity to trial materials that provide therapeutic music-centred and arts-based experiences as preludes to lessons and as interludes to support transitions. The teachers will be supported in introducing these innovative routines through reflective supervisions with practising therapists, including music therapists.  \r\n\r\nThe activities in this multi-local project are given coherence through the even sharing of responsibilities between the partners for shaping the professional products. The various management, implementation, writing, research and review teams all include members from each region represented. The communications are supported through a dedicated website and significant resources that are created are translated into the languages spoken in the regions and schools represented.  Opportunities for mutual learning between the project participants are enhanced through an annual short joint staff training event.

Those with low levels of education are three times more likely to be NEET compared to those with tertiary education, while young people with an immigrant background are 70% more likely to become NEET than nationals. Young people suffering from some kind of disability or health issues are 40% more likely to be NEET than those in good health. Being a NEET has severe adverse consequences for the individual, society and the economy. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop a new innovative method of training courses that will empower young unemployed individuals and/or NEETs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partners involved in the project are from Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Spain and Sweden, whom all are highly experienced organisations that work directly with the target groups as well as representing countries that has high youth unemployment.  The partner from the United Kingdom is the expert in positive psychology and psychosocial interventions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific aim will be achieved by using an approach that is based upon previous work on stress, coping and resilience in health and occupational psychology. In this project, we will prepare participants to not only adapt to potentially stressful events and successfully assimilate these, but also to use these potential stressors as opportunities for positive growth based on identification and utilisation of key Positive Psychology constructs and processes.  Furthermore, we will focus on the potential stressors likely to be encountered by unemployed younger adults seeking employment or entrepreneurial opportunity.  This goes hand in hand that it is necessary to Empowering young people by creating favourable conditions for them to develop their skills and to work and participate actively in society is essential for sound and sustainable economic and social development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be accomplished by to develop a training curriculum \"Be Positive\" in modular form.  It will be implemented on 100 \u2013 150 young unemployed and/or NEETs in the following partners countries (AT, BG, ES, GR, SE) in order to ensure the effectiveness and cultural adaptation.  The result will be evaluated and modified if required.  The final product will be available for free via the projects website. \r\n\r\nThe impact is the following:\r\n\r\n- Increase the staffs' awareness of their capacity in the partners\u2019 organisation to act as role models and curators of learning environments which value diversity in appearance and promote social inclusion.\r\n\r\n- Increase the staffs' awareness of cultural appearance and beauty norms and they way in which different cultural appearance norms may affect the social integration in our European society.\r\n\r\n- Provide strategies and resources that can be integrated into current guidance counselling and vocational training provisions\r\n\r\n- Provide growth and insight for young unemployed and/or NEET via the developed material for young unemployed and/or NEET that will consequently prepare them to handle the current difficult labour market in Europe in the participating organisations.\r\n\r\n-  Furthermore, the training can make them more resilient for the psychosocial stress associated with being unemployed and therefore consequently improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n- Between 150 \u2013 200 guidance counsellors, vocational trainers or other relevant stakeholders will be involved in a training seminar as a National Multiplier event in AT, BG, ES, GR and SE.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the developed program is easily studied via self-directed learning, the organisations that have been exposed to the project via the extensive dissemination/exploitation plan can easily incorporate it and consequently ensure a pragmatic sustainability.   The end result is that organisations will have a resource that is both sensitive to psychological issues relevant to this group, as well as being constructive and positively focussed. It is expected that participants will be better psychologically prepared both to cope and manage positively with the difficulties of being unemployed/NEET, whilst also being enabled and empowered to identify personal strengths and meaningful goals to facilitate the search for engagement with economically productive activity.", "http://www.uwe.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA202-000988_4"], [2014, "Face Value: Optimising the psychosocial care for individuals with birth defects in Europe by implementing an innovative training method for staff in health care and NGO settings.", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", 131896.0, 7, 7, "The rational of the project was shaped at the European parliament meeting \u201cThe challenges of health inequalities in the treatment and prevention of birth defects in Europe\u201d in Brussels (9/10/2012) since it was identified that the psychosocial aspects for individuals with disfigurement is less than optimal in many instances across Europe.

In many cases the health care professionals lack the capacity to deliver appropriate psychosocial care in combination with not understanding the specific cultural stigma associated with disfigurement.  In Bulgaria, by a request from UNICEF, a survey highlighted that 40% of the parents were advised to abandon their child with cleft in an orphanage where they can expect life-long institutionalization, because of the financial and emotional burden. Of 89% of these, the advice was given by a qualified health professional (ECO, 2011). In Bulgaria, Latvia, Turkey and Serbia, the psychosocial care provision is not adequately developed or in some cases non-existing.  This is mostly due to that the health staff or members of relevant NGO\u2019s has no training in regards in how to deliver appropriate psychosocial support.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy having a consortium of psychosocial experts (UK), pedagogical experts in vocational training in accordance to the European Qualification Framework (NO) together with hospitals that deliver care for disfigurments (RS, TR) and NGO\u2019s (BG, NL) that works directly with individuals with disfigurement and their families as well as providing training to health professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim is to generate the training course \u201cFace Value\u201d since it is established that health professionals can be taught to provide psychosocial support when given simple training and access to appropriate resources.

Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery. The course, once developed, will be deployed to 45 trainees each in UK, Spain, Norway and Denmark over 4 days during a 7 month period. In parallel, the eCourse will be deployed in one region to test the right balance for blended learning and assess the most suitable platforms for its deployment. The toolkit will be built on the project website.\r\n\r\nThe third phase will focus on evaluating the course and assessing its impact on the target group and external stakeholders. During this phase, the curriculum and course will also be tested in a Central and an Eastern European country with differing cultural and health and care system characteristics. A sustainability plan laying the foundations for the future of the project and its intellectual outputs will be delivered towards the end of the project.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and impact: The ALTAS project will deliver a fit-for-purpose standards and curriculum, assessment framework and course materials for  health and social care professionals. These deliverables will be supported by an eCourse, a course deployment toolkit and a comprehensive evaluation report. The ALTAS project is expected to (1) raise awareness and increase knowledge of ALT for front-line health and social care staff and their managers, (2) increase motivation in staff to take ALT courses, (3) increase staff willingness and confidence to promote ALT, (4) increase interest in the ALT workforce to exchange and share good practice across Europe and (5) increase collaboration and cooperation between training organisations and ALT suppliers.", "http://www.hft.org.uk", "NHS Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013710_8"]]}}, "7FR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1496188800000, "Initial Training Network for Neurogical disorders orchestrated by cytoKines", "Apitope Technology (Bristol) Ltd", "Neuroinflammatory disease, in particular multiple sclerosis affects more than 700.000 people within Europe alone. European countries are at the forefront of neuroimmunological research and students in medicine and biology are greatly attracted by the field. Neuroimmunology research further impacts our understanding of the ethiopathology of other CNS-disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia and Morbus Parkinson. The ability of inflammatory immune cells to cause tissue damage within the nervous system is largely governed by soluble mediators including cytokines/chemokines, cytolytic molecules and growth factors. The therapeutic targeting of such mediators has proven successful for the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, yet is failing for the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders. Clearly, the rules and regulatory elements, which govern inflammation and tissue injury within the CNS, differ significantly from those of other tissues and a unique CNS-focused research approach to unravel these rules is required.\nIn this ITN proposal, we will train ESRs and ERs specifically in Neuroimmunology by combining prominent laboratories in academia and industry on the task to study the communication networks between immune and CNS-resident cells.\nScientifically, we focus particularly on the soluble factors mediating cell-cell communication at the immune-CNS interface. To this end, we combine expertise in molecular and cellular Neuroimmunology with Neuropathology of human and animal models of CNS inflammation.

These materials are a route to further exploiting advanced materials, using enabling technologies for additional functionalities, without compromising structural integrity. Carbon fibre (CF) based materials have particular advantages due to their lightweight, good mechanical, electrical and thermal properties.
