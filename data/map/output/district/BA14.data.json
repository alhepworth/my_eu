Over this period, we will recruit 35 travel & tourism students to undertake 4 week work placements in tourism focussed host organisations, based in Seville and Crete. Student will travel in groups of 10-15 and will be accompanied by staff, at a ratio of 1 staff:10 students. All participants will be students from our Level 3 BTEC travel and tourism diploma. The mobility will provide an opportunity to apply their theoretical classroom learning in a real life work setting. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to create an experience for the students that will enhance their overall programme of study. The project will support this by giving the students the opportunity to live and work in another country whereby they can adapt their social skills when dealing with a new culture and language. \r\n\r\nAt present, we are able to offer work placements to students in the local area, but we recognise the value that an international dimension will bring. It will encourage learners to become more independent, develop their confidence, self assurance and other key skills in a structured and supportive setting.\r\n\r\nFor many of our learners, this will be their first experience of travel outside the UK or even their home community. In the context of their vocational course, travel & tourism, it is vital that they have some international experience, of working and communicating with people in a different language and culture. The mobility is a chance to offer learners this experience, in an environment of close staff and peer supervision and support. This will put them in a much stronger position to access employment in the sector, and equip them with a broader perspective of the opportunities available to them. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will give our learners a broad understanding of different types of travel and tourism organisations within two popular tourist locations. \r\n\r\nWe have support mechanisms in place to support our young learners through the accompanying person role, work placement supervisors, and local reps in each host location. We will also design in depth preparatory activities, and schedule parents evenings and info events prior to departure. \r\n\r\nWe will agree a set of learning outcomes for each learner, which will be aligned to specific units of their vocational course. they will also have personal learning objectives. We will look for opportunities to integrate the mobility into our course delivery, for example, setting activities for students whilst on placement using our online software package, which will enable students to collaborate and  learn about both locations and the experiences of their peers, in addition to their own individual placement experience. \r\n\r\nWe expect the impact will be that learners develop their confidence and self assurance, raise their aspirations and broaden their horizons. It will be a significant professional and personal development opportunity. In  the long term, we hope it will impact on their onward progression and career path decisions. \r\n\r\nIt will be a development opportunity for the staff involved, to engage with new employers and forge new European partnerships.It will be an opportunity to enhance course delivery and integrate a mobility opportunity into the course, thus making the course more attractive to learners, which we hope in the short term will improve learner motivation and performance and in the longer term positively impact on marketing and recruitment for the College.", "http://www.wiltshire.ac.uk/", "Wiltshire College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047142_coordinator"]]}}, "0JZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1362096000000, 1443571200000, "The Development and Construction of a Master Mould for Riblet Construction", "Axess Technologies Limited", "The project will consist of the construction of a seamless, precision welded flat master mould manufactured to such a high quality to enable the embossing of painted riblets onto the outer surface of an aircraft.

This should also have a positive effect in terms of the national economy revitalization, especially in the South of Italy.\r\nTourism and Agribusiness are key sectors for all of the regions involved in the project and recently they have been object of important development strategies for the promotion of the Italian territory and its typical products at European level.

The first step of this model is the transnational mobility.

In spite of this, nationally the area receives only 22% of investment and employment is in decline. Thus we can see that agriculture remains a sector characterized by light and shade, the lack of people specialized in agriculture and the cultivation of high quality food products as well as the widespread reluctance to approach and develop the agricutlural sector due to the lack of knowledge regarding the employment potential of this sector. In recent decades these issues this have contributed to people abandonning agricultural land and a reduction of the area of utilized land. Moreover only 5% of the land in the South is currently being used to cultivate high quality products. \r\nItaly has always distinguished itself for its agricultural richness, variety and quality. Today there are 268 products with regional and geographic protection which puts Italy at the forefront of the EU in terms of agriculture. This agricultural wealth creates value from a cultural, economic and social perspective esepcially when one considers gastrotourism which contributes to awareness and enthusiasm for Italian products abroad and assists in developing disadvantaged areas which produce high quality products. The DOP, IGP and STG labels which indicate geographic protection of agricultural products also make up a significant part of Italian food production and also encourage competition in local agricultural contexts. \r\nFrom this analysis, the dea for the project High Quality was born, a project which primarily offers the opportunity to new graduates in agricultural subjects to complete training in the agricultural sector in a European context. This opportunity will develop and foster the competitiveness of the agricultural producers of the future and better prepare them for the commerical challenges which lay ahead in their career. Indeed the most powerful weapon available to farmers in the EU is the quality of their products and for that reason the hosting organizations are producers of top quality products, allowing graduates to learn from the best. \r\nThe overall objective of the project is to create qualified professionals able to import and contextualize best practices in food production to their territory and furthermore spread these good practices in the cultivation of DOP, IGP and STG products thereby promoting a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in the sector.\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n- Provide work experience that allows participants to learn the techniques and dynamics of crop production;\r\n- Stimulate the creation of new farms which produce quality products from the central and southern regions;\r\n- Introduce into the world of farming 100 new operators/people with a clear professional profile in agri-food sector.\r\nThe project High Quality has been promoted and proposed by the Technical training school M. Buonarroti which is situated in the territory of Caserta as a training centre for people in the agricultural sector and has been supported by the Department of Industrial Engineering and I.T. at the Second University of Naples. Other project partners include 012Factory, an enterprise center which seeks to create a 'space' where ideas, knowledge, competence and intelligence can circulate freely through the cross-fertilization and Confagricoltura Campania which supports the synergy of entrepreneurial attitude with agriculture and looks to the future and innovation whilst respecting traditions.\r\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be new graduates (within one year of graduation) of the agricultural project partners (ISSS Mondelli Massafra (Ta), ISISS Piedimonte (Ce), ISSS Angeloni of Frosinone), who will receive interdisciplinary training associated with the activities of a farm specifically in the production of DOP, IGP, STG products. Trainees will develop simultaneously the technical skills of cultivation with the enterprising  and entrepreneurial know-how, looking at introducing both managerial and financial nouse with the promotion and cultivation of hig quality foodstuffs.\r\nThe mobility activity has been organized into two streams lasting three months without interruption and participants will fulfill these traineeships in farms in the following European countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Malta, Portugal and the United Kingdom.\r\nAt the end of the mobility period, for each of the two streams there will be a final workshop in which the acquired skills and experiences will be shared and will bring together companies operating in the area, professional associations and all other relevant stakeholders.\r\nThe expected result is the fostering of entrepreneurial spirit in each of the participants which can then assist them in their future career by developing transferable soft-skills or allowing them to achieve self-employment.

Dates are predicted for March-Aprill 2017 and April -May 2017, which fits perfectly into the calendar practices of the school year 2016/17.During the learning process, students acquire general knowledge of professional courses. However, to be effective education, basic knowledge must go hand in hand with practice and experience. The holding of foreign work experience is a definite asset to the local, regional and national labor market.

This type of responsibility is an examination of maturity for all participants.According to the research of the Laboratory of Social Sopot, employers generally expressed a positive opinion about people taking foreign practice. In their view, this type of experience teaches flexibility and ability to work in a group.

The growing importance of Diversity Education has led the college to expand its range of work placements to students and trainees to include a two-week work placement in a school catering for pupils with disabilities for the 2016-2018 bid. The project is important for the college, staff and student development in that it- increases the interest in European languages other than English at the colleges, such as Spanish and Polish in the areas of hospitality and catering and pre-school education- provides childcare students and trainees from the Hospitality and Catering Dept. with the opportunity to practise and improve their English in the UK- enables teaching staff to participate in job-shadowing visits which expands the network of contacts to other EU colleges which promotes the European dimension in the college and its curricula- places a strong focus on the professional development of the language and subject tutors in that they gain experience through job shadowing and training courses in their respective subjects such as Spanish, ICT, childcare and diversity education- motivates teachers and other college departments that are not yet active in EU projects to support the EU Project Management Team in organising and carrying out projects inside and outside the classroom.Six students from an A-level course ending with a vocational qualification in childcare and education (Berufliches Gymnasium) will complete a two-week work placement at a childcare centre in Leeds. A further six students will complete a two-week work placement in a nursery school in Glasgow, while three students will have the opportunity to work for a fortnight at a school for pupils with disabilities in the same city. Six apprentices from the department of hospitality and catering will complete a two-week work placement in a hotel or restaurantin Pembroke, Wales or Glasgow, Scotland, while six trainees from the same department will have the opportunity to  expand their existing professional competences while working at the Alexander the Great Beach Hotel in Greece. Both groups of learners will have the opportunity to improve, adapt or attain knowledge, attitudes and skills in each of the followingareas:- reflect upon vocational training/working conditions of early learning practitioners, teaching staff at schools for disabled pupils or hotel/restaurant staff in another country- gain insight into the professional mentality of practitioners and hotel/restaurant staff in another country- re-evaluate their own opinions about the relevance of the European Union on a personal and vocational level- learn to adapt to a new hierarchy in the hosting childcare centre in the UK or hotel/restaurant in the UK or Greece- expand their knowledge of methodology and pedagogics in early learning or in diversity education in the UK or of hotel and restaurant management in the UK or Greece- act as ambassadors for Germany and the German language.Thirteen members of KKBKHA staff will participate in job shadowing visits to England, Wales, Scotland, Greece, Poland and Spain. Two language tutors will attend teacher training courses for the languages English and Spanish. In addition, the college EU project coordinator will attend a seminar in London in preparation for the 2017 Erasmus+ bid for Strategic Partnerships as the college plans to submit a funding application to finance a project that aims at engaging refugees through art projects.The main long-term benefit of the project is that there will be increased support for EU projects and work placements abroad at the KKBKHA from students, trainees and teaching staff. Our existing network of European contacts will grow and the European dimension will be incorporated in a long-term way into the curricula of the various departments. The EU Project Management Team will profit from increased support from teaching staff in all departments of the college to whom tasks such as the initiation and organisation of new projects can be delegated to support long-term success.", "http://www.edeurope.me", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003158_9"]]}}, "9EH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "\"MOVIEing through art into the future.\"", "The John of Gaunt School", 160468.0, 6, 6, "The project \" MOVIEing through art into the future\" is a partnership encompassing 6 countries: Germany, Italy, Turkey, Portugal, United Kingdom and Martinique. The 537 students involved in this project  are between 11 and 17 years old.\r\nIn order to propagate the media educational work in different areas, film scripts will be worked out and realised in all partner countries. Thus, small movies will be created that introduce regions, cultural institutions and local architecture. The participants will learn how to plan movie projects, to deal with the digital film technology, the editing and sound rendering as well as the public representation. A side effect is the active use and immersion in the English language. There is much room for creative ideas, the participants will learn a lot about institutions and cultural features in their own regions and are given the possibility to compare their region and work with those of their partners.  Participants will recognise connecting similarities and receive impulses to optimize their own organisation and projects. Furthermore the participants will learn about new occupational fields that normally are outside their daily experiences. The results of their short films which encompass the following titles \u201cThe beauty of my territory\u201d, \u201cLeisure time places, culture and own region facilities\u201d, \u201cArt and outstanding  architecture in my area\u201d,will be released via internet where everybody who is interested may watch them. In order to increase cooperation between students and teachers a common short movie is going to be created along the 3 years project with the title  \"The ideal European school\" focusing on the best practice and activities wich students have acquired and performed during project visits , as well as exchange of ppt presentations and through project visits or the dissemination of reports.\r\nWe aim to:\r\nIncrease students' motivation towards school and learning.\r\nIncrease ability to  team work both  in teachers and in students.\r\nImprove knowledge of local  history, geography art  and music.\r\nImprove knowledge of  the same subjects related to  the other European  partner countries.\r\nPresent and compare our respective territories and lifestyles to other European countries.\r\nStrengthen cooperation and links with our respective local institutions (town council, libraries,  local heritage and cultural associations  and students\u2019 families.\r\nEncourage the increase of the local institution investments in alternative teaching methods and activitiees.", "http://www.jogschool.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA201-001291_5"]]}}}}
