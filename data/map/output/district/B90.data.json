Participants will undergo foreign internships as part of their compulsory professional training. Placements will be four weeks long. Accommodation will be provided in host families. Before leaving for an internship, participants will have to pass preparatory lesson that will involve an English course, cultural, workl and organizational preparation. Internships will take place in small and medium enterprises and organizations in administration, business, marketing, IT and multimedia. Depending on the specific placement, participants will work on a PC with office software, work on the Internet and social networks, operate office equipment, deal with business correspondence and phone calls, work with documents, help with archiving, scanning, copying, they will check and sort documents, prepare invoices, they will seek new business partners, create and manage databases, perform inventory, work with accounting documents, attend meetings with business partners, carry out marketing activities, etc. The project will bring results especially in an intangible form. Project\u00b4s participants will receive a certified practice abroad that will bring them new professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Participants will use the acquired knowledge to further studies and subsequent entry into the labour market. The tangible outcomes of the project will include Europass Mobility, certificates from intermediary organizations, ECVET Placement evaluation, photographs, newspaper articles and articles presented on school website. The impact of the project on the sending organization will be an involvement in international cooperation, exchange of experience, improving teaching and building the reputation of the school. The project will build cooperation of our school with new foreign partners and will deepen the cooperation with current partners. The level of professional practice and teaching of English at school will increase. Thanks to the project professional development of project team members and accompanying persons will be supported.

The GELCLAD is produced using a single co-extrusion procedure in which both ecoWPC framing skin and FEA core are simultaneously formed such that no discontinuity is formed between them. Using a multilayer effective continuous extrusion allows the benefits of high quality multi-meso-structured systems and productive production to be obtained without the traditional drawbacks of existing bonding lamination of extremely high embodied energy insulation materials, and high labouring and skilled installation of multi material layers. By combining also this biopolymer based ecoWPC/aerogel with passive pre-programed materials responding dynamically to ambient stimuli and control the air flow, GELCLAD wants to target the market as a novel environmentally friendly multi-functional smart cladding solution, to be used as an ecological alternative to the current cladding and ventilated fa\u00e7ade systems.
