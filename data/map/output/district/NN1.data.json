ALS has an estimated prevalence of 5.40 cases per 100.000 population corresponding at about 40.000 patients at European level. Treatments are modestly effective at best, and the majority of patients die within 3-5 years of diagnosis, often from respiratory failure.\nTUDCA-ALS is based on the results of a successful proof-of-concept trial and has the ambition to develop a novel therapy in patients with ALS, based on administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in addition to riluzole. TUDCA-ALS aims to perform a state-of-art randomized control trial on safety and efficacy of TUDCA in patients with sporadic ALS, without cognitive involvement and to exploit the project results into a novel therapeutic treatment for ALS. The trial primary endpoint is deterioration of function measured with the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised. The secondary endpoints are: (1) Survival time to invasive ventilation (tracheostomy) or death; (2) changes in quality of life parameters measured by the ALSAQ-40 questionnaire; (3) functional changes measured by Forced Vital Capacity, and the EQ-5D scale. Muscle force will be assessed by the MRC scale and a correlated analysis of function and survival will be performed. \nTwo biomarkers will be measured: neurofilament levels in the CSF and serum and MMP-9 expression in serum.

Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.

As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.", 36263.0, 497988.0, 5, 8, "PROSE", null, null, null, "fp7_188908_955842463"]]}}, "4EU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting", "Autism Concern", 314105.0, 5, 9, "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting (ESIPP).\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nAutism is a lifelong condition which affects about 1% of the population (or approximately 7.5m European citizens) as well as those who live with them and care for them. \r\nThe presence of autism can be extremely challenging to parents and other family members, and autism has been identified as causing greater family and parental stress than any other disability. The condition can challenge traditional parenting styles and cause parents to feel deskilled and disempowered.  The presence of autism within the family can negatively affect the educational achievement, employment opportunities and social inclusion of mothers, fathers, siblings and the individuals with autism themselves.\r\nTeaching parents to understand the condition, and to work effectively with schools and other professionals, has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for individuals with autism and their families.
