The theachers meets and concludes the need for teacher training in English language and the acquisition of new methodologies, so they decide to choose a group of them to attend training courses and conducting Job Shadows in order to transmit to other teachers acquired knowledge and to integrate theminto the classroom routine. Final four definitive teachers or with several years in the school are chosen in orden to give continuity to the activity once started. These teachers will be two elementary school teachers, the project coordinator who is also the school secretary and the specialist English teacher.\r\n  The main activities are scheduled in the project are3, a project TwinSpace, training courses and Job Shadowing:\r\nOver the next two years keep direct contact teachers who participate in the mobilities and other teachers of the school with their puplis once a month with the school that will do the Job Shadowing throught TwinSpace.\r\nThe next school year, four teachers will travel to UK to attend a training courses to explore motivational techniques and encouraging students used English as a communication tool help develop English language fluent and colloquial form will help us to use strategies to motivate students in learning that will improve their knowledge and their ability to use English more safely and in a proper manner. As noted above will become the two mobilities in pairs.\r\nIn 2016-17, there wil be the visit of the two teachers at school in London for two weeks, also in pairs, for the Job Shadowing.\r\n  When they return mobility, meet all teachers to transmitting the training acquired and included in the daily work, making the necessary changes that are created in different techniques, activities and methodologies that are performed in the different subjects.\r\n  It will be a multisectoral dissemination as well as publishing both the school website and its Facebook page the activities undertaken, also quarterly meet the president of the Association of Parents of the center as a direct liaison with families school to transmit a series of phrases and simple everyday vocabulary to continue working in the family started in the center.

The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development.
