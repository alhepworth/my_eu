Bazila Ve\u013ek\u00e9ho v Pre\u0161ove, Slovakia and the receiving institution- Coloma Court Care Home. The aim of the project is to support participants in their training and help them with their personal development. Participans are students  in  third grade of vocational school in Slovakia which specializes in health care. After finishing their studies at vocational school students become health care asistants. Students are  taught to care for clients personal care needs in a way which respects their dignity and self respect and contributes to maintaining their independence. We are planning to chose ten trainees for mobility in september 2015 and other 10 students for mobility in june 2016. During their three weeks placement in nursing home in London, students would be able carry out activities as dressing, washing, toileing, feeding, serving food, making and changing beds, monitoring vital signs.\r\nErasmus plus grand would enable students to gain new competences and skills abroad. Spending a period of time in London would encourage foreign language learning and help them to get to know English culture. For most of our students it would be first stay in a foreign country and initial vocational training mobility would improve their self-confidence and social skills.\r\nLooking after people who are suffering from various disease would help students to see what kind of needs person with certain disease have and how his or her quality of life can be improved. We expect that students who undertake placement would return to their home countries with new ideas.", "http://www.hmt-uk.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SK01-KA102-008703_1"]]}}}}
