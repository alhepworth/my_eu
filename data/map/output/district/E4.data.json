It will also prevent prejudices and stereotypes as the participants will be given the opportunity to share their own opinions and experiences. The project seeks to address the above mentioned issues, as well as the following needs:- enhance the visibility of youth organisations from rural areas, as they are lacking the skills and knowledge on how to pitch stories towards media and external partners;- support youth workers and young members in developing their knowledge on how to deliver coherent and solid messages that adhere to the real vision of their organisation- support youth organisations to reach out to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds or areas: they need to have access to this information and to know about the existence of such entities. The \u201cSpeak it Up!\u201d project is designed to help youth workers maximize opportunities to educate the media, gain visibility for their activities and learn how to communicate the vision and mission of their organisations to the external world.In line with this, the objectives of this project are as follows:O1.Increase the skills and capacities of young spokespersons in working with the media and external relations, and thus it increase their chances on the labour market;O2. Raise public awareness about specifics and challenges of youth work in all partner countries;O3. Increase competences of young spokespersons in establishing long-lasting and close relations with the media;O4. Enhance intercultural learning and understanding;O5. Set the basis of an international network of young spokespersons from diverse European countries, which can be further enhanced;O6. Help ensure a consistent message related to youth work, its impact and the issues it is facing is delivered to the media so that it can be used to influence the public opinions and policies on education and youth work. In what concerns the impact on the participants, we expect to see that they will gain and/or improve their knowledge and skills in relation to external communication, public speaking and ethic in media relations (e.g. how to provide unbiased visibility to the activities of your organisation, how to deliver solid and newsworthy messages, how to fight stereotypes related to Scout activities) and how to raise public awareness on the value of youth organisations. The participants will grow as professional youth workers, who are aware of the impact on society their work can have and will be able to exert more self-reflection on their media relations. In what concerns the parnters, the participating organisations will get new experience of management of an international project and long-term cooperation of these organizations will be thus strengthened.

Its value is however increasing as we see young people becoming detached from their natural environment and facing more challenges with the traditional school system. Outdoor centers and non formal educators have a role to play in todays school system. The centers can provide an important connection with nature and a way for kids to reconnect. They can also provide traditional educators with training and tools so that they can better use non formal education to reach there students.The school camps and outdoor centers face a challenge today. They are few and far between which makes them isolated. To be able to  share ideas and grow there program they need to meet. The centers also need a platform to be able to share their knowledge outside there group. This project brings together the two elements. The first half of the project brings together outdoor and non formal educators from 5 different European countries. All the partners have a long history of outdoor education and non formal education but in their own setting. By bringing them together we are able to share knowledge and practices and make all the centers better. The second half of the project also puts a positive pressure on the first half. Because the partners are organizing a seminar for traditional educators from very different backgrounds (schools, play-schools, after school activities, higher education etc.) they have to focus their sharing in such a way that it would be beneficial to an outsider that can have little or no knowledge of outdoor or non formal education. This structures the conversation and makes the partners look at their work from a fresh perspective. The second half of the projects is a two day open seminar in outdoor education and non formal education. It brings together traditional educators and outdoor and non formal educators. The seminar will be a mix of lectures and workshops that will aim to bring outdoor and non formal education closer to the traditional school system. If the project is successful it can be a model for similar events in other European locations. The project will use non formal methods in planing and executing. Participants will take turns in directing workshops in the first and second half of the project. Each partner will sent 2-4 participants that will meat up with 10-12 participants from Iceland. The aim is to have 28 participants from 5 partners. In the second half of the project the participants will host and manage a two day walk in seminar for about 100 educators. The goal is both for the participants to practice their non formal eduction techniques and for the visiting educators to learn about non formal and outdoor education. The impact can be great for such a small project since the partners and participants directly engage with thousands of young people every year, from different backgrounds. But the potential is even greater since the second half of the projects gives the partners the opportunity to reach an even greater audience. With a positive impact on educators from the traditional school system the long term benefits can be great. Non formal education is not just something to use in the non formal setting. It can have positive applications in the traditional system where todays students have increasing difficulties engaging with the subjects.", "http://www.scouts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-IS02-KA105-001664_4"], [2018, "Scout Partnerships", "The Scout Association", 12195.0, 17, 21, "The Scout Partnerships \u201d project is aiming to strengthen international partnerships at European level and to raise the quality in international projects and youth mobilities within scouting.

As the consortium is formed solely of non-formal education providers, the methods used in the seminar programme will be non-formal education methods, such as: audio-visual presentations, workshops, team-tasks, peer to peer learning, case studies,educational games, role-play and others. \r\n\r\nIn what concerns the foreseen results and impact of the project, they comprise of: \r\n-enhancing the knowledge and skills of the project participants (and partner organizations) in the fields of international youth mobilities and partnerships; \r\n-increased interest of Scout organizations in the European Solidarity Corps,  international project management and use of e-learning tools within youth mobility management; \r\n-increased accessibility to international activities for over 1 million young people in Europe  \r\nProviding learning opportunities for the youth workers and introducing them to innovative methods and tools will reflect into:\r\n-an improved educational offer that better responds to the needs of European youth, ensuring their active involvement their community\u2019s development;\r\n-development of important competences and skills related to project management in the field of international projects;\r\n-better recognition of the skills acquired in the mobility experience; \r\n\r\nConsidering the potential long-term benefits, the \u201cScout Partnerships\u201d project hopes to achieve the following:\r\nBetter quality of youth mobility experiences developed by youth organizations in Europe (both scout and non-scout, as the results will be disseminated to a large network of European youth NGOs) supported by dedicated tools such as E-learning modules and dedicated networks (Erascout)\r\nbroader understanding of the partner organisations in relation to youth needs in Europe and a stronger capacity to support the educational development of young people\r\nFaster development of the international dimension in the programmes of the partner organisations due to the structure of the project and direct support offered \r\nimproved educational curricula of the partner organisations that includes youth mobilities as an educational element and better responds to the needs of members and youth workers;\r\nMore international collaboration and partnerships developed between the national level of different Scout organisations with the purpose of mutual support and youth work development.", "http://www.scouts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES02-KA105-011015_3"], [2015, "Umwelt-,  Wirtschafts- und Sprachkompetenz in einem vereinten Europa", "The Scout Association", 12028.0, 5, 5, "The primary background oft he project ist he so-called \u201egreat practical experience\u201c of our school, the HLUW Yspertal (Higher School for Economics and the Environment of the Cistercian mmonastery in Zwettl). This school is unique in Austria regarding its curricular emphasis on economics and environmental issues, leading up to the A-level exams after 5 years of schooling. A further unique aspect, in addition to the curriculum, are voluntary additional qualifications, a tight co-operation with international schools and the local economy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the five years, it is obligatory to do a three-month internship, in which the pupils have to gain practical experience in fields relating to the curriculum: laboratory work, office work, and production work. These internships can be done locally or abroad. In order to give all pupils, also those from financially weaker families, the chance to do their internship abroad, we are trying to get support from the Erasmus+ project. Regarding the partnership with Erasmus+, the HLUW can look back on years of successful co-operation comprising 11 Erasmus+ (and formerly Leaonardo) projects with 38 companies in 11 different countries.\r\n\r\nThis year, there are 11 pupils from our third form are hoping to realise their internships abroad with the help of Erasmus+. Suitable partner companies have been found in Ireland, Great Britain, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. 9 of 11 pupils have already signed learning agreements with the partner companies at this moment of applying for support from Erasmus+ - thus enabling us to ensure a suitable quality of the internships.\r\n\r\nThe project always starts long before the application with informing the parents and pupils in September. After finding suitable partner companies, the framework of conditions is defined together. Yet also during the internship stay, we constantly try to maintainthe quality of the training by adopting parts of the ECVET. After constant supervision by a contact person, a Personal Transcript and a Europass are compiled.\r\nThe aim of the project is, for one, a further improvement of the competences required by our curriculum. Due to the wide scope of our curriculum, the practical emphasis in the various internships will vary, with this year\u2019s activities focussing on office tasks and science and sustainability. By doing the internship abroad, further aspects gain importance: improvement of linguistic competence (this year especially in the first foreign language English), improvement of personal and social competence (due to the need for acting independently abroad and organising a journey and stay without the immediate help of adults, as well as due to experiences with human resources management), increasing knowledge of different approaches to and ways of work and, quality management, and a strengthening of the idea of a common Europe. These diverse aspects are expected to increase the competitiveness and employability of our pupils and thus, indirectly, the competitiveness of Europe as a whole.\r\n\r\nBesides the positive effects on the pupils, the school itself and its partner companies are also expected to profit from the cultural and technical exchange, since international internships are supposed to increase the transfer of knowledge and thereby the quality of the training at our school as well as the competences within the partner companies.

In the increasingly globalised interconnected world, most people come into contact frequently with people of other cultures and from other parts of the world, are affected by events in other countries, have multiple global relationships (at work, in business, socially, through family ties, travel etc.), and will have to negotiate and collaborate across social, cultural, ethnic, racial, political and geographic differences. \r\n\r\nEducation has a crucial role to play in ensuring citizens develop these new capacities, address the challenges and opportunities. However, if educators are to facilitate the development of adults\u2019 global competences, it is essential that they themselves are globally competent, because creating globally competent citizens require globally competent educators.\r\n\r\nThe project activities will be achieved through a number of activities that include intellectual outputs, joint staff training, and blended training.

Following Agenda 21, Kyoto Agreement, COP 21, The MDGs and now (SDGs) countries have been working towards \u201csustainable development\u201d, defined as \u2018development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u2019 (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, p. 43). Sustainable development efforts are now focused on achieving the 17 SDGs, and most countries have a sustainable development strategy, which stresses the important role of education in achieving the goals. \r\n\r\nEducation is seen as having a key role to play in achieving the SDGs, not only in terms of informing and encouraging engagement with SD, but crucially, in acquiring the skills and competence to act and bring about the required changes in the social, economic and environmental domains of sustainable development.\r\n\r\nThe need for ESD is exemplified by the fact that all EU member states have the equivalent of a sustainable development strategy, and ESD now forms part of the school curriculum in compulsory and in some higher and further education institutions. \r\n\r\nGlobal Citizenship (GC) and sustainable development are inextricably linked, as their overarching objective is similar in trying to build a better, more sustainable and just world. GS is about understanding that local actions can have impact around the world. The world faces challenges that require global solutions. These interconnected challenges call for far reaching solutions and changes in how we think and act in the wider interest of humanity. In this context education for global citizenship (EGC) aims to equip people for critical and active engagement with the challenges and opportunities of life in a fast-changing and interdependent world. It is transformative, developing the knowledge and understanding, skills, values and attitudes to participate fully in a globalised society and economy, and to secure a more just, secure and sustainable world than the one they have inherited.\r\n\r\nThis project promotes ESD and GC in adult education by improving the capacity of organisation to deliver high-quality ESD and GC.

They were motivated to participate in international activities as they saw Erasmus + offered opportunities for them to address some of the training needs that had been identified in their organisations and other priorities, going forward.\r\n\r\nThe project is being carried out to help meet the strategic and professional development needs of the organisations with similar aspirations and common need to develop an international dimension to the organisations, and empowering staff to improve the overall quality of the training and services they provide to learners. \r\n\r\nThe consortium members between them provide a combination of adult basic and functional skills including, Literacy, Numeracy, ICT, Media, ESOL, Health & Social Care, Personal finance/Financial Literacy Employability Skills training, information advice and guidance, targeting socially excluded and disadvantaged adult learners, but there is a gap and lack of capacity in delivering some of the core competences for lifelong learning that they want to fill. They would also like to help adults develop other core competences of social and civic competence, cultural awareness and expression, learning to learn and sense of initiative and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe main activity is structured training for a total of 17 participants to undertake training in 6 broad areas:\r\n\u2022 Organisational leadership and project management\r\n\u2022 Strategies, tools and methods of non formal education\r\n\u2022 Digital tools and learning technologies\r\n\u2022 Special educational needs\r\n\u2022 Key Competences for lifelong learning\r\n.

The consortium members want to give their organisations an international outlook, and provide staff with opportunities to acquire the competences needed for the further development of the organisation and own professional needs, thereby providing organisational capacity, and improving the quality of teaching and learning within their organisations.Within this broad aim the project will achieve the following concrete objectives:1. Improve the competences of managers in policy formulation and implementation 2. Empower individual consortium member organisations to support dyslexic and dyscalculic learners by equipping staff to use relevant tools, teaching strategies and materials.3. Develop the skills and ability of staff so they are able to engage and motivate learners to embrace digital learning including social media in learning, and their daily lives.4. Equip staff with the skills to embed the global dimension and reflect intercultural issues in teaching and learning,5. Improve Intercultural awareness among participants In order to meet the identified needs, is proposed to send 6 managers and 9 teaching staff on structured training to enable them to acquire the required competences.            A senior manager from member organisations will attend  training  on internationalisation, to enable them to lead on the development of an international strategy and lead on bringing about the international outlook within their organisations. Teaching staff will undertake training to meet identified professional needs, and to support the implementation of the international strategy. The main needs are to (a) provide improved support for adult learners, especially those with special needs (dyslexia and dyscalculia),  (b) motivate and encourage learners to engage with digital learning (c) reflect the global dimension the curriculum, and (d) improve the intercultural competence of staff.The training will result in participants developing knowledge, skills, attitudinal and behavioural changes to further the development of their organisation and their own professional careers. Managers will learn about organisational change and the competence strategies for internationalizing their organisations.  They will be able to formulate, implement and monitor the international strategy, and gain an insight into international issues and intercultural competence in the context of internationalisation and their roles in learning.Staff (teaching & support) will have improved knowledge and understanding of global issues, cross cultural issues, pedagogical skills and the ability to use a range of tools to better support learners and boost their achievement. They will develop the ability to devise and implement attractive learning programmes to motivate adult learners to embrace digital technology. They will be more confident, skilled, with broadened horizons, and likely to engage in transnational activities, and become multipliers and champions for promoting the EU agenda.The culture of the participating organisations will change, becoming more global and intercultural. The organisations will participate in other strands within Erasmus plus and other European programmes. The globalism and interculturalism reflected in the organisations will resonate well with learners, since they are very culturally diverse. A more welcoming learning environment with which they readily identify, and an enjoyable learning experience will motivate them and others, to engage with learning and improve their performance and achievement.", "http://www.global-learning-skills-partnership.org", "Global Learning & Skills Partnership", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA104-023430_coordinator"]]}}}}
