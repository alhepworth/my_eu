In the Strategic plan of the school for the year 2014-2016 is noted that it is foreseen to reconstruct infrastructure of art and computer departments at school in order to improve teaching quality and to increase its attractiveness. Therefore ICT teachers need to acquire new skills and knowledge related to the newest and modern computer equipment, tools and programs applied in European vocational schools and companies and to search for new ways of adapting them to Lithuanian vocational training institutions in order to ensure successful integration of students into labor market. \r\nIn addition to labor market conditions and high professional qualification requirements, employers are looking for workers who would be able to adapt, integrate and change together with alteration in society. Much attention is paid to the knowledge of foreign language and personal characteristics such as responsibility, independence, sociability, creativity, ability to work in team. Lifelong learning increases human capital, therefore schools have to encourage their students to participate in training and development regardless of age because of rapid changing working environment. Vocational schools in Lithuania try to improve the quality of training, but its quality lags behind the EU in terms of ICT training. In addition, vocational schools in Lithuania do not have such advanced IC technologies, which are being used in EU countries' vocational schools and enterprises.
