The risk to workers is significantly higher in the construction and transportation sectors.\n\nBIM captures all digital data relevant to a building or piece of infrastructure over its lifetime. The use of BIM is becoming mandatory for public procurement projects in Europe and will generate a wealth of digital data. This presents a major opportunity for disruptive business ideas and we have identified the possibility to repurpose this data so that we can provide interactive and context-relevant S&H training via 3D applications.\n\nWe, Severn Partnership, want to carry out a feasibility study around our concept for repurposing data from BIM. We will develop an application to deliver S&H training to railway workers. It will employ pedagogic strategies in a games environment to demonstrate enhanced learning. We will test it in a classroom environment with real learners and benchmark it against current methods of teaching (presentations, course notes, Q&A). \n\nThe feasibility study will explore the market landscape across different sectors utilising BIM, especially within construction and transportation.

The project positions itself at the pre-competitive intersection of optical fibre sensing and integrated optics. It aims at developing a flexible and stretchable foil in which all necessary optical sensing elements can be integrated; that if relevant to the application can include optical and electrical powering as well as onboard signal processing and wireless communications; that can be wrapped around irregularly shaped objects; that will allow quasi-distributed sensing. To do so the sensing elements in PHOSFOS will rely on special highly birefringent micro-structured optical fibres (MSF) and polymer optical fibres (POF) with fibre Bragg gratings. The silica fibres will be designed to exhibit almost zero temperature sensitivity whereas POF fibres will be used for their very specific property that their length can be stretched up to 300 % before breaking. The optimal Bragg grating writing technology in these fibres, both silica and POF, will be developed. PHOSFOS will focus on embedding these into the sensing skin and on the optical coupling/interfacing to the peripheral opto-electronics and electronics.

If Europe\u2019s cities are to adapt, grow and meet their citizen\u2019s needs then science must be at the forefront. Over 67% of the European population live in cities. Enabling those cities to deliver services effectively, efficiently, and sustainably while keeping their citizens safe, healthy, prosperous, and well-informed is amongst the most important challenges in this century. Improving the attractiveness of cities is targeted by the Lisbon Strategy and the EU's strategic guidelines for cohesion policy (Integrated Sustainable Urban Development) for 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nWithout a strong scientific base Europe will not meet its Europe2020 goals of smart and sustainable growth. This includes more research and innovation to overcome challenges faced by issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss and increasing urbanisation. Unless young people choose to study science, then it is highly unlikely that the scientific expertise will be developed to fill the jobs needed to solve major EU wide problems created by climate change and urbanisation, and create new jobs in the green economy (as identified in Skills for Green Jobs \u2013 CEDEFOP 2010). There is a clear need to motivate more pupils to study science and be ready to tackle the challenges of an urban Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Urban Science Project aims to meet the needs of an urban Europe, where scientists of the future have the skills and knowledge to create healthy and sustainable cities. Urban Science will focus on how science can develop solutions to urban issues, so motivating pupils to view the positive benefits of science to the urban environment. It will support teachers with exciting and innovative ways to teach science that has real life meaning for their pupils. It also aims to meet the needs of pupils to be competitive in a rapidly changing world where scientific understanding is vital. Partners will promote a hands-on inquiry based approach to science that engages learners in everyday issues that have relevance and meaning for them. We will use the urban environment as \u2018living laboratories\u2019 in which pupils explore how science can help create healthier places to live and work. \r\n\r\nThe potential impact is large. There is very little science specifically targeted at addressing urban issues, and research by the partners suggests there is a big demand for outdoor science activities. During the project we expect to reach 150 secondary schools and 3125 pupils. Through training activities we will reach 300 teachers. We expect to reach greater numbers after completion of the project through our exploitation and dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of Urban Science will be \u2018to improve the teaching of scientific inquiry and investigation so that pupils develop the competencies to actively contribute to creating healthy cities, gain scientific skills for employment, and are more motivated to study science.\u2019 We will achieve this through linked specific objectives:\r\n\u2022 Review the needs of science based businesses to identify the science skills and competencies needed for healthy cities and the low carbon economy.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the support available for teachers to increase their professional competence in teaching science in the urban environment using inquiry and investigation.\r\n\u2022 Develop formative assessment models that assess science competencies rather than knowledge.\r\n\u2022 Provide learning modules for teachers to deliver science in the urban environment.\r\n\u2022 Science that develops the competencies of pupils to be confident learners, creative thinkers and adept at solving problems.\r\n\u2022 Increase the motivation of pupils to study science and connect science with careers in a low carbon economy. \r\n\r\nUrban Science will be solutions based. There are science programmes that teach investigation skills. However, we want pupils to explore solutions to urban issues not just the issue itself. This puts a greater emphasis on creative thinking and problem solving skills, and ensures that the science pupils learn is seen to be practically applied. A solutions based approach also enables us to put curricula topics into a meaningful context. For example, a scientific understanding of ant behaviour and how they regulate flow in and out of their nest can be applied to urban traffic to reduce congestion, pollution and journey times. Understanding the chemistry of photosynthesis can be applied to develop systems to grow an alga that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and produce bio fuels for cars.
