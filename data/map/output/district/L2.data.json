How to support civil courage within your youth projects, Tulln July 2016 supported by the European Youth foundation)These trainings were based on the individual possibilities how to react in a situation where civil courage is needed. The success of the previous courses and the political issues all over Europe showed the urgent need for civil courage.  As a next step we would like to work on how youth organizations can run campaigns on the subject of civil courage as the external trainers and the participants found that this was a missing element for which we did not find the space in the already held trainings. Youth organisations and civil society can play a very powerful and important role in society. Our training courses in 2015 showed that the concept of civil courage is very new to most of the youth organisations and still not known everywhere. Some languages even lack a word for it. The need for this training course is very much connected with the \u201ccivil and courageous\u201d values and attitudes that young people and youth worker in organizations carry. For this reason, we will focus on participants learning process touching important elements as integrity, participation, critical thinking, self-esteem, dialogue in order to empower them to start campaigns according to their countries and working realities. Furthermore we would like to use the chance to create a Manual on Civil courage methodologies to allow also other organisations to use the methods developed and explored during the 3 civil courage trainings and to spread it.Civil courage essentially describes two things: a person\u2019s courage to speak out in the public sphere, and readiness to stand up and help their fellow citizens in time of need. Ones ability to judge and act upon civil courage comes when one clearly senses injustice. Sometimes just the use of the word \"civil courage\" can have a liberating effect on someone with a sense for it.But not only individuals can speak out, also organisations can raise their voices and change injustice in their environment through different channels. Campaigning can be one of them and we would like to explore the possibilities together with all involved partner organisations. We intend to organize a 5-day training course on how to plan and implement civil courage campaigns within each organisations context. The training is aimed for youth workers or active members of the participating organizations.Aims and Objectives\uf0b5 To promote and teach civil courage within youth organisations and give youth workers tools to implement them \uf0b5 To share methods on how to encourage youth workers and members of youth organizations to stand up for their own beliefs\uf0b5 To experiment with different methods of campaigning (facebook, flashmob, action day, dance in public,\u2026.)\uf0b5 To sensitize  on situations where civil courage is needed \uf0b5 To give youth workers within their organisations methods on how to design civil courage campaigns through their members and participants\uf0b5 To give participants and youth organisations involved in international voluntary projects or other youth projects tools to stand up against racism and unequality \uf0b5 to get inspired by practical examples and organisations working in Vienna Grenzenlos has an inclusion focus within all our programs.

The starting point will be the International Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000).\r\nThe main theme of the project is that of the \"Human Rights\" and \"Hospitality\" in reference to what, in the last few months, Europe is experiencing in terms of relationship with the processes of migration and terrorism. The main reasons why we intend to realize this project are: a) the request by the same young people who participate in the activities to reflect on the phenomenon of migration, peace and hospitality; b) understand how these issues can be transmitted through the use of different media communication; c) build their own message through the use of video, photos, artistic productions.\r\nThe general aims of the project are summarized below:\r\na) promote knowledge of human rights, starting with the International Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000);\r\nb) promote the exchange of ideas among young people, of different positions and motivations;\r\nc) to conduct a common experience of study and experimentation to make sure that the young participants acquire tools and skills to get together to delineate hypothesis of solutions;\r\nd) facilitate the meeting of different cultures and raise awareness of the participants to the theme of diversity, peace, migration and hospitality, and the need to plan for the future valorising the encounter with the other as opportunities for learning and growth common.\r\nThe project has the following specific aims:\r\na) use the media and the instrumentation available today (video camera, photography, software, collage) to socialize their ideas and be able to communicate to a wide audience;\r\nb) create multimedia productions on the theme of hospitality and cultural diversity by the use of videos, photos, posters, drawings, phrases, to be shared through existing platforms on the internet (youtube, facebook, twitter, the partner organization network, etc.);\r\nc) present the productions in a final exhibition at the end of the project and events planned in the partner countries' territories.\r\nThe project will take place in Vallefiorita in Calabria (Italy) and will last 10 days. It will involve 25 young people between 18 and 25 years. The project fits into a path that, consistent with the EU's objectives and with the direct participation of young people, could also involve other target groups (young students, municipalities interested in the use and dissemination of the concept of hospitality and sharing with the other).\r\nIn the laboratories and workshops of young people will develop their communication proposals on the culture, peace and promotion of diversity. Regarding the techniques and tools of communication young people, accompanied by experts of communications and media, will use techniques and tools for phototypesetting and photomontage, techniques and tools for producing multimedia products and video (eg mash -up and vlogger), the graphic composition and artistic techniques such as collage, decoupage, decollage, papiers colles, tape art, paper mache.\r\nThe non-formal and informal learning is the basis of the planned activity in youth exchanges. In the laboratories will apply a variety of different methods, such as exercises, simulations, role play, these elements will be accompanied by team building exercises and assessment methods. The relationship that is established within the learning environments will be interactive: the \"learning by doing\". \"Peer education\", \u201ccooperative learning\u201d and the \"mentoring\" are some of the methods employed in the non-formal learning process.\r\nThe project is part of a long-term perspective, and planned in order to achieve a multiplying effect and sustainable impact.

One youth worker from the Youth center Trbovlje (MCT) will visit the organization Associazione Teatro Giovani Teatro Pirata  for one week, observe and explore their methods of theatre. ATGTP operates in the field of social theatre by working with disadvantaged target groups: disabled people, people with mental health problems, refugees, victims of violence, etc. ATGTP involves these people in laboratories and workshops to build personal development processes and/or rehabilitation and social reintroduction paths.

Far-right parties argue that this is just a sign that the \"common sense\" is prevailing. No one disputes that great changes are taking place in cities and districts in Europe today.\r\nThe slow growth in Europe and high unemployment rate, are creating huge tensions in society.\r\nIn recent years, migration flows inside the European Union and from  third country have increased significantly rising uncertainty and instability in many communities already beleaguered by the economic crisis.\r\nThe combination of these two phenomena has exacerbated situations of intolerance and conflict in European society.\r\nIn particular young people constantly undergo a flow of information in the traditional media, but especially social media depicting danger and scaremongering against foreigners.\r\nPromoting human rights and equality among young people is critical if we want to achieve an open, tolerant and equal society.
