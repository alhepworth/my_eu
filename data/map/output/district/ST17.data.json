They are students who are in the initial stage of  vocational education at the age of  17-19 and who are trained to achieve economic profession. The aim of this project  is to gain new vocational skills by students.  During the training practice students get to know  the organizational structure of commercial enterprise and  modern accounting  programmes in a small firm.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we would like  our students to confront the Polish system of  vocational education with the English one and broaden the knowledge of   job market and enterprise and also to improve their  foreign   language competences. Taking  part in this project gives them a chance to get to know the economic  conditions of the partnership country and also increases their abilities to cope and exist in new, unknown surroundings. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial preparatory course organized by PZSE named  E.Kwiatkowski in Sandomierz, we plan to send  three groups of students, 16 students in each group with two   guardian teachers  for a three-week  vocational training practice in Great Britain. The training practice will consist of two modules ; training in accounting companies and also the course of the British accounting, where the objective is to operate financial and accounting programmes in a small company.  \r\n\r\nThe basic purpose of the training practice is to check their practical knowledge and skills gained during their education at school , in vocational lessons and to get to know the environment of vocational economist , the work environment in another country and willingness to cooperate in the future, support the abilities to adapt and make students sensitive and aware of mental and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThe  additional purpose , still of great importance, coming from the fact that this  training  practice will take place in Great Britain, there will be comparison of introduction and doing expenses of small companies by  accounting offices,  which will be visited by our students.  The aim of this practice is to see  the differences between the Polish and English accountancy connected with  specific documents.  The Beneficiaries will be able to  draw conclusions about  companies  functioning in Poland and  in Great Britain.  Another aim is to get to know vocational vocabulary.

Participants of the training practice , thanks to these gained skills, will be valuable workers in the field of accountancy.  On the basis of our local employer analysis , we can say that the key  competences which are  required from future  workers  are:\r\n\r\n-having  high practical knowledge in operating financial and accounting programmes\r\n\r\n-having vocational practice  in a company using financial and accounting  programmes\r\n\r\n-being fluent in at least one foreign language ; general  language and vocational  language knowledge\r\n\r\nStudents who graduate school , we can regard them as not suitable on the job market. It is connected with little work experience of young workers coming into  the job market and lack of funds  for  vocational  education and creating and setting up their own business. Employers  demand vocational experience  in the field of accountancy , therefore, it is significant to reinforce practical education  during  school education and make  use of the European funds  dedicated  to lifelong education. That is why, a good solution is to take part in  the project of Erazmus  plus.

We want to change that. Participants internship with established experience will certainly be valued and sought after employees in their industries. In the opinion of our local employers ( employers conducted interviews with industry economic , mechanical and IT industry ) perfect employee should be characterized not only diligence , honesty and integrity , but also to high professional qualifications, experience acquired during the apprenticeship and become at least one foreign language , because a large portion of traders executes orders outside the country. Hence the idea of creating a project in cooperation with our regional entrepreneurs. Youth ending school education can be classified as disadvantaged groups in the labor market. This involves little professional experience of young workers entering the labor market and the lack of funds for training courses. Employers require in fact presentation experience in the industry. This implies a need to strengthen practical training at school and the use of EU funds for educational activities throughout their lives. In this situation, a very good way is to participate in the Leonardo da Vinci program. The student gains an additional prestige here, what is its positive value and increases the chance of getting a graduate job, because a greater degree meets the expectation of a potential employer.He or she also gets many other possibilities, such as - the European dimension of their education , training in the use of foreign language professional language, Europass Mobility Certificate.

The DeICE-UT project will apply these 2 technologies in combination to wind turbine blade applications, where the synergistic effects of the 2 technologies both prevent ice accumulation and remove already formed ice. To achieve high ultrasound powers within the required regions of the blade, guided wave US technologies will be utilized. By doing this, DeICE-UT will provide a solution that will enable the safe and reliable operation of wind turbines in adverse weather conditions and achieve the following benefits:\n\u2022 Significant reduction of downtime for ice-prone sites across the EU leading to increased efficiency and reliability of the wind turbines and increased income for wind turbine operators.\n\u2022 Significantly reduced maintenance and increased component lifespan, leading to reduced maintenance costs for wind turbine operators.\n\u2022 Significant reduction of energy to operate system \u2013 2% of turbine power output for DeICE-UT compared to >12% for other systems.\n\u2022 Significant increases in the number of wind turbines located in extreme climatic regions and reduced residential complaints.\n\u2022 Significantly reduce the danger of accidents resulting from ice thrown from the blades.\nThe SME consortium target a significant penetration of the EU market within a 5 year period, achieving sales of ~ \u20ac71.5 million and creating ~475 jobs.
