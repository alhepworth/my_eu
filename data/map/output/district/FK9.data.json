This ratchet-like property of human culture appears absent in nonhuman species, as socially transmitted behaviours in animal populations are generally no more complex than those that can be acquired by trial and error. Scientists from a wide range of disciplines have offered high-profile speculative theories about the underlying differences that might be responsible for this striking evolutionary discontinuity, but adequate empirical evidence is still lacking. In the RATCHETCOG project, Dr Caldwell and her team will, for the first time, implement a comprehensive systematic investigation into cumulative cultural evolution, using an experimental method that offers sufficient flexibility to generate valid comparisons across three critical research domains: species differences across the primate family tree; age differences over human development; and learning condition differences in groups of adult human participants. The methods devised for the project will make it possible to both measure and manipulate the complexity of the behaviours learned, thus offering a tool for analysing the extent of ratcheting under different conditions and across different populations. Each of the three research strands provides a vital source of evidence. Studies of nonhuman primates will reveal the limits on learning in these species, and studies with children will provide key opportunities to determine which cognitive abilities predict the development of capacities for cumulative culture. Finally, comparing different learning conditions in groups of adults is critical, as these experiments will allow clear causal conclusions regarding prerequisites and constraints, in relation to task complexity.

It is now a serious public health crisis of international concern. The numbers of cases are still increasing 11 months after the first case was described (December 2013): by mid-November 2014 approximately 15000 individuals have been infected and the epidemic is still not under control. The direct effects of this outbreak include disruption of standard medical care, insecurity and social disruption in countries that were already struggling to recover from decades of war. One of the most important key actions to limit and stop the spread of this deadly disease is to identify and isolate the EBOV-infected patients. The diagnosis of Ebola Virus infections has in the past, been performed overwhelmingly in specialist reference laboratories with high-performance molecular, serological and culture methods. In recent years many of these functions have been mobilised into rapid response mobile laboratories. Indeed several of these units supported by European, CDC/USA, Canadian, Chinese and African states have been set up to help the current outbreak by performing laboratory diagnosis, in collaboration with national centres in West Africa. While this type of response has been effective in helping control past EVD outbreaks in rural parts of Africa, it has not been as effective at controlling the current outbreak, which is now spreading in densely populated city and slum areas. Unfortunately, the diagnostic procedures currently used in the mobile laboratories are associated with several problems: i) there are a limited number of diagnostic hubs, ii) performing the diagnostic tests correctly requires specialist training, skill and experience, consequently there a limited numbers of trained staff, iii) the distance between the point of care and diagnostic hubs means that patients cannot be rapidly isolated and thus spread the virus and iv) there are serious biosafety aspects of handling and transporting hazard group 4 infectious samples from hospitals/emergency medical units to the diagnostic hubs. \nThe EbolaMoDRAD project plans to investigate and focus our activities on developing robust, sensitive and rapid diagnostic tools that can be used at the point of care for field investigation. The complexity of the technical issues to be addressed requires a broad and multidisciplinary network of experts. EbolaMoDRAD will build existing leading-edge expertise in Europe and Africa, and bring these together with new networks of scientists who will work towards solving important public health issues concerning EVD that cannot be resolved by individual groups. \nThe overall aim of EbolaMoDRAD is to develop and deliver rapid bedside diagnostic tool(s) that will significantly increase our capacity to handle the current situation of EVD in West Africa and also future outbreaks, within a 24 month period. \nThe project will be a multidisciplinary research consortium drawn from key European and African research organisations, thus consolidating previous tools and knowledge. EbolaMoDRAD will also put in place a strong capacity building programme in West Africa and hands-on training in non-endemic countries (neighbouring to endemic areas) in the fields of outbreak management, diagnostics and application of EbolaMoDRAD tools/results. EbolaMoDRAD will disseminate widely all results as they become available notably to public health bodies, NGOs, outbreak management teams and local hospitals in West Africa via a strong outreach programme.

Traditionally, Flavobacterium infections have been treated with antibiotics, but this is an emotive issue because of the perceived problems associated with tissue residues and the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Indeed the high susceptibility of Flavobacterium for the antibiotics commonly used in EU fish farms has been recorded. Alternative methods of disease control are needed for which the use of bacteria as probiotics and/or water treatments is gaining attention. Thus, the role of the beneficial bacteria is to exclude pathogens and promote the good indigenous microbial flora in fish. The aim of this research is to optimize protective bacteria which work as biological control agents against Flavobacterium infections. The research will focus on three bacterial cultures which have been highlighted in preliminary in vitro and in vivo work by the researcher, to determine their mode of action for disease control in salmonid culture. As Flavobacterium usually affects the host through external surfaces, it is proposed to study how the beneficial bacteria exclude the pathogen from these surfaces.

With declining fisheries, farmed fish constitute an increasing proportion of the fish in the food basket. n-3 HUFA in farmed fish has been obtained using fish oils (FO), derived from feed grade marine fisheries, in the feeds. This practice is not sustainable, and will constrain growth of aquaculture and will further pressurise these dwindling stocks. In this scenario, sustainable alternatives to FO are urgently required, with vegetable oils (VO) the prime candidates. However, VO are rich in short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) but devoid of the n-3 HUFA abundant in FO. As with all vertebrates, PUFA are essential in the diet of fish, but requirements vary with species. Generally, in marine fish, the dietary requirement is for HUFA, rather than shorter chain PUFA found in VO. Feeding marine fish on VO can reduce health condition, and also lower the n-3 HUFA content of the flesh compromising their nutritional value to the human consumer. HUFA can be biosynthesised from short-chain PUFA in reactions catalysed by fatty acid desaturase enzymes. Evidence suggests that the dependence of marine fish on dietary HUFA is caused by deficiency in the activity of one or more of the key fatty acid desaturase enzyme needed for its synthesis. The objective of this project is to study these enzymes in cobia Rachycentron canadum, a marine fish with a huge growth rate when fed on FO. This growth rate and the production of healthy fish cannot be maintained when fed VO diets and so, as a first step to understanding the mechanisms underpinning the effects of VO feeding, we plan to clone and characterise the fatty acid desaturase enzymes in cobia.

However, growth of fish on VO results in lower levels of n-3HUFA in their flesh, compromising their nutritional value to the human consumer. There is therefore a pressing need to identify strains of fish with reduced requirements for pre-formed dietary n-3HUFA. The intestine is the gateway of nutrients into the body and the enterocyte intracellular metabolic activity is much more important than initially thought. However, very little information exists on how the physiological functions of the intestine are affected by different dietary lipids. Additionally, the inclusion of VO in the diet of carnivorous fish commonly results in histological changes in the intestine. Identification of the genes and pathways involved in PUFA metabolism in salmon intestinal tissue is of direct relevance to these problems. This project will address this issue by the identification of salmon genes and metabolic pathways in intestinal tissue influencing traits that are important in terms of sustainability of farm production and nutritional quality for the consumer. The project will apply cutting edge molecular techniques for the analyses of fish transcriptomes (microarrays) and proteomes (proteomics), to determine differential expression patterns in intestine of salmon fed FO and VO and how they may be affected by genotype (fatty or lean families).

To date, two means are available 1) preventing fish escaping by improving cage design and containment or 2) produce sterile fish. Although considerable technological advances have been made in the design of cage systems, no system will be fully reliable as escapees through natural disasters are inevitable. Therefore, there is a clear need to revive the previously abandoned triploid concept as the only means, known to date, to address the environmental impact of escapees contributing to genetic pollution. Furthermore, the production of sterile fish would be very beneficial to salmon breeders as a way to protect their domesticated stocks which are the result of long and costly selection processes aiming to improve important traits such as disease resistance, growth performance and flesh quality. Triploidy would also alleviate early maturation problems and subsequent welfare associated infringements and decreased quality standards.

Trans-European organisations have identified the need for a common set of core modules  to inform professional development. Safeguarding presents challenges to all child support agencies where there are concerns regarding child welfare and these challenges require a co-ordinated response.\r\n \r\nObjectives\r\nThe project aims to create a suite of core child protection modules for social work child protection training in South East Europe.  The creation of complementary child protection training within partner institutions will provide a template for future transnational collaborations and improved cross border collaboration. Such a joint enterprise will enhance the quality and relevance of the learning in social work education and increase the capacity and professionalism of a skilled workforce to address the challenges of child protection and welfare in a globalised world via improved competency and knowledge base of social workers.\r\n \r\nThe identified modules include:\r\n- Practice / skills base / risk assessment (including online e-learning skills scenarios)   \r\n- Effective practice / evidence base / monitoring skills\r\n- Collaborative working / multi-agency approaches (including co-production with children and families)\r\n- Working with hard to reach children / families \r\n- Transnational social work (include issues of poverty and / or culture) \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe project group comprises eight universities with specialised areas of skill and expertise.

REPLAY-VET aims to provide the disadvantaged and low- skilled people with targeted opportunities to acquire the VET skills to cover these replacement vacancies. Our project will do this specifically through utilizing the many job opportunities in Europe resulting from replacement demand. Through prior identification of future vacancies tailored to real labour market needs, our project will provide enhanced VET opportunities for people furthest from employment, including an innovative new strategy to identify those low- skilled positions in critical sectors that will have the greatest impact in the future and best practice strategies aimed at strengthening the key competencies of low- skilled people.REPLAY-VET is designed to achieve cooperation for innovation through the exchange of research and development of new forecasting approaches on replacement demand and mixed methodological approaches and the development of innovative new tools and strategies in education and training (mainly VET) for upskilling low qualified people.The project is seeking to benefit its audience through both better practice and better policymaking.

Planning the formation of mixed working groups, we ensure that all our primary pupils (6-12 years) can benefit from using ICT with our European partners (highly motivating our pupils). Mixed groups mean: pupils of 1st to 6th form, migrants and non-foreigners, handicapped and non-deprived, each on their own level, contributing their part to the whole work. Disadvantaged pupils are included and this help all children to be happy, proud and confident about the work done together with the European partner groups. English is the project language, and even our young pupils realise that learning a foreign language helps coming into contact and to work with each other, thus may establish a long-lasting motivation for learning. Our choice of presentation products are very adequate for this age-group.\r\nThree pupil exchanges are planned. During these exchanges our young learners will use their knowledge of English to communicate, to learn about their partners\u2019 school and family life and the culture of the country in more detail, imparting this information to their peers at home at the Erasmus+ assemblies.\r\nProfiles\r\nWe four partners are all specialists in different areas and will benefit from each other: \r\nFinland gives all technical support for the website, creating the logo, the blogs, the video script and the QR-codes. \r\nScotland introduces the creation of 3-D-books to the partners, cares for the questionnaire and its evaluation. \r\nPoland helps Finland with the QR-codes and as a newcomer gets all necessary support and benefits from the experiences.\r\nGermany, as the overall co-ordinator, creates the Prezi and the song, advises the foreign colleagues in making a Lapbook, using eTwinning. \r\nProject steps\r\n1st year:\r\nDuring the first year children get in contact with each other and realise the importance of English knowledge (most of them will have started to learn this language by then) by introducing themselves, their families and school life. The project song will help the pupils to identify with the project and its aims and will be sung on each Erasmus+ assembly and meeting.\r\nThe blogs, eTwinning, and the Erasmus+ corner in each school will be established.  Through the website, videos, Lapbooks and Prezi, all partners will present their school, town, country etc. to each other. Introducing themselves, our young learners will describe their childhood and their current social life and they will see the similarities as well as the differences between the countries. They will enlarge their knowledge about their own neighborhood and at the same time learn about cultural similarities in order to decrease prejudices and to develop tolerance.\r\n2nd year: \r\nDuring the 2nd year pupils will understand the evolution of a unified Europe: Learning details about their grandparents' childhood experiences by interviewing senior citizens, reading books, visiting museums and other informative locations which deal with that period (1940\u201360), they will be able to realise the importance of talking together \u2013 not only after the period of the 2nd World War and Cold War but also today. Enemies became friends and built up relationships, and, in addition, the foundation of the EU was started. This has made it easier to study and work in European countries. Dealing with these historic matters our children will be able to compare their actual life with the childhood of their grandparents in the 1940-1960s. They will imagine the situation after the War and the Cold War in Europe and on the other hand they will discover the importance of getting in contact with each other, talking together and forming friendships.  In former times this led to the foundation of the European Union-a future of cooperation and friendship among its members.\r\nThe 3-D-books will be created by pupils to present their stories of childhood and family life after the 2nd World-War.                     \r\n3rd year:\r\nDuring the 3rd year pupils will imagine their own future in Europe. Keeping in mind that communication and not hostility is the main element between the EU-countries, our young learners will create their vision (art and handcraft) of their children's future and share ideas. \r\nA town guide and plates at places of interest will not only provide information for the subsequent pupils but also for townsfolk and other interested visitors. As travelling around is easy nowadays, it is necessary to create guides which are suitable for children too; these do not yet exist.\r\nOn the last exchange in May 2018 we will celebrate a common Europe Party; after that, the ceramic doves with wishes for peace will remain in each partner school.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013523_2"], [2014, "Improvement of staff concerning language awareness, knowledge of different school systems and methodology", "Cornton Primary School", 21397.0, 4, 4, "During the 2-years-period we will send 5 teachers for a teacher-training-course to the United Kingdom and 6 members of our school to a job-shadowing-measure to one of our partner schools in Finland, Scotland, France and Italy. \r\n\r\nThe aims of these teacher-training-courses are to improve the quality of teaching English in our school with our young learners (6-10) and increase their motivation to speak a foreign language.
