They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_162"]]}}, "0PW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "\u00d8kt motivasjon og l\u00e6ringsutbytte for alle elevene p\u00e5 Riska ungdomsskole gjennom kollektiv kompetanseheving for l\u00e6rerne innen realfag, pedagogisk bruk av iPad, Lesson Study og god vurderingspraksis.", "Balfron High School", 20148.0, 4, 10, "Riska Ungdomsskole is a secondary school located at Riska in the municipality of Sandnes, Norway.

The local school authorities have through several years focused on developing sustainable schools, offering adequate education for every learner, regardless of their own socio-economic background and special needs. Preparing learners to help them succeed in completing secondary school is a paramount object in Norway, like in the rest of Europe. Late 2015 our school fulfilled our participation in a national initiated project aiming to make the lower secondary school more varied, challenging, practical and relevant for the learners. All this to motivate the learners and to make them believe in their own abilities to complete Secondary school. Riska Ungdomsskole initiated a strategy containing four main objectives to pursue this work and to increase the learning outcome for all of our students. Our school implemented iPads for all students and staff late 2015 to develop the student\u2019s technological abilities and to educate our students in internet security, internet ethics and internet safety. Managing technology is crucial in a world being more and more digitalized. A second objective was to increase the student motivation and the production of student works. The technology opened for new ways for students to share their work and efficient ways to assess student work. Early 2016 the school started using Lesson Study as a model of teacher collaboration and professional development. The objective was also to learn more about the student response to the teaching they were offered. Our strategy also contains a revitalization of our work related to assessment for learning. We aim to update our staff on several aspects concerning assessment for learning, but put the most effort into how to involve students in the assessment of their own products. National education authorities have challenged schools in Sandnes to have a special focus on science education. Due to this, we aim to update the teachers in our science department accordingly, so they can offer our students an education suitable for the 21th century.

We acknowledge that great schools are developing their skills together, and that their school leaders are deeply involved in this work. During the project we intend to send all of our teachers to visit at least one partner abroad. We have planned for 55 visits. The visits will be planned based on what subjects they teach, which grade they teach and their experience. They will have a learning assignment, and when they come back, they will share their learning with the project group and their colleagues. New knowledge will be implemented and new experience and knowledge will be shared with other schools. We will visit schools that have proved good practice within each of the areas of development. Academic environments in Norway and in the host countries have recommended schools to visit. Our teachers will attend lessons and watch how the use of iPads enhance learning in the context of the partner school. Following the observation, our teachers will take part in reflection groups together with staff from host schools. Teachers visiting schools focusing on Lesson Study, will attend the planning, observe the teaching and take part in the reflections after a Lesson Study cycle. Staff visiting schools to study assessment for learning, will observe how teachers work and take part in discussions related to this topic. They will be focusing on to learn about how to let students take part in assessment in a way that is moving them forward in their learning. Staff teaching science subjects will take part in courses and conferences relevant to our objectives. The expected short-term effect of this project is an increase in the score on reported motivation and student involvement in assessment, measured through the national student survey. We also expect students to report they experience more support from their teacher in their learning. We expect the long-term effects to reflect in higher scores on both exams and national tests.
