The education and training systems often do not provide sufficient targeted support for pupils to cope with emotional, social or educational difficulties and to remain in education and training. We, as practitioners, are strongly aware of impact emotional and social competences have on personal development and school performance from pre-school age onwards .The first target group of the project are children and pupils. This project most relevant  objective is to improve emotional and social competences of children and students with positive effect on their key competences, prosocial behaviour and academic results. Secondly, we aim to improve inclusive school practice by special focus and participation of students with fewer opportunities facing different obstacles. We expect our approach to have positive effect on early school leaving in the future.  The second target group are the teachers and other specialised school staff. The project aims to enhance and develop their professional knowledge, skills and experience by learning and using the innovative teaching method, as well as change in their personal beliefs about specific problems in their work with students. They will also have the opportunity to improve their communication on foreign languages, digital competences, intercultural and personal competences. Third target group are parents, their participation is vital for this kind of interventions and the project aims at improving parents understanding of social and emotional factors influencing the academic results and children behaviour as well as helping the children in the process. Forth target group will be professionals in education at local, regional, national and EU level. The project aim to raise awareness of the topic, transfer knowledge and experience, exchange good practice, derive new similar projects. Next target group is the authorities in education and policy makers and we desire to raise their awareness about the topic, to inform them about effective and quality school programs of this type, foster opportunities to spread this program to other schools and educative environments. We expect building an European identity of schools, internalization development by integrating European dimension in school activities and curriculum. We estimate 3500 participants will have direct and indirect benefit of this project including about 300 participants with fewer opportunities. We aim to achieve this by development, implementation and evaluation of the learner-centered approach based on Social and Emotional learning (SEL). We will combine Emotional Competence program and Promote Alternative Thinking Strategies method. SEL interventions showed positive effects on students without and with emotional and behavioural difficulties, in racially and ethnic diverse student population as well as in urban, suburban and rural regions, and different age groups. We want to work especially on the following aspects: Emotional Self-Awareness , Managing Emotions, More positive feelings about self, school, and family, Harnessing Emotions Productively , Empathy,Handling relationships. Project activities will be integrated in regular class curriculum and extra-curricular activities and developed gradually by teachers and pupils. The children will actively take part in the learning process. The activities will be adapted and sensitive to the age, gender, type of fewer opportunities and personality of the pupils. The project will be cross-curricular including a variety of activities in different subjects (Arts, Science, Music, PE, Maths, language). Special effort will be made to ensure generalization of acquired skills outside of the classroom. The teachers will be trained before and during the implementation of the program. The evaluation and assessment will be carried out in all project phases, especially by school psychologists. Parents will be included and receive counceling and guidance. The main intellectual output will be The Good Practice manual and we will deliver several other tangible materials (eTwinning projects, School mascots, Project logo, Portfolio Talents Books, Multilingual Mini pictionary, Feel Good Song, Smile Corner, DVDs, school movies, plays, presentations of our educational systems and school organisations, evaluation data).

Early Childhood Education and Care is the essential foundation for successful lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and later employability. It is especially important for children with fewer opportunities, social and educational obstacles, special needs. Those obstacles often lead to early school leaving and transfer of poverty to the next generation. Their inclusion in kindergarten stops the cycle of obstacles they face. Development of quality schools and programs in the educational system strongly affect the strategy EUROPA 2020 which 5th goal is fight against poverty and social exclusion. To accomplish these goals it is necessary to develop staff competences, new quality programes and services and to improve and modernize the existed. One of our project goals is to develop linguistic, digital, communicational, presentational, intercultural and professional competences of our staff. The second goal is development of long-term and sustainable internalisation school plan to improve curriculum, our programes and services, to implement new innovative teaching methods. The third project goal is to improve our quality of inclusive practice and education, to ensure human rights and meet the needs of children and families with fewer opportunities. Our project team consists of qualified professionals - five teachers, headteacher, psychologist and speech therapist. They have experience in presentation of their work, school curriculum, educational programes, projects, scientific papers, children activities at local, regional and national level. Most of them have experience in dissemination in media, eTwinning platform and other social networks. Preparatory project activities cover school needs analysis, estimation  and determination of goals ,results and impact we want to achieve, a selection of courses, cooperation with the partner school. Mobility phase of the project includes participation in structured courses, insight in European educational practice, study visits to kindergartens, schools and universities, job shadowing, new contacts and cooperation with European colleagues, realisation of new projects. The main topics we want to address are: New innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses; Inclusion - equity; Teaching and learning of foreign languages. The first topic would include two structured courses which would attend headteacher, psychologist - project coordinator and two pre-school teachers in France and Belgium. The second topic includes the job shadowing activity for speech therapist and pre-school teacher in Great Britain. The third topic includes CLIL methodology course in Great Britain for our two pre-school teachers. Main project activities also include dissemination inside and outside of our kindergarten, implementation of acquired knowledge, competences and skills in the curriculum, project evaluation. The expected impact on participants is improvement of personal and professional competences, change in attitudes related with international orientation, multiculturalism, fewer opportunities groups and diversity in education, certificate acquisition. Impact on the organisation includes development of long-term school policy internalisation plan, integration of innovative, modern teaching methods and transversal skills, new projects with schools in Europe and Asia, improvement of our inclusive educational practice.

We are a passionate school who and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the teaching and learning as well as aiming to provide exciting experiences for both staff and children. This, along with our current development of global learning, has fueled our application and motivation to apply for European courses. Through various staff meetings and evaluation of school practices and data, we have identified a few areas of development which we feel would be improved through attendance at structured training courses in Europe.Therefore our project objectives are:1Enhance teaching and learning skills through development of creative methods that meet the needs of all children2. Develop Sen provision3. Enhance the teaching and learning of ICT4. Enhance the teaching and learning of MathsThe structure training courses  will be attended by a total of 12  teaching and non-teaching staff  who will be selected upon their role, experience, motivation to enhance practice and make change to improve provision meets our needs; for example, the courses in Finland and Sweden use methodologies such as observing practice and networking with local teachers. This will help to benefit our staff and school through adapting our own current practice and provide potential opportunities to form European links. The teaching and learning of maths course in Belgium also gives a chance for staff members to reflect on their own practice and observe practice and approaches in a different country. Due to the increasing importance of a strong Special Education department, the course based in Iceland seems ideal to help develop our own department. The course allows a chance for observations and to exchange views with other practitioners which has been another influential reason of choosing this course. Another area we identified for improvement was effective use of ICT throughout the school. This is why we chose the ICT Enhanced Classroom course in Spain which allows participants to observe good use of ICT as well as develop enhanced ICT skills which helps to engage learners and increase the confidence of teaching staff. Similarly, the second Spanish course enhancing teaching and learning through effective use of teaching assistants will help achieve our overall objective of improving teaching and learning across the school. Attendance at such course  will generate the follwoing outcomes:enhanced teaching and learningraised staff competencies in teaching of mathsincreased knowledge about systems across Europeenhanced knowledge about cultural diversityenhanced and creative methods to use ICT in the classroomenhanced provision for special needsestablished links with schools in Europeenhance our ability to work within a European contextAll the courses outlined will be effective in increasing staff member's confidence in that subject area and in turn this will be reflected in their own teaching. This will mean that the children they are teaching will receive more specialist teaching. Additionally, the participants on the course will be able to share their knowledge with all of the staff members and all of the pupils through a variety of means, including; staff meetings, staff conferences, assemblies, display boards and discussions. The results and impacts of the courses can also be shared on the school website and sharing App where parents and others outside the consortium can share the European experience. As all the courses will allow participants to network with local teachers, it provides opportunity to create links with European schools. This can benefit the school and can help to develop an extra European dimension to the school as well as providing a great experience for pupils. The longer term benefits of participating in the courses include creating specialist teachers that have up to date knowledge of a subject area. They will also be able to guide other teachers and influence those that they are working closely with. Areas of the curriculum and school approaches will  be changed or adapted which could also have a long term benefit on motivation of staff and learners as well as improving school data.

The three years EwasteR journey, undertaken through a series of nine closely related work packages, developed and established the partnership as a collaborative high performance team.  The EwasteR project addressed the increasingly relevance of the Electrical and electronic waste (E-waste) sector in Europe which is currently the largest growing waste stream. Recycling of WEEE is a specialist part of the waste and recycling industry. Indeed, waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) such as computers, TV-sets, fridges and cell phones is one the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with some 9 million tonnes generated in 2005, and expected to grow to more than 12 million tonnes by 2020.WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content, and if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources (e.g., around 10% of total gold worldwide is used for their production). To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and enhance resource efficiency the improvement of collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.The main beneficiaries of the project are young aspiring workers/technicians and entrepreneurs (learners) wishing to work in the weee recycling and reuse management sector, but the project also provides substantial benefits to the organisations working in the circular economy area using VET as a tool to increase employability chances for those learners at the European level.The aim of the EwasteR project has been to emphasise the relationship between waste creation and resource management and to demonstrate the need for skills, competence and experience of entrepreneurs and specialists in devising a solution and/or an appropriate intervention. The project had four concrete key objectives, including:-Overcome the challenges of vocational skills mismatches in the WEEE re-use sector and give supportto it;-Contribute to the development of new solutions in VET system;-Ensure the highest possible relevance for all targets groups and stakeholders involved;-Create new conditions for providing employment and training opportunities and supporting national Qualifications award in the sector with growth potential (green jobs).The future for the practice that has been developed in EwasteR depends on three key factors and these have been the focus of the exploitation strategy. These factors are:-Evidence of the demand for the recognition and validation of new professional qualifications in WEEE recycling and reuse management sector to implement the NQF and RQF of different Countries across Europe;-The development of new European initiatives that enables the development of a strategic sector skills alliance for VET providers and professionals, employers, experts, and stakeholders concerning Circular Economy system and sustainable development across Europe;-The potential to encourage training-exchanging experience across Europe and to work for an effective impact in the VET and labour systems at all levels.", "http://www.wamitab.org.uk", null, "erasmus_554341-EPP-1-2014-1-IT-EPPKA2-SSA_9"]]}}, "7HT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Your vocational training - your Europe!", "DACHSER Limited", 89773.0, 6, 7, "The mobility project (pool project) is aimed at 50 trainees that are between 18 and 25 years old and have studied or are currently studying in the following fields:\r\n\r\n- Aircraft Mechanics/ electronics for aviation systems \r\n- Pharmaceutical and Veterinary Medical technician/ assistant\r\n- Commercial assistant with the focus on \"logistics\"\r\n- Event- and Marketingmanager/in\r\n\r\nThe project will be coordinated by Education GmbH in cooperation with the following vocational schools and training companies:\r\n\r\n\u2022 DACHSER GmbH & Co.

During the conference the project data, administrative procedure, project quality controls, validation requirements of the work placement will be discussed. \r\n\r\nThe linguistic preparation of the participants is done by electronic means (language modules and e-learning courses). The intercultural preparation is carried out in cooperation with the host companies and will treat the main differences and similarities between Germany and the host country in the professional and private life.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the mobility initiative are the following:\r\n- Increase professional skills through practical implementation of theoretical knowledge\r\n- Additional qualification of the participants (learning about new processes, methods and approaches in the respective professional area during the internship)\r\n- Reduction of language barriers by using a foreign language (in written form as well as verbally)/ increasing confidence in using a foreign language\r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented starting from August 2017.", "http://www.dachser.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003891_4"]]}}, "7PW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "EU - Internationalisierungskompetenzen in der beruflichen Erstausbildung", "HARTING Ltd", 21923.0, 5, 5, "Germany has a long established tradition of an apprenticeship system which involves hands on training at a local company as well as attending a vocational school  two days a week or in blocks of several weeks. This is known as the \u201cdual system\u201d. In general an apprenticeship lasts three years at the end of which  the trainees sit for an examination before the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry  in order to obtain the professional qualification in their chosen professions for example as management assistant in business administration (Kaufmannsgehilfenbrief).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from this general examination, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Bielefeld offers the possibility of obtaining an additional title certifying the so called \u201cEU competence\u201d. One of the requirements for this additional title is to complete a six-week  internship in a company in a European country outside Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is directed  at trainees in the field of business administration who attend courses at the vocational branch of the Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke (college of further education) and work and train in local companies. All of them want to obtain the \u201cEU competence\u201c qualification of the Bielefeld Chamber of Commerce and Industry. At present we are preparing nine trainees for this additional qualification. They will spend six weeks in a European country outside Germany where they will do an internship in a local company  in 2015 (projected period: from 28 February to 11 April 2015). The participants all possess higher educational certificates: seven Abitur (diploma from German secondary school qualifying for general university admission) and two Fachhochschulreife (diploma from German secondary school qualifying for technical university admission). Next year we are expecting the same number of trainees with similar scholastic backgrounds who will spend six weeks abroad in spring 2016. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll planning is done in cooperation with local businesses which wanted to be involved in the process of finding project partners abroad in order to control the quality of the internship. They also wanted to have influence on the content of the tasks the trainees will have to complete during their internship abroad. During a period of three years  the Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke prepares the trainees for their final examination including the one of \"EU competence\" and coordinates international internships which includes applying for financial support for the trainees. Trainees with \"EU competence\" will ensure that local companies will have, in the long run, a pool of well-trained and open-minded staff who have a high degree of international competence including language knowledge. This is essential for companies which do most of their business in export. For the trainees participation in the EU programme increases their chance of being offered a permanent position after their exam as well as greater prospects of career advancement later on. It also fosters personal growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the project is to involve the trainees in all aspects of business in their European partner company. This entails getting to know the business and taking over increasingly complex tasks in one or more administrative department.  The Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke gives each trainee an individual assignment to monitor their own professional development and their knowledge of their host nation. These assignments are formulated jointly by all participating parties. Each EU partner company has a designated adviser for their foreign trainee. There are three fixed appointments for individual feedbacks. If needed, the trainees can get in touch by email or telephone with their companies at home and their teachers at the Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the internship the participating trainees will have to write a report and prepare a Powerpoint presentation referring to their respective assignment. They then present the result to their company in Germany and the Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke. The certificate awarded at the end of the internship is the first requisite for the qualification of \"EU competence\" given by the Bielefeld Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Europass (CV, mobility, languages) documents the achievements and progress of the trainees in the framework of the project which will be undoubtedly conducive to their future career advancement. The Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke will also improve its competence with regard to European affairs which will make it more attractive to both teaching staff and the student body. The close and productive cooperation between all companies involved in the project and the Berufskolleg L\u00fcbbecke will in all likelihood result in a growing number of young people who will take part in training programmes to prepare themselves for work in the European context.", "http://www.harting.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000098_3"]]}}, "7YD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1380585600000, 1475193600000, "User-Centric Networking", "Intamac Systems Limited", "The explosion of information available online and the ubiquity of connected media devices are rendering existing content recommendation and content delivery system inadequate. The recent data deluge has made finding relevant content a daunting task. Users are presented with seemingly infinite choices for consumption and because recommendation systems are typically service or application specific and based on little or narrow data, which results in too coarse-grained recommendations. Furthermore, existing content delivery systems focus their media adaptation to match device and network characteristics, instead of users' context and profile that could help increase the relevance of content search and the viewing conditions.<br/>We introduce User Centric Networking (UCN), a new communication paradigm that leverages user information at large to store, discover and deliver content in the most optimal conditions at any time, for a given user in a specific context. UCN relies on a distributed Personal Information Hub (PIH) that contains information such as the user context, her mood, historical data about her taste, expectation, social acquaintances, and her network/device resources. UCN will use these data to decide at any point in time where to search content and where to deliver it from, and how to configure the delivery for a user in her context. In addition, UCN creates opportunities for a new range of personalized services, based on geo-location or fusion of very different sensor data for example.<br/>UCN will deliver prototypes for a new generation of Internet-based applications and services in the digital media sector and beyond.

We are a two form entry school and have 329 children on roll and 70 staff. Our inclusive ethos is always aspiring to an environment where children enjoy learning, develop confidence and experience success. All children and adults are encouraged to demonstrate good behaviour and respect for each other in a culture that promotes thinking and learning. We work hard to promote our school ethos, 'Working Together To Be The Best We Can Be'. Our recent Ofsted Inspection in July 2017, once again, judged us to be a 'good school'.\r\n\r\nAs a school we are always looking for effective ways to improve our practice so that we can provide the best possible teaching and learning experiences for our children as well as motivating, professional development  opportunities for our staff. Erasmus+  funding would allow us to take this to a new dimension by allowing us to explore excellent practice beyond the limits that the UK has to offer. We have four main aims within the context of this project:\r\n\r\nThe first is to enhance our Early Years provision by raising staff expertise in a range of areas. We have identified this as a focus because we know that there has been an increased focus on improving Early Childhood Education at European level due to this stage of education being identified as a key to success and fulfillment in later life. To achieve this aim we would like to develop knowledge and understanding of creative teaching approaches and teaching techniques for specific groups as well as an awareness of new resources.\r\n\r\nThe second is to develop the well being and mental health of both children and adults. This areas has been identified as a focus because our research has shown that this can have a positive impact on teaching and learning and is an area that we are already working on. We hope to achieve this aim by learning how to address learners self confidence, motivation and appreciation of their own abilities; developing methods to encourage positive relationships; and understanding the impact of mindfulness.\r\n\r\nThe third is to enhance teaching and learning by using teaching assistants and support staff more effectively. We became aware of the importance of this through a course of leadership training undertaken by three members of staff. To achieve this aim we hope to learn how to support teaching assistants so that they are aware of their role and fully prepared for the classroom and to develop their questioning and feedback techniques to develop pupils' independent learning.\r\n\r\nThe fourth is to increase our knowledge and repertoire of approaches and practice to break down barriers to learning for children with special educational needs. This is an important area at Hunsbury Park because we have children with a range of special educational needs and a Special Designated Provision (DSP) for children with social, emotional and mental health needs. We would like to enhance our provision by developing an understanding of the Icelandic special educational system; increasing competencies in our practice; and developing an understanding of new technologies.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these aims we hope to take part in European courses offered by Language Education and Partnerships Ltd (LEAP). The methodology and approach of each course involves specific classes, cultural sessions and visits and visits to educational establishments. In addition, participants are encouraged to discuss and reflect on their learning and to network with one another to establish future links and partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send participants in pairs to each course, ten in total, and they will be selected by a committee in school. They will be chosen because of the relevance of each mobility for their role in school; their motivation to participate; having a clear understanding of the aim of the mobility; their ability to disseminate their learning; and their ability to ensure new initiatives take place and have impact within the school and beyond.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we envisage that the impact from these initiatives will be to develop and improve the teaching and learning at school and beyond. This will be by improving our Early Years practice; by developing confident children who appreciate their own abilities; by developing children who can form positive relationships; by having classrooms in which children are skillfully supported by all adults; and a special educational needs provision with the most up to date competencies and technologies.\r\n\r\nOver time we will share our learning and skills with members of the local community and other schools in Northampton.", "http://www.hunsburypark.northants.sch.uk", "Hunsbury Park Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046743_coordinator"]]}}}}
