Robert Bosch GmbH is divided into various business sectors, one of these sectors is Consumer Goods and within this sector is our business unit, Bosch Lawn and Garden in Stowmarket, UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently we have 8 apprentices in total and we are aiming to employ 5 new apprentices each year, starting in 2014. Our business unit has now gained experience in planning and managing a 3 year apprentice program, focused on offering engineering apprenticeships. Regarding the success of our apprentice program, we have decided to develop an exchange program with our divisional headquarters in Leinfelden, Germany. The exchange program has started in 2013 and was successfully repeated in 2014. The exchange program may be divided in two big parts: the exchange as such, with duration of four weeks \u2013 two weeks in each country \u2013 and a project work which has to be finished within the four week timetable. In 2014 3 English and 5 German apprentices were participating in the program (for 2015 it is planned to send 2 English apprentices). Starting with a two week stay in either Stowmarket or Leinfelden participants have the possibility to get to know each other and to start working on their project. The project will be designed by our Senior Engineers and should be based on the technical knowledge and abilities of participating apprentices. Further, the projects\u2019 subject should be important to the company as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the project work, where our apprentices have to cope with various demands, they will work in the business unit at Leinfelden for two weeks. During their stay they will mainly get to know the processes and products of a foreign business unit while accompanying a German apprentice. Besides this they will be trained in the field of electronic engineering or programming. Regarding the fact that both, apprenticeship and the profile of apprentices are slightly different in Germany and the UK, the exchange program should be beneficiary for both business units. The apprenticeship in Germany is for example much more specialized than in England (e.g. in the field of Electronic Engineering). In contrast, our apprentices will get a broader view during their apprenticeship. German apprentices will take part in their third year of apprenticeship while our participants will be in their second year. Finally, participants have the possibility to complement each other, especially during their project work which focuses on their technical knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nTo join the exchange program Bosch Lawn and Garden in Stowmarket will invite apprentices to have an interview with our HR Department. Moreover, abilities and profiles will be discussed with Senior Engineers since they are mentoring our apprentices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project work, as well as the whole exchange, offers the possibility to work in an international team on a realistic subject. Through this, participants may develop a deep understanding for the difficulties and processes of an international co-operating company. Also, they will learn how to discuss problems, how to find solutions and how to realize their ideas. By presenting their results to a mid-size audience they finally have to reflect their work and explain their way of proceeding. All of these steps should help to develop them technically as well as personally further. Moreover, they should develop a deeper understanding for the structures of the whole Robert Bosch GmbH and by this develop a deeper understanding for their own business unit within these structures, as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince most of our apprentices are from the local area of Stowmarket and haven\u2019t gained intercultural experience yet, we want to support them gaining experience acquired abroad. To us it is important to understand the behavior and culture within foreign business units since we are part of a global acting corporation. Moreover, we want our apprentices to be part of this intercultural experience by working in an international team. Not only to develop them further, but also to improve the quality of communication and networking within the company long term. \r\n\r\nBesides working activities it is also part of the exchange program to visit local sights and have dinner with all participating employees. Through this we want our apprentices to get to know the German and English culture respectively. Finally, the mix of activities should be seen as a personal and technical challenge as well as a great chance to surmount these challenges and to establish international relationships.", "http://www.bosch-garden.com/gb/en/garden-tools/homepage/index.jsp", "Bosch Lawn and Garden Ltd.", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000491_coordinator"]]}}}}
