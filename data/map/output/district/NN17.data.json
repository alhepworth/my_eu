In line with European Commission priorities, the general objectives of the project are:- to ensure a good start in education for all children, by enhancing the quality of ECEC and by ensuring that the benefits of ECEC are carried through to other school education levels; - to support teachers to adopt new methods and tools for dealing with complex classroom realities and diversified groups of learners. In the context of the needs identified at local and transnational level by the partners involved, the project proposal aims to DEVELOP INNOVATIVE APPROCHES, METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS FOR FACILITATING CHILDREN\u2019S TRANSITIONS across home, ECEC services and school institutions. Within this framework, the specific objectives of the project are:1) to examine existing transition practices with different focuses at each project location in order to take into account the diversified needs of target groups in each context; 2) to involve teachers, families and local stakeholder in designing innovative practices for smoothening transitions, with special attention paid to the school success of children facing complex situations (eg. socio-economic disadvantage) and to the engagement of families at risk of social exclusion (eg. Roma);3) to increase the competence of ECEC/school professionals by involving them in action-research and experimentation projects, with the support provided by experienced researchers;4) to promote the educational innovation of ECEC and school institutions by experimenting new pedagogical approaches and educational methodologies that support children \u2013 especially those who are most at risk of school failure \u2013 in facing successfully transition processes; 5) to identify principles of good practices that could contribute to trans-national exchange and learning as well as to the improvement of educational policies at local, regional, national and EU level.The partnership consists of 10 partners - university/research/training organisations as well as ECEC/school institutions \u2013 located in 4 countries:- ERI and OS Tisina (SL),- UNIBO and DD Vignola (IT),- Pen Green Research Base, Rockingham Primary School, Studfall Junior Infant and Nursery School (UK),- VBJK, Mezennestje day care centre and Kolva kindergarden (BE).The International Step by Step Network (ISSA) and the \u2018Mensen voor mensen\u2019 poverty advocacy group are associate partners to the project.

The proposed system is based in the optimal combination of solar thermal (ST) energy production, seasonal heat storage and high efficient heat pump use. Heat pumps will be improved technically in order to obtain the best performace in the special conditions of the CHESS-SETUP system.\n\nThe used solar panels will be hybrid photovoltaic and solar thermal (PV-ST) panels, which is a promising solution for also producing the electricity consumed by the heat and water pumps of the heating system and part of the electricity consumed in the building. Hybrid solar panels are a key element to achieving energy self-sufficiency in buildings, especially in dense urban areas where the roof availability is one of the most limiting factors.\n\nAlso will be considered the integration of other energy sources as biomass or heat waste, to make the system suitable for any climate conditions. The project will also explore the possibility to integrate the system with other electricity or cooling technologies (solar cooling, cogeneration).\n\nThe system operation will be optimized according to some external factors, as electricity price or user requirements by using a smart control and management systems developed specifically for the project.\n\nThis proposal will be materialized in three pilot experiences: a small-scale prototype in Lavola's headquarters (Spain), 50 new dwellings located in Corby (England) and a new sport centre located in Sant Cugat (Spain).", 863808.0, 3212273.0, 5, 11, "CHESS-SETUP", null, null, null, "h2020_203231_952416714"], [1383264000000, 1477872000000, "District of the Future", "Electric Corby Community Interest Company", "Cities are increasingly recognizing the need of addressing climate and energy challenges.
