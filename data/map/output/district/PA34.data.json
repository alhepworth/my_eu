This combination of approaches is intended to create synergies and transfer of information between different research groups and the different SME and SME-AGs.\n\nSME-AGs can start to reduce the isolation of SMEs by disseminating appropriate information, alongside information from other parts of the value chain (e.g., Whitby Seafoods Ltd, participant 7). The key outsourced RTD deliverables can be matched against questions that SME \u2013AGS have posed when askd to evaluate options for Nephrops creeling or enhancement as follows:\nWhich habitat is of most value for creeling and as possible expansion areas?\nObjective - Nephrops habitat suitability maps\n\u2022 Is there a robust and cheap way for an SME to survey novel areas in the future?\nObjective -Site assessment protocol\n\u2022 How do recently released individuals move?\nObjective - Report on movements of recently released individuals including analysis by sex, size and reproductive status (berried females)\n\u2022 Does stocking work?\nObjective - Report detailing survival and residency post release of seeded stock and growth of ranched stock.\n\u2022 Can baits be improved?\nObjective -Novel baits manufactured and their potential for creel fishery evaluated\n\u2022 Can local stock be subsidized with additional food for faster growth?\nObjective -Juvenile Feed enhancement\n\u2022 Can pots be improved, particularly with respect to selectivity?\nObjective -Creel prototype completed and evaluated\n\u2022 How could a hatchery be set up?\nObjective - Hatchery handbook\n\u2022 What is the best way of returning wild-caught discards and hatchery-reared Nephrops?\nObjectives - Release protocol for Nephrops and release equipment.", 209374.0, 2736900.0, 4, 15, "NEPHROPS", "http://www.nephrops.eu/", null, null, "fp7_103402_962392485"]]}}}}
