The aim of the project is to develop value and appreciation of European cultural heritage in relation to social cohesion, in particular to the value of human rights, equality, diversity and peace. \r\n\r\nThis project will expand, transfer and implement Global Link's innovative heritage learning practices with transnational partners in Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Germany and Italy.  Global Link will share learning from recently completed and very successful heritage and global citizenship project 'Sowing the Seeds of Global Citizenship.'\r\n\r\nIn this project, Global Link worked with adult volunteers to use local Archives, Museums and Libraries, to research and document histories relating to ordinary people\u2019s struggles for peace and a growing sense of connectedness with the international community. These activities range from \u2018no more war\u2019 demonstrations, to peace and global citzenship education in schools, to the establishment of local League of Nations (the precursor to the United Nations) groups. Global Link has created an interactive Online Map documenting these activities, focusing primarily on activities in the UK. The map can be seen at http://www.documentingdissent.org.uk/dd-map/\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will train partners to recruit and work with adult volunteers to research and document peace activism, internationalism and global awareness across Europe during and after World War 1.  Each partner will work with at least 5 adult volunteers to research local League of Nations groups across Europe, as well trade union and youth exchanges relating to international efforts for peace building, anti-racism and cross-European connections. The time period for the research would be World War 1 until shortly after World War 2. \r\n\r\nGlobal Link will provide training to partners on recruiting volunteers, identifying local archives and sources of historical information, and IT-based formats in which to gather the information, and how to upload the information to the online map. Each partner will do a short project with their target groups, taking them to Archives, Museums and Libraries to inspire the beneficiaries to research their own local histories.  The partners will train and support the volunteers to write short accounts of their research in the IT-based format required to upload the information to the website, and train them how to upload to the website. This will result in Output 1.\r\n\r\nThe partners and their volunteers will then create Multiplier events to share this heritage learning with a minimum of 20 young people in their localities, who in turn will engage critically with the material, linking it to current debates around responses to refugees and migrants in their societies. 10-15 young people will then produce creative arts-based and/or digital outputs which reflect on their local heritage and what this means for their roles as global citizens in the world today. This will result in Output 2. These will digitised so that they can be uploaded to the www.documentingdissent.org.uk website and thus widely disseminated via social media. \r\n\r\nThe final multiplier event will be a \u2018Living Museum\u2019, where adult and young volunteers will work with project partners to share all the project outputs in a museum, library or other public space, as a 'living' museum, where the audiences will engage with both the project outputs and the volunteers. \r\n\r\nAll Outputs will be shared on the online platforms and widely disseminated.", "http://www.globallink.org.uk", "GLOBAL LINK (LANCASTER)", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-048217_coordinator"], [2017, "Youth in Progress and Partnership for Equality and Exchange", "GLOBAL LINK (LANCASTER)", 126059.0, 5, 5, "The project addresses inequality still growing at all levels, severely touching upon youth with fewer opportunities who lack of access to personally tailored services, to empowering education structures, to knowhow and skills to enter labour market to find or create quality jobs, to mobility, or to create space for participation and feel influential.

The energy reduction will originate from improved efficiency and cost effective high temperature (SOFC), to act as micro heat and power cogeneration (\u03bc-CHP) systems providing demand-flexible electricity and heat to the building and district, coupled with optimised energy and power distribution networks that will optimally control heat storage at building and/or district level. FC-DISTRICT integrates a proven innovative mid-term energy technology (SOFC) with heat management at building and district level (building thermal storage coupled with intelligent distribution networks) to serve the consumer needs for economy-ecology-sustainability.

For example, there have been significant developments in new digital technology platforms such as mobile technologies, cloud computing, social media, open educational resources (OERs), free and open-source software (FOSS), as well as the associated hardware (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, interactive whiteboards). Opportunities and demands of globalisation and technology are fuelling transformations of educational practices and school infrastructure quickly t. The evolution of educational systems and digital technology also provide additional challenges to framing our perspectives, including the emergence of virtual and networked schools that share courses and programmes within countries and across regions (Davis, Eickelmann & Zaka 2013). Utilising these technological advancements to support good-quality training and reflective professional development are fast becoming essential parts of a teacher\u2019s professional life.

In this project when the term NEET is used it specifically refers to young people with a previous negative educational experience, or early school-leavers, who have failed to complete formal education.\r\n\r\nThe share of young people between the ages of 20 and 34 years neither in employment nor in education and training in 2016 stood at 12.4% in DE; 21.3% in CY; 14.8% in UK; 18.5% in IE; 18.0% in PL; 15.0% in FI; 16.2% in CZ and 22.5% in HR. With a record number of NEETs following the financial and economic crisis, there have been concerns among policymakers that a whole generation of young people in the EU could remain out of the labour market for years to come. Research evidence suggests that young people can deal relatively well with short spells of unemployment. Longterm disengagement, however, is likely to have a scarring effect on future labour market participation as well as earnings over the life course and thus may lead to social exclusion for those affected.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the project is to design and develop a bespoke challenge-based educational intervention aimed at re-engaging NEETs and supporting them to build skills and competences to assist their reintegration to education or employment. Partners will initially focus on building trust and confidence which may have been broken by past negative experiences and on addressing motivational deficits that act as barriers to engagement. Once NEETs are re-engaged the online escape room challenges will focus on the development of market oriented key competences.

In the case of GF2-students, mobilities are arranged so that they fit into the individual learning plan of the student, and go to a destination/company that matches the student's wishes and defined learning objectives. In the same manner, a large number of SKP-students are offered work placements in \"real\" companies, as they are released from their main course to company based learning (VFU). Due to changed VFU rules, these mobilities are cut down to 3 weeks, but it is the hope of the college that the they will still lead to paid employment under the Danish apprenticship abroad scheme (PIU) for many SKP-students.

The same model is tried out with a hair dresser student both summers at Crete (F16) with a new and promising host company. In both cases the aim is to fulfill specific learning objectives, but at the same time also to increase chances of apprenticeship in Denmark  or abroad (PIU). \r\n\r\nA2) Staff training abroad\r\nWith the aim ogf exchanging experience regarding best practice within guidance towards VET programs and incorporation of an international element in the individual student's VET, TECHCOLLEGE sends 4 groups of 4 staff members (F1-4) on a 1 week's mobility stay at selected partner schools in the EU to see how these challenges are tackled here. Each group consists of 2 TECHCOLLEGE staff and  2 counsellors from Youth  Guidance Centre Aalborg. The participants have a key role in attracting students to VET and in adding an international dimension to VET programs.\r\n\r\nACCOMPANYING TEACHERS\r\nIn connection with the larger groups (F12-15), extra accompanying teachers are added as they stay only 1 week each and as the students are devided in 2 stays.

This understanding is highlighted in the EU economic strategy \u201cEurope 2020\u201d and embedded within the detail of its various flagship Initiatives such as:  \u201cSmart Growth: Innovation Union\u201d, \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d, which among other things seeks to better equip our young people to achieve  successful employment in adulthood and the \u201cNew Skills for New Jobs\u201d agenda. This 30 month project seeks to address the new challenges in the labour market by exploring all the factors above & developing practical, user friendly and transferable solutions by nurturing & capitalising on the good work already happening in the partner countries and across Europe. By the same token, local economies also require specialist research to ensure the labour market is adequately served. As stated by The UK Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities makes clear in the English Apprenticeship 2020 vision, \"Nobody understands the skills employers need better than the employers themselves. That is why we are placing them in the driving seat. They are designing apprenticeships so that they focus on exactly the skills, knowledge and behaviours that are required of the workforce of the future\".The target group in this project are organisations and employers that work directly with young people who are facing significant challenges securing meaningful careers, as well as the young people themselves who often need extra guidance when making the transition from education to the world of work. The preparation and guidance for transition from education to employment readiness is a key focus of this project. To support this notion and develop new approaches to handling this transition process are the main objectives of the training elements in this project and also why we are also seeking employer, SME and other professional voices. Cedefop Director James Calleja said: \u2018SMEs, who are drivers of economic growth and job creation, are natural partners with vocational education and training (VET) which provides the skills they need.\"By gaining a unique level of access to young people who in the process of transition from education to work, we can get invaluable feedback about the State of the Art pertaining to Career Guidance whilst working together to develop new approaches matching the ever changing nature of the job market to the vocational skills of those entering work.We will create a suite of modular resources, testing tools, a training framework and CPD training packages and pilot test them in real training situations with career guides and trainers, and upwards of 200 young people. Materials can be adapted by partners to fit different sectors and educational levels. We hope to run several events to maximise the interest in the final tools and share them with local, regional and international actors. Socio-economic challenges in all of the partner countries mean that new ways to guide and steer young people into a stable working life, to avoid transient career choices, spiralling debt and reliance on state support; towards a better standard of living, can in someway contribute to a more harmonious society. The unique experience of the partners and their level of access to different target groups; youth, higher education, trainees, apprentices, volunteers, school leavers, unemployed and those pursuing a vocational education or re-entry to the labour market, will ensure not only a truly transnational project and outputs, but also ones that are adaptable to different socio-economic and educational groups.The migration of labour and the free movement of people within the EU should make the project's inter cultural findings and activities more pertinent in all of the partner countries. This experience and the import / export of new approaches dealing with a rapidly changing labour market with new skills demands, can help organisations and communities meet the need to prepare 'Generation Y' with the new skills and approaches for work readiness.   Before the project started, partners conducted research to establish a need for the project in each country and to lay the foundations for future activities. The findings of these eight reports highlights the need more a consistent, yet adaptable approach to guide people at a vital stage in their lives.Every year we hear in the media about different approaches to education internationally with much political posturing, however by simply taking the best approaches from the partner countries in a pilot such as this, we can directly benefit the Career Guidance and Vocational preparation on a local, regional and international level whilst bringing together a diverse range of partner organisations with a range of experiences.", "http://www.lmc.ac.uk", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024558_coordinator"], [2014, "Digital timelines", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 190089.0, 5, 6, "Digital Timelines is a training course and support materials to produce videos for the benefit of people with dementia. The project maximises the use of developments in ICT with regards \u201cmulti-media\u201d digital devices and associated progress in consumer access to produce a training programme and bespoke digital resources which can encapsulate memory stimulating information from a variety of media to benefit specifically the person with dementia and their family and friends, as well as professional carers.   \r\nThe project aims to allow practitioners in care as well as family members to produce an effective resource which is at very little or no cost to the persons with dementia or their carers. The project encapsulates a research element which then makes an international comparison of the partner countries (UK, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey & Sweden) Which informs the development of the training package that is easily transferable and accessible to individuals, carers, family and professionals alike.  The training package will be cascaded on a one-to-one basis or in small groups. It will further be available as an eCourse, and will be supported by examples of digital timeline videos, as well as an instructional video, to ensure that along with many other complementary support interventions, the products are universally and freely available as open educational resources. As well as the national research and international comparison report, it is intended that the project will train up to 72 participants, create 12 example videos, with 6 instructional videos. The resources will be available in the partner languages as well as English.\r\n\r\nDementia is a universal phenomenon which is increasing at an exponential rate. It is estimated that there are currently 1.04 million (1.65%) sufferers in the UK, 270,300 (1.26%) in Romania, , 32,000 (1.57%) in Slovenia, 331,000 (0.44%) in Turkey and 173,000 (1.82%) in Sweden. (Alzheimer Europe 2012 stats) There are more than 10 million across Europe and 44 million globally. Directly linked to longevity, this is set to double over the next 20 years. Until, indeed if, dementia becomes curable, it represents an increasing cost challenge for governments, as well as an increasing social and moral challenge for humanity.  These challenges therefore create demand by governments, communities and families for new, innovative and low- cost services which help to manage progress of the disease, maintain quality of life and help people stay away from expensive chronic support services \r\nThis means that care for people with dementia is a growth industry and offers economic opportunities for European workers.  Furthermore, the scope to use increasingly sophisticated ICT to help people with dementia is likewise a growth field, with new assistive technologies regularly coming on stream.  Already, there are a variety of therapies accessible to dementia carers, family, friends and professionals , which help the person with dementia to sustain activity of the memory function and maintain good quality of life for as long as possible eg. compilations of favourite songs;  written and photo-annotated 'life story' personal accounts.\r\nIn our initial exploration of the potential value of and demand for the outputs  of this project, Alzheimer\u2019s Society UK have been most encouraging and supportive. \r\n\r\nThe envisaged impact will be that many people in direct or indirect contact with people with dementia will become trained in the production of the digital timelines videos across Europe as well as be trained in the ability to train others in the production of same. \r\nThis will allow them to appreciate how they or those trained by them can improve the life of a person with dementia  by stimulating memories in a technical based multimedia way. A number of third sector organisations and SMEs providing health and social care.  will benefit from knowledge exchange opportunities that might not otherwise be easily available via our community of practice, they will be able to share best practice and adopt the project learning materials as part of their programmes of education and training. \r\n \r\nSustainability is an area where we already have very positive responses from internationally respected organisations including Alzheimer's UK. our sustainability plans, and our reach at local, regional, national and EU level is one of the major strengths of this project.

The mobility of students to undergo unique work experience placements abroad is a major and highly relevant part of this strategy; to give the learners a wider and more valuable learning experience as well as to boost their technical skills. \r\n\r\nOur main motives to carry out this project focus on the development opportunities, both personal and professional for the learners involved and to link to the specific course skills and requirements for every trainee, in a manageable and scalable way. The direct objective of this project is to provide a unique work placement for participants to get structured, practical and validated training experiences as well as experience of another country and its culture. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be transparently and carefully selected by staff and teams from the various programmes at LMC. However, encouraging independence is also a focus of the project, and the accompanying tutors will monitor and evaluate the work programme to ensure the students meet their work place objectives and develop themselves professionally as well as personally. \r\n\r\nThe indirect objectives of the project are to ensure that the young people who take part are more employable, with a broader understanding of their own professional areas and other cultures. The proposal provides learners with appropriate opportunities in acquiring skills and knowledge for their personal development and employability. The feedback from past mobility experiences backs up this objective, where students cite their overseas experiences as a pivotal moment in their lives and careers. \r\n\r\nThe mobility and life experiences this project offers have a greater value than local training, and those experiences are not available in the UK. The added value of the EU aspect of the project might be just as valuable as the work and learning aspects of the project, and the benefits on the individuals taking part are as much cultural as educational.\r\n\r\nLMC is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of the learners and of employers, this project aims to deliver a more skilled, developed and experienced level of trainee, recruit or employee whilst producing high quality learning outcomes and reinforcing the capacities of the organisations involved. The number of learners is planned to ensure the safest manageable and proportionate experience.           \r\n\r\nLMC are now linking, more than ever, to industry, technical and work based partners to prepare the learners for meaningful employment. This is evidenced locally and regionally, where strategic approaches are needed to address crucial changes in working practices and employment culture. This was highlighted in a recent report from the EC and sums up the nature of the relationships present in this application, \"New types of strategic partnerships between VET providers, companies, other economic actors, social partners and authorities are crucial.\"Strasbourg, Vocational education and training for better skills, growth and jobs publication.\r\n    \r\nThe benefits for LMC are also substantial and contribute to our priority objective of being an international facing college, see: \r\nwww.lmc.ac.uk/the-college/european-learning\r\n\r\nThe LMC Principal captures the real relevance and objective of this and past mobility activities that offer students, \"an unprecedented range of opportunities to develop their skills, confidence and exposure to different cultures\". \r\n\r\nAnother key objective surrounds the role of training and recruitment in key technical areas, not only for the College but also relating to the local and national employment situation.  Sport & Public Services, Business & Recreation, Hospitality & IT professions are vital to the local economy, and by up-skilling and widening the outlook of the young people this project aspires to have a significant outcome and long lasting impact.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance our students opportunities to enter their chosen professions and rise to the current challenges of the labour market, creating skilled and experienced workers with a more culturally sensitive and aware outlook; participants will be better people, culturally aware and inevitably more employable after this experience.\r\n\r\nThe Europe 2020 strategy with its demands for a closer cooperation between vocational institutions and the common transparency instruments require an international focus.

One significant change that has resulted is that high levels of stress in the workplace are now experienced across all pay grades, by all staff categories. According to a study on work-related stress from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, stress is the second most frequently reported work-related health problem in Europe. Up to 60% of all lost working days can be attributed to work-related stress and psychosocial risks.\r\n\r\nWhile occupational psychologists accept that in today\u2019s modern workplace, a certain level of pressure is completely normal and to be expected, when this pressure develops into a persistently stressful working environment, with little or no supports in place, people can find it difficult to cope and some may develop a range of health issues as a result. The biggest stress factor identified is concern around possible job loss, which increased the odds of poor health by up to 50. In Europe today, a significant cohort of young people run a high risk of unemployment for a number of reasons; (a) their low skill levels; (b) the skills miss-match between the skills they have and the skills now required; (c) their inability cope with current market needs; (d) their inability to manage and plan an effective and appropriate career trajectory that suits their own specific skills, characteristics and ambitions.\r\n\r\nhe objectives of the UNWIND project are to:\r\n- develop a totally new suite of career management resources that address the 4 key thematic areas identified in the Career Management Skills Framework for Scotland:\r\nSELF - competences that enable young people to develop their sense of self within society; \r\nSTRENGTHS - competences that enable young people to build on their strengths to pursue rewarding learning or work opportunities; \r\nHORIZONS - competences that enable young people to visualise, plan and achieve their career aspirations; \r\nNETWORKS - competences that enable young people to develop networks of support.\r\n\r\n- develop a bespoke curriculum of mini-learning format resources for young people that support the acquisition of high-value labour market oriented skills. \r\nCOMMUNICATION - building the skills to be an effective communicator and developing an understanding of different communication styles; \r\nTEAMWORK - building the capacity to combine individual skills in pursuit of a common goal by helping, persuading, sharing, being flexible, and showing commitment; \r\nPROBLEM SOLVING - building the skills to effectively define a problem; determine the cause; identify, prioritize, select and implement a solution; \r\nLEADERSHIP - building the skills to be an effective leader able to motivate and inspire those around you.\r\n\r\n- develop a comprehensive range of self-help resources to support young people to effectively manage stress in the workplace. These resources will address a number of critical work-related stress areas such as:\r\nKNOWING WHAT IS IMPORTANT - important techniques that can help young people to prioritize their workload;\r\nLESS ANGER; LESS STRESS - anger is a stress emotion young people can do without and learning how to control the expression of anger is an important skill;\r\nBEING ORGANIZED - feeling a sense of control over your environment and knowing how to spend your time for the best results;\r\nSUPPORT SYSTEMS - 'no man is an island' and it is essential that young people surround themselves with individuals they can trust and relate to\r\n\r\nUNWIND partners will also develop an induction programme for front-line trainers supporting young workers and an online learning environment that will function on a full range of fixed and mobile technology platforms.

This applies not only quantitatively but also qualitatively in relation to learning potential and in the spreading internally at school \u2013 i.e. involvement of more colleges, education programs, student types and staff categories.ACTIVITIESA1) Shorter mobilities in companies for VET studentsThis is mobilities of 4-7 weeks\u2019 duration and therefore they may fit into the new Basic Course 2 with specific learning objectives that are achieved in a company abroad. Most mobilities will be carried out for individuals or pairs, when suitable in the individual student\u2019s education plan and to a destination/company that matches the student\u2019s wishes and the defined learning goals. Only in the case of Holland (F2), a fixed schedule is made, whereby 4 groups of 4 Media-students are doing mobilities of 4 weeks with one group every half year. The perspective is increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship in Denmark or abroad (PIU). A2) Longer mobilities in companies for VET studentsFor Norway (F1) this is SKP students in construction trades, who released from their main course will do a longer work placement in selected companies in Bod\u00f6 and possibly elsewhere in Norway. In Cyprus (F2) this concerns a group of chef students, who starts at school in the spring and therefore is able to do 8 weeks of work placement over the summer holiday at hotels in the Paphos area. Also here the perspective is increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship or PIU.A3) Shorter mobilities at colleges for VET studentsIn Tampere, Finland (F1), TCAA arranges a 3 weeks\u2019 school period for EUX students as part of their main course. The professional content is log house building (carpenters) and mass ovens (masons). Due to detail planning this mobility will not be carried out until the autumn of 2017. For Leeuwarden, Finland (F2), Media College is sending 2 groups of 10 students, who will do a children\u2019s book project together with Dutch students. This will include a similar activity I Aalborg. In both A3 activities, the idea is completion of specific learning objectives, but also increased qualification for subsequent apprenticeship or PIU.A4) Shorter mobilities at colleges for TCAA and UU staffTCAA sends 4 groups of 4 staff members on 1 week\u2019s mobility to selected colleges around EU to see how they cope with the  challenge of guidance to the VET system and incorporation of an international element in the individual student\u2019s education program. Each group is composed of 2 TCAA people (international coordinators, teachers etc.) and two counsellors from Youth Guidance Centre Aalborg (UU). The participants all have an important role in relation to the student\u2019s choice of VET and a possible international element, and they will be strengthened in their role as counsellors and motivators.TARGET GROUPSIn compliance with the school\u2019s globalization strategy, TCAA has included a broader array of participant groups \u2013 particularly among the students, who form the majority. Thus, some flows are planned for specific target groups like SKP and EUX, while the rest are primarily for basic course (GF2). Due to the VET reform, it has not been possible to find ways, whereby GF1 students can participate in mobilities. TCAA is also still working on including new graduates in mobility, but the interest has been very low so far. Therefore no specific activities are planned for this group.Another new development is that TCAA plans to send out a larger part of participants in groups. This has previously proven difficult, but this time the initiative comes directly from leaders responsible for EUX and Media, and the preparatory work is already going on with the partner colleges abroad.In connection with group mobilities, TCAA sees a pedagogical and logistical need for accompanying teachers \u2013 especially in the start. The same applies to one student mobility in Spain to allow at least one socially weak SKP student to take part.PARTNER CHOICE AND STRATEGYContrary to what would be expected, the VET reform has not had a particular influence on the partner composition in this project. Out of 11 partners, 9 took part in the previous project (in one case only the coordinator), and both of the two new ones are well-known from previous/other projects. All school partnerships are formalized as MoU's in ECVET-like format at part of TCAA's gradual introduction of this QA tool.However, the reform has had its bearing on TCAA\u2019s composition of activity types. This is seen partly by putting more emphasis on new participant groups (e.g. SKP and EUX), and partly by using parts of school periods (and the associated learning objectives) as a new activity type for VET students compared to previous years, which is clearly in line with the aims of the new globalization strategy.", "http://www.lmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022032_5"], [2014, "Structured Training and European Mobility for Vocational Education and Training", "Lancaster and Morecambe College", 150517.0, 7, 8, "The Project\r\nThis project will enable students from across the wide ranging curriculum offer of Lancaster & Morecambe College to undertake structured two or three week placements overseas with established vocational training centres and host organisations in Europe. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nWork experience is a vital part of the personal and professional development of all students at Lancaster and Morecambe College and every effort is made to validate and match that experience with the students' course of study. As well as preparing the student for their next steps into the world of meaningful employment, it is also expected that this opportunity will give them cultural insight and a personal experience that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.   \r\n\r\nProfiles\r\nThe project is a balance of past mobility projects that have run for several years with the inclusion new destinations and vocational areas to maximise the impact on the whole organisation and benefit a wider range of learners. In this application 64 learners will be able to improve their employability prospects and broaden their horizons with a structured placement in one of the following countries:\r\nLevel 3 - Sports & Public Services students in Slovakia and Bulgaria\r\nLevel 3 - Engineering & Construction students in Aalborg, Denmark\r\nLevel 3 - IT students in Ostrava, Czech Republic\r\nLevel 2/3 - Football Coaches in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands\r\nLevel 3 - Hospitality & Tourism students in Abruzzo, Italy\r\nLevel 3 - Health & Social Care students in Vasto, Italy\r\n\r\nQuality\r\nThe outgoing numbers are aligned with past project applications to ensure realistic quality and consistency for all participants. The competition for places is high with all students having to meet strict selection criteria to be considered. The faculties represented deliberately start with smaller and manageable numbers to ensure the end result and only then can consider increasing the number of outgoing placements. \r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe placements are negotiated and developed between the International Team, LMC teachers and host organisations. This is a continual process to help refine the activities for future students and improve the project. The emphasis is on a work placement and in all instances there are opportunities for training and more intense linguistic preparation for particular vocational fields such as hospitality and health care.\r\nMobilities are normally three weeks (two for football coaching). This is the optimum time based on staff and student feedback over recent mobility projects. Mobility dates are agreed well in advance of the activity and shared with students, usually after the first term. This itself we have found to serve as a motivating force for learners. Therefore, the impact on the students is positive even before any mobility preparations have taken place. \r\n\r\nIn all projects a timetable of activities is agreed in advance and worked out by key staff and the hosts who manage the training. This ensures a realistic and manageable project with all expectations and requirements clearly laid out. This design of the programme is often adapted for specific needs of participants with specific skill sets. For example, in summer 2014 LMC Sports and Public Service students demonstrated their skills in advance for the host organisations in both Slovakia and Bulgaria. This allowed the hosts to programme activities on their side, based on the skills of the outgoing students. \r\n\r\nIt is intended The Netherlands and Czech mobilities will be carried in 2015/16 in only one flow each.\r\nAll the others will happen over two flows in 2015/16 with a safe, realistic number of accompanying people.\r\n\r\nAccompanying people will remain with the participants for the entire duration of the placement only if the students are under 18 years old. All but two of the projects involves the students staying abroad without staff and therefore getting the best independent life experience. \r\n\r\nResults and impact\r\nLMC attracts a lot of students from deprived areas and its typical student profile is one of very little exposure to different cultures and little or no experience of travelling away from the region. This project will provide a tremendous opportunity for broadening their horizons and developing an appreciation of European Citizenship as well as introducing new employment opportunities. \r\nIn recent years the impact on students has been immense.

T4TEMP aims to increase participation of NEETs, into Labor market and Education by upskilling Educators, Career Counselors, Youth Workers. A secondary aim is to raise awareness of heterogeneity of the NEETs population across member states so that adaptation can accommodate diversity of NEET profile. The T4TEMP will implement the following objectives:- Identify ItInternational Comparison State of Art of Adult educators and target group of NEETs . - Develop an on-line e-LearningToolkit. The use of the specific tools would enable Educators allocate their time with each one of the people who are in need of their services in a more constructive and effective way, by mobilising internet technologies and in specific social media to allocate part of their work.  (e-Learning Toolkit)- Develop and implement targeted courses, which enables them to understand, support and increase their skills in order to be competitive and supportive to NEETs. The objective of the project is to give the possibility to Educators and counselors for better and more targeted provision of services through the provision of tools available on social media as well. The main target group of the project is addressing Adult Educators, VET Providers, Teachers, Career Counselors,etc who dealing with NEETs whom wish to upskill their competences, qualifications, approaches, in order to be able to be more competitive, professionals and provide the NEETs with better assistance and help them to come to employability or education so as to attain their career goals. Throughout the implementation and validation phase of the project the partners will include members of this target group (training sessions, local national events, feedback etc.). Approximately the projects aims to reach directly all the relevant stakeholders (Teachers, Career Counselors, VET trainers, etc)  from the Organizations (Public and Private Authorities) and networks participating in the project, within Europe and beyond.  Furthermore, other professionals in the private sector or in trade unions, who provide in-service training and development for teachers and young professionals, will also benefit from the tools developed, as they will improve their professional profiles and their roles in training sessions. The secondary target group includes NEETs :- Students or trainees from (15 to 24) who are in the schools or in the training system, ending their compulsory education but being at risk of becoming NEETs- Persons who are not in the school- or in the training system (as well as unemployed persons) ranging from 15 to 29 years.It is expected that a total number of over 240 educators, counselors will be involved in core project activities, giving valuable feedback and information on the quality and usability of the project results.  Local, national and international stakeholders will be let known about the outcomes of the project and their importance in the role and tasks of  enhance their qualification. The methodology and activities for implementing the project is simple: the project starts with the formulation of an International Comparison State of Art of Adult educators and target group of NEETs  (O1).  This activity will lead to the design and development of the Targeted Training  Courses for adult educators, who are working with the target group of NEETs (O2). In addition to the development of O2 , a e-Learning Toolkit (O3) will be created based on all the aforementioned.  The structure and method of delivery will be defined by the partnership and the implementation phase will include the evaluation of the pilot training course developed, so as to assess the effectiveness of the course. Each partner will have to work on all outputs and deliver their results on schedule. Regular feedback on all activities will be exchanged throughout the project, while six partner meetings are planned. The project coordinator will make sure to resolve any issues arising via regular communication.Project sustainability will be pursued through all available media (website, platform, social media, emailing lists, international/ national conferences). T4TEMP hopes to make an impact on contributing significantly in enhancing the opportunities for up-skilling  of adult educators, both nationally and at EU level, as well as for other members of the target group.

The subject of the project is computer service training including personal and professional development. The target group of the project are adult persons (in particular aged 50+) who have lack the skills in the field of computer service. In many European countries are organized training courses related to computer service, which are designed to reduce the digital gap dividing older and younger generations. The vast majority of these courses aim to provide adult learners with the technical skills connected with computers and basic programs. Adult people (especially aged 50+) belong to the people of the difficult situation on the labour market. In connection with the economic crisis, whose effects are still being felt to a large extent, many workers in this age have lost their jobs and are now unemployed. Adult people, in particular those who are struggling with difficult situation on labour market (e.g. unemployment) are also at risk of social exclusion and isolation. The project has been created in order to support adult people in social and professional development through computer service training. The aim of the project is to exchange experiences and good practices in the implementation of computer service training courses among the partners and the common creation of a training program, which takes into account not only the support for the computer, but also use it for social and professional development. Developed training program will allow adult participants for acquiring social and professional skills.

Through these mobilities, the student will - apart from reaching the professional competences required at the actual stage of their education - also obtain personal development (e.g. maturity) and stronger intercultual competence (ability to cooperate across national and cultural barriers). Thus the students will be better equipped to act on the global market for employment and life long learning, and TCAA will to a higher degree live up to the aim of the Law on VET that calls for a clear international dimension in the education - and thereby TCAA will also live up to the pedagogical manifesto of the college itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA prerequisite for being able to motivate VET students to participate in international mobility is that the teachers/counsellors, who are close to the students in compulsory school and at the transition to youth education have a solid knowledge themselves about how VET and guidance is being delivered  around Europe. Therefore, this project also gives the opportunity for teachers, student counsellors and youth guidance practitioners to strengthen their competences in this field through short mobility stays, so that thereafther, they may contribute better to promotion of VET and international mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe European partners have been choosen to represent professional and geographical diversity. Most partners have worked with TCAA for several years with mobility - some even for decades. Therefore TCAA can vouch for their experience and competence in implementing mobility on basis of written agreements and common understanding. TCAA has secures that every partner has a reasonable network of suitable host companies, and proper procedures are in place for matching student and work place. Furthermore, partners take care of arrival, introduction, ongoing monitoring, evaluation and securing that the achieved competences are documented. This is all done through regular communication with partners and students - and by letting accompanying teachers (activity 3) take part in the start of 4 of the larger group mobilities. In addition, the preparation in Denmark will include cultural understanding and handling of possible cultural chock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the student side (activities 1 and 2), the major part of the planned 52 students will be from the basic course. They will be selected on basis of professional skills, English language skills and maturity. Another group of participants will come from TCAA's college based main course (SKP). They will get a more realistic learning enviroment in real companies this way. And as something new, mobility abroad will also be offered to a small  group of recently graduated craftsmen, who will get their first job on the CV and obtian international competence.\r\n\r\nOn the teacher/counsellor side (activity 4) the planned 32 participants - regardless of their professional background - need to know how VET is provided and marketed in a broad European context, so that they will be more competent in motivating students to choose this path and to add an international angle to their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dissemination of project results TCAA will continue a series of ongoing activities that  realready put in place to promote international mobility as an integral part of VET. This is for example the world map found on every sub-college homepage. Here stories of mobility (Leonardo, Erasmus as well as the Danish PIU) are oploaded regularly in a Google map with search function. This gives the chance for primary school pupils, enrolled students at TCAA, teachers, councillors and other interested of finding information and inspiration.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, TCAA will continue running its \"PIU\" Facebook group\". Despite the name, it is not only about PIU but also Leonardo/Erasmus mobility. The group currently has 215 members, and TCAA has noticed an increased number of inquiries from comming students through this social media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe achievement of concrete competence aims during the mobilities will be carried out in close dialogue with the partners.

In this way, not only the personal development of the learners is promoted but also the possibility of getting a job on the (European) labour market. Additionally, it counteracts prospective youth unemployment. Therefore, the Elisabeth-Selbert-Schule can support the professional development of  the students and promote the quality of the apprenticeship and the further education. \r\nWithin the scope of this project the participants should be able to recognize the differences of the vocational systems and evaluate them. Moreover, practical skills are provided, a sensitisation for other cultures is initiated and flexibility and independent working are ensured. \r\nThrough the work in other vocational- or social facilities the participants are able to learn new methods and gain experience, which can be applied in their own working environment and it can be passed on to other learners. In this way the learners\u2019 competences are promoted and the curiosity towards new trends is aroused. Especially jobs in the catering trade require local flexibility. Therefore, the first steps within the programme are decisive for the further process.   \r\nFurthermore, a placement abroad supports the natural handling with other people and foreign cultures. These are factors that play a great role in the service sector and also in jobs that deal with people, who have special needs. This target group is particular important because they are a minority of whom the learners can profit a lot. After successfully completing the stay abroad the sense of self-esteem and the personality of the learners are strengthened.   \r\nBack in their home country the learners pass on their newly learned knowledge and experience along with a detailed evaluation of the vocational system. \r\nThe intercultural aspects play a substantial role for the nursery nurse trainees, because they are visiting countries without speaking the native language. Therefore, the students have to be more sensitive towards requirements and the behaviour of people of the target culture. Cultural openness and curiosity are essential, especially regarding the work with parents of children who have a migratory background. But also getting into contact with children by using the body language enables the learners to lay special focus on gestures, mimic and the overall behaviour. This is usually not possible in the dense school curriculum of the learners. Everyone included in the exchange can only profit from such cultural diversity. The acquired experience of the nursery nurse trainees can be applied to different working fields during the training course. E.g. the learners are able to find different ways of communicating. This can be helpful if the communication of a child is restricted in some way. \r\nForeign language learning should be an additional goal in the different branches of the work experience. Standardized learning results and the specific understanding between the partner institutions are the criteria for a quality-assured assessment. This makes the acknowledgement of the acquired knowledge and competences possible. \r\nFor this it is necessary that every person involved, including the participating learners, have to have a clear understanding of what has to be learned and how this is documented within the scope of the Europass.

In order to improve the feeling of \u2018being a European\u2019 an experience in a different country is a must. Not just a holiday, but a work placement, so that people can experience what the labor market has to offer in the rest of Europe. In the new Erasmus+ program it is possible for Vocational Education (VET) students to do a work placement a year after they have graduated. This is an golden opportunity to help those graduates gain work experience, as the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities-  has shown. In order to improve the current project teachers will be included in this project as they are a primary source of knowledge for students and offer a perfect position to inform and encourage students about internationalization, The Project The idea of the project is to improve the current project \u2013Introducing EU Opportunities- and to introduce recently graduated VET-students and their teachers to the European labor market. The goals of this project are; Firstly, to improve the participants labor market perspective and career possibilities. Secondly,  to increase entrepreneurship and initiative. Thirdly, to boost the participants self-confidence, self-awareness and independence. Finally, to raise their intercultural awareness and create a more positive outlook on Europe and European values and projects. There are three outcomes behind this initiative: Firstly, mobilize graduated VET-students in Europe and make them go where there is enough work in their field.  There is a good chance they stay with the company that has a job offer.Secondly, introducing graduated VET-students to different work techniques and give them valuable work experience they can take back home in order to gain a better position in the local labor market. Thirdly, creating a modern viewed teacher when it comes to internationalization. This means that teachers will be open minded when it comes to the opportunities the European labour market offers to their students. The aim is that this positive outlook will reflect on the students and encourage them to take the step towards an international mobility. DetailsThe participants in this project will be recently graduated VET-students (max. 1 year), because they will not be aided by the schools and will most likely be a left over group. The beauty of this group is that they have no obligations back home (i.e. they do not have to make a school exam or worry about school guidelines) because they have finished their education. Making them the perfect group to explore the rest of Europe and experience firsthand the chances the continent has to offer. The work placement does not have to be a long one, it will last for two weeks. With a preference for two weeks if the participant does not speak the language of the destination country properly. This period is long enough for the participant to get a taste of Europe and decide whether they want to stay in the country they did their work placement or go back home and share their experience on the local labor market. In addition, the period is long enough for employers to see if the participant has what it takes to be taken on full time.  This means that the work placement can have two outcomes. The first being that the student will stay for a longer period of time, because they have gained employment at the company they did their internship (job shadowing) for. And the second being that the participant will return home with increased knowledge, experience, self-confidence, self-awareness, independence and an appreciation of Europe and European values and projects. By undertaking such an experience the participant are already improving their entrepreneurship and initiative taking.

Each person has been selected on the basis of specific criteria which have been defined by the Academy: committment to innovation, willingness to train in order to develop their skills and the committment to partake in a training program which not only includes an European mobility but also includes preparatory activities and the use of their new skills as part of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe training program is based on a diagnostical evaluation of the linguistic capacities of the participants and defines the training activities which will take place before, during and after their mobility.

We aim to tackle the shortcoming of previous technologies by using completely soluble formate as a mediator between electrical current and living cells. Within an integrated electrobioreactor, CO2 will be reduced to formate at a very high rate, and the formate will be consumed by an engineered E. coli to produce propane and isobutene, gaseous hydrocarbons that are easy to separate from the liquid broth. Both propane and isobutene can be further converted into a range of products, including excellent fuel substitutes (e.g., isooctane), using conventional chemical engineering methodologies. Our approach comprises a truly interdisciplinary effort. Material scientists will design novel electrode compositions and structures, which will be used by electrochemists to optimize electrochemical formate production at high efficiency and current density. Metabolic engineers will adapt E. coli for growth on formate via two synthetic formate assimilation pathways, specifically designed to fit the metabolism of this model bacterium.

In the end of each day during the event, every player will participate in reflection meetings supervised and guided by the coordinators in order to discuss their views on the challenges and the European shared values they corresponded to.\r\nApart from the understanding of the European Union shared values, one of the project's main goals is the development of a strong European identity among the participants and the creation of a core group that will act in the youth sector at a local, national and international level. This core group will try to evolve into an active, multinational and multicultural European community that is interested in passing European Union shared values and ideas to new people in the rest of Europe. The core group creation goal will be achieved during the event as the coordinators will use team-building techniques to make sure that all participants are collaborating in a friendly, pleasant environment. Besides these, several social, communication and English language skills will be practiced and knowledge of several mythologies (primarily the Greek one) will be acquired by participants. Last but not least, the project aims to further develop the teaching method that will be used during the event.\r\nThe project will be completed in 3 phases: in the first, preparatory phase, all practical amendments will be taken care of (flights reservations, accommodation etc), research on several ethnic mythologies will be undergone and in general all necessary action will be taken to ensure the event runs smoothly, without surprises and with the expected learning outcomes. Phase 2 is the actual youth exchange in Athens, while in phase 3 coordinators will contact participants to write down their impressions and assist them to take initiative at a local level to expand the community and multiply the benefits of the event.\r\nParticipants will be chosen through informal youth groups that act in the youth and role-playing games sectors. All partners will do their best to include as participants young people with less opportunities, mainly youths with educational and financial difficulties. The collaborative framework within which the event will have been structured (coordinators will make sure that all teams formed during the event will have members of each and every nationality and background and will do their best to keep people moving among teams to amplify inter-cultural relations) will help participants understand European Union shared values and how these are perceived by European citizens of different culture.

Distinguishing between these possibilities is vital to understanding our most fundamental cognitive faculties and the origin of modern human cognition itself.\n\nThe current project will render this problem tractable with the groundbreaking proposal that language bootstraps the cognitive complexity of the human mind by enhancing its ability to form and manipulate more elaborate mental representations than would otherwise be possible without language. In an innovative programme of investigation that uses cutting-edge methods from experimental psychology, psycholinguistics, cognitive modelling, and corpus linguistics, we will examine how words interact with conceptual knowledge gleaned from perceptual and action experience in forming mental representations across a range of fundamental cognitive tasks, including categorisation, memory performance, and abstract thought. We will test whether and how language provides indispensable aid to cognitive processing that struggles to complete under time pressure or that strains working memory capacity, and how such aid could have influenced cognitive evolution.\n\nFindings of this project will answer whether language provides critical enhancement to the achievable complexity of cognition, and whether language use could have brought about the sudden flowering of art, fine tools and culture that are the hallmarks of complex cognition in modern humans.

Recent work has shown that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have enhanced tree growth in forests. However these increases in growth can also cause \u2018priming effects\u2019 whereby microbial degradation of soil organic matter is stimulated by fresh carbon inputs, such as plant litter, releasing additional carbon from the soil. Given that forest soils represent the largest terrestrial carbon pool, priming effects could cause a major release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Despite their potential importance in ecosystem carbon dynamics under environmental change, the processes and mechanisms underlying priming effects are still poorly understood. This is in part due to the enormous disparities in the experimental scales and methods required to study microbial processes vs. ecosystem carbon dynamics and the difficulties in extrapolating the results of laboratory studies to the ecosystem level. This project will significantly advance our understanding of the role of priming effects in forest carbon dynamics in different forest types and reconcile the experimental problems of scale using multidisciplinary nested studies across multiple scales. The nested design will explicitly test the validity of extrapolations made at one scale to predict effects at another.

A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing. Each researcher will experience both academic and commercial environments thanks to the strong industrial involvement, resulting in multi-skilled, industry-focused graduates.

The interest to this area has surged in recent years due to the rapid development of fabrication and measurement techniques in nanophysics and physics of ultra-cold atomic gases. Nanoelectronics devices (such as quantum point contacts, nanotubes and organic nanowires) and ultracold gases in elongated optical traps are the experimental systems where one-dimensional quantum fluids are encountered. While the main focus of nanoelectronics has always been on the electrical and spin transport, with only limited access to other aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics, the amazing degree of control over atomic systems has transformed the physics of one-dimensional fluids into a rapidly expanding universe of non-equilibrium phenomena. Quantum quenches, explosions and collisions of atomic clouds, diffusion and drift of quantum impurities, motion and decay of solitary waves have been observed and mapped in real time measurements.  The fundamental value of the research in this direction lies in the strongly correlated nature of  one-dimensional  quantum systems, which makes their kinetic theory a largely unexplored territory.  For these systems, the application of traditional tools of the kinetic theory, such as the Boltzmann collision integral and non-linear equations of hydrodinamics meets with serious conceptual difficulties. Indeed, it is usually impossible to represent the low-energy excitations of a one-dimensional system as a collection of weakly interacting quasiparticles. It is also impossible to consistently quantize non-linear hydrodynamcis within the standard framework of perturbative quantum field theory.

The network will train PhD students and produce new technology to answer critical issues in our understanding of human development. A core assumption of the network is that development of perception, motivation, and cognition is grounded in, and develops through, our own actions (von Hofsten, 2004). We learn about our physical environment by actively engaging with the world. As we develop new action capabilities, new elements of the environment become salient to us. This process is especially prominent early in infancy when action capacities and an understanding of the world develop. The nature of developmental research demands a multi-method approach. As a result, we propose to rigorously train ESRs such that they obtain two or more techniques required to study the relationship between brain and behaviour in early social development.   We will conduct research and training within and between academic and industry partners on the role of attention in action, prospective control, social interactions, and semantics in action.

In nanocircuits the electrons can behave coherently over the circuit dimension and thus follow the rules of wave motion rather than Ohm's law. To achieve coherence, however, electron scattering lengths must be larger than the sample size. That demands high purity to limit impurity scattering, but even limiting thermal scattering, by working at millikelvin temperature, we are still confined to circuits on the nanoscale. This provides the motivation for this application: there is an implicit imperative in nanoscience that there are enormous advantages to be gained at much lower temperatures.

One of the major goals of the project is to design this technology such that the resulting environments are secure and trustworthy.<br/><br/>The key concept that will be developed within the project in order to realize these objectives is called Adaptable Pervasive Flow (APF). Many processes in real life are defined in terms of flows either implicitly of explicitly. A flow consists of a set of actions that is glued together by an execution plan in order to achieve a goal under a set of constraints. This resembles the well-known workflow concept. However, APFs represent a much broader concept that enables adaptable pervasive applications. They are situated in the real world, i.e. they are attached to entities like artifacts or people, moving with them through different contexts. While being carried along, they model the behavior intended for their entity and adapt the entity's environment to this behavior. Thus, when a mobile user carries a flow that specifies his prospective actions, the pervasive computing environment will be set up for him by the flow. The flow itself may also adapt to reflect changes. In order to achieve this, flows are context-aware. They can sense the context pertaining to their entity's current environment as well as the entity's actual activities.<br/><br/>In the proposed project, new mechanisms, methods, and principles for adaptable flow-based pervasive applications will be investigated, and a respective programming paradigm will be developed.", 442052.0, 3543952.0, 3, 5, "Allow", null, "http://www.lancaster.ac.uk", null, "fp7_85272_999840984"], [1293840000000, 1419984000000, "Intelligent Context-Aware Systems for Healthcare, Wellness, and Assisted Living", "Lancaster University", "Context awareness has the potential to revolutionise the way people interact with information technology.

Within the framework of these societal challenges, technological development \u2013though necessary- is not enough to guarantee social change and innovation. Yet, we still know very little about these innovation processes in social contexts, what institutional conditions are key, the role of culture and values in their development, and why this happens in some countries more easily than in others. The point is to shift from \u201cscience in society\u201d to \u201cscience for society\u201d. This has to do directly with the education of Early Career Researchers (ECRs), particularly PhD students and post-PhD researchers, who in recent years have experienced an increase in their responsibility and need for transversality and applicability of their results. This is also in line with the European policies concerning the training and promotion of new generations of researchers \u2013 of which the numbers are increasing. \r\n\r\nThese concerns compel us to develop our proposal around two nuclear goals:\r\n\u2022 To reconceptualize the role of ECRs in order to enable them to successfully face current societal challenges and establish satisfactory careers.\r\n\u2022 To enhance the development of ECRs\u2019 identities and careers through training.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To design, create and assess interactive on-line research-based resources to help ECRs (PhD students and post-doc) to face research challenges and strategies for developing resilience and regulating emotions.\r\n2. To develop, validate and set up digital tools that contribute to develop ECR identity and career trajectories through effective participation in the professional and scientific communities of reference.\r\n3. To raise awareness within the European scientific community of the importance of researcher identity and career development.\r\n4. To showcase and disseminate proven methodologies, tools and practices for ECR to successfully address challenges faced in advancing their careers.\r\n \r\nThe RID-SSISS addresses the following target groups: ECRs across disciplines, Higher Education institutions and educational stakeholders (doctoral school directors, graduate program directors, supervisors within and outside academia), and Research funding agencies and policy makers.\r\n\r\nRegarding results, RID-SSISS will create not only a training on-line platform but also a social networking space, in the process of becoming the first European community designed for ECRs in Europe. Through this social interactive platform \"A researcher like me\", the exchange of best practices and a rapid replication of best cases will be promoted. The platform will be complemented and connected to a complete set of interactive tools also launched by the project (Android and iOS mobile apps, twitter and blogs).\r\n \r\nOutputs of the project will also consist of a set of validated training courses, workshops and interactive questionnaires that will provide ECRs with the unique opportunity to develop effective strategies to negotiate their research careers. Institutions and stakeholders will be integrated into the process of validation (design and piloting) and implementation of the training outputs to make effective changes at social, institutional and work-condition levels. \r\n\r\nThese materials will contribute to ECRs gaining the following competencies: \r\n- Most suitable strategies to manage innovative scientific communication addressed to different audiences. This implies participants being able to master not only scientific writing (journals, conferences, reports and reviews, grant applications), but also alternative genres to disseminate research (blogs, wikis, websites) and networking (social and professional platforms and consortia).\r\n \r\n-Resources to grow as independent researchers looking for funding their own projects; develop and consolidate new research profiles, looking for research ethics, sustainability and equity; and negotiate their career trajectories by analysing their potential and real affordances and limitations according to international job market possibilities. Such researchers might contribute to substantial changes in European research in terms of developing interdisciplinary projects required to face societal challenges.\r\n \r\n-Knowledge and strategies to appropriately balance work demands with personal life since research has shown this is a competence, which has been overlooked in European countries, in which junior researchers feel unable to develop their research careers along with a satisfactory personal life.

HELPcare proposes to help close the care gap via better management of the education and training of care workers to develop a more professional workforce that will attract recruits and has recognised progression pathways. The problem:\r\n1) The EU population is aging rapidly\r\n2) Many care workers are engaged in the informal economy\r\n3) Health & social care workers in the formal economy find it very difficult to access training and development opportunities;\r\n4) Qualifications for care workers are not a pre-requisite for employment & there are no agreed education and training standards across the EU for this sort of work.\r\n5)  Health and Social Care work is seen as undesirable and low status with no recognised routes for progression into wider caring professions and with no HE-based training available in this specialist area for managers/leaders of care provision. \r\nThe overall aim of HELPcare is to develop and transfer innovative practices in education for the qualification and professionalization of health and social care workers as well as encourage people to view health and social care work as a positive career choice with recognized routes for progression through VET and from VET to HE. \r\nObjectives:\r\n1. To develop a model based upon best practice for training and regulation standards for existing home / healthcare workers that can be adapted and adopted across the EU either nationally, regionally or locally dependent on setting\r\n2. To work with those currently providing home /health and socialcare services  (via undeclared labour or via provider organizations), VET establishments and users and commissioners of homecare to develop a model of CPD  to develop pathways to professionalisation and provide new routes for progression from home /healthcare work into the wider range of health and social care and to explore the potential of HE-based qualifications in health and social care management.\r\n3. To explore existing health and social care qualifications in partner countries and develop a new model of work-based/VET-based learning outcomes for health and social care that will fit into the HELPcare framework for professionalisation.  \r\na. Includes developing skills mapping tools for existing care workers to assist in their effective CPD & the development of a careers guidance portfolio aimed at highlighting the possibilities of a career in home health care\r\n4. Develop a transnational network and community of practice comprising service commissioners, policy makers and VET providers to disseminate best practice in  health and social care workers education and CPD throughout the EU.\r\n\r\nOur participants will include health and social care workers from both the formal and informal sectors (500), vulnerable older people (100) who make use of care workers (and the families of vulnerable older people), employers of care workers in the formal economy (150) VET providers, HE providers, commissioners of care from statutory bodies, third sector and local, regional and national government agencies. \r\n\r\nActivities include: A survey of 500 care workers to establish educational level & need, interviews with 100 care workers to further explore barriers to education, interviews with 100 older people to explore the impact of untrained versus trained carers on their lives, work with VET /HE providers to establish clear learning outcomes for VET based training and potential for HE training at level 4. Work with employers to develop models of work-based learning & commissioners to explore best practice in care, training, recruitment & progression.\r\n\r\nOutcomes include:  An online course of CPD for care workers & pilot of this, careers guidance framework, skills mapping tools, progression pathways, ECVET learning outcomes, a conference to share our findings, policy briefings, education for commissioners and employers in strategies for professionalizing the workforce and best practice in financing training and regulating care work, briefings for HE providers on potential for progression to HE.\r\n\r\nImpact: bridging the care gap is essential if the EU is to manage the rapid demographic change taking place. This project will help raise the profile of a critically important issue & has the potential to offer innovative ways of using education & training to professionalize & thus develop an under-valued workforce that currently has difficulty recruiting and retaining workers.

However, as HEIs we are also becoming aware of the collateral repercussions of digital overload and uncontrolled use of digital communications and social media, from the mental health of individual students, to societal impacts, such as the controversies surrounding free speech and radicalization. \r\n\r\nThe crux of the challenge is that access to digital media has outpaced our ability to guide its responsible use. Many teaching staff feel disadvantaged by having grown up in a pre-digital world, and yet are concerned with the wellbeing of their students and their ability to thrive in digital settings.\r\n\r\nIn response, Digital Wellbeing has a clear objective: increase the capacity of lecturers and teachers to integrate digital education in a way that promotes the digital wellbeing of students. Through building teacher capacity, the project will improve students\u2019 abilities to manage their online time, make the most of digital learning, critically assess the media they consume and create, and become responsible, confident digital citizens.\r\n\r\nWe will achieve this by pursuing the following specific objectives:\r\n- Identify and showcase innovative, participative approaches to developing digital wellbeing in education (IO1: Compendium of Best Practice)\r\n- Upskill teachers in confident use of digital education, combining digital wellbeing with effective development of other digital competences (IO2: Digital Wellbeing Education OERs & APP)\r\n- Develop a Digital Wellbeing App to be used as a stand-alone resource for students, and as an additional teacher resource to be used alongside the OERs(IO2: Digital Wellbeing Education OERs & APP) .  \r\n- Produce a Teachers\u2019 Digital Pedagogy Toolkit to support teaching staff in developing their own digital competences and mainstreaming digital literacy skills in their teaching activities.

In encouraging teachers to integrate digital wellbeing teaching into their programmes, institutions  offer higher quality learning opportunities for students. Thus, they achieve a greater contribution to societal needs, and provide a more well-rounded civic and social education of value to society and students themselves. \r\nc) Students make the most of digital learning and develop more critical thinking skills, enabling them to critically assess the media they consume and create. They achieve improved outcomes in terms of their academic achievement, social competences and active citizenship.\r\n \r\nOverall the project is designed to contribute to  a shift in understanding of the role of HEIs in contributing to digital wellbeing and the provision of well-rounded education that contributes to socially-responsible adults.

Dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties with word decoding, spelling, handwriting, reading, memory and attention span (Kormos & Smith, 2012).  The British Dyslexia Association say that 10% of the population have dyslexia, although figures quoted in the USA can be 15-20%, so the need to improve support for this learning difficulty is widespread (http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk).  \r\n\r\nThe CIELL project is a collaboration between comic artists, language teachers and learning technology researchers, to create innovative open educational resources that enrich teaching practice  and support dyslexic learners.  The CIELL project is an extension of the ERASMUS+ ViLi project (https://www.viliproject.eu/) that aims to improve the visual literacies of educators, making learning more visual through static (e.g. comics, mind maps), dynamic (e.g. video) and interactive visuals (e.g. virtual reality).  The CIELL project further develops static visual representations in learning.\r\n\r\nThe CIELL project aims to address the EU policies on social inclusion and digital competence by:\r\n- enhancing the digital competence of second language teachers by providing a Compendium of open educational resources including a Teacher\u2019s Pack and examples of the good practice in the use of comics in education, and\r\n- developing innovative teaching materials delivered in a mobile application (app) to support more visual teaching and learning practices and increase the social inclusion of dyslexic learners.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the app will support dyslexic students studying for the British Council examination (IELTS) and Cambridge University English proficiency (C2), with a focus on opinion essays, reviews and article writing.  For example, writing guidelines and sample essays will be created in comic form and other visual representations such as mind maps.  The topics of the essay writing will be based on the 17 United Nations goals for 2030 (http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) as they have global relevance and appeal.\r\n\r\nEducational researchers, language teachers and comic artists will create and refine the innovative teaching content and practices and these open educational resources will be shared freely, worldwide.  Dyslexic language learners (60) and language teachers (30) will work closely with developers to refine the app, the teaching content (comics) and the Teacher\u2019s Pack.  A survey will also be conducted to discover examples of good practice in the use of comics in education, for inclusion in the Compendium, and it is expected that there will be 100-200 respondents.  A conference for 100 researchers and practitioners will be arranged on the use of comic art for serious educational purposes.  Dissemination is expected to reach 8000 through social media and inclusion within two massive open online courses. \r\n\r\nThe project will adopt an Educational Design Research methodology (McKenney & Reeves, 2012) that aims to design an intervention in a real educational setting, it is practice oriented as it is assessed by its practicality to users, it is interactive and participatory, as end-users are involved in a cyclical approach to design and evaluation where user perceptions influence redesign and redevelopment thereby maximising practical relevance.  It also aims to improve theoretical knowledge by increasing understanding of what works best in teaching practice.\r\n\r\nWe will strengthen the skills of educators in higher education and other educational settings by designing new content, linking visual approaches to language teaching to facilitate more socially inclusive education.  As teaching English as a Second Language and the writing of English is a key competence required for accessing Higher Education and global migration, the potential impact is huge.

However, teachers often lack awareness, training and resources to cater for DLs' special needs in mixed ability classes as indicated by previous projects (DysTEFL 1-2, CalDys2) we intend to build on. Although there are some English resources meant for DLs on the international market, materials in German are scarce, and in the target countries of designed task bank (Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland) there are no bilingual learning materials for individual learner use or differentiated classroom work to provide targeted support for DLs. To cater for this educational need, the project aims to produce a flexible, thematically organised English and German digital task bank for DLs participating in integrated primary school education across classes 4th-8th (age group 10-14), up to proficiency level A2 according to CEFR. It will contain skills development tasks addressing the difficulties of DLs, graded tasks allowing for alternative solutions of the same assignment, as well as open-ended individual and group project tasks encouraging a task-based approach and cooperative learning. As a specificity, ENGaGE will be based on a multilingual and multicultural approach providing native language support in the languages of, and (inter)cultural content related to the target countries: Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. \"Screenager\", the digital surface hosting the material is an innovative, teacher operated educational platform. It fosters a multisensory approach to learning with more than ten task types and the possibility to integrate a wide variety of materials (games, videos, pictures, word and pdf files, etc.), as well as a monitoring function for teachers to follow and shape learner progress individually.\r\nThe project will be realised in the cooperation of seven partner institutions from four countries: the University of Miskolc, the University of Szeged, Lingua-Met Gp. and Navigates Up. from Hungary, Lancaster University (UK), Masaryk University (Czech Republic) and Warsaw University (Poland). The partners contribute to the project a broad spectrum of expertise including educational research and teacher training practice in the field of learning with SEN, and developing digital learning platforms and printed course materials for the targeted age group with and without SEN. As associated partners, primary schools from each target country will join the project to try the material and provide feedback. Six national language teaching associations from the partner countries have also volunteered to help disseminate the results of the project. \r\nThe activities to be completed within the framework of the project will include the development of the ENGaGE digital course in English and German with audio recordings and animated audiovisual materials produced with the Powtoons Animated Video Builder platform, built-in language games, sample lesson plans, teachers' manual and learners' guide. The material will be tested in the associated partner schools, where the partners will collect feedback, conduct classroom observation and subsequently report the outcomes. To familiarise language teachers with the potential of the ENGaGE course and digital materials to individualise the learning process, a 15-hour Teacher Training Programme will be developed and conducted locally in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. Communication and cooperation between the partners will be facilitated by five partner meetings. Finally, the results will be disseminated on the project's website and Twitter account, the websites and social media sites of the partners, in Lancaster University\u2019s Dyslexia and Language Teaching Massive Open Online Learning Course, on the EU's School Education Gateway platform, in various media appearances, academic publications and presentations, and at three multiplication events organised in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. \r\nThe project aims to raise awareness of the special educational needs of DLs in foreign language learning, and provide ideas and resources for teachers to facilitate their individualised treatment in mixed-ability classes. Awareness and information might help teachers to develop a more supportive and proactive attitude towards the education of DLs. For DLs the course offers a tailor-made, attractive learning environment to increase their engagement,  motivation, activity and subsequently improve foreign language attainment.

Videographics (the use of visual images) and infographics (the visual representations of data) are areas of increasing importance. Forbes Insights (\u201cExecutives embrace non-text world\u201d, 2010) highlight that executives and business people prefer using non-text formats for a wide range of goals. Visual thinking strategies, video storytelling and Vlogs (video diaries/blogs) for reflection are also on the rise. The National Commission on Writing (2006, p.15) says \"Thinking on the screen\" is as important as \"thinking on paper\" in the 21st century. This under researched area is rising in importance and competence in video and visual thinking is crucial for communication in education and business.In Higher Education(HE), the EU is lagging behind the rest of the world in modernisation and internationalisation, e.g. in the UK the bienniel UCISA Technology Enhanced Learning survey (2014) found that Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have made little impact on HE however, video recording of lectures is increasing. Video technologies are being increasingly used in online learning and particularly in MOOCs. MOOCs have great potential for opening up education and making it accessible to all irrespective of institutional boundaries, national borders, or educational context. The need for competences in video/visual thinking is increasing and especially useful for supporting dyslexic learners.- Objectives The ViLi project aims to improve the performance and efficiency of education and training by:- developing the competences of educators in video and visual thinking strategies, by delivering a MOOC that is open to all in e.g. vocational training, business and further education.- supporting the opening up of education by providing pedagogical materials and open educational resources (OERs) developed and evaluated through two MOOCs on video/visual thinking strategies.- Activities and MethodologyTo achieve these objectives the project will:- research current practice in the use of video/visual thinking strategies and to combine it with a review of literature to develop an innovative theory that encapsulates best practice and theory and draws from experience in multiple fields. Pedagogical materials will be developed based on this new theory with a mosaic of case studies that show how to improve knowledge representation or construction exploiting the potential of visual/video thinking strategies.- to promote the use of video and visual thinking strategies in online learning and MOOCs through the dissemination of OERs developed and evaluated through two MOOCs on video/visual thinking strategies.A design based research methodology will be used to develop and evaluate the OERs and pedagogical materials and informed grounded theory methodology will be used to generate the innovative theory of best practice in video/visual thinking. Social media will be used to inform stakeholders and recruit participants to the MOOC. The MOOC will enable testing and evaluation to lead to refinement of the resources, as well as the creation of a supportive learning community that co-creates a WIKI of case studies to showcase examples and encourage re-use of resources. - ImpactThere are two major intellectual outputs produced: pedagogical materials; and open educational resources (e.g. MOOC on video/visual literacies, WIKI, videos). The pedagogical materials and OERs can be freely reused by educators, vocational trainers and those working in human resources, wholly or in part. The supportive learning community and WIKI will help to ensure the sustainability of the resources produced. The potential impact on HE, vocational training and business is increased competences of educators in communication through video/visual literacies, and support for the development and use of MOOCs within Europe through open educational resources and the MOOC on visual literacies. Papers in academic and practitioner conferences and journals will open up further research and innovation on video/visual literacies and MOOCs in education.

The barriers faced by migrants for finding a job in the receiving country include, among others, insufficient skills and experience (especially language barriers, low level of education or a lack of local work experience) and difficulties in navigating host-country labour markets (including poor information about how to present themselves and look for a job). \r\nWorKit will address the above needs and challenges through the application of innovative context-related and learner-centred tools providing language information linked to the migrants\u2019 immediate needs for employment. The main project products (Job Language Kit for Migrants, WorKit Online Interactive Tool and WorKit Mobile App) will provide language information on work and employment, addressing specific areas in the process of seeking, finding and keeping a job.

The impetuous youth may think they are onto a good thing only to find they have lost money through unwise choice. The project is therefore designed to provide older school age children and students with a comprehensive and easy to access guide to managing their money now and hopefully throughout their whole life.\r\nThis is something that is currently missing from the schools curriculum but which represents a key life skill, and also has many commercial attributes and employability skills attached to it\r\nThe aim would therefore be to give students (target age 14-21) a basic understanding and competence of personal finance issues that they are likely to face.

The project encapsulates a research element which then makes an international comparison of the partner countries (UK, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey & Sweden) Which informs the development of the training package that is easily transferable and accessible to individuals, carers, family and professionals alike.  The training package will be cascaded on a one-to-one basis or in small groups.

(Alzheimer Europe 2012 stats) There are more than 10 million across Europe and 44 million globally. Directly linked to longevity, this is set to double over the next 20 years. Until, indeed if, dementia becomes curable, it represents an increasing cost challenge for governments, as well as an increasing social and moral challenge for humanity.  These challenges therefore create demand by governments, communities and families for new, innovative and low- cost services which help to manage progress of the disease, maintain quality of life and help people stay away from expensive chronic support services \r\nThis means that care for people with dementia is a growth industry and offers economic opportunities for European workers.  Furthermore, the scope to use increasingly sophisticated ICT to help people with dementia is likewise a growth field, with new assistive technologies regularly coming on stream.
