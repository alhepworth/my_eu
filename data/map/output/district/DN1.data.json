The main purpose of this project is to provide VET learners with skills that match the needs of the labour market \u2013 national and transnational - and thereby to increase their chances for a smooth transition into stabile employment and self-employment.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project is to increase the knowledge and self confidence of VET apprenticesin European technical structure and techniques and improve these skills which will make them multi skilled in the hair and beauty industry.The activities aim at increasing the employability, self-employability and horizontal and vertical mobility of participants in the local, national and EU labour market promoting marketability of their curricula with previous work experience in the European context, internationally recognized certifications, good foreign language preparation (especially work-specific); and to stimulate a desire to update and refresh their skills and learning also after the school training and the traineeship. \r\n\r\nThe project, of a 24 months duration, has the specific objective to develop and certify practical skills on state-of-the-art equipment in companies that work with cutting-edge technologies, and soft skills (such as dealing with customers) in a real-world environment to 60 students (4 groups of 15). The groups of participants aged 17 years or older, enrolled in the 2nd year of the Hairstyle and Beauty course, will take part in a mobility activity in Bergamo, Italy. \r\n\r\nThis objective will be achieved through traineeships in Italy in modern beauty and hair salons. Mobility will last 2 weeks and will be preceded by a preparatory phase (pre-departure and on-arrival) to introduce the experience from the cultural and practical point of view, contextualizing them within the professional training which they will be attending. The mobility will include 2-week work-based training, that will include a 1-day on-arrival preparation and a 1-day final evaluation, organized by the HO. It is decided that the mobility lasts 2 weeks in order for the learners to have enough time to be introduced to their new surroundings, become acquainted with the working environment, absorb a basic specific language terminology and to have enough time for a quality training process.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the host country is linked to the fact that Italy represents one of the reference points in Europe for the professional standards of the hairdressing sector and trends.\r\n\r\nThe project is promoted by Oracle in collaboration with the HO IKAROS. The HO has a consolidated experience in training VET learners, and taking part in transnational and international mobility programmes for VET learners. The HO has collaborated in VET learner mobility programmes with Oracle. The project was a natural continuation and a reinforcement of an ongoing cooperation between the applicant and the host organization.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of VET learners in the partner countries will improve social cohesion and international cooperation. The cooperation between the VET training institutions will, on one side, contribute to the internationalization of their courses, comparison and division of best practices, creation of new cooperation projects in the future and the possibility of involving new international partners in future projects. This will inevitably promote intercultural learning of all parties included. The visibility of the project, ensured by the dissemination activities of the partners involved, will make visible the quality of VET training and employment and professional opportunities, making vocational training a more modern and attractive learning option. Finally, the resulting increase in the number of qualified workforce in the respective sectors will bring upon a reduction of the unemployment rate, increase in longterm employment and consequentially contribute to the economic growth on the European level. The new workforce will not only be more qualified for the respective area of work, but also be more adaptable to international and intercultural working environments. Also, it will influence the international labour force mobility, with qualified young people equipped with intercultural and interpersonal skills for finding employment abroad.", "http://www.oracle-uk.com", "Oracle Training Consultants ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013057_coordinator"]]}}, "2DY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1314835200000, 1409443200000, "Design of a pan-European Infrastructure for Large Apparatus studying Grand Unification, Neutrino Astrophysics and Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillations", "Alan Auld Group Limited", "Key questions in physics can be answered only by constructing a giant underground observatory to search for rare events and study terrestrial and astrophysical neutrinos.

This mobility project provides an invaluable opportunity for the young people to start to build international contacts and gain a greater awareness of the world around them. Over the two-year project period, we will send 24 students to Link\u00f6ping, Sweden in the areas of Childcare, Construction, and Animal Care and 8 Catering students to Gijon, Spain. Additionally, 16 accompanying people will join the students.  Students will undertake a 2-week work placement in an external company within their chosen vocational field. They will work alongside members of staff from the host country, participating in all normal day-to-day activities of the company. Their progress will be monitored and recorded by the accompanying staff member and a designated member of staff at the host company. Students will also self-assess themselves at specific intervals throughout the mobility via evaluation forms in the Student Logbook, such they will be able to clearly see their own progress, in their own words. Cultural activities will take place outside of working hours. We envisage significant professional and personal impacts on the participants. This project aims to give students a more holistic understanding of their chosen vocation, and thereby equally increasing their global employability skills. Moreover, students will gain new skills and knowledge that would not be feasible form the UK due to differences/limitations in resources and regulations; this will be key for their future employability. The long-term benefits of TRADES 5 are expected to have an impact both on an organisational and participant level. From an organisation standpoint it will increase our European profile, thus leading to new collaborations within Europe and beyond to further enhance our international provision.  From a participant level, as we have previously seen in past participants, the long-term benefits of even a two-week mobility are immense; the students gain insight into their own capabilities as professional members of the global workforce, and grow on a personal level that is not possible whilst only remaining in their home country.

Furthermore, four persons will accompany the under age students.\r\nThe activities last throughout the whole project, 24 months. Special emphasis lies on the contact with the partners and the companies abroad. Students will be trained and prepared for international dealings, strengthening their languages skills. The last stage of this project consists in concluding interviews where students prove the gain development and maturity.\r\nThe methodology used to develop the project consists of three stages: First, finding a partner who is willing to hosts students and offers training in English. Second, maintaining a constant communication with the companies. Finally, continuous monitoring of students in the mobility period as well as evaluating and reflecting effects and results.\r\nThe results will benefit the development of basic skills, focusing primarily on intercultural competence, communicative competence and social-personal competence; besides developing skills that are characteristic to its area. These results will be presented in the training\u00b4s final report, the Europass-Mobility, which in long-term will improve the prospects of finding employment. The expected effect of this project is not limited to participating students, but extends to the Foundation itself, gaining international experience, improvement in the process and innovation of the organization. Moreover, partners that welcome students from different countries will profit from supporting young talents. In addition, a positive influence on the neighborhood of our school can be noticed because of motivated and confident students.\r\nLong-term benefits can be proven by similar European projects the Foundation has been involved in since 2008.

The main purpose of this project is to provide VET learners with skills that match the needs of the labour market \u2013 national and transnational - and thereby to increase their chances for a smooth transition into work life.The objectives of this project is to organize activities aimed at increasing the employability, self-employability and horizontal and vertical mobility of participants in the local, national and EU labour market promoting marketability of their curricula with previous work experience in the European context, internationally recognized certifications, good foreign language preparation (especially work-specific); and to stimulate a desire to update and refresh their skills and learning, also after the school training and the traineeship. The project, of a 24 months duration, has the specific objective to develop and certify practical skills on state-of-the-art equipment in companies that work with cutting-edge technologies, and soft skills (such as dealing with customers) in a real-world environment to 80 students (4 groups of 20). Two groups of 20 students enrolled in the 4th year of the Hairstyle and Beauty course will take part in a mobility activity in Doncaster, UK, while two groups of 20 students enrolled in the 4th year of the IT course will go to Dublin, Ireland. This objective will be achieved through traineeships in UK and Ireland in modern beauty and hair salons and IT companies. Mobility will last 7 weeks and will be preceded by a preparatory phase (pre-departure and on-arrival) to introduce the experience from the cultural and practical point of view, contextualizing them within the professional training which they will be attending. The mobility will include 7-week work-based training, that will include a 1-day on-arrival preparation, a 1-day midterm evaluation and a 1-day final evaluation, organized by the HO. It is decided that the mobility lasts 7 weeks in order for the learners to have enough time to adjust and get introduced to their new surroundings, become acquainted with the working environment, absorb the specific language terminology, to have enough time for a quality training process. It has been proven in our previous projects that, although the training periods of 4 weeks and less brought good results, all of the parties involved (SO, HOs and learners) expressed the need for a slightly longer training period, in order to have a well-balanced, all-encompassing training plan.The choice of the host country is linked to the fact that UK represents the reference point in Europe for the professional standards of the hairdressing sector and trends, while the Irish industrial development approach focuses greatly on high technology sectors for computer hardware, software and ICT services.The project is promoted by Ikaros in collaboration with the HOs Oracle Training Consultants OTC and Emerald Cultural Institute ECI. Both of the HOs have a consolidated experience in training VET learners, and taking part in transnational and international mobility programmes for VET learners. Both of the HOs have collaborated in VET learner mobility programmes with Ikaros. The project was a natural continuation and a reinforcement of an ongoing cooperation between the applicant and the HOs.The mobility of VET learners in the partner countries will improve social cohesion and international cooperation. The cooperation between the VET training institutions will, on one side, contribute to the internationalization of their courses, comparison and division of best practices, creation of new cooperation projects in the future and the possibility of involving new international partners in future projects. This will inevitably promote intercultural learning of all parties included. The visibility of the project, ensured by the dissemination activities of the partners involved, will make visible the quality of VET training and employment and professional opportunities, making vocational training a more modern and attractive learning option. Finally, the resulting increase in the number od qualified workforce in the respective sectors will bring upon a reduction of the unemployment rate and consequentially contribute to the economic growth on the European level. The new workforce will not only be qualified for the respective area of work, but also be more adaptable to international and intercultural working environments. Also, it will influence the international labour force mobility, with qualified young people equipped with intercultural and interpersonal skill for finding employment abroad.", "http://www.oracle-uk.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004510_2"]]}}}}
