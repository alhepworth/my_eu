Schools should help people develop relateable identities, which should not only include that which is specific for a nation, but also that which is European and global. \r\nTeaching art is a way to increase the pupils\u2019 knowledge of our collective European cultural heritage. Today, exchanges of culture and communication are happening across borders to a much greater degree than before. The main goal of schools, therefore, must be to prepare pupils to live in a changing society, where values and cultures meet, and to give pupils the tools they require to participate and act in matters concerning the society.\r\n\r\nICT is an important tool for all partner countries. Both teachers and pupils need to develop their knowledge of ICT. In today\u2019s interconnected society, it is natural to communicate using ICT. The available digital and/or technical solutions give us the possibility to participate in each others\u2019 art projects and exhibitions in a rapid and varying fashion.\r\n\r\nWe are five schools in this project:  \r\n- A primary school from Northern Ireland with 282 pupils age 4-11 years old. The school is coeducational and accommondates pupils of all abilities.\r\n- An infant /primary/secondary and upper secondary school in the Basque country, 1416 pupils. The school is following an inclusive educational model.\r\n- A secondary school in Nord Rhein/Westfahlen, Germany with 880 pupils. The school has got prizes being a succesful \"Europaschule\" five years in a row.\r\n- A primary/secondary school in Brandenburg, Germany with 502 pupils. The school has a sport profile.\r\n- A primary school from Sweden with 450 pupils. The school is surrounded by forests and works a lot with outdoor education.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n1.\r\n- Each school studies the national art history.  Each school visits a national art museum. Each school makes a  presentation of a well known national artist and shares it with the other schools on the blog.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n- Each school makes an exhibition with sculptures, craft etc. inspired by the other schools presentations.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n- Each school makes an intervju of a local artist. It will be uploaded on the blog and shown to all the pupils as an inspiration for the next task.\r\n- Each school makes a mural with the help of the local artist. The mural will be shown at an exhibition.\r\n\r\nDissemination\r\n\r\nParticipating organisations\r\n- all partners will exchange work by web uploading on the blog\r\n- discussions of staff in each school and with all teachers in project at project meetings\r\n- reporting in school documentation\r\n- exhibitions in each participating school\r\n- wall displays in each schools\r\n\r\nLocal communities\r\n- publishing in the local press\r\n- public exhibitions together with the local artist. Invitations sends to the local politicians as well to the members of other schools and the local society\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n- European integration - enhance a sense of European citizenship among staff and pupils.\r\n- The knowledge of European art will enhance European identity of all children in each school. \r\n- The project will enhance the pupils creativity and increase their skills in using arts and crafts to express themselves. \r\n- The project will have a positive impact on the pupils reading skills in both the native language as in English.\r\n- The project will have a positive impact on pupils' and staff's ICT skills.\r\n\r\nSustainability\r\nThe successful work in arts will be a part of each school\u00b4s curriculum.

The knowledge, skills and competences which people acquire in VET should enable them to manage their career and to play an active role in society. These actions will positively influence in the promotion of equity, social cohesion and active citizenship.\r\nAccording to CEDEFOP (The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training), COMPETENCE is the ability to apply learning outcomes adequately in a defined context (education, work, personal or professional development).  It is completed by a comment: \u2018competence is not limited to cognitive elements; it also encompasses functional aspects (involving technical skills) as well as interpersonal attributes (social or organisational skills) and ethical values\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of transversal competences to educational systems is in constant development and brings important benefits.  However, these benefits are accompanied by the difficult of the process of assessment by trainers.  \r\nBased on their own experience, the participants of this project have concluded that the \u201cassessment\u201d of transversal competences is the core issue to be addressed in a competence-based training model.\r\n\r\nThe annual Work Programme adopted by the Commission stress on the need to foster the assessment of transversal skills and promote the take-up of practical entrepreneurial experiences in education, training and youth work.\r\nWith the main objective to contribute to the EU objectives in this field, the CompAssess project will firstly, establish a European network integrated by recognized organizations that already count with solid basis in the field of transversal competences and have made achievements in assessment methodologies, in order to share best practice experiences in such areas; secondly, the partnership will identify best practice cases in order to proposed assessment methodologies or tools able to be implemented at European level in the VET system; thirdly, it will develop implementation and assessment plans; and finally, the consortium will present new proposals and recommendations about methodologies and tools for competence assessment to education authorities to promote their implementation in the European VET System.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will define a strategy for the establishment and operation of the Network, the best practice cases and definition of methodologies will be carried out through four workshops that will allow the interaction among the partners.  Based on the results of the workshops, best practice papers will be drafted, which are crucial for the recommendations for EU policy makers dealing with the VET system. A final event will be held in Spain to present the project outcomes and the establishment of the Network.\r\nParticipants:\r\nThe partnership is integrated by universities, VET providers and innovation centers, all of them with vast experience in the implementation of transversal competences: \r\n1.

This is the main objective to consolidate the European network.\r\n\r\nThe target groups will count with tools/methodologies of assessment tested and validated at European level, which will be available to be implemented at VET providers.  \r\nThe tools/methodologies proposed by the CompAssess project will represent a direct contribution for the achievement of the objectives of the EU education strategy 2020, and addressed by this call. \r\n\r\nVET education authorities will count with key recommendations on the field of assessment of transversal competences.", "http://www.nrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA202-005000_7"], [2016, "Robotics Automation Careers in Engineering for the 21 Century", "NORTHERN REGIONAL COLLEGE", 136653.0, 7, 7, "Who - Robotics, Automation Careers in Engineering in the 21 Century (RACE21) is a partnership between six VET colleges (UK, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Finland and Romania) and a VET host organisation in the Czech Republic.

During the RACE project students learned about automation and robotics careers opportunities as well as developing practical skills in \u2018How to Build a Robot\u2019.  In explaining the rationale for the use of automation and robotics, employers highlighted the dual gain of increased productivity and their ability to release employees\u2019 creativity and innovation capacity.RACE21 focuses on this duality of purpose and seeks to move students from \u2018How to Build a Robot\u2019 to \u2018How to Integrate a Robot\u2019 and develop the skills amongst VET students to enable them to \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 in an industry sector that has an in-build bias towards entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation.
