Original predictions over the longevity of constructed wetlands were approximately 50 -100 years (Conley et al 1991).  However, it has become disappointingly apparent that these systems are clogging and have on average a lifetime of less than 10 years (Griffin et al 2008). Currently when a wetland becomes clogged, the whole site has to be refurbished and the reeds regrown, which takes several years and has significant economic consequences for the operators.\n\nOur project ARBI aims to develop and trial an Autonomous Reed Bed Installation containing a magnetic resonance probe, can be deployed in several locations within a wetland to give measurements at different depths.  By measuring the relaxation times of MR, sufficient information can be obtained to determine the clog state of the gravel bed of a wetland. This would enable the operators to isolate those areas of the bed where the problem resides and make a partial intervention, without the need to remove and re-plant the whole reed bed. When the system is  developed, we will have potential for application in other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows like: slow rate sand filters, and river bank filtration.\n\nThe project will have major benefits for those organisations who would like to install reedbeds but  have resisted doing because of concerns over performance and maintenance costs.

Students prepares for the learning objectives for their own program, and finding out which type of exercises are expected to perform during their period abroad. Teachers facilitate and help students in order for them to be able to learn the most, and thereby help them to match the learning objectives and defining achievement.\r\n\r\nPrior to traveling, students attend preparatory meetings. The focus is society and culture. Through the these meetings we prepare students on what to expect and what it means to be a \u201cworld Citizen\u201d. We also try to give them an insight to the fact that the world increasingly becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe school hopes to observe that internationalization makes a difference in school choice among youth. There is a need to recruit for vocational subjects, and particularly some subjects have been more affected than others have. The mobilities in itself is an activity to encourage recruitment to our program areas, and not least to motivate students to complete their vocational education. \r\nThe upcoming period of mobilities holds new partners in France and in Italy. We carefully  follow the development for the programmes of  resturant and food processing (France) and Design and Textile (Italy). We are eager to see how our cooperation will develop, and not least to see the experiences and learning outcomes the pupils will have.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of learning outcomes is important and is an ongoing development in all departments. Using ECVET documents will become easier for more teachers as this is a focus in the field. The work is time-consuming and it is expected development in the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe school's European development plan \"PROUD\" says:\r\n\"Students thrive through feeling secure, trusting each other and caring for each other \u2013 through internationalisation, confidence is tested, both for the individual student and for the staff members who travels along: new destinations, new collaborators and colleagues and new companies. Through training trust through new collaborators, testing the ability to care for each other and for new friends, students and teachers alike strengthen their ability to thrive, and feel more confident that they can thrive in unfamiliar situations.

All these competences will enhance student\u2019s access to the EU labour market, both as self-employee and/or hired worker.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES that partners of the project will carry out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\nThe impact on the partnership\u2019s VET schools will be:\r\n- Improving qualifications and competitiveness of youngsters, enabling them to adapt to the digital era\u2019s demands and to a global knowledge-based economy, enhancing , at the same time, the increase of the youth employment and a sustainable growth.\r\n- Consolidating and increasing contacts with European entities to modernise education, to share good practices and to develop new projects in the field of European cooperation\r\n- Improving the quality of the training, delivered in the school, and adapted to linguistic, social and cultural diversity. This will allow schools to meet disadvantaged people\u2019s needs in a more efficient way and to understand better what active European citizenship is.\r\n- Improving knowledge and the use of evaluation and certification tools (ECVET and EUROPASS). \r\n- Increasing the attractiveness of vocational training education, to make it the first selected option for students and enhancing the prestige of the participating VET schools.\r\n\r\nThe project is strictly related to the 2020 Strategy and the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016; it is consistent with the strategic priorities for contributing the increase in employment, productivity and social cohesion in the EU and its member states.", "http://www.be-together.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037020_19"], [2017, "Stolte fagfolk for framtida fra Borgund VGS!

This may initially sound easy. However, there is much to be in place for pupils, parents, teaching staff and school administration before such work practices can be referred to as successful.  Partner organizations have to prepare to receive a Norwegian student. They must assess tasks in their own companies and match them to learning objectives our students bring with their curriculum. Students prepares for the learning objectives for their own program, and finding out which type of exercises are expected to perform during their period abroad. Teachers facilitate and help students in order for them to be able to learn the most, and thereby help them to match the learning objectives and defining achievement.\r\n\r\nPrior to traveling, students attend preparatory meetings. The focus is society and culture. Through the these meetings we prepare students on what to expect and what it means to be a \u201cworld Citizen\u201d. We also try to give them an insight to the fact that the world increasingly becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe school hopes to observe that internationalization makes a difference in school choice among youth. There is a need to recruit for vocational subjects, and particularly some subjects have been more affected than others have. The mobilities in itself is an activity to encourage recruitment to our program areas, and not least to motivate students to complete their vocational education. \r\nThe upcoming period of mobilities holds new partners in France and in Italy. We carefully  follow the development for the programmes of  resturant and food processing (France) and Design and Textile (Italy). We are eager to see how our cooperation will develop, and not least to see the experiences and learning outcomes the pupils will have.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of learning outcomes is important and is an ongoing development in all departments. Using ECVET documents will become easier for more teachers as this is a focus in the field. The work is time-consuming and it is expected development in the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe school's European development plan \"PROUD\" says:\r\n\"Students thrive through feeling secure, trusting each other and caring for each other \u2013 through internationalisation, confidence is tested, both for the individual student and for the staff members who travels along: new destinations, new collaborators and colleagues and new companies. Through training trust through new collaborators, testing the ability to care for each other and for new friends, students and teachers alike strengthen their ability to thrive, and feel more confident that they can thrive in unfamiliar situations. Consequently, the students become more aware of their own ability to master situations which they are sure to meet in their working life\"\r\n\r\nTo uphold the secure environment for learning our school always send accompanying persons to all destinations. Our students are aged 17 to 19 when they leave, and they need the secure framwork we can offer. \r\n\r\nBorgund Vidareg\u00e5ande School is focused on quality.

Since 2011 the Hansa Berufskolleg Unna has been allowed to carry the title 'European school' and firmly fixed the European Idea within the school's main programme.\r\nThis request is reflected by the cooperation with local training companies having intense international business contacts. \r\nEspecially industrial companies in the textile and steel trade strongly demand for internationally qualified staff and therefore support work experience abroad.\r\nThe most popular business partner of our local companies are located in England, Belgium, Poland, Turkey and Italy. \r\nDue to some French-based companies in Unna we lately acquired a new partner agency in Bordeaux, France. \r\nSince 2000 Hansa Berufskolleg Unna has successfully offered three-week-work placements within Europe. Additionally our school established bilingual classes for industrial clerks and Europe-classes (classes with additional lesson in a foreign language and European politics)\r\nEngland, Belgium, Poland, Turkey and Italy belong to the countries that our local businesses mainly deal with. \r\nStudents receive the chance of passing English test on a voluntary basis (KMK-certificates) \u2013 their job performances are evaluated by ECVET-points to enhance transparency with regard to the qualification for the European job market. \r\n\r\nNumber/Profile/Description/Project implementation/Results:\r\nThe number of the participants for the three-week-work placements is 36. They mainly originate from the business area of wholesale, logistics, IT and industry. Their German companies usually support only the three-week-period; that is why there are two options \u2013 trainees can choose between the short-term (three-week) or long-term (3- month) stay abroad.\r\nThe long-term stay in Ireland is a further development of the short-term projects. \r\nThe participants\u2019 number is 13 and all of them are doing a traineeship to become an industrial clerk. Many months ahead of the actual stay in Ireland the German companies are informed about the organisational requirements. The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) in Dortmund supports this work placement in all areas. The implementation of the project is done by the agency Green Horizons, which offers impeccable organisational skills.\r\n\r\nLongterm effects:\r\nParticipants receive the Europass which offers a major plus for their applications. At the same time they acquire the competence of basically taking a look beyond the fence. The unique opportunity of gaining work experience abroad serves as an incentive for transferring and expanding business knowledge to the host company - at the same time the participants might feel inclined to take up business studies abroad or going abroad for work. Therefore receipt of ECVET-points is of utmost importance to reach transparency for the documentation of job skills gained abroad.\r\nIn the long run the number of participants of the three-month-stay should be increased aiming at the introduction of a single class.", "http://www.be-together.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001836_7"], [2014, "EUC Syd rejser og l\u00e6rer", "B&E Together Ltd", 51609.0, 12, 12, "The project is an integrated part of the EUC Syd internationalization strategy whose primary objectives are based on the EU 's great ideas on freedom of movement so that participants in mobilities get a realization of the European labor market as their future labor market and not only the national labor market.
