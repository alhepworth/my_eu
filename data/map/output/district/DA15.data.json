The envisaged framework will be based on automated technology for advanced data processing supported by an important human component in critical decision making stages, as well as, legal and ethical aspects. The framework will consist of tools to automatically manipulate, analyse and fuse vast amounts of heterogeneous data acquired from different sources including CCTV surveillance content, confiscated desktops and hard disks, mobile devices, Internet, social networks, handwritten and calligraphic documents. The type of data considered includes text, images, video, audio and biometric information in multiple formats. In order to manage the results of the automated processing, a knowledge repository will be built. It will consider explicit analyst-knowledge and critical legacy information from previous cases. The proposed knowledge representation framework will also allow the system to provide recommendations to analysts, guide the investigation process and perform inference based on evidence extracted from available data.\nIn LASIE, search and retrieval of evidence will be enhanced through the provision of complex query formulations and multimodal search mechanisms yet through a user-friendly, user-centric human-computer interface. The aim is to link and merge heterogeneous data retrieved from multiple sources to improve the knowledge-base and the accuracy of retrieved results. The envisaged user-friendly interface will allow analysts to easily visualise and navigate through the retrieved evidence, highlight relevant events and provide feedback to refine their search criteria.\nLASIE will follow a privacy-by-design approach, ensuring that all the aforementioned functionalities and the used forensic data strictly obey all legal and ethical restrictions and national laws. This ensures that the outcomes of the system will be accepted in European courts of law.", 362195.0, 9067621.0, 10, 18, "LASIE", "http://www.lasie-project.eu/", null, null, "fp7_185486_954748303"], [1493596800000, 1588204800000, "Defending the European Energy Infrastructures", "Venaka Media Limited", "Critical Energy infrastructures (CEI) protection and security are becoming of utmost importance in our everyday life. However, cyber and system-theoretic approaches fail to provide appropriate security levels to CEIs, since they are often used in isolation and build on incomplete attack models, resulting in silos-like security management fragmented operational policies. To face these challenges, DEFENDER will (i) model CEIs as distributed Cyber-Physical Systems for managing the potential reciprocal effects of cyber and physical threats (ii) deploy a novel security governance model, which leverages on lifecycle assessment for cost-effective security management over the time (iii) bring people at centre stage by empowering them as virtual sensors for threat detection, as first level emergency responders to attacks, or by considering workforce as potential threats.

These needs have been identified after consulting with eleven different European LEAs \u2013members of the MAGNETO consortium. In response, MAGNETO empowers LEAs with superior crime analysis, prevention and investigation capabilities, by researching and providing tailored solutions and tools based on sophisticated knowledge representation, advanced semantic reasoning and augmented intelligence, well integrated in a common, modular platform with open interfaces. By using the MAGNETO platform, LEAs will have unparalleled abilities to fuse and analyse multiple massive heterogeneous data sources, uncover hidden relationships among data items, compute trends for the evolution of security incidents, ultimately (and at a faster pace) reaching solid evidence that can be used in Court, gaining also better awareness and understanding of current or past security-related situations. In parallel, MAGNETO will spark an ecosystem of third-party solution providers benefiting from its open, modular and reusable architectural framework and standard interfaces.\nTo achieve these objectives, MAGNETO will test and demonstrate its developments on five representative and complementary use cases (types of crime), under real-life operational conditions in the facilities of eleven different LEAs, keeping them continuously in the production loop, adopting an agile implementation methodology and a multi-disciplinary scientific approach, combining researchers with exceptional track records, officers with top-level operational know-how in law enforcement, recognised experts for legal and ethical compliance to EU and national standards, and qualified training experts for innovative curricula development.", 213849.0, 4634525.0, 10, 22, "MAGNETO", null, null, null, "h2020_216142_954748303"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "VENAKA MEDIA LIMITED*VML", 222095.0, "Fostering secure European societies (09.04.03.03)", "fts_2017_4622"]]}}, "9DF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance", 99609.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.bruford.ac.uk", "Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046945_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance", 73202.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.bruford.ac.uk", "Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035354_coordinator"], [2017, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance", 70755.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
