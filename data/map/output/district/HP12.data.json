New and more efficient manufacturing technologies can pave the way to improve material quality, reduce processing time, converge towards near-net shape fabrication, trim energy spent and abate production costs.\nHELM will address these challenges by proposing innovative high-frequency electromagnetic, microwaves (MW) and radiofrequencies (RF), heating technologies for integrating and, in the long term, replacing standard thermal processing routes, i.e.: Chemical Vapour Infiltration (CVI), Liquid Silicon Infiltration (LSI), Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis (PIP), and Graphite Exfoliation (GE).\nMW/RF heating owns peculiar features (rapid selective bulk heating, reversed thermal gradients, more homogeneous heat distribution) that will enhance materials performance.

In such composites the silicide matrix provides excellent oxidation resistance at high temperature (forming silica), while percolating refractory metal reinforcements enhances their strength at high temperature, ductility and creep resistance. The continuous metallic skeleton serves as efficient tool against crack propagation, thus improving toughness of material at both high and low temperatures. The volume content of silicides will gradiently increase from the refractory core, forming continuous skin at the surface. The design of these tailored gradient materials (FGM) will be based on multiscale modelling, characterisation and non-destructive evaluation techniques developed to understand the role of residual stresses and acting degradation mechanisms. The infiltration technique for manufacturing of complex near-net shape parts having self-healing oxide coating will open a cost efficient way for wide range of structural applications in space, automotive and energy production sectors, especially when reliable performance at high temperature (above 1500 K) in oxidizing environment is required.
