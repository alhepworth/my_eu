Additional specific archaeological layers will be included into the WebGIS to facilitate the object identification through shape detection techniques and mapping.\n\nThe system will be verified and validated through an extensive on-ground (sea) campaign carried out with both cutting edge technologies (side-scan sonar, multi beam echo sounder) and traditional means (submarine exploration with professional scuba divers).", 62590.0, 1710356.0, 6, 12, "ITACA", null, "http://www.anesti.it", null, "fp7_188817_959144343"], [1328054400000, 1380499200000, "Marine Park Enhanced applications baseD on Use of integrated GNSS SErvices", "Anesti Limited", "Marine parks are areas which deserve an extremely accurate care of the ecosystem and as such are usually subject to severe restrictions applied to their end users, first of all leisure boats and local operators.\nThose restrictions are often different in different areas depending onto the level of threat that anthropogenic activities may exercise on local environment. As an example, in some areas boat transit may be fully prohibited, in others fishing and anchorage, in others night anchorage, etc.\nIn order to limit and control the access to restricted areas, very often parks management organisations force users to request for a permit (e.g. daily or weekly, free of charge or not) without which the boats are not allowed to enter the marine park. In compliance with the different ways for accessing the park, also permits are different (e.g. transit and anchorage, shore fishing, sea fishing, scuba diving\u2026).\nThe main objectives of the Meduse Project can be summarised as follows:\na)\tTo develop a prototype service infrastructure for the delivery of location based services within restricted access maritime areas (parks, reserves) to the following customer categories:\ni.\tInstitutional \u2013 Marine parks and restricted marine areas management institutions;\nii.\tPrivate - Marine parks and restricted marine areas users (leisure boats);\niii.\tCommercial \u2013 Commercial operators acting within restricted areas (e.g. cruise boats);\niv.\tLaw Enforcement \u2013 Maritime police authorities (Coast Guard).\nb)\tTo demonstrate a subset of services and applications (with limited functionality) that shall be enabled by the service infrastructure for all the above listed customer categories;\nc)\tTo analyse commercial sustainability of the service infrastructure in order to identify and characterise the critical mass of applications and services that shall bring sustainability and define associated service models towards the different customer categories.", 23064.0, 430140.0, 3, 5, "MEDUSE", null, "http://www.anesti.it", null, "fp7_208252_959144343"]]}}, "3GG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Project Carcassonne", "Hill House School Ltd", 8641.0, 1, 1, "Hill House School, is an independent day school for girls and boys in Doncaster, in the north of England. We have 752 pupils on role, aged between 3 and 18.\r\n\r\nFollowing a significant change of staff, and the creation of the post of Junior School MFL coordinator, we conducted a staff and pupil audit to assess the status of French.\r\n\r\nThe audit found that:\r\n\r\nSome aspects of language learning led by Senior trained staff were tired, dull and repetitive. The scheme of work being used did not excite nor challenge young children and was not compliant with 2014 curriculum changes. Pupils have made better progress in the 3 years since a Junior trained member of staff has taken over the French teaching and it was felt that the children could achieve more in terms of success, progress and enjoyment if the ways and means of delivering French was overhauled and given a Junior School perspective.\r\n\r\nThrough staff discussions, it has been identified that it would be desirable to deliver the EYFS and KS1 French through the creative curriculum, rather than as a weekly timetabled lesson. The 40-minute period is too long for such young children, and does not happen on occasions when the French teacher be absent due to other commitments. \r\n\r\nHill House is a school with high expectations, but numbers continuing with languages in the High School are dropping. This is in contrast to local competitor schools, who are maintaining numbers and achieving higher grades at GCSE and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe audit also found that:\r\nAlthough Junior School are enthusiastic about language teaching and have good general experience and skills, no member of the team has a French degree. Junior School staff lack confidence in their language skills, and in particular their ability to teach French; they identified a need to increase their personal French skills to ensure pupils continue to progress. Junior pupils want to learn about and communicate with children in France, however, most Junior School staff lack any recent first-hand experience of French culture. \r\n\r\nTo address these issues, we are launching a 2-year Erasmus+ staff mobility project to give 3 teachers the opportunity to take part in a programme of immersion courses run by PQ France. We expect this to:\r\n\r\n-  develop teachers\u2019 personal knowledge and proficiency of French language, cultures, traditions and heritage \r\n-  train teachers relatively new to teaching French to become more proficient in the teaching of a foreign language \r\n-  broaden experiences of cultures and beliefs of the children \r\n-  offer opportunities to the less able and disadvantaged children to increase their life experiences \r\n-  ensure that the children become proficient in the French language including reading, writing, speaking and listening \r\n-  establish an effective relationship with a French primary school \r\n- introduce the Europass to benchmark MFL progress for pupils.\r\n\r\nThe impact we expect to see is:\r\n- Participants will have higher levels of competence and confidence and greater cultural understanding \r\n- Participants will have enhanced their professional profile\r\n- The subject coordinator will have developed project management skills, and extended her subject leadership skills to include the methodology and pedagogy behind a progressive MFL Scheme of Work\r\n- Better learning experiences for the pupils \r\n- Pupils will be corresponding with French children\r\n- The school will have an enhanced European dimension \r\n- There will be a bank of authentic cross-curricular resources freely accessible to all staff on the school network.\r\n\r\nOur project results will be disseminated within our school community and beyond to other local schools and shared at Society of Heads conferences, via written reports, website stories, termly newsletters, discussions, INSET, teacher exchange placements and through the use of social media updates.", "http://www.hillhouse.doncaster.sch.uk", "Hill House School Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047360_coordinator"]]}}}}
