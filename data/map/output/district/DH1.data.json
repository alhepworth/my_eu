The currently favoured candidate is cold dark matter or CDM. This forms the basis of the standard model of cosmology, LCDM, whose predictions, dating back to the 1980s, turned out to agree remarkably well with observations covering a staggering range of epochs and scales, from the temperature structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation to the large-scale pattern of galaxy clustering.

However, the war and its immediate aftermath are also significant because they occurred at the juncture of periods often characterized as \u201cmedieval\u201d and \u201cearly modern\u201d in the East Asian case. What were the implications for the social, economic, and cultural contours of early modern East Asia? What can this conflict tell us about war \u201caftermath\u201d across historical periods and about such periodization itself? There is little Western scholarship on the war and few studies in any language cross linguistic, disciplinary, and national boundaries to achieve a regional perspective that reflects the interconnected history of East Asia. Aftermath will radically alter our understanding of the region\u2019s history by providing the first analysis of the state of East Asia as a result of the war. The focus will be on the period up to the middle of the 17th century, but not precluding ongoing effects. The team, with expertise covering Japan, Korea, and China, will investigate three themes: the movement of people and demographic change, the impact on the natural environment, and technological diffusion. The project will be the first large scale investigation to use Japanese, Korean, and Chinese sources to understand the war\u2019s aftermath.

Rice is the food source for the majority of the world's population but also a model for cereals. Drought and related high salinity during essential periods of plant growth affects nearly all crops including the major cereals such as rice causing drastic yield losses. A major goal of plant biology is to develop crop cultivars that are 'drought and salt resistant', defined as those that have higher yields than standard cultivars under these environmental stresses. However plant responses to drought and salinity are overlapping and complex involving many physiological pathways controlled by cascades of molecular networks. This makes engineering drought and salt resistance in crops possible but very challenging unless we identify molecular mechanisms (\u2018Master\u2019 co-ordinators) that can influence multiple signalling networks to produce an integrated stress response. Crop improvement programmes that target these \u2018Master\u2019 co-ordinators will have the greatest potential for yield increase.\nWe have discovered that SUMOylation, an emerging protein modification mechanism can be recruited to co-ordinate multiple molecular response pathways to dramatically improve plant growth on high salinity and during drought stress.

Accretion and core formation would have defined the initial elemental composition of the Earth\u2019s interior whereas plate tectonic processes controlled chemical exchange between the Earth\u2019s surface and interior and the distribution of elements between major geochemical reservoirs. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the roles of these processes in the chemical evolution of the Earth and hence in the creation of a habitable planet.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal I propose to investigate the partitioning of new stable isotope systems such as Ge and Se in high-pressure experiments that simulate core formation. This novel, multidisciplinary approach will provide some of the first direct constraints on the extent to which these volatile elements  were partitioned into the core.

The rise of international organizations and, within Europe: the emergence of the European Union, have challenged the idea of the sovereign state ever since the end of the Second World War. And, in a seemingly paradoxical parallel, the myth of monolithic state power has equally come under attack from within states. Indeed: many modern states currently experience a political and constitutional devolution (Italy, Spain, United Kingdom).\nCan we identify these developments with federal theory? Federalism is a philosophical and a constitutional problem. The federal principle has made a long \u2018journey through time in quest of a meaning\u2019 (SR Davis).

Thus, the simulation of earthquakes and their induced hazards is not yet accurate enough to prevent human losses.

In many countries the general public is encouraged to participate in public policy decision processes. Sound evidence-based decision-making in private as well as public life requires from the informed citizen a certain level of quantitative reasoning skills to understand important social issues. Government agencies and NGOs in many European countries make abundant data as raw material available to the general public. Traditional print media increasingly provide interactive abilities for data exploration on their web pages to allow readers far more in-depth exploration than a traditional newspaper article. Modern technology provides powerful tools for data visualization that offer the potential of exploring large multivariate datasets. However, statistics education both at secondary and tertiary level is lagging behind the demands for informed citizenship. Relevant datasets that can inform debate and action have a complex multivariate structure, and visualisation tools by statistics producers may not be accessible for everyone. \r\nThe project aims to develop integrated resources (lesson plans, data visualization tools, and support materials) for statistics instructors at tertiary levels which will also be accessible to high school teaching, designed to facilitate exploration and understanding of authentic, multivariate (mostly large scale) data about social, environmental and health issues. Integrating authentic large datasets into teaching lets students experience how statistical analyses and data play a role in understanding the pressing social and political issues of our time. The project aims to create opportunities for networking for educators who teach statistics at universities and high-schools, in order to facilitate mutual learning and exploration and refinement of new materials.\r\nDuring the first year of the project, in order to pursue our goals, we explored and sketched out a new sub-area of statistics we call Civic Statistics which is distinct from conventional statistics taught to non-specialists in introductory courses. Civic Statistics' data and messages are quite unique because often they are based on official and open sources, are multivariate in nature (i.e., involve multiple variables that are correlated or interact, sometime in a non-linear way), and dynamic (changing over time). Such types of data and statistical messages related to them that are conveyed to the public by the media, official statistics offices and other providers, and their understanding is required for participation in democratic societies, but they are usually not at the core of regular statistics instruction and have received relatively little attention in the statistics education literature. \r\nThe six project partners from Germany, UK, Hungary, Portugal, and Israel have a strong background and expertise in researching conceptual foundations, assessing and enhancing statistical literacy as well as teaching statistics and data handling to a wide variety of learners. Coming from diverse backgrounds, different home departments (Education, Mathematics, Economics, Human Services) and rooted in different networks and professional environments (College and University Teaching, National Statistics Offices, continuing teacher education networks) they complement each other in unique ways with their experiences in ICT-based data visualisation, in tertiary and secondary statistics teaching and creating multimedia learning material for school and college education, in consulting big data providers such as National Statistics Offices and in the development and assessment of numeracy and statistical literacy. \r\nOutputs of the planned project include: \r\na. development of a conceptual framework regarding the skills and knowledge needed for understanding civic statistics and multivariate data related to socially-meaningful phenomena. \r\nb. Preparation of selected relevant datasets from various public or open sources, \r\nc. design or refinement of unique data visualisation tools that will be made available to educators and students both through a central website as well as ready for mobile devices, into which educators can insert local data. \r\nd.

Many projects under the framework of the programmes Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ supported this award as \"Europaschule in Niedersachsen\". \r\n\r\nHanover has about 550000 inhabitants and is a multicultural city. About 30% of the population have a migration background and represent about 125 nationalities in total.

They see their multicultural heritage as a chance to be successful on the German labour market, especially in a multicultural city like Hanover. This project supports the preparation of young people for a role in the global labour market and provides them with the necessary skills and competences to work in an international, multilingual and multicultural environment.\r\n\r\nAt Euro Akademie Hanover, a two- to three-year vocational programme is the basis for individual development and different options to obtain further qualifications or find employment. International placement opportunities help the students to develop employability skills, search for professional opportunities, and support the development of academic key competences and qualify for a bachelor top-up degree. The combination of vocational and higher education degrees enables students to proceed to bachelor top-up programmes. This project helps to maintain existing academic partnerships and develop new academic pathways for students.\r\n\r\nQualifications and job requirements have changed significantly as globalisation makes high demands on the labour market and require the mobility of labour. At the same time the idea of a European Union is threatened. This development challenges the way vocational education is structured and organized. Young people need expert knowledge and interdisciplinary skills, proficiency in foreign languages and profound intercultural skills. \r\n\r\nSome of the qualities and attitudes that graduates of the 21st century should possess include the ability to deal with uncertainty and change, flexibility and mobility. International placement opportunities enhance the students' knowledge of skills and competences that are expected by employers. \r\n\r\n The staff mobilitities within this project aim at the development of e-learning initiatives that prepare students for their international placement opportunities and help them to organize their activities.

They do a work placement abroad in a company of their choice for 22 weeks, either from January to July or from July to December.\r\n\r\nBy signing their contracts, participants commit to fulfilling previously agreed tasks in the company. They should successfully manage professional tasks and should thereby further their professional education and experience the value of European integration in a practical way. Besides the promotion of intercultural skills, such as languages and subject-specific knowledge, the development of methodological and action competences will be definitively supported. This variety of skills should enable them to work successfully in marketing or management for international companies, regardless of sector. We educate young employees who are able to apply for jobs on the European market. Furthermore, participation in this project contributes to a large extent to the personal development of the beneficiaries, whose independence will be encouraged and who will learn to act on their own responsibility. In addition, life and work in the host country in the chosen time period supports their tolerance of foreign cultures and develops intercultural competence. \r\n\r\nApproximately 15 participants should benefit from the project.

They will be prepared for this placement through intensive training in two European languages and a superior commercial education.\r\n\r\nThe work placement abroad, over several months in the last of the three years of training, serves to practically test skills acquired to this point and enhance them. We therefore encourage beneficiaries to be independent, while following their progress, as closely as necessary, together with project partners.

On a European level, this aim cannot be reached without competence in foreign languages and a deeper awareness of European citizenship.The work placement experience is only one step along this process of growth and awareness and it needs coordinated and solid planning and implementation of preparatory activities that invade the sphere of traditional teaching and modify contents and methodology of the students\u2019 curricula.The beneficiaries of the NAIL IT IN EUROPE project are 105 students of IIS Scalcerle and other schools of the province, selected according to shared criteria which are described in the quality procedures of the school. They are trainees at their initial training stage who will get a High School or Technical School Diploma corresponding to level 4 of EQF. They have concluded the 4th year of their educational training (either the Foreign Languages course or the Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnologies technical course). Immigrant students and an elevated percentage of women are involved. The work placements will last from 2 to 4 weeks.The work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and assessed mainly by using ECVET criteria and will be meant to allow the acquisition of competencies that can be built up in time and acknowledged at a national and an international level in different contexts.
