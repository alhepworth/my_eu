It is through involving practitioners from across Europe, as well as teachers, therapists and other special educational professionals, that we can truly \u201cimagine the future\u201d and extend the scope of possibilities for young people with complex needs.\r\n\r\n\u2018Imagining the Future\u2019 will provide young people with meaningful community-based learning opportunities, which will enable them to connect with others, socially, economically, locally and globally. Mini-Enterprises will be set up to enable this, which will include the setting up of \u201cShare Fair\u201d an online safe and accessible platform in which young people with learning disabilities can buy and sell produce, including goods produced at a non-European partner special school in Ghana. Mini-Enterprise activities will happen throughout the duration of the project.", "http://www.northridge.doncaster.sch.uk/", "Swiss Cottage School, Development and Research Centre", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013723_3"]]}}}}
