Also the project will contribute to improving and extending the offer of high quality learning opportunities tailored to individual adult learners including through innovative ways of outreach and delivery. The project proposed intervention is following a previous collaboration between current partners during 2012-2014 within Community Mentoring for Social Inclusion Partnership funded LLP Grundtvig Learning Partnerships (GRU-13-P-LP-237-SV-UK). The previous partnership project aimed to compare and contrast the experiences, methodologies, definitions and assumptions of the different approaches used by the organizations involved in providing learning opportunities to socially disadvantaged members of communities and involve representatives from these groups in these processes. As a result of these exchanges the project collectively designed and integrated approaches based on attracting, training and empowering successful individuals from similar backgrounds to socially disadvantaged adults, to become community mentors. \r\nThe project aims at increasing institutional capacity of the project partners, empowering them to provide new and innovative services for social inclusion in Europe.  The training of trainers will generate a legacy to the project, and will ensure the cascading of learning continues after completion.  The pool of trainers in each member country will be an asset to the organization and their local community.  In this context the objectives proposed for developing a new partnership program are:\r\n1. Development of a common professional profile of Community Mentors for Social Inclusion at European level, based on the initial assessment and lessons learned and best practices applied  in partners countries. \r\n2. Develop training curricula adapted to the common professional profile of Community Mentor for Social Inclusion (based on the initial assessment). \r\n3. Increased institutional capacity of 6 organizations in 4 countries by providing modern and innovative training to their key staff involved in community mentoring for social inclusion.\r\n4. Develop competences and skills of 132 professional in adult education to become community mentors for social inclusion using short-term staff training and learners blending mobilities. \r\n5. Develop innovative tools to transfer information and knowledge,  promote and support community mentoring activities. \r\nThe intellectual outputs created during the project, generate training tools and materials, transferable in any European country and will continue to be used by the project partners  and also other organizations. \r\n* The Community Mentor Profile developed during the partnership is an important reference for future interventions and it will sustain itself based on the quality of the content.\r\n*The curricula and training modules that will be developed will constitute transferable knowledge ready to be used by any interested organization. This training is an important asset for any organization involved in community mentoring building its capacity to deliver training services to the community. \r\n* The critical mass of 132 professionals in adult education trained in community mentoring (22 people in each organization) will ensure the multiplier effect of the  intervention.  They also represent important assets to their organization, which can valorise their improved skills and competences. Therefore each organization will be interested to support their activities from their own resources as a win-win strategy.\r\n* Community Mentoring 4 Inclusion guide  (electronic format), and the Video \"Community Mentoring in the European context\" \r\nwill ensure both project visibility and knowledge transferability long after the project will end. \r\nLast but not least the partnership will continue to exist after the project ending based on common interests and values.  All partners will continue to work together and share experiences regarding a common profile of Community Mentor for Social inclusion at European level, which can be recognized/ certified at national and international level.

Our inclusive, future-oriented pedagogy addresses the acute problems of European societies related to science education: the decrease in student interest in pursuing STEM (Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics) careers and the \u201cskill-gap\u201d between school learning and labour market needs. Furthermore, in the midst of dramatic social change with unprecedented flows of migrants to the region, Europe more than ever needs education that acknowledges and anticipates diversity.Underlying these problems and challenges is students\u2019 difficulty in projecting themselves into the future as responsible and active persons, citizens and professionals. While the problem touches the whole generation, especially the migrant youths coming from different cultures and difficult experiences face challenges in finding themselves in their new context and in imagining their future. In order to foster such capacities, our SP creates novel ways to develop future-scaffolding skills of all upper secondary school students (ages 16-19). These skills include strategic thinking and planning, risk taking, thinking beyond the realm of possibilities, action competence, managing uncertainty and creative thinking.The SP consists of three secondary schools, two universities, an environmental NGO, a teachers\u2019 association and a private foundation. The partners are from four European countries: Italy, Finland, Iceland and the United Kingdom. The SP grounds on two well-established and effective school-university partnerships: one between the Liceo A. Einstein and the Department of Physics of the University of Bologna (UNIBO), and the other between Helsinki Normal Lyceum and the Department of Physics of the University of Helsinki (UH). The Icelandic Environment Association (IEA) brings to the SP their expertise in environmental and sustainability education and the action competence approach. Hamrahlid College in Iceland adds to the cultural diversity of students and teachers participating in the project. The partnership between the three schools in Helsinki, Reykjavik and Rimini is projected to be fruitful in terms of cultural exchange and the generalisability of the results. Both aspects are boosted also by the Association for Science Education (ASE) who bring added value through their extensive school and teacher network in the UK. In order to connect school science to competences needed in the labour market, the Fondazione Golinelli (FG) in Bologna, Italy, joins the partnership. The SP will develop \u201cI SEE\u201d modules on cross-cutting and societally relevant fields such as climate change or nanotechnology. A module consists of materials and a manual for teachers and students on activities both in the classroom and in out-of-school settings. The start-up module developed during the first year will be implemented, tested and refined in the Summer School which will host a culturally diverse group of students from all four countries as well as teachers, educational researchers and other stakeholders. On the basis of the discussions and results, the partners develop three \u201cI SEE\u201d modules through a multiple back and forth process of design, cross-testing and refinement that will run over the second and the third year. In addition to \u201cI SEE\u201d modules, the outputs of the project include a guide for developing further I SEE modules, case studies, and recommendations for inclusive STEM education to enhance the capacity to aspire. The materials will be provided both in electronic form and in print, and made publicly available through the web-site and the e-Twinning platform.

The negative attitudes and lack of interest about STEM are two of the main problems to be addressed (Fensham, 2006). Students often perceive a gap between what is learned at school and what is relevant in the workplace. Therefore the acquisition of competencies is crucial, and it can impact their choice of university or facilitate their entrance into the labour market. One of the most effective learning methodologies to attract students to science is Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) which is active and self-directed learning (Berret, 2001). The teacher serves as facilitator, helping students to make connections between their ideas and scientific concepts and methods.\r\nAnother aspect that is important to maintain students\u2019 motivation is the relation to real issues in the world around. Among the most consequential real-world issues are the environmental problems connected to global climate change. Among the most vulnerable systems are rivers and streams, potentially creating high hydrological risk. Over recent years, the restoration of water flows in urban areas is of increasing interest but further promotion and awareness, especially in the younger generations, is needed. The process by which they are uncovered and re-exposed to the environment is known as deculverting, or \u2018daylighting\u2019 Also the World Water Day (March 22) aims to raise awareness and inspire global action for sustainability in water use.The involvement of young generations is crucial as their understanding of phenomenon and associated risks, as well as  competences and skills to find solutions. \r\nAnother important aspect is the outline of the general and learning methodologies (O2) in order to maximise the benefits to the students and as basis for the module development. On the base of the O1 results, the general methodology will base on main steps: a) Identification of students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 competence and skills needs, \r\nb) Implementation of the didactic modules; \r\nd) Assessment of the learning process oriented to the students\u2019 future career.\r\nFour modules (O3) will be developed by the scientific partners in collaboration with the teachers of the three piloting schools . \r\nThe modules, likely structured according well-known models of IBL (e.g. Five E model), will deal for instance with four main thematics: land use and land use change with analysis of green surface loss, urban sprawl and planning of urban rivers.\r\nurban rivers actions for restoring biodiversity impact of urbanisation in the hydrological cycle and river eco-services in an urban area\r\nmodeling sediments dynamics linked to the territory and climate change.Each module has own peculiarity and will allow teachers (as facilitators) and students (as primary target), to use open source software (Q-GIS) and platforms for the creation of Location Based Games (LBG). For the application of methodology and mentioned technologies, teachers will be trained in a five day training course (C1) on insights on the geology and hydrology of the area (by WREF); Geographic Information System use applied to a real case study (by IBIMET-CNR) ) and how to develop a Location Based Game (by PRISMA). After the training course, the modules are piloted in the classroom (O4) (M14-M20). Students will be involved in a step-by-step process, firstly engaged on issues connected to \u201cculverted rivers\u201d in their own town. In the end, they will confirm the acquired knowledge and competence by summarizing their experience in outcomes like LBG and design projects and presenting them to general public and stakeholders. After piloting, the modules will be corrected (if needed) according the feedback about implementation from teachers and students. Evaluation of the modules and the learning process (O5) will identify weakness and strengths before the implementation and the effectiveness of the implementation. The modules will be evaluated internally in terms of suitability, level of challenge and interest, feasibility in the school. Then, the module implementation will be assessed through further survey tools like questionnaires, to investigate if the intervention in the classes a) increases the acquisition of competences and skills; b) increases the attitude of students toward STEM, c) decreases the career decision-making difficulties, d) increases career decision-making self-efficacy, e) increases teaching self-efficacy and effectiveness.

The benefits are large, however, as compilers need only capture concurrency in a virtual way rather than capturing, mapping and scheduling it. This separates the concerns of programming and concurrency engineering and opens the door for successful parallelising compilers. Mapping and scheduling is performed dynamically by implementations of the concurrency control instructions in the processors ISA. Another advantage of this approach is its binary compatibility. This means backward compatibility over a base ISA and forward compatibility as compiled code is executable on an arbitrary numbers of processors. Ths compatibility also enables dynamic resource mapping to binary programs from a pool of processors. Particular benefits can be expected for data-parallel and functional programming languages as they expose concurrency in a way that can easily be captured by a compiler. As well as computational benefit the ISA supports the management of partial failure, which provides support for reliable systems.

In this context, geotechnical surveying for civil and commercial applications (e.g., underwater construction, infrastructure monitoring, mapping for natural hazard assessment, environmental mapping, etc.) aims at seafloor and sub-bottom characterization using towed streamers of fixed length that are extremely cumbersome to operate.

Core fragmentation, pressure from the expanding ionised gas, magnetic fields and mass loss through stellar winds, all work against the effects of gravity, thereby restricting the final stellar mass. Advances in theoretical models, aided by numerical simulations (e.g. adaptive mesh refinement), have proposed elegant solutions; for example, the interaction between radiation and the dense circumstellar gas is subject to radiation-Rayleigh-Taylor instability, creating low opacity chimneys to vent out the radiation pressure. Likewise, heated cores and disks are stable against Jeans fragmentation. The exact manifestation of these issues and their solutions vary significantly between theories, and the physical structures found around embedded, still accreting massive stars provides a strong discriminator between models.

There is a growing portfolio of online degree programmes offered by many institutions across Europe. As online education grows however, it is evident that some of its potential benefits are yet to be fully realised. An important issue is the accreditation of online assessment and specifically a secure means of conducting safe, valid and reliable remote examinations. As a consequence, in those cases where formal examination is a required element of the course assessment, students need to physically attend their educational institution or a local approved facility in order to take the examination. This can be a costly, time consuming and inefficient process, and undermines some of the potential benefits of online distance education. OBJECTIVES OF THE PARTNERSHIPIn this Strategic Partnership, \u201cOnline Proctoring for Remote Examination\u201d (OP4RE), six leading Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and two private companies focused on technology-enhanced education innovation, will work collaboratively to develop a valid and reliable solution for remote examination. With the support of 21 Associate Partners, OP4RE aims to develop, implement and disseminate innovative practices relating to remote examination to enable European HEIs to realize the full benefits of online education through secure and trustworthy examination and certification. More specifically, OP4RE will address the following key barriers to the uptake of remote examination:1. Uncertainty related to the validity and accreditation of remote online examination;2. Security issues including fraud;3. Practical and technical issues in the implementation of online proctoring;4. Potential negative perspectives/experiences by students;5. Privacy issues.ACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY PROPOSEDThe three-year project will consist of Preparation, Implementation and Follow-Up phases. In the initial 6-month Preparation phase, the project will investigate current practices of remote examination in order to determine best practices across Europe. Desk-based literature research will be supplemented by case studies drawn from the partner institutions. The implementation phase has a duration of two years and will consist of further desk-based research and interviews as well as the set-up of several pilots employing remote examination in various settings within the six participating HEIs. Within this phase a highly innovative online proctoring system will be developed, tested and implemented, based on findings from the initial Preparation phase, and which will build on the current offerings of the consortium\u2019s two private companies. As such, an innovative, best-practice solution to address the five key barriers to remote examination will be created and specific guidelines drafted in the form of Open Access Intellectual Outputs (IOs).The final Follow Up phase will focus on dissemination of the project\u2019s IOs and findings to HEI\u2019s, HE policy makers and accreditation/certification organizations across Europe. We will showcase the proposed solution and provide guidance, policies and procedures to enable other European institutions and awarding bodies to scale-up their offerings of online courses and examination. The Associate Partners will play a central role in this phase, and various national \u201cReach Out\u201d meetings will be held including a major international conference in Hertfordshire, UK in September 2019.ENVISAGED RESULTS AND IMPACTOP4RE aims to resolve the current issues associated with remote examination and demonstrate the full potential and benefits of online education in Europe, by providing secure and trustworthy online examination and certification. Moreover, OP4RE will create five innovative Intellectual Outputs to support HEIs across Europe to develop and implement remote examination and online proctoring themselves: (1) Accreditation and remote examination rulebook; (2) Security- and anti-fraud legislation protocols; (3) Bring your own device (BYOD)/off-campus examination protocol; (4) Guidelines for fair and optimal student experience and achievement; and (5) Privacy Regulations. POTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITSBy offering secure, remote examination processes, higher education can become more accessible to a wider audience. Online education coupled with remote examination, offers more students the opportunity to gain a degree without the need to stay at or travel to university. In this way, this project will widen access to HE through reduced cost and help educate people across the world, especially in countries where access to this level of education is restricted.

This project therefore aims to develop a shared on-line learning module focusing on the policy, research and best practice in meeting the education, health and social work needs of these children and young people. The objectives of the project are to scope and critically analyse policy, research and best practice evidence from national;European and international sources to identify the extent of the needs of children and young people with complex intellectual and developmental disabilities; the involvement of academics from the partner universities, students and practitioners from education, health and social work services to scope out and identify the content of the shared learning module to ensure that it meets expectations and future service needs. The project will work with technologists to design and build the shared module content and assessment and pilot and test the effectiveness; the collaborations between the partner universities in the on-going delivery of the shared module with students from education, nursing and social work.  An iterative methodology will be used that involves literature identification and analysis, workshops and interactive sessions between academics, students and practitioners to identify future needs, best practice and module content and assessment, design and piloting of the learning module and implementation of the learning module across the five partner universities with cohorts of students from education, nursing and social work supported by academics . Student involvement will be through participation in an Erasmus Intensive programme. It is anticipated that the results will set out the evidence of the range of needs of children and young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their complexity of needs that will inform the content of the shared learning module that will be delivered collaboratively by the five partner universities as part of a longer term work programme focusing on further shared learning modules, publications and research.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA203-001023_4"], [2018, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF HERTFORDSHIRE HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 149333.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The project meets the goals and priorities of ERASMUS + in the field of vocational education and training \u2013 that is to say enabling the greatest number of students to take part in a quality European mobility and enhancing the cooperation between vocational schools and companies via the mobilities of school staff members. \r\nMELYPROLOR 6 brings together 33 vocational, comprehensive and trades schools of the acad\u00e9mie. 26 of them already took part in one of the previous projects, which highlights the interest that these schools have found in this opportunity to join a group European project. \r\nIt will permit traineeship abroad mobilities for 472 students of Premi\u00e8re or Terminale (Year 12 or 13) over a period of 12, 26, 33 or 56 days, for 180 accompagnying members of staff, as well as 56 teachers in staff training over a period of 5 or 7 days. The different mobilities will concern 12 European countries, over a period of 2 years. Tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 41 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.\r\nWhatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere. Beyond the accompanying staff,  often necessary at the beginning and/or at the end of the mobility (since the students are still minors), the opportunity to include training mobilities for the school staff in this project gives these people the possibility to integrate in the receiving companies, to develop a partnership over time, to assess everyone\u2019s expectations, to negociate the training contents at best, and for some of them to register for the certification in the teaching of a subject in a foreign language (CLIL lessons).", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035387_1"], [2016, "AQUITAPRO2", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 626884.0, 2, 2, "The mobility project for the students enrolled in the FCIL, is born from the evolution of the Erasmus + 2014-2020 regulations, consisting of a group of educational institutions in the region. Formerly and since 1995, the ADAST association, mandated by the president of the Regional Council, gives post-VET (Vocational Education and Training) learners and post-HND (Higher National Diploma) the opportunity to follow an internship in Europe with the support of Leonardo\u2019s grant.The European reform program led to the creation of an intern consolidation. This year, we want to introduce a similar program for the students enrolled in the FCIL, recent graduates from various fields of vocational baccalaureate, complementary mention or higher education. They need a first professional experience abroad giving them a key asset on the labor market. A group of forty high schools allows to pool resources between member institutions and share a common vision oriented towards an international opening.The main objectives of the program are:- To provide participants with a first professional experience abroad. The trainee will develop valuable professional and personal skills combined with knowledge in a foreign language.- To allow students to learn and develop skills differently through informal learning structures, while continuing their studies and receiving feedback, but also benefit from the added value of the acquisition of diversified language skills.By setting out those objectives, we want to give these young recent graduates the opportunity to follow a six-month internship in Europe. Speaking another language will be an asset to enter professional life.Various activities will be proposed to participants in order for them to successfully achieve these goals. Previous to their departure, they will follow an International Training Program (FCIL) at Gustave Eiffel high school divided into two courses: online courses, seminars with intensive language courses.Participants will complete three training modules on everyday and professional life and learn about the culture of the host country. By developing new skills through this course, they will be able to live fully their six-month internship in a European country.At the end of the internship the trainee will defend a dissertation in front of a mixed panel of several members of the high school group.To conduct this project, a methodology has been developed to organize the mobility program by sharing responsibilities between associated high schools and the coordinating high school.The European mobility department coordinator meets every institution in order to inform target groups about the program. Each institution will then be in charge of informing, selecting and preparing their candidates.Students will begin the training program at the start of the new school year. If they have not found a host company, procedures will be set up to secure a work placement for each student. Internship missions will be defined by the tutor in agreement with the mobility representative of the related high school and the coordinator.The coordinator of the European mobility department, together with the mobility representative of the related high school are in charge of monitoring related work placements. The tutor is responsible for sending assessment forms on a regular basis.We will achieve good results by introducing an innovative learning program for young people. The program ensures an early preparation for students in an innovative work environment before the start of their internship. Once in Europe, by experiencing the concept of European citizenship, students will measure the importance of having a very good knowledge of one other EU language.The success of the program will also be measured by the development of their ambitions, their capacity to adapt and to be independent in the development of professional skills in order to integrate the market or to make the choice to carry on their studies.During meetings, we will discuss and present indicators and statistics in order to follow progress. Furthermore, official statements will be communicated on a regular basis.One of the major benefits of this collaboration is to enable institutions to join the program, especially those lacking resources to support such an initiative.

The project aims at encouraging the revival of the local economy and the labor market in Puglia in relation to the agri-food sector and cultural tourism, considered through a proper European perspective (dissemination and visibility of the Mediterranean Diet as a dietary pattern) and in a bottom-up development. The project will involve a local partnership of schools, public and private institutions, SMEs and associations operating in a territorial context, which is rich in traditions.

It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1.

MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"Moncada\" in close collaboration with other 16 partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4.

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users.

The students are mostly first year Btec in different professional sectors:  agricultural, management of wildlife and flora, landscaping, horticultural production, forestry, equestrian, services to people and territories and sales. In total, more than 261 students + 14 members of the staff will start an internship .\r\n-70 Mfr staff, mainly monitors( teachers of MFR)  and members of the board in an accompanying framework of the youth internship.\r\n\r\nNote that for many young people concerned, the mobility will be the only opportunity for them to travel in Europe.  Many have little opportunity to travel with their families, who have limited financial resources ( about 50% are financial granted students).  Moreover about 80% of the students are from rural areas, and remain strongly attached to their territories.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities are primarily focused on professional training in the enterprise. The professional content will be prepared in close collaboration with the host companies in each different professional sector.  The host companies are selected on their specific skills, often complementary to the skills found in French companies.  These learning acquisitions will help many young people to have a much broader overview and analysis on their professional skills and practices in French companies and these ones will be taken into account in the ECVET process.\r\n\r\nCultural heritage visits will be conducted outside of internship time.  The achievements of non-formal learning will be observed in a family setting, or in hostels. and will allow the student to gain in autonomy, taking responsibility, and the remobilisation of language learning.  The participants will be able to open up to different cultures and other realities, discover great places in town and other customs.\r\n\r\nIn order to manage this project, we have created a consortium.  13 institutions are working together to share the different practices.  The Federation of Maisons Familiales Rurales of Franche-Comte are managing this project together. Many coordination meetings have taken place all along the project. Different tasks have been established in order to enable the sending schools to focus on the students who will complete a traineeship with Erasmus +.\r\n\r\nThe project will have a number of different impacts on different levels:  Individual, in the sending establishment, at a regional and national level too.  Valuations will be provided in all the establishments to allow everyone to express themselves on their acquired experiences.  The valuations are often public in order to allow a greater number of people to be aware of the impact of such a project.  An ambitious plan has been set up to communicate as widely as possible about the project, and to promote the youth and their activities as well.  Different meetings will be organized at a regional level, particularly at a Europass award ceremony, which will have a regional impact.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of

BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students'

Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill. The project also intends to use the methods and tools for skill and credits recognition through the use of Unit of learning to be capitalized and converted into the school  and / or training credits  by measuring, recognizing, validating the LO through linear and transparent procedures according the indications  of the ECVET.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS80 STUDENTS. BACKGROUND. Young 16/19 years attending the 4th year of Secondary School from the regions that will participate in the project. 20 GRADUATES/NEW QUALIFIED. Young people who have obtained  a qualification or diploma within last 12 months  and is connected with the sector of tourism and wellness.The project  will also give the opportunity of participation to disadvantaged persons.ACTIVITIES. Project activities are following:- Project management (divided into 4 main documents, which contain 4 main  aspects of correct project management: Coordination and Control Plan, Plan for Learning and Evaluation, Plan of Management of the Communication,  Dissemination and Valorization)- Preparing for the internship (linguistic, technical, educational, cultural, digital preparation)- Identification and activation of interns (following the selection of participants, the MATCHING of the candidate-company will be held  in collaboration with foreign parties who will evaluate the profiles according to the availability of the enterprises)- Accompanying of the participants under 18 years and disadvantaged persons (mainly by professors of the institutes involved) adequately prepared.- Monitoring during and ex post- Final evaluation (outcomes, project, good practices)METHODOLOGY. The used methodologies are  practices to achieve effective, efficient and repeatable activity.RESULTS AND IMPACT. In general, the project will have the main impact in education and training (VET) sector thanks to: training results  of mobility participants; acquired skill (soft skill, professional skill, personal, cultural and ethical skill); recognition of training credits. The dissemination strategy will support the global objectives and specific project activities, in particular the publication of the project OUTPUT (materials, in particular the video made by the participants), but also the OUTCOMES (results) and OUTREACH (impact).LONG TERM BENEFITS. In the long term, we expect: greater involvement of Italian partners (institutional or non), the extension of the partnership abroad, from territorial and skill point of view; the possibility to carry out exchange projects and cooperation also thanks to the participation in other European programs (as COSME and other instruments that finance the social and wellness tourism etc.); the opportunity to become (as the Consortium) a prestigious partner in mobility management and the adoption of the logic EQAVET  nd of the system of recognition of the credits ECVET.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005267_8"], [2017, "Think different ! \u2013 Acte 2", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 244899.0, 7, 18, "For a few years now, the  Rurales Family Houses (MFR) of Bourgogne and Franche-Comte have been putting in place internships in Europe, for students and the personnel through the old L\u00e9onardo Da Vinci program which is now Erasmus+.  \r\n\r\nOur project is entitled \"Erasmus + think different - act 2\" Because it has different objectives.\r\n- to open up to the world and others\r\n- to gain in maturity and autonomy \r\n- to rediscover the desire to speak a foreign language\r\n- to acquire new professional practices\r\n\r\nDifferent types of people will be involved in our project:\r\n- Firstly the students of the Rurales Family Houses (MFR).

The person in charge of projects as well as the administratitve assistant in the DAREIC (whose mission is to favour the European and international mobility of students in the acad\u00e9mie) will be the permanent link between the mobility management committees in every school of the consortium. The project meets the goals and priorities of ERASMUS + in the field of vocational education and training \u2013 that is to say enabling the greatest number of students to take part in a quality European mobility and enhancing the cooperation between vocational schools and companies via the mobilities of staff members.MELYPROLOR 5 brings together 23 vocational, comprehensive and trades schools of the acad\u00e9mie. 19 of them already took part in one of the previous projects, which highlights the interest that these schools have found in this opportunity to join a group European project. It will permit traineeship abroad mobilities for 381 students of Premi\u00e8re or Terminale (Year 12 or 13) over a period of 14, 28, 35 or 58 days, including 8 students with fewer opportunities and 1 partially-deaf student who will be integrated to a group of 4 other students. It will also involve 135 accompagnying members of staff including 16 to go with the 8 students mentioned above, as well as 36 teachers in staff training over a period of 5 or 7 days. The different mobilities will concern 11 European countries, over a period of 2 years. The mobility management committees of 2 schools with experience in VET traineeship abroad will be more precisely in charge of the students with fewer opportunities and will be able to assess new tools and adapted methods at the end of the project and share their knowledge with all the MELYPROLOR 5 partners. This tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 31 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.Whatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere. Beyond the accompanying staff,  often indispensable at the beginning and/or at the end of the mobility (since the students are still minors), the opportunity to include training mobilities for the school staff in this project gives these people the possibility to integrate in the receiving companies, to develop a partnership over time, to assess everyone\u2019s expectations, to negociate the training contents at best, and for some of them to register for the certification in the teaching of a subject in a foreign language (CLIL lessons).The students who will benefit from the mobilities as part of the MELYPROLOR project will have demonstrated their motivation before the departure and will build their project before, during and after the mobility with the members of the management committee along with the families and the consortium steering group. The first expected concrete result will be the validation of the EuroMobiPro certificate which, along with the EUROPASS certificate, will be added to the students\u2019 diploma. The project will enable the partner schools to get a more positive image and to meet the regional priorities such as combating early-school leaving.

Many of the young people do not have the opportunity to travel with their families as they have limited financial resources (about 50% are financially granted students).  About 80%  of the students are from rural areas, and remain strongly attached to their territories. The students are mostly first year Btech in different professional sectors: ( agricultural, management of wildlife and flora, landscaping, horticultural production, forestry, equestrian, services to people and territories.The activities envisaged are mainly centered on professional internships in different companies.  The professional contents will be established in close collaboration with the host companies, according to the various sectors.  The host companies of which 80% already colaborate with us and have done for some years, were selected according to their competences with  the same competences also found in French companies.  These learning acquisitions will help many of the young people have a broader outlook and help them to analyse their professional skills and practices in French companies.Cultural heritage visits will be conducted outside of internship time.  The achievements of non-formal learning, will be in a family setting, or in hostels.  Which will allow for the student to gain in autonomy, taking responsibility, and the remobilisation of language learning.  The participants can open up to other cultures and other realities, and to other customs.The project will have a number of different impacts on different levels: individual, in the sending establishment, also at a regional and even at a national level.  Evaluations will be provided in all the establishments to allow everyone to express themselves on their acquired experiences.  Often the evaluations are plubic in order to allow a greater number of people to be aware of the impact of such a project.

Staff are concerned with the need for knowledge of theoretical and practical pedagogical practices, specific techniques of each of the training sectors, school management, training coordination and extracurricular activities, and project and partnership management mechanisms for training in working context.\r\n\r\nEnsuring a sense of accomplishment and success for each other goes through quality training geared to the job market, without forgetting the interests of students and the applicability of technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt the regional / local level, the project will contribute to the key aspects for which any school aims to contribute and from which cohesion and sustainability depend - education and professional and personal development of young people. It is intended that these young people after being \"matured\" take a chance in the region and that stimulate it with new ideas and projects. At European and international level, the impacts of mobility already studied, including the 2020 targets, number of mobilities, credibility and quality of vocational training, use of European instruments and greater institutional cooperation.\r\n\r\nIt is this investment in internationalization and in the introduction / adaptation of pedagogical practices and school management that will highlight EPV in the field of vocational training, not only at national level, but also at an international level.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035609_14"], [2017, "2016-1-FI01-KA109-022861", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 96664.0, 11, 22, "Vamia was born 1.1.2017 when Vaasa Vocational Institute, Vaasa Adult Education Center and Vaasa Apprenticeship Office merged into one entity. In the spring of 2016 the three organizations took part in creating a joint internationalization strategy for the vocational education and training organized by the City of Vaasa. The aim is to provide the growing Vaasa region with a competent labour force that will thrive in the international, multicultural and multilingual working life and society. The objective of the project Professional Skills through Mobilities@vamia.fi is to implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are based on the ECVET system. The methods for identifying and recognizing skills achieved abroad will be further developed for all students. The students\u2019 personal digital portfolio  will be further developed, and the students and staff will be more deeply familiarized with the utilization of it. In addition to this, all the practices regarding adult education students will be developed in order to create a high-quality process for international mobilities.\r\nThe project will enable all staff members and students to participate in international mobilities.The project will pilot and in the future intends to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students.  The project will enable shorter mobilities for students with special needs.  Multilingualism will be promoted by developing Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and training (starting in autumn 2017) as well as developing CLIL in all vocational education and training programs.\r\nIn the project new partnerships will be created. New partners will be given the opportunity to job shadow or do on-the-job learning in Vaasa. This will allow the staff and students of Vamia to get internationalized at home, make new contacts and together develop the quality of student mobilities.\r\nDuring this project we strive to further develop genuine and high-quality partnerships and networking while supporting Vamia\u2019s strategy and benefiting all stakeholders as well as contributing to quality assurance and safety of student mobilities. The aim is continuous improvement of the quality of international activities and mobilities by applying and developing LEAN tools such as continuous development boards, and by simplifying and standardizing practices. This applies to preparatory courses for students, on-the-job learning and assessment, the administration of international activities and the uniformity of practices across Vamia.  This also includes continuous training of the staff on the areas of responsibility and the phases of the international guidance plan as well as the continuous development of the students\u2019 use of the personal digital portfolio.\r\nThe aim is also to provide everyone with the opportunity to go abroad regardless of their study program, age, sex, and language or cultural background. The aim of the project is also to develop and increase the mobilities of adult students. Short mobilities for special needs students with an accompanying teacher (2 weeks in Glasgow), and a system for financially supporting students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds will be developed. A framework and a transparent application process will be developed for this.\r\nIn the project one of the objectives is to develop the competence of the management and staff through job shadowing. Vamia\u2019s management group of 15 persons (principal, vice principals, heads of department, development manager, financial director, manager of international affairs, and the people in charge of LEAN development) aim to do job shadowing in a vocational school in Tilburg, Holland, and learn about their LEAN and Oppiscrum system. The school has been developing their management system according to LEAN principles while Vamia has been using LEAN in teaching and learning environments. The two schools will learn from each other through mutual exchanges. Furthermore, we aim to send three teachers from the department of business and administration to Kunskapsk\u00e4llan in Sweden, where they can deepen their knowledge of e-commerce. Kunskapsk\u00e4llan is situated close to Bor\u00e5s, which is a center for e-commerce in Sweden. Vamia, together with local companies, will start export mechanical fitter education in English. Four members of the staff will be going to Elgoibar, Spain, to get acquainted with their English-speaking programs for fitters. The aim is to create job shadowing and cooperation between the two schools as well as to together create and share teaching material and develop cooperation with companies. The staff mobilities will consist of job shadowing in vocational schools and local companies, creating contacts and developing the quality of student mobilities.

We will focus on several objectives:\r\n- The acquisition of new professional practices, both technical and educational.\r\n- Open-mindedness to the world and to the others\r\n- Become more autonomous and mature\r\n- Experiencing a unique mobility\r\n\r\nSeveral profiles of participants would participate to this project:\r\n- First of all, the students, apprentices and students trainees from the MFR of Franche-Comt\u00e9. Most of them are preparing a BTEC National with different specializations: agriculture, management of the fauna and flora, landscaping skills, horticultural and forest skills, care services. We will also have some students specialized in services who prepare a NVQ or are pre-apprentices. We can actually count on more than 180 learners who will go on European work placement\r\n-Some members of the MFR staff: 20 people, most of them are teachers.\r\n- Members of the board of directors: the board of directors is composed of parents from all the MFR. Their role is highly important for the management of our associations. The 20 members who would participate will have a \u201cpolitical\u201d goal: spread the development of our associations in Europe to create more partnerships. \r\n-Tutors and professionals. We would like to find 10 people who would get involved ; Their project would be more focused on professional practices, the transmission of their skills and their experience.\r\n-newly graduated students: we would like to propose to 10 of our freshly former students who have just passed their diploma to participate. The Youth Information Center of Franche-Comt\u00e9 is a partner of this project to send other young adults outside the MFR network so they can have a 3-month internship in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe can all notice that it will be the unique opportunity for some of our students to travel abroad. A majority can\u2019t travel with their families for economic reasons. Moreover, 80% of our students live in rural areas and stay attached to their territory.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned will be mainly focused on a professional internship in a company. They will be defined according to the professional sector. Cultural and historical visits could also be done during their free time. The participants would so open to other cultures, other realities, other traditions.\r\n\r\nIn order to manage the project, a consortium was created. Several training centers work together and gather theirs methods and practices. The Regional Federation of the Franche-Comt\u00e9 MFR runs the project.  Many coordination meetings have been set up to follow up the project. The sharing out of the tasks has been organized in order to allow each sending school to focus on the participants.\r\n\r\nThrough this experience, we hope that the participants will acquire a different approach of Europe, of other cultures. They will hopefully discover and use other professional practices, and therefore, develop their technical and linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nThere will be important impacts on the individual themselves, on the sending institution and surely on a regional and even national level. The school will next organize some talking spaces and events to put forward the experiences and newly acquired skills. It will be open to all, so everyone would be able to judge and enjoy the values of such a project.

Therefore we are going arrange a long term English language course in Vaasa and after that continuing with an English language course in Glasgow (5 teachers). The school in Elgoibar has a similar programme in English and both schools will in collaboration develop material, create work placements and improving personnel\u00b4s knowledge.\r\nStudents in security programme (8) will be offered a Security programme course in a vocational school in Denmark. It has been difficult to arrange work placements abroad for security programme students because of the local legislation abroad.\r\nNew partnerships have been created through different projects which we now want to pilot. Some of the previous partners will no longer be in this project because changes of contact persons has made the collaboration less qualitative. The collaboration between partners is mutual and this give a good opportunity for personnel and students in Vamia to internationalize at home, build new contacts and to develop the quality of student exchanges together.\r\nNew partners will also  be given the opportunity to job shadow or do traineeship in Vaasa.

They will develop further LEAN procedures in their own department. The collaboration is mutual. The participating personnel will get trained for Erasmus+ procedures, ECVET and travel security so they are more confident when they send teachers and students abroad.

Ostrobothnia and Vaasa commuting area is bilingual and multilingual. There are many international companies who has English as working language, specially in technology (energy). International competence and good language skills are tools for future success. \r\n\r\nDuring 2013-2015 Vaasa Vocational Institute started piloting ECVET principles in the international mobilities for students. At the same time the institute has tried to establish a continuing and mutual collaboration based on mutual trust and understanding with the partners in Europe. The aim has been to get all study programs at Vaasa Vocational Institute involved in the international activities. \r\n\r\nOVERALL GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE: \r\n\r\nThe project Establishing_ECVET@vao.fi is a mobility project for students and staff at Vaasa Vocational Institute. The project offers mobility to all study programs (EQF4) within the framework for  ECVET -principles. The focus lies on quality and security of mobilities and also on  indentification and recognition of knowledge and skills gained  during the whole mobility process from the beginning to the end with the help of portfolio combined with a electronic  blog.  \r\n\r\nThe focus lies even on the possibilities that the new national curricula for vocational education enables   and on identification and  recognition of informal learning and key competences for lifelong learning. A big emphasis lies also in participants commitment in planning the participants mobilities. \r\n\r\nThe participants are selected among second and third year students from initial vocational programmes (EQF4) within Vaasa Vocational Institute. Students within all disciplines are offered the possibility to participate.  Participants from staff will be head of departments, vocational teachers, study councellors and international co-ordinators. The amount of students is 74 and experts 15. \r\n\r\nThe partners abroad concists of organisations in Sweden, Estonia, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, Spain and Slovenia (totally 15 partners). \r\n\r\nWHY  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration with the partners and the ECVET work at Vaasa Vocational Institute has now come to the point that there is a need to deepen, extend, establish and to develop the quality of the exchange. Also identification and recognition of knowledge and skills that the students acquire abroad has to been extended outside the vocational objectives. Vaasa Vocational Institute is developing models and tools for identification and recognition of knowledge and skills based on the  possibilities that the new national curriculum is enabling (starting in August 1th 2015). These models and tools will be piloted in this project. There is a need for established collaboration with the existing partners with focus on quality and security of the mobilities. There is also an interest in extending the cooperation to new study programs.  An intensive, mutual collaboration with focus on economical working methods and arrangements will gain both partners and students. \r\n\r\nTHE EXPECTED OUTCOMES  \r\n\r\nTo be able to offer qualitative and secure on-the-job placements abroad for students in all study programs within the principles of  ECVET framework. \r\n\r\nAn increased international knowledge, improved language skills and a increased possession of key competences for lifelong learning among the students \r\n\r\nA personnel who has ability and skills to coach the students in their process of gaining international skills. \r\n\r\nA model and tools for identification and recognition of knowledge that the student have obtained during the whole mobility process from the beginning to the end included informal learning. This model can also be established to other study areas, eg entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nElimination of overlapping studies and evaluation which may enable shorter time of studies. \r\n\r\nA possibility to offer the students individual and flexible study paths which respond the students need and interest. \r\n\r\nTHE IMPACT OF RESULTS  \r\n\r\nThat  Vaasa Vocational Institute and vocational education is as a natural choice for potential students. \r\n\r\nThat students of Vaasa Vocational Institutes are attractive in the labour market and and are seen as a natural choice when employing new staff  \r\n\r\nThat the region of Vaasa has access to employees with strong international competence and good language skills \r\n\r\nThe relevant topics for the project are: quality assurance, recognition(non- formal and informal learning/credits), international cooperation, international relations and development cooperation.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008856_4"], [2017, "Une mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne pour une int\u00e9gration professionnelle r\u00e9ussie des apprenants h\u00f4teliers jurassiens du secteur de l'h\u00f4tellerie et de la restauration.", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 84628.0, 2, 2, "Who: Students  during their  initial training in final year of  vocational baccalaureat \u201ccooking\u201d or \u201cfood and beverage service\u201d   - European section.\r\nIntended needs:Do a work placement  in an obligatory professional environment for their cursus in an Anglo-Saxon country during 8 weeks, in connection  with the reference frames of skills of the diplomas mentioned previously.

This project describes a path of disruptive innovation for the development of simple, compliant, yet strong, robust, and easy-to-program manipulation systems. The idea is: Soft Manipulation (SoMa).\n\nSoMa explores a new avenue of robotic manipulation with the environment, as opposed to manipulation of or in the environment. In our approach, the physical constraints imposed by objects in the environment and the manipulandum itself are not regarded as obstacles, but rather as opportunities to guide functional hand pre-shaping, adaptive grasping, and affordance-guided manipulation of objects. The exploitation of these opportunities, which we refer to as environmental constraints (EC), enables robust grasping and manipulation in dynamic, open, and highly variable environments.\n\nThe key ingredient for the exploitation of EC is softness of hands, i.e. their embodied ability to comply and adapt to features of the environment. The traditional paradigm for robotic manipulation is in complete disarray in front of this shift of focus: state-of-the-art grasp planners are targeted towards rigid hands and objects, and attempt to find algorithmic solutions to inherently complex, often ill-posed problems. Further complicating matters, the requirement of planning for soft, uncertain interactions between hand and environment is entirely beyond the state of the art. However, this is how humans most often use their hands, and how we plan to change robotic manipulation.", 650447.0, 5931457.0, 5, 7, "SoMa", "http://soma-project.eu/", null, null, "h2020_194335_935517083"]]}}}}
