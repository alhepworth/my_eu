VET partners will also act as a host for 40 local businesses to participate.What - This is a three year project whereby 8 VET staff and 360 students from four countries will participate in a project aimed at developing new, innovative, creative, entrepreneurial education.  VET students will have the opportunity to learn from real-live start up enterprises and gain insights as to why and how they grow.Staff from the Business Incubation Centre and Business Association will act as a source of expertise and will independently organise a transnational enterprise competition for Enterprise is Vital Club members to participate.Outcomes will include a VITAL Resource Pack for VET Centres to implement an Enterprise Ecosystem (Strategic Intent, Programme Co-ordination, Recruitment of Students, Delivery Methods, Programme Content, Programme Enrichment, Business Planning Competitions and Celebrating Success) thereby bridging the gap between academia and the world of work. As well as a Europass recognition, participants will explore the possibility for ECVET credit for their entrepreneurial learning. By applying the ECVET principles VET student mobility visits will be increased to real learning opportunities as opposed to passive participants on tours and events and in doing so VET students will be able to accumulate and transfer ECVET points.Where \u2013Transnational meetings, blended mobilities and a Joint Staff Training event will be hosted in each of the four partner countries ensuring staff and students gain transnational experience.  When \u2013 Enterprise is VITAL will commence on 1 September 2016 and finish on 31 August 2019.How \u2013 The project will be delivered through an Enterprise Club based at each partner campus.  World of work and businesses will also participate. Enterprise is VITAL is a unique opportunity to engage VET students with employers in an innovative way.  Enterprise is VITAL seeks to build on the shared learning from its predecessor project Enterprise citizens, employees and New venturers (E3) project that identified an unexpected learning opportunity.  During the E3 project 30% of participating VET students stated that they would consider starting a business if the conditions were right and 85% stated that a certificated outcome from entrepreneurial learning would motivate them to participate beyond the idea generation stage.Enterprise is VITAL focuses on this duality of purpose and seeks to move students from the theory of starting a business by experiencing real-life incubation practices \u2018spin-in and spin-out\u2019, participating in a transnational enterprise competition to create ideas that span European borders and gain a European wide credit for their learning. It is very difficult to be an entrepreneur on one's own. Entrepreneurs are adept at developing social capital (people they can collaborate with).
