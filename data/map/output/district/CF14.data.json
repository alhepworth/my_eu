This project aims to provide participating schools with the training and support needed to effect changes to curriculum delivery.We intend to put young people at the heart of this project giving them the opportunity to work with teachers and contributing to the success of the outputs.  Participating teachers will receive comprehensive training on how they can embed creativity across the curriculum and how by improving their own skills in delivering creativity they can raise standards across all subjects but especially in literacy, numeracy and digital competences.   As part of our dissemination and sustainability plans we will train participating teachers to coach others in order to embed creativity across the curriculum in their own setting but also teachers from a wider group of schools, locally, nationally and internationally.  Creative Arts (overarching description of any activity such as drama, music, graphic arts, performing arts, film, visual arts etc.) is increasingly being recognized as an effective tool for working with young people and to give them a means to express themselves openly. Creative Arts is an effective tool to empower all  students including those with behavioural or mental health problems through creativity.  It is a form of expression that improves and enhances physical and emotional wellbeing through reconciling emotional conflicts and fostering self awareness.  In today's society the perception of the success is parallel to academic success.We will include young people from a wide range of ability and socio-economic background.  This projects meets the European Prog. objectives of promoting equity and inclusion by facilitating access to education for learners from a range of ability and those from disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities compared to their peers.Some participating pupils are disadvantaged because of:-disability.  That is participants with special needs people with mental, physical, sensory or other disabilities-educational difficulties. This includes young people with learning difficulties, at risk of early school-leaving, low qualification and/or poor school performance- socio-economic disadvantage.  To include young people with a low standards of living, low family income, dependence on social welfare etc.The pupils will take part in a series of activities throughout the project allowing them the opportunity to express themselves through creativity and to identify skills that they believe make a creative teacher.  Through social media and eTwinning pupils will work with pupils in the partner regions to share ideas and creative projects prior to exhibition during the multiplier events.  They will be given the opportunity to present their ideas and those of their peers overseas to teachers from other schools, families and the wider community. All participating schools will work with families and the wider community to develop family engagement activities.  We know that achievement amongst school pupils is directly impacted upon in families where parents do not see the value of education, this can be for many reasons. Parents may themselves have experienced low achievement in school, many may not have attended school.

It will develop a vocational Training Course for staff of service-providing organisations in collaboration with people with a learning disability that will also be of immediate benefit to family carers and will as part of the project legacy, be adapted to serve as a training course for people with a learning disability. The outcome we seek is to raise awareness amongst staff of service providers, family carers and people with a learning disability themselves of their rights and needs concerning personal relationships and sexuality, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The topic of personal relationships and sexuality is often still considered as a taboo by professionals and families of people with a learning disability. This situation urgently needs to be addressed via coherent training and sensitisation activities so that the competencies of staff working in the disability sector and family carers can be enhanced, their confidence in dealing with matters can grow, with the ultimate goal of improving the well-being of people with a learning disability.  The project partners will seek to secure appropriate accreditation for the Training Course in their respective countries. 'LoveLife' uses an innovative approach focusing on a recognition that people with a learning disability are experts of experience, and training them as co-trainers with non-disabled colleagues to deliver this training course. 6 of the project partners (not EASPD) have played a direct role in trying to support people with a learning disability to address issues arising from relationships and sexuality. Aside from our university partner, P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Salzburg,this activity has been of an informal, unaccredited nature and partners have to some extent been working in an isolated way in their countries. This is because since it is a difficult, sensitive topic, many organisations and family carers feel daunted and give priority to tackling other,less challenging areas. Partners to collaborate with within countries have therefore been hard to find.With an extensive Research Report (IO1), aimed at better understanding the needs of people with a learning disability and the barriers to healthy personal relationships and sexuality in their social and family environments, the partners of the 'LoveLife' project will create a comprehensive toolbox (IO2) and Glossary (IO3) that will be essential elements in development of a Training Course, but will also be a stand alone freely available resource to professionals and other stakeholders interested in this area. The development of a Curriculum (IO4) and a Training Manual (IO5) to include pedagogical methods and tools, will provide the framework for 2 intensive 'Train the Trainer' courses (C1 & C2). The courses, for a total of 48 direct beneficiaries as participants (24 of whom will have a learning disability) will give them the confidence, knowledge and skills they need to deliver the Training Course as part of the legacy of the project.
