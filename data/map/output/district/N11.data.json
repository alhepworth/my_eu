They do \u2013 however \u2013 have one great disadvantage in them being highly unsteady. When the wind doesn't blow - windmills do not generate enough power to satisfy demand. When the wind really blows \u2013 they generate too much power, again a great problem. The same goes for other equivalent energy technologies. Fluctuations in demand and production do not follow the same curve. And you cannot store the energy in the grid!\r\n\r\nAt present we balance the fluctuations with fossil / nuclear fueled power plants which again creates problems such as depletion of fuel, pollution, extremely toxic waste, huge CO2-emissions and dependency on nations that Europe has no interest in being dependant upon.\r\n\r\nThe solution is energy storage, hence the title. There are many ingenious ways to store energy, but so far none that satisfy the needs of a European grid. If we want green energy to become a truly viable energy supply, we must crack some serious nuts.\r\n\r\nSome current problems are:\r\n\r\nLow energy density\r\nLong charge / discharge times\r\nPrice\r\nToxic waste\r\n\r\nSolid-state batteries show a high energy density but also long charge / discharge times. In addition, they are based on metals that are mined in a non-sustainable manner. Organic polymer based batteries have a relatively short charge / discharge time and can be built out of green materials, but show a very low energy density. Capacitors, fuel cells, salt heating etc. have other but equal problems.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to engage and motivate high school students across Europe to be masters of energy storage technology and theory in order to facilitate a lift in the European knowledge base of this area. In short, our students will play a small  but important part in saving the world. Ambitious, yes - but also possible and to be honest, absolutely essential.\r\n\r\nWe are four upper secondary schools from very different regions of EU, in political and geographical terms: Greece, Poland, United Kingdom and Denmark. Each country has it\u2019s own political and scientific discourses when it comes to energy and we need to learn from each other. What works best in Greece does not necessarily work in the UK - but what if it does! The laws of physics are the same no matter where you are born. \r\n\r\nOur schools represent a good cross section of European youth - both talented and challenged. We have a strong focus on science and knowledge sharing in an international context and know that ambition is a great tool for learning and motivation. \r\n\r\nThrough the two year program our students will learn the physics behind energy storage as well as political and logistical complexities of alternative energy production. They will conceptualize and build new ways of storing energy. With the aid of universities, labs etc. the students will get a grasp of the scientific approach to critical thinking and become more aware of possibilities and paths to employability in vital sectors.\r\n\r\nFrom physical problem solving and theoretical physics, via hands-on and entrepreneurial approaches to energy storage and on to the seemingly easy communication and evaluation of these complex matters, this methodology will ensure that both hard & soft skills will be improved in a holistic manner. \r\n\r\nThe results will be tangible. A steeper learning curve through learning that actually matters and makes a difference. Highly motivated and skilled students that will be more than ready to be passed on to universities or other sectors dealing with green energy. Young future scientist that are trained in multilingual contexts and entrepreneurial cooperation. Schools where the know-how, expertise of teachers and the European identity will improve.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits are even more promising. To have a future solid network of young scientist in the field of energy storage base on both professionalism and friendship. \u201cAll\u201d It takes is one really good idea developed in this network to change vastly improve the chances of having a true European electrical grid based on green and sustainable technology. This is the real promise of our project.\r\n\r\nBesides this the active communication of the urgent need for research into energy storage might reach politicians, decision makers and companies. We could help making this a hot topic, the buzzword of those that decide the fate of Europe.", "http://www.alexandrapark.school", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA219-034248_2"]]}}, "2EZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Foreign Sisters", "KORI", 36040.0, 2, 2, "The project Foreign Sisters is an exchange program between young people from the organizations Interlock from Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Kori from London (United Kingdom). The aim of this project is to bring together two young people groups, comparing each other's living worlds with the main theme of developing a female identity, following the themes of racism, exclusion and discrimination of black women in the two European cities.\r\nThe exchange project called Foreign Sisters discusses the problems you face as a growing black woman in a big European city. And to render young people vulnerable to these social issues. Eleven in this project is that there will be two exchange projects. Kori will travel to Amsterdam in October 2017 for an exchange with Interlock. Next, Interlock will travel to London in April 2018 for an exchange with KORI. We think it is important that the intended results from the 1st exchange of October 2017 in Amsterdam are evaluated and continued in London during April 2018. It is necessary that both youth groups perceive each other's living worlds on the spot and implement them in practice through exchange activities. Each exchange group consists of an average of 16 young people and 4 supervisors. The exchange activities consist of the following elements: meeting meetings with intercultural games, group dynamics, debates and informal conversations, workshops resilience and empowerment, youth center visits and historical sights such as a visit to the Tropenmuseum, the Black Archives museum, evaluation meetings, visit to the activities of the Black Achievement Month and culinary evening.", "http://www.kori.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-NL02-KA105-001752_1"]]}}}}
