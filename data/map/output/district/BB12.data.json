There are 235 pupils on roll, predominantly of white British heritage.  The rate of unemployment in the town of Padiham is both higher than the average for Lancashire and higher than the national average.  Following the addition of statutory language teaching to the curriculum, we reviewed our present language teaching provision in school and audited staff to ascertain their level of confidence and skills in the teaching of French.  Results from the audit clearly identified a need for training and development in this area.The Erasmus+ project was highly recommended to us by other primary schools which had benefited enormously from the experience.  We feel that the Erasmus and Key Action 1 objectives would perfectly support our training needs and compliments our School Development Plans. The project team consisted of the Headteacher, Deputy, Subject Leader and Language Specialist formed a Selection Panel and agreed suitable criteria for the selection of candidates.To ensure the success of the project, we will consider the need for CPD language training alongside the personal attributes of the staff involved. We will ensure there was a balanced representation throughout Key Stage 2 and that all candidates are given clear guidance relating to the expectations of their role in actively developing the programme throughout the 2 year project.We are applying for Erasmus+ KA1 funding and have outlined in our bid the intention to send 8 staff members over the course of 2 years on short immersion courses organised by PQ France. This will enable our staff to improve their language skills, deepen their understanding of the cultural heritage and traditions of the French people and make links with a French primary school to give our pupils more purposeful learning.Through our involvement in the project we expect to see a transformation in the provision of language teaching in our school and ultimately to see it impact positively on every pupil. We anticipate teachers and children using language more confidently in lessons and assemblies, creating a real enthusiasm for the language and general buzz around school. We expect to see far more cross curricular links bringing France and Europe into other subject areas; an increased enjoyment of language indicated through audits of pupil responses; an increased participation and progression and more purposeful learning, both written and oral, motivated by direct links with native speakers in a French school. Through the first hand language learning opportunities and new teaching ideas provided by PQ France, we expect to see a significant rise in both the skills and competency of all 8 participants.Over the 2 year period, in response to an effective planned framework of skill dissemination, we anticipate seeing continued growth based on the initial training and the development of real French culture being nurtured within our school.We expect the positive impact to transfer into the wider community on a range of levels. The immediate positive results will be shared within the school and its wider community, through Headteacher reports, Governor meetings, school website, school newsletter and other social media forums including etwinning and the Languages in Primary Schools facebook page.Ongoing information related to the scheme and its impact on academic success of pupils will be shared with staff, Governors, and other cluster schools in our area through regular Headteacher meetings. Raising the profile of language learning and other European cultural values will nurture and inspire a love and enthusiasm for language learning within our children which will permeate throughout the school, home and the wider community. In the longer term, we would hope to see a real development in the language skills of the teachers, built on from their initial training, contributing to their professional development and opening up other possibilities in their future careers. We expect to strengthen our links with the French primary school and develop future projects together. By embracing a shared learning approach, we will provide a valuable model for the children in our school of the positive effects of life long learning.", "http://www.st-john.lancs.sch.uk", "St John the Baptist RC Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023859_coordinator"]]}}, "7PE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Read en France", "Read St Johns CE Primary School", 8376.0, 1, 1, "Read St. John's is a smaller than average primary school in the North West of England.\r\nThe introduction of legislation to teach a foreign language from September 2014 has highlighted a need for us to provide staff training so our teachers have the skills and knowledge to provide quality learning for our children.\r\n\r\nOur staff have basic French and no experience of teaching a foreign language. We have chosen to run a 2 year Erasmus+ project aimed at giving our teachers the opportunity to take part in language and methodology immersion courses in France.\r\n\r\nOur project objectives are:\r\n- improve staff linguistic competences and develop their confidence\r\n- increase the range of teaching ideas to inform classroom planning \r\n- raise cultural understanding at both individual and school-wide level\r\n\r\nDuring the 2 years our project, 6 staff will take part in 8-day structured training courses. We will be visiting a French school as part of the immersion and we hope to build a lasting partnership with the staff and children we meet. \r\n\r\nWe expect participants will return with new skills, knowledge and confidence which they will pass on to other colleagues and children in the school. Our aim in the short term, is that staff are able to confidently teach their own language lessons and use their growing awareness of French culture to make links to other areas of the curriculum. \r\n\r\nLonger term benefits will be that our staff, inspired by their French experience, continue to develop their linguistic skills and grow in confidence and competence so the children of Read St John are able to transfer to high school achieving or exceeding the levels expected by the new National Curriculum.", "http://www.read.lancs.sch.uk", "Read St Johns CE Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012737_coordinator"]]}}}}
