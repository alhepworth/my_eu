Producing operational representations of style is precisely the subject matter of the ERC project Flow-machines, which already produced scientific and technical breakthroughs: turning style into a new content type is within reach. The next step is to explore commercial strategies to exploit style. \nThe goal of this PoC project is to apply these techniques to synchronized music, and to study three business models in the movie, game and advertisement sectors. The project will: 1) develop a style manipulation prototype for synchronized music, 2) evaluate the prototype in the key industrial sectors and 3) clear legal issues related to the exploitation of style information.", null, 119773.0, 2, 3, "FlowMachines", null, null, null, "h2020_193789_960670347"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "SONY EUROPE LIMITED*", 766787.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_11124"], [2017, "SONY EUROPE LIMITED*", 229902.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (15.03.50.01)", "fts_2017_10683"]]}}, "8JG": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "ENGAGE BUSINESS MEDIA LTD", 817.0, "Other management expenditure (14.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_47572"]]}}, "8RN": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "ROAD HAULAGE ASSOCIATION LIMITED*", 274.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18784"]]}}}}
