We are in a very strong position now to take on a large-scale staff training project that builds up the confidence, the knowledge, the understanding and the enthusiasm of my team. \r\n\r\nWith the changes to the curriculum that was introduced in September 2014, we have spent the last two years really getting to grips with what needs to be done. Having spent time on the core areas of English, Maths and Science, we are really looking forward to giving the Modern Foreign Language expectations a high priority. It is time to bring French to life! \r\n\r\nOver a two year period, we will send 12 participants on structured training courses in France, and have planned an ambitious project that will inspire our staff and children, and transform French teaching and learning within our school. \r\n\r\nIn order for the project to be successful, I have already enlisted the help of key personnel; my Senior Leadership Team, my School Business Manager, my French lead teachers and our governors. \r\n\r\nA plan is developing to ensure that the practical elements of the project are carefully thought through. We have a timetable of attendance to ensure the correct members of the team go at the correct time for maximum benefit to the school and our pupils. \r\n\r\nOur Learning Journeys will capture the process beautifully, and become a personal diary that will be excellent evidence of the value of the project. \r\n\r\nI have every confidence that this project will have a positive impact right from the very start. The timing of the project is perfect - as a school we are more than ready to take on the challenges of a large-scale project, we are experienced in working and learning together and the pupils deserve the very best quality teaching.", "http://mossheyprimary.co.uk", "Moss Hey Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035409_coordinator"]]}}, "2DG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Improvement of the plastic packaging waste chain from a circular economy approach", "Axion Recycling Ltd", "The European plastic market is not currently aligned with the circular economy. More than 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced per year in the EU28 being recycled only 29.7%. This represents a clear loose in the plastic market loop (losses of \u20ac10.56bn). Moreover, this goes against the EU legislation on waste (high environmental impact; 23.8 Mt of CO2). \nLow recycling rates of plastic are mainly due to the situation of packaging waste (i.e. main plastic waste fraction), since it is mainly domestic residue and consequently the quality of the material collected depends on the system of segregation available and the environmental awareness of citizens.\n\nPlastiCircle aims to develop and implement a holistic process to increase recycling rates of packaging waste in Europe. This will allow to reprocess again plastic waste in the same value chain (i.e. Circular economy; closure of plastic loop). This process is based on four axes: collection (to increase quantity of packaging collected), transport (to reduce costs of recovered plastic), sorting (to increase quality of recovered plastic), and valorization in value-added products (i.e. foam boards, automotive parts like engine covers/bumpers/dashboards, bituminous roofing membranes, garbage bags, asphalt sheets/roofing felts and urban furniture like fences/benches/protection walls). \n\nThe target is to increase collection from 81.7% to 87% and valorization in a 9.8%. The implementation of PlastiCircle approach in Europe have the potential to increase collected plastic in 861,250t (reaching 14.14 Mt) and valorization in 1.59Mt. The valorization of this new material, represents a market value of \u20ac2.86bn-\u20ac7.95bn.

We will also update our cultural knowledge and give staff the opportunity to develop new teaching ideas and discuss important issues relating to language teaching.We will update our MFL Schemes of Work and particularly develop our A-level syllabus to include more current culture and up-to-date information. We need to better engage and motivate students and find more ways to introduce native speakers to the language classroom We also intend to promote language learning to our pupils to improve their aspirations and employability, help them to understand how languages are a vital skill and increase the uptake of languages. We will also focus on bridging the attainment gap, raising the attainment of our Pupil Premium children and closing gender attainment gaps within languages. We also want to focus on linking languages and literacy and developing a cross curricular approach to language teaching to reinforce learning and show pupils the relevance of languages. We will increase our links with local primary schools to support them in introducing languages to the curriculum.We will involve members of staff from the MFL department and our PE/Food Technology/English departments in intensive training courses in Spain and France.The courses will include intensive language training, cultural activities and teaching methodology and a visit to a Spanish or French school. The focus of the visit will be observing good practice and building links with Spanish and French schools. We will then use these links to give our pupils a better insight into other people\u2019s lives and improve their cultural awareness through having contact with pupils in the Spanish and French schools and getting to know them personally. The courses will help our staff to find out about Spanish/ French culture and celebrations, which we can then weave into our teaching, giving pupils a positive experience of this culture.All of these improvements will lead to more positive attitudes towards the importance of learning languages and developing awareness of other cultures. We will make better use of international links with increased communication and more celebration of other cultures.

Staff competence and confidence in speaking French is low at present and French is taught by the MFL coordinator or the visiting native speaker.  Staff are motivated to develop their skills and increase their confidence in speaking French which will equip them to teach French at St. Peter's.  A course in France  will be the optimum means  to achieve these objectives. At present, two staff will be selected to participate in in-service training abroad. The identified staff have different levels of attainment and confidence in speaking French. The selected course in France will allow staff to gather authentic resources for use in the classroom, learn more about the culture, bring fresh ideas back to the classroom and develop language skills through being taught by a native speaker. Methodology and pedagogy sessions will include using songs and rhymes, games, drama and stories to teach language to young learners. The use of ICT will enhance language teaching and learning whilst motivating pupils to become independent learners e.g. research into French speaking countries on the Internet. The course will enable teachers to plan and assess to ensure progression and support transition to high school. Staff will also become familiar with key documents e.g. Curriculum 2014 and how this will impact on schools.\r\nAs a result of staff attending training abroad, we expect:\r\n1. Confidence levels in speaking French will increase. \r\n2. Competence in speaking French will improve\r\n3. A desire for further language learning \r\n4.
