This will be done according to the 3rd Catalan Vocational Training Plan 2013-2016 and the Strategic Agreement 2013-2016 between the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya) . One of the SOC (Employment Service of Catalonia) priorities is to foster and ensure people\u2019s professional qualification. In order to achieve this priority, the SOC has a high value tool: the Professional Training and Innovation Centres (CIFO). The training activity of the CIFOs is based on imparting specific and quality training actions for employment matching the needs of people, companies and territories. They provide the necessary theoretical and practical training to achieve or improve skills in order to contribute to the employability of their pupils, which are unemployed registered as job seekers in the Job Centre. We have 8 CIFOs, each one with its own specific specialities. 100 participants will be chosen to take part in this project among the pupils in the CIFOs taking part in the courses addressed to obtain a Certificate of Proficiency (CP) within the Vocational Training for Employment supply 2014-2015. In the moment of their registration they will have to show interest in taking part in this project.\r\n\r\nThose who succeed in their training courses, will be given the opportunity to enter a selection process for 16 weeks traineeship in a European company within the next year after obtaining their CP. Specialities will be such as \"ICT\" = Information and Communications Technology, Renewable Energy, Industrial Mechanics, Electrical Installation, Industrial Automation Systems, Welder, Chemistry, Logistics, Management, Finances, Comercial Management, etc... \r\n\r\nOur project starts from a new concept which consists in complementing the value of the CP with a traineeship in a foreign labour environment, which is real but strange, and they will have the chance to use their recently acquired knowledge and skills in a different language. Therefore, the CIFO will provide language courses in order to improve adaptation in the host country. \r\n\r\nCandidates will have to prepare a CV in the Europass format and a motivation letter in the language of the host country or in English as common language. We have a network of intermediary partners which are experts in mobility management in different European countries. They are in charge of matching the proper companies with the profiles of our participants and be always aware of the acquired competences and those to be acquired. \r\n\r\nThe SOC, together with the Catalan Chambers of Commerce General Council, have developed an Application called qBID to put into effect the management of internships. The qBID will provide planning, monitoring and evaluation of the stay abroad of the Catalan participants in this project. This Application has been successfully used for 10 years in the monitoring of internships in the Initial Vocation Training in Catalonia so far and has been recently been adapted to the Vocational Training for Employment. As a novelty for this project, the qBID will include on-line monitoring methods of the traineeship abroad. A Training Agreement containing the Erasmus + own prescriptions will be designed in this tool as well as an Activity Plan, dimensioning the dedication time for each skill, anticipating the evaluation, monitoring the work of the trainee and the trainee himself will be able to value how the internship is appropriate to their previous training, the tutor will evaluate the trainee and will qualify the results and the company will evaluate the evolution and the profile of the trainee. Once the stay is finished, a follow-up process will take place, regarding the employability of the participant after 3/6, and 12 months through indicators. \r\n\r\nAn increase of the internship hours improves the qualification and the employability of the trainees.
