This film, \u201cOne of Them\u201d, is partly based on the director\u2019s own experiences and is a reaction to the need that\u2019s felt by participants of this project to address young girls concerns and experiences in film. \r\n\r\nFilm is a mass medium that is mostly made up of male scriptwriters and directors. This means that male experiences are given preference. There is a gap in the market for a story told by women for women and we intend to help fill that gap with this short film. \r\n\r\n\u201cOne of Them\u201d tells the story of the fourteen year old girl Soffia who has been bullied at her school for most of her life. She is an outsider and her only friend is a boy in her class, another outsider. They have been friends since childhood but as Soff\u00eda grows older she's uncomfortably aware that he's not enough anymore. She's had enough of staying on the sidelines. She feels like she\u2019s missing out on life and is desperate to be accepted into the dominant group of girls at her school. She gets her way by taking action and picking a fist-fight with the leader of the girls. Winning the fight gives Soffia a foot in the door but she has to prove herself further by participating in group activities, such as shop-lifting and drinking. The final test to prove her loyalty to the group comes when, a few days after the fist-fight, the kids throw a rainbow party. A rainbow party is when boys and girls come together, the girls all wear different shades of lipstick and are expected to perform oral sex on the boys, creating a rainbow pattern on their penises. This is a loyalty test. Soffia knows that she will have to perform this too if she wants to become fully a part of the group. Filled with liquid courage Soffia is finally ready and is pushed into a room by the girls where they tell her a boy is waiting. But it turns out to be none other than her childhood friend lying passed out on the floor from too much alcohol. With the group of girls standing behind her, Soffia now has to make the fateful decision of whether she is to take advantage of her childhood friend in order to prove her loyalty to her new friends. \r\n\r\nThe participating companies are Icelandic based Askja Films who will provide main support and management of the project and UK based Booruffel Films who will provide minor support and management and also technical supervision in post-production.\r\nThis is an Icelandic-UK co-production where the script is written in Iceland, pre-production is handled jointly by both participant companies, the film will be shot on location in Iceland over a period of one week with Icelandic actors and a mix of Icelandic and British crew and post-production will be done to a large extent in the UK and to a minor extent in Iceland. The Director, Eva Sigurdardottir, lived and worked in the UK for a number of years, but more recently she moved back home to Iceland where she intends to shoot this film. This co-production will bring together the two industries that she knows so well, and be an opportunity to share skills and knowledge between the two sides. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to address the peer pressure and conformism faced by teenage girls everywhere in the western world. By making this film we will be finding and training teenage actors who will benefit from the training received by the director and casting director. Young adult will also be given the opportunity to work on their filmmaking skills and honing their talent, which they might otherwise find difficult since it is always hard to get funding for a starting project. We hope that the co-operation between the countries will be beneficial to both partners.

Stalled RNAPII triggers transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, a process whereby lesions in genes are preferentially removed. Importantly, however, UV-irradiation also affects transcription genome-wide, so that even genes that are not damaged temporarily cease to be expressed. Alternative mRNA splicing also changes dramatically. The mechanisms and factors that underlie the global, damage-induced changes in gene expression, and its eventual normalization, are poorly understood. \nIn order to facilitate identification of new factors and mechanisms involved in this response, we performed several distinct proteomic screens and an siRNA screen in parallel.

A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA damage by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. Following the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs), the NBS1 protein is required for activation of ATM. But ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage. Treatment of cultured cells with hypotonic stress leads to the activation of ATM, presumably due to changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described a second ATM cofactor, ATMIN (ATM INteractor). ATMIN is dispensable for DSBs-induced ATM signalling, but ATM activation following hypotonic stress is mediated by ATMIN. While the biological role of ATM activation by DSBs and NBS1 is well established, the significance, if any, of ATM activation by ATMIN and changes in chromatin was up to now completely enigmatic.\nATM is required for class switch recombination (CSR) and the suppression of translocations in B cells. In order to determine whether ATMIN is required for any of the physiological functions of ATM, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse model for ATMIN. ATM signaling was dramatically reduced following osmotic stress in ATMIN-mutant B cells. ATMIN deficiency led to impaired CSR, and consequently ATMIN-mutant mice developed B cell lymphomas. Thus ablation of ATMIN resulted in a severe defect in ATM function. Our data strongly argue for the existence of a second NBS1-independent mode of ATM activation that is physiologically relevant.

In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012). These data suggest that in-depth analysis of tumour evolution may help define routes through which tumours must progress, offering opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We will develop new animal models of ITH, by developing knock-out strains for two suppressors of replication stress and CIN, recently identified in our laboratory (Burrell Nature 2013).

As a counter-defense, viruses deploy viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). Well-established in plants and invertebrates, the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals has remained unknown until our recent findings (from my first postdoctoral studies) that undifferentiated mouse cells infected with Encephalomyocarditis virus or Nodamuravirus accumulate 22-nt long siRNAs. These derived from viral dsRNA replication-intermediates, incorporated into AGO2, were eliminated in Dcr knockout cells, and decreased in abundance upon cell differentiation.

We concluded that antiviral RNAi operates in mammalian cells. One of the key findings from this study was that antiviral RNAi operates in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. Our main hypothesis for this discrepancy is that, in mammalian cells, virus infection triggers other defense systems that are not sequence-specific by nature -such as the interferon (IFN) response- and that these defense pathway may mask the effects of RNAi. Accordingly long dsRNA-triggered RNAi is active in mESCs, which are known to be defective in their IFN response.

Therefore, uncovering the spatio-temporal heterogeneity, i.e., when, where, and how melanoma cells respond to drug and acquire resistance in a complex tumour microenvironment is the key step toward the comprehensive understanding of resistance mechanisms. To tackle these problems, we will investigate the tolerance and resistance to B-Raf inhibitors with single cell resolution in vivo. We have established melanoma cell lines stably expressing EKAR-EV biosensor that reports ERK activity in living cells. In vitro, the melanoma cells show homogenous responses to BRaf inhibitors, whereas intravital analysis indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in ERK activity within tumours. This cannot be attributed simply B-Raf mutation as all cells contain the oncogene, and we hypothesize that additional signals from the microenvironment activate ERK, possibly putting the neighbouring melanoma cells in drug-tolerant state. Similar mechanisms are possible at metastatic locations. The tumour microenvironment of CNS metastases is quite different from those of other organs, it is particularly enriched in RTK ligands.

The observed precision and reproducibility of gene expression appears greater than can be accounted for by the precision of Shh signalling alone. Thus, mechanisms must exist that filter signaling noise.

After activation, B cells proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells. The mechanism involved in this B cell fate decision has been recently explored and a new theory has been proposed based on the existence of an asymmetrical B cell division (1). This theory assumes the unequal inheritance of antigen between daughter cells due to antigen being rapidly polarized in a unique compartment that is maintained along B cell division. This polarity abolishes the uniform distribution of antigen vesicles between daughter cells, generating two functionally different B cells.\nThis proposal is focused on understanding how this initial antigen polarity is established and maintained and what is its role in B cell activation. Furthermore, the functional significance of the asymmetrical B cell decision will be analyzed in vitro and in vivo. In addition, possible new parameters asymmetrically distributed that could also determine B cell fate decisions will be evaluated.\nDuring this project, a huge range of techniques including state-of-the-art microscopy (in vitro and in vivo methodologies), flow cytometry systems (multiparametric analysis and ImageStream) will be used and advance mathematical analysis approaches will be developed.\nResults from this proposal will contribute to the general knowledge of immunological responses, but more precisely will explain how different B cell populations are originated after B cell activation, a key step that is deregulated in some diseases such as cancer.\n\n1.\tO.

HA consists of the receptor-binding HA1 and the fusion-mediating HA2, which has two membrane-interacting elements: the N-terminal fusion peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane anchor. At low pH, HA2 undergoes a series of conformational changes that project the fusion peptide out of a protein pocket towards the target membrane, and subsequently bring fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor, and likely the two membranes, into close proximity. The conformational changes are defined by crystal structures at neutral and low pH, but the membrane-associated parts of the protein were absent from the crystallization constructs.

Unfortunately, regardless of the outcome of recent studies identifying specific KRASG12C inhibitors, so far, oncogenic KRAS is not a druggable target yet. The best-characterized KRAS effector pathway, the ERK cascade consists of RAF, MEK and ERK proteins that can be inhibited with small molecules targeting their kinase activities. As the development of RAF and MEK kinases inhibitors progressed, feedback loop reactivating the ERK cascade have emerged, inducing resistance to treatment. Thus, new innovative strategies are needed to achieve a more long-term inhibition of this signalling pathway, while reducing detrimental side effects due to MAPK inhibition in normal cells. It has been described more than 20 years ago that RAF directly interacts with RAS through its Ras Binding Domain (RBD), and many research groups have been trying to disrupt this interaction developing allosteric inhibitors as a cancer therapy. At the moment, those molecules need to be improved in order to achieve a strong inhibition of this pathway. Surprisingly, no mouse model actually demonstrates the requirement of RAS/RAF interaction during KRAS-induced lung tumourigenesis.

The influence on the whole population of environmental factors is undoubtedly powerful, but one remarkable feature of the obesity epidemic is the persistence of enormous individual variation in body weight throughout the population.

The aim of this project is to work beyond these boundaries for the first time and so recover this profoundly influential dispensation, presenting it as a vibrant entity with connections across several regions and sub-continental areas. To address this aim, three PIs have formed an interdisciplinary team spanning linguistics, history, religious studies, geography, archaeology, Indology, Sinology and GIS/IT technologies.

The SUSTRAIL integrated approach is based on innovations in rolling stock and freight vehicles (with a targeted increased in speed and axle-load) combined with innovations in the track components (for higher reliability and reduced maintenance), whose benefits to freight and passenger users (since mixed routes are considered) are quantified through the development of an appropriate business case with estimation of cost savings on a life cycle basis.  In fact, a holistic approach to vehicle and track sustainability has to be taken, since improvements in track design and materials alone are not enough as demands on the rail system increase.\nContributions from the different topic areas (vehicles, track, operations) will be demonstrated on real routes, offering geographic dispersion as well as differences in type, speed, and frequency of traffic.\nA strong multidisciplinary consortium committed to concrete actions aligned toward a common outcome has been grouped for the achievement of the challenging objectives of the project with a balanced combination of Infrastructure managers, freight operators and Industry, including Large and Small enterprises, with support from Academia.", 329752.0, 7685789.0, 13, 31, "SUSTRAIL", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157228.jpg", "fp7_99098_999540963"], [1222819200000, 1333152000000, "INtegrated European Signalling System", "Network Rail Infrastructure Limited", "Due to the seamless guidance by rails, the railway system requires a dedicated signalling sub-system, whereby a major part of the functionality must be ensured and controlled on the infrastructure side. From a European perspective, the traditional signalling is one of the most conservative parts of the railway system strongly bound to the national traditions by all involved parties.Since 1990 the EU is promoting the reformation of parts of the signalling subsystem under the ERTMS programme.However this covers not the whole signalling system.The implementation of ETCS could be hampered, in areas of the conventional European rail network, where interlocking will need to be replaced, if this cannot be carried out in an economically and technically efficient manner. Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles.

The exchanges will be supervised by an experienced host qualified in family medicine.This project is an extension of the well established European Hippokrates exchange program (http://vdgm.woncaeurope.org/content/about-hippokrates) developed by the Vasco da Gama Movement of young family doctors affiliated with WONCA Europe (http://www.woncaeurope.org/), the European division of the World Organisation of Family Doctors. The programme was founded from a recognition that junior doctors benefit from the opportunity to directly experience the delivery of family medicine in other European countries. This vital addition to training identified family doctors who are better prepared for an increasingly multicultural workplace and society.The aim of the project is exchange and mobility of junior family doctors, providing a broader perspective of family medicine and, in addition, to evaluate family medicine across Europe, explore best practice and promote personal and professional development.The placement will take the form of a 2-week observational role to a number of different European countries with established partners.

Moreover, the study demonstrated very significant drop in all cause mortality of the IFN-beta treated patients at the day 28, the only accepted efficacy measurement as the primary end point for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. The pharmacological effect of IFN-beta is based on its ability to increase the de novo synthesis of endothelial cell surface anti-inflammatory molecule CD73, which can locally produce the enzymatic end product adenosine.

RTIs are major causes of morbidity and mortality in adults and children worldwide causing millions of deaths each year. RTIs affecting the lung parenchyma (pneumonia) can be classified into three main categories: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP); Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) which includes Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP); and opportunistic pathogens causing pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients (Opportunistic RTIs or ORTIs). RTIs are difficult to diagnose accurately and current standard microbiological culture based tests are laborious and time consuming with a turnaround time to results > 30 hours. Thus, all ill patients presenting with CAP, HAP, VAP or ORTIs are initially treated empirically with antibiotics, without an accurate identification of the causative microorganism and associated antibiotic susceptibility profile. This leads to inappropriate use of antibiotics, which can increase patient morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a great need for rapid molecular diagnostics tests capable of identifying a large range of microorganisms and antibiotic resistances rapidly and accurately so that appropriate therapy can be instituted on first consultation. Accurate pathogen identification and resistance profiling is also important for the epidemiological surveillance of pneumonia.

The content packages will be used in ten science museums, 34 universities, hundreds of online media channels and many other outlets covering 37 countries. These will be sustainable communication channels, which the ERC can continue using when the contract is over, targeting key audience segments: more than 40 million people. This campaign \u2013 as \u2018cool\u2019 as the ERC itself - will stir interest in science, raise awareness of the ERC as a science power, build broader political and societal support for the ERC \u2013 and encourage grant applications from a new generation of researchers, especially in countries under-represented among ERC grantees.", 57565.0, 810141.0, 6, 8, "ScienceSquared", null, null, null, "h2020_198734_939904587"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1459468800000, 1561852800000, "Capital Accelerate & Scale-up Tech Superstars (CASTS)", "Capital Enterprise", "The project expands the provision of London\u2019s accelerator programmes to generate more innovative tech and tech-focused fast growth companies.

Given that the harmonization with Acquis Communautaire is par excellence legal issue, and taking into account that the most important chapters in the accession negotiation process are related to legal aspects, the role of UoM Faculty of Law at this moment is of crucial importance.Key objectives of the project are following:- Through facilitating various study visits between partner institutions from various Member States, securing the proper training for UoM Faculty of Law academic staff, so as to improve their general teaching skills and their level of comprehension and understanding of various aspects of EU law;- Assessment  and potential refreshment of the newly accredited general curriculum;- Confirming that curricula of the various courses dominantly or partially linked to various aspects of EU law are framed in a manner that equals that of such courses in EU Member States;- Producing a guidebook/reference manual on teaching and researching various aspects of EU law in Montenegro;- Contributing to overall endeavors of Montenegro in successful closing of accession negotiations with EU. Impacts:The project will allow academic staff to acquire new competences which they will systematically transfer not only to students but to Montenegrin judges as well, since they will be involved via project partners, such as Judicial Council and Judicial Training Centre.

All components are linked to the current policy question of how taxes influence debt and systemic risk, and all use novel dynamic structural models. I am unique in explicitly linking such models to empirical testing.\nTheory: \u201cLearning, Capital Structure and Systemic Risk.\u201d Standard dynamic structural models of financing assume firms know the stochastic process governing cash flow. I will first consider a partial equilibrium model. Here firms are exposed to rare event risk, with the true probability being unknown. Firms learn and update beliefs regarding risk. Relative to standard models, firms are debt conservative and there is leverage persistence. In many cases, firms increase leverage only if they have avoided a negative shock long enough. In order to analyze asset pricing implications, I plan to embed such firms in a general equilibrium setting with a common catastrophic risk having unknown probability. Firms rationally respond to \u201cGreat Moderations\u201d by increasing leverage. Recessions are more severe after long tranquil periods due to high debt overhang. A third paper, Re-Examining the Link Between Leverage and Systematic Risk, considers cross sectional asset pricing implications of credit shocks. The standard levered beta formula is erroneous, and the pre-tax cost of capital increases with debt. Together, the models show privately optimal debt is lower than recognized, and that tax breaks for debt reduce welfare.\nEmpirical Testing: \u201cNatural Experiment Policy Evaluation\u2014A Structural Critique.\u201d A common approach to testing whether taxes influence corporate financing and investment decisions is to compare leverage and investment before/after tax changes. I use a structural model as a laboratory to show that lack of a statistically significant change is not sufficient to reject the null that \u201ctaxes matter.\u201d I will first consider an economy where the tax rate is a Markov process. Flotation costs on debt and real irreversibility limit the response of financing and investment to changes in shadow prices. More importantly, responses to tax changes are attenuated whenever they are partially anticipated and not permanent. Standard tests violate rational expectations by implicitly assuming tax changes come as surprises, with each new change being viewed as permanent, until the next surprise. My argument implies that standard tax experiments cannot falsify the null that taxes affect behaviour. Further, one cannot generalize elasticities if the policy transition matrix differs. I will propose an alternative Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing.

However, recent empirical evidence suggests that leading asset pricing models cannot explain how risks are priced across maturities in equity markets, which is a key input to measuring the costs of business cycles. An analysis of what leading models miss will vastly improve our understanding of how the real economy and asset prices are related. Also, by expanding our empirical evidence about the term structure of equity to the firm-level, I plan to study how investment decisions relate to asset prices. My goal is to measure the firms' incentives to invest and how this impacts economic growth more broadly.\n2.Financial Economics of Insurance Markets: Households in Europe and the US can choose from a wide variety of insurance products that insure health and mortality risks. Choosing between these products is no easy task and the costs from sub-optimal insurance choices are estimated to be large. My plan is to develop a comprehensive life-cycle theory of insurance choice that accounts for family structure, risk factors such as labor income and housing, and different institutional settings across countries. I also plan to study the supply side of insurance markets. The traditional view is that insurance prices are driven by life-cycle demand or informational frictions. However, as is clear from evidence during the financial crisis, insurance companies are in fact financial institutions. If financial constraints bind, it may affect insurance prices and ultimately consumers' welfare. My goal is to understand how financial frictions affect insurance companies.

This proposal describes my research agenda over the next five years to fill this important gap in academic and policy knowledge. The emphasis is on a new empirical framework to revisit the transmission mechanism of changes in macroeconomic policies and institutions through their (possibly unintended) consequences on uncertainty, risk and inequality across diverse groups of society and across countries. The proposed approach combines survey data, international evidence and a narrative identification of policy and institutional changes from the analysis of historical records. Another main contribution will be the development of analytical frameworks to account for the stylized facts uncovered by the proposed empirical approach. These include models of imperfect information on individual tax rates and inter-generational risk-sharing within households as well as characterizations of the way monetary institutions and labour market regulations interact to affect macroeconomic uncertainty and financial market volatility. The ambition is to generate a set of testable predictions that could then be used to identify and assess the relative merits of specific theoretical mechanisms in the data.

Incentives of Money Managers and Asset Pricing\nThe leading theories of asset pricing stipulate that prices in financial markets are determined by households who seek to optimise lifetime consumption (or by the so-called  representative consumer ). This approach leaves no role for important institutional frictions such as, e.g., financial constraints and contract-induced incentives that played a major role in the 2008 crisis. An analysis of such frictions will add vastly to our understanding of how institutions make decisions and will also allow us to explore the implications of these decisions for asset prices. I propose to depart from the representative agent paradigm and introduce explicitly institutional investors into asset-pricing models. My goal is to understand how institutions affect financial markets and the real economy and to help develop appropriate policy responses.\n2. International macro-finance\nIn the past two decades, economic globalisation has produced an unprecedented rise in cross-border equity holdings. Accounting for capital gains on these equity holdings, currently disregarded both in the official statistics and in traditional international macroeconomics, may potentially overturn implications and policy recommendations of the leading theories. In this project, I seek to enrich the field by incorporating explicitly portfolio choice and capital gains on financial assets. Such a theory marries two fields of research:  international economics (Economics) and asset pricing (Finance).\n3. Combining the above two areas\nThe 2008 crisis was sparked by banks and lead to a worldwide recession. Combining the insights from the first two projects, I intend to research how the instability spreads across countries and how incentives of institutions ought to be designed to limit the consequences of their actions for asset values and the real economy.", 752604.0, 752604.0, 1, 1, "IFAP", null, "http://www.london.edu", null, "fp7_96427_999433681"], [1427846400000, 1522454400000, "Long-Term Investment", "London Business School", "The typical 20th-century firm was capital-intensive and competed on cost efficiency.  The 21st-century firm is different.  Competitive success increasingly depends on product quality, which in turn hinges on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture.  Unlike tangible investment such as buying a factory, the fruits of intangible investment may take several years to appear.  A manager pressured to maximise short-term earnings may fail to invest, jeopardising the long-term future of his firm.  This project will study the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three linked components.\n\nFinancial Markets.  The traditional view is that financial markets dissuade investment by forcing firms to cater to short-term shareholders.  I will study two channels through which markets promote investment.  First, traders gather information about a firm\u2019s past investments and incorporate it into stock prices by trading - rewarding the manager for good investment.  Second, traders can gather information about a firm\u2019s future investment opportunities - informing the manager about his future investment decisions.  I aim to analyse what determines the efficiency of both channels. \n\nIncentives.  Most research on incentives focuses on either the level of pay, or the sensitivity of pay to performance, but it is the horizon of incentives that is key to promoting investment.  I will theoretically analyse the optimal incentive horizon, and empirically demonstrate how it affects long-term decisions.

Despite their wide use across the world, the quantitative effects of these large scale measures on the aggregate economy remain unclear.  The main reason for this uncertainty is that governments and central banks have been unable, so far, to target the households and businesses more likely to boost the recovery:  (i) some consumers may not spend their income tax rebate in the anticipation of future tax raises;  (ii) part of the financial institutions may use the expansion of the central banks\u2019 balance sheet to increase their capital ratio rather than lending;  (iii) many import good producers may take advantage of fluctuations in the exchange rate to vary their price mark-up as opposed to passing it to customers;  (iv) entrepreneurs may delay some investment projects until part of the uncertainty on their returns is resolved.\nThis research aims at contributing to the growing empirical and theoretical literature on macroeconomic dynamics with heterogeneous agents by offering an empirical evaluation of the policies and macroeconomic conditions that prevailed during the financial crisis.  The aggregate effects of individual heterogeneity will be quantified across groups of the society endogenously determined within the estimation method.

These people can have problems when reading such as difficulty understanding complex instructions, misinterpreting literal meanings, or being confused by uncommon words, figures of speech and lack of precision.<br/>Using the language technology created in the FIRST project, users with ASD can convert a standard document into a personalised version which is easier for them to understand. The conversion software will automatically detect problematic language and replace it to make the text clearer. It will also simplify complex structure in the text and clarify ambiguity. Not relying purely on textual changes, the conversion software will add illustrative pictures to documents and will also offer navigation tools such as hyperlinked tables of contents and concise document summaries. Users with ASD will thus be empowered to read any documents with confidence and at their own convenience, without relying on support workers as can currently be the case. This will enable users with ASD to gain better access to educational, vocational, cultural and social opportunities in Europe.<br/>Clinicians in three different EU countries will work closely with a test group of people with ASD, who will review the software and provide feedback to ensure that it is developed to meet their requirements. Tests of reading comprehension with and without the software will provide an explicit indication of the software's advantages.  The involvement of a European support group for people with ASD will allow news of the software to be easily distributed to those who could benefit from it.<br/>An exciting aspect of FIRST's research is that the simplifying language technology to be developed will have wide-ranging applications beyond that of users with ASD.

This is the lowest rate for the EU-28 since September 2011, but anyway the rate is still higg as the latest statistics of Eurostat december 2016 shows 18.6 % of young people are unemployed in the EU-28. The highest rates were observed in , Greece (46.13%), Spain (43.6 %)Italy (36.4 %), Croatia (29.7%) (Eurostats).\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship is one the most important aspects to fight against youth unemployment. In our contemporary world, social entrepreneurship is becoming one of the effective and innovative methods to solve the social problems and unemployment too. It gives the opportunity to deal with problematic issues in a creative way that in return it helps involve into social sphere more people, create alternative jobs and income.In the light of economic changes, globalisation and requirements on labour market (the moving from employment to employability) entrepreneurship itself is becoming a popular issue among young people, a lot of them are struggling to find job or having their own income. As a result of these, young people are searching alternative ways wsuch as running their own enterprises. In order to be able to do this, they need some certain skills and knowledge such as business sector, understanding financial risk and management, having soft skills (communication, leadership, management etc). Moreover, 90% of all startups are failing which stops young people to put their ideas in action. \r\n\r\nAt this point NGOs should provide young people with information and help on the topic of social entrepreneurship and involve them into the issue.
