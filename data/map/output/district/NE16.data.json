The result will be to ensure the acquisition of key competences with a focus on entrepreneurship which is seen as a key competence itself in the European strategic framework ET 2020.  A strategic game will be the core of the SUSEN learning arrangement. Students of 7th-8th grade to assume the role of a manager/entrepreneur in the market of energy provision and collaborate in teams. The game-character of SUSEN will typically raise motivation so the learning topic has the maximum impact with the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium selected the energy sector as a focus for the project to combine entrepreneurship education with education for sustainable development. Energy provision, energy mix and energy consumption are central issues for sustainable trajectories in times of climate change. Sustainability comprises not only environmental but also economic and social factors to consider. The game brings together economic questions of entrepreneurial success with questions of corporate citizenship and personal civic engagement.  As a consequence, the learning programme will combine a classroom game with elements of service learning. Participating students have the opportunity to learn outside the confines of school. Students will be confronted with tasks that require contacts with utility companies as well as with nonprofit/community organisations. With this enrichment of traditional game construction the partners intend to sensitise students not only for community but also to create opportunities and preparing young people for when they leave school. It will also engender cooperation between schools and business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SUSEN game-based learning is innovative according to the mentioned combination of learning topics with their particular learning goals: education for sustainable development, entrepreneurship education, and civic education. Far more, it will support collaboration strategies between the game players besides strategies to succeed in a competitive environment. It fosters creativity and design thinking, self-efficacy and self-efficiency. Last but not least it requires transversal competences like a sense of initiative, learning to learn and digital competences. For this reason the consortium adopted a blended learning concept creating an online companion to accompany the game which is appealing to the younger audience offering  \u2018auditory\u2019 and \u2018visual\u2019 learning styles. \r\n\r\nTeachers are the multipliers of the SUSEN game development programme with its ambitious objectives as they will be paramount in its success in supporting the core objective. Firstly, the partners develop a \u2018self-starting\u2018 teacher support pack comprising all the required information, materials, and tools teachers need to implement the game in their lessons. Secondly, they develop a one day teacher training course providing future users with a syllabus and training materials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reach these objectives the consortium analyses at the first phase the learner\u2019s needs according to the different topics and main learning goals.  Simultaneously analysing the relevant curricula to ensure the intended programme is embedded more effectively in schools' regular processes. Regional/national differences are considered in game construction by adaption of rules. The partners develop the game rules, define players' roles, and identify relevant stakeholders (experts) who accompany the game development critically. The classroom game and the online companion will be piloted by schools in different programme partner countries. The evaluation of the whole programme leads to a final version of the game and the online companion. At this stage the teacher support pack will be developed as well as a syllabus and material to train teachers. This will be tested and evaluated in several multiplier events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium of six partners from Germany, UK, Poland, Belgium, and Switzerland were selected for its breadth of relevant knowledge and skills and partners' experiences referring to the topics entrepreneurship, sustainability and civic education as well as their experiences in proceeding EU projects. All partners are situated in the educational sector - from higher education to adult education, from vocational to general education.

With the 20-20-20 targets as relevant part of the Europe 2020 Strategy the CO2 emissions shall be reduced until 202 by 20 per cent, the share of renewable energies shall be raised by 20 per cent and the energy efficiency shall be increased by 20 per cent. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from increasing the efficiency in all energy applications and in energy transition as well as the extended replacing of fossil energy sources by Regenerative energy sources - as technological colums of climate protection - the behaviour of households and other user groups must change as well. Particularly households with a low income are not able to compensate the increasing prices for energy through the reduction of their energy consumption. However, they do also not have the financial means to invest in energy and power saving devices. Thus, relevant saving potentials remain unused. This is the starting point of our project that will be implemented by partner organisations from Germany, Spain, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy and Romania. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Power Saving Check that has been offered all over Germany since 2008 consists of the mediation of knowledge for users in households with low income for their conscious dealing with energy in heating, cooking, lighting and the use of electronical devices, media and communication devices and sensitises them for a raised awareness in the purchase of those items in relation to their energy needs. This knowledge and skill mediation is done in form of a free consultation - the Power Saving Check. Through the change in the user behaviour and low investive measures the power, water and heating energy consumption of those households can be relevantly reduced what is proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consultation is assigned to the so-called Power Saving Checkers - unemployed, particularly long-term unemployed and unemployed young people - and requires an according qualification. An adequate further education is not possible in the partner countries at the moment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject results are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The concept \"Power Saving Check\" including the curriculum for the training of Power Saving Checkers was transferred to ES, GB, \r\n\r\n     HU, IT and RO.  \r\n\r\n2. 6 preparing and 12 special training modules generating the curriculum for the training of Power Saving Checkers was adopted in \r\n\r\n     time and contents to the national needs in ES, GB, HU, IT and RO  \r\n\r\n3. The adopted curricula were translated into one blended learning course each. \r\n\r\n4. A Power Saving Calculator (online-tool) for the investigating and visibility of power savings and CO2 reductions due to the work of \r\n\r\n     the Power Saving Checkers was developed and can be used in the frame of the Power Saving Checks in ES, GB, HU, IT and RO \r\n\r\n5. After the Pilot Training 20 experienced adult educators from ES, GB, HU, IT and RO are able to use the gained skills and \r\n\r\n     competences in the education practise of their countries and to multiply them. \r\n\r\n6. The adopted curricula for the training of Power Saving Checkers were tested in practise in ES, GB, HU, IT and RO. The trained Power \r\n\r\n    Saving Checkers have implemented Power Saving Checks in ES, GB, HU, IT and RO. The achieved energy savings and CO2 \r\n\r\n    reductions were examined with the Power Saving Calculator and are visible. \r\n\r\n7. The Curricula have been acknowledged by the according institutions in ES, GB, HU, IT and RO. \r\n\r\n8. Project results and products were disseminated and are available. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the long run POWER SAVING CHECK contributes to enabling relevant stakeholders and decision makers at national level to use the existing potentials and resources in the partner countries better, to extend their systems of general education (ET 2020), to raise the employment rate, to reduce CO2 emissions and to increase energy efficiency (Europe 2020).", "http://www.environmental-academy.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA204-001553_6"]]}}}}
