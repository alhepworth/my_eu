It first disappeared in 1785 but was re-introduced from Sweden in 1837 as a game bird. By the 1970s the populations numbered around 20,000 birds.  Since then, however, its decline has been dramatic with population numbers dropping to around 1,000 birds.  Key threats include mortality through collisions with deer fences, predation of chicks, lack of suitable foraging sites for newly-hatched chicks and, above all, the severe fragmentation and reduced quality of the capercaillie's prime woodland habitats.   A number of emergency conservation efforts have been carried out in recent years but these were neither large scale nor wide spread and remained predominantly localised programmes.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=1975", "http://www.capercaillie-life.info/,", "life_239"], [2013, "LIFE hen harriers - Conserving the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland", "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1842941.0, 921470.0, "The hen harrier (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>) is a species of European conservation concern and is listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive. After several decades of recovery in the UK, the population is currently declining. While the reason for this is not fully understood, it is clear that illegal persecution associated with commercial shooting of red grouse (<i>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</i>) is a significant factor. The decline is particularly serious in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland, where the hen harrier is nearing extinction as a breeding species. Other factors that are likely to be impacting breeding success include inappropriate land management, human disturbance, and predation of eggs and young from nests. Recent analyses published by the UK government indicate that enough suitable habitat exists to support up to 2 650 pairs in the whole of the UK (compared to 630 pairs in 2010), suggesting that, in the long term, the potential for population growth in the absence of persecution is significant.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4935", "http://www.rspb.org.uk/henharrierlife/,", "life_141"]]}}}}
