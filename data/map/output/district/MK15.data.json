The 37 participants of the project belong to different sections: 2-year-course in biotech, 3-year-course in IT and students of commercial education. Before attending Berufskolleg Hilden these students decided to work in very different professional areas and have reached different qualifications and certificates. The above mentioned project includes 3 different activities matching the 3 different sections. At a very early stage all students are informed about the possibility of internships abroad. Their interest is also aroused by separate informative meetings held by former interns reporting about their experiences in foreign countries. They get information about current partners of the Berufskolleg Hilden and about organisational and financial aspects. At the same time the existing contacts are carried on to emerge the current data according to supervisors and contact persons. The individual facts are directly given to the participants in order to start a personal contact and relationship to the tutors at an early stage; i.e. before departure. In the section dealing with commercial education the students start their placement in cooperating companies and contact them through their employers. According to  the section/activity varies the duration of their stay.  In the biotech section the students stay abroad for at least 3 months, in the section of commercial education the stay is only 3 weeks and in the IT section the student stay for 2 months. When beeing abroad a continual contact between the  participants, the            tutors  and coordinators  in Hilden is secured. In addition to that a personal visit of the teachers in charge is effected; respectively in the BTA and IT sections. In the end the Training Agreement and the Europass will be worked out and signed mutually. All students write an internship report which is proof read and evaluated by their teachers. These reports offer an insight into the increase of language, professional skills and experiences, as well as into social and intercultural competences of the students. Furthermore the reports as well as presentations are used for evaluation. Posters and presentations function as a tool for spreading the results. Moreover organisations and other interested parties are informed by these activities in order to establish the Berufskolleg Hilden as School of Europe (Europaschule) focussing on the major target of internationality.", "http://www.industrial.omron.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000172_22"]]}}, "0ZR": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "WORLD VISION UK LBG*WV UK", 741415.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_25566"], [2017, "WORLD VISION UK LBG*WV UK", 392514.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_31740"], [2017, "WORLD VISION UK LBG*WV UK", 261676.0, "Enhancing the respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and supporting democratic reforms (21.04.01)", "fts_2017_36295"], [2016, "WORLD VISION UK LBG*WV UK", 176942.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_39240"], [2016, "WORLD VISION UK LBG*WV UK", 40595.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_58610"]]}}, "8BA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Training goes Global", "Mercedes-Benz UK Limited", 240501.0, 12, 17, "Especially the extension of the European Union requires more mobility and intercultural skills than ever before.

The accommodation will be in a host family, so that in addition to business English, everyday English can also be experienced.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nThe British education system is quite different from the German system . By working in an exemplary educational institution , the teacher gets to know the British system exactly and can also act as ambassador of the dual system.\r\n\r\nCulture\r\nThe professional manners differ basically from the German. Organizational structures and do's and don'ts are extremely important for international relations in the professional field. He will experience this very close. Living with a host family will complement the experience of British culture in the private field.\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\nSince he is also a teacher for automotive technicians, this is a successful addition to the first three parts of the project and creates extra value for one for him as a teacher and therefore also for all his students.\r\n\r\nThe English teacher will participate in the Mercedes Benz Training Academy to the local teaching for two weeks. He will exchange ideas with local teachers intensively on methodological , didactic and technical subject matters and has the opportunity to develop inguistically , professionally and personally.\r\n\r\nThe acquired knowledge will be applied to the lessons after returning  of the teacher .
