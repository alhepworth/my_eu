They will be able to recognize the appropriate options for themselves and understand the relationship between their options and education/ training and business. Thus, they will plan their own future more consciously. On the other hand, they will enjoy coming to school and fell inspired to get involved in project activities. Teachers will recognize  the importance of their role in career planning and will become more willing to be students' advisors.

There is also a lack of staff who are fluent in any foreign language. In order to improve the quality of school, it is needed to train the staff on new methodologies and on the use of new educational tools. According to this need, it is planned to attend a course on ICT tools in Spain, a course on Web 2. 0 tools in Romania and  a course on CLIL methodology in Czech Republic.

Sessions covering mental preparation \r\n4. \"Thinking On Your Feet\" Skills and basic creativity and team work, negotiating and working with others\r\n5. Health and safety\r\n6. A cultural and recreational excursion\r\n\r\nThe relevance of the project is related to the Foundation's policy of continued professional development of coaches at all levels. The participant coaches will benefit from a residential environment and will improve both their pedagogical, theoretical and practical understanding of the requirements needed for professional sport coaching and the benefits of combining different sports.
