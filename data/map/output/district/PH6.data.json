The training has been delivered with support from LLP funding through Leonardo da Vinci, Grundvig, Youth and more recently through ERASMUS+. ARCH coordinates a strong and growing network of the leading heritage and nature organisations in Scotland from the NGO, academic and state sectors as part of the mobility consortium for NET 5. \r\nNET 5 will give 220 Adult Education staff participants the opportunity to learn from targeted study visits of 6 to 7 day duration, hosted by skilled trainers in 12 European countries. ARCH works with a mobility consortium to identify priority areas for skills training in natural and cultural heritage management which informs the basic structure of study visits. The skills priorities for natural heritage management are: species management including reintroduced and invasive species, ecosystem management, climate change adaptation, terrestrial wind farms, economic development in and around protected areas, managing farmland for biodiversity, environmental interpretation, community land ownership and management. The priorities for cultural heritage management include: managing cultural landscapes, cultural heritage interpretation, retaining traditional craft and building skills, developing business skills and models to make cultural organisations more financial independent, facilitating wider engagement in cultural research and practice, increasing social impact of cultural assets, and balancing paid staff and volunteers within a diverse cultural sector. More effective use of digital tools for data, interpretation and engagement is a cross-cutting priority. \r\nThe overall objective of NET 5 is to provide a framework to ensure that cultural and natural heritage professionals are well-informed, well-connected and enthusiastic about valuing and protecting out heritage, and promoting its benefits to all. The detailed objective are: to provide targeted study visits with leading European trainers based on the priorities of the European Development Plan; Identity and support suitable participants before, during and after study visits; provide networking opportunities for individuals and organisations in Scotland and Europe; provide evidence and experience to influence practice, policy and training; review and evaluate our project to improve our impact and provide best practice examples for other trainers. \r\nThe participants are identified through our consortium members, Scottish Natural Heritage, the RSPB Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland, Historic Environment Scotland, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the John Muir Trust, the Woodland Trust Scotland, Trees for Life, the Cairngorms National Park, Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, Caithness Horizons , EBUKI, the Scottish Rural College, the Forestry Commission, the Institute of Chartered Foresters and our latest members the Scottish Countryside Rangers Association and the Scottish Council for Archaeology. \r\nOur European hosting partners and trainers are academic, state and small independent organisations: the Devetaki Plateau Association (BG), Kato Drys Community Council (CY), Viitong Tours (EE), Tampere University (FI),  Bygg\u00f5asafn Skagfir\u00f5inga (IL), State Forest Service (LV), Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences and Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NO), Society for the Coast (PO), Asociatia \u2018Satul Verde\u2019 (RO), Krajina and Lisov Museum (SK), VITRA (SI), Dehesa San Francisco (SP).\r\nARCH has developed a strong dissemination structure and ethic with our partners. Learning outcomes are disseminated through written reports, presentations at conferences, internal and thematic working groups, films and social media. Every participant completes a report of their visit detailing the learning outcomes and impacts. ARCH has built up an online archive of these reports, available on our website In addition through NET 5 we intend to trail thematic webinars as a dissemination tool, and to provide support for participants to film their experiences and upload them to a dedicated Youtube channel. \r\nThe impact will be felt in daily working life, training courses for students and adult learners, and in policy development. \r\nOur consortium members and host partners all share the aim of providing high quality, innovative and inspiring vocational training, committed to learning from and sharing best practice across Europe. Our natural and culture heritage is one of most important pillars of our environmental, social and economic well-being.

The transnational trainings are essential for the beneficiaries of learning because, they will learn something about specific objectives of landcare in partner countries and how to implement them on the ground across Europe.\r\n\r\nDissemination of results:\r\nThrough publications of the participating organisations and seminars.
