The project \u201cAniAge\u201d is designed to answer this very challenge, using Southeast Asian ICH as the main application. Southeast Asian ICHs, e.g. local dances and puppetry, are visually and culturally rich, but are unfortunately disappearing due to the globalized modernization. The overall aim of 'AniAge' is two-fold. The first is to develop novel techniques and tools to reduce the production costs and improve the level of automation without sacrificing the control of the artists, in order to preserve the performing art related ICHs of Southeast Asia. This involves capturing and processing versatile visual performance data, which are heterogeneous in nature and gigantic in quantity. Two areas of technological innovation are aimed to be made, which are novel algorithms for 3D computer animation; and visual asset management with data analytics and machine learning techniques. The second is to promote knowledge exchange and dissemination between EU and Southeast Asian partners, with a view to fostering researchers and spreading knowledge. This will be achieved by having researchers participating in the well-designed research projects, workshops, seminars and open lectures. This consortium consists of six partners, two from the EU and four from Southeast Asia.

Species-specific modifications to separate similar pheromone systems, and prevent a generic response, have not previously been required due to geographical isolation, whereas today these species are increasing living in sympatry in European freshwaters. Correspondingly, a dominant individual of an invasive fish that uses chemical signals to modify behaviours among subordinates could, when introduced, also affect the individual behaviours of native species.

Model regions are Great Britain and France, providing a large latitudinal and climatic gradient suitable. Model species are alien freshwater fishes, as they strongly represent invasive animals in Europe. The experienced researcher (ER) will complete the following research objectives to meet the primary aim: (O1) select the species for modelling and collate the data for modelling; (O2) develop an initial ABM for current climate conditions; (O3) parameterise, for each model species, the initial ABM to predict current invasion probabilities; and (O4) use these final ABMs to predict, via simulations of climate change and management actions, the future invasiveness of the model alien fishes in freshwaters. As the ER has high expertise on invasive species then strong knowledge exchange activities in the Fellowship will: (1) provide the ER with new competencies in predictive ecology and modelling to enable completion of this novel and innovative research, and (2) enable the hosts to develop new research agendas on biological responses to environmental change.", 170111.0, 170111.0, 1, 1, "Primer", null, "http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk", null, "h2020_215365_999862906"], [1488326400000, 1614470400000, "SMart rObOTs for fire-figHting", "Bournemouth University", "Over the years, changes in modern infrastructure have introduced new challenges to firefighting practices.

They must develop sound subject-specialist knowledge, professional skills, and professional values, ethics and attitudes during their studies (IAESB, 2015). Such competence cannot be acquired through a didactic concept which involves only traditional lectures, seminars and modes of assessment. \r\n\r\nThe digital economy is growing much faster than the rest of the economy, but this potential is currently held back by a shortage of skilled graduates. Open vacancies for ICT practitioners cannot be filled, despite the high level of unemployment in Europe. The project will help to close this gap (shortage of up to 900 000 ICT professionals by 2020).\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop a teaching concept that facilitates the development of all competencies to meet the current and future demands in the Profession and significantly enhance the employability of engaged students.  The technological changes in the profession require graduates to be more digitally competent, commercially and internationally aware, analytical and resilient.  The teaching concept will to take the changing environment into account. Working as an accountancy professional requires interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving skills, as well as understanding accountancy in different cultures and legislations.\r\n\r\nThere will be four distinct but integrated sets of case studies with underlying text and on-line learning materials including two data bases.  The topics of cases address areas of global and immediate concern, the titles of which are:\r\n\r\nIO1 - Combating Aggressive Tax Planning Strategies, Post-BEPS\r\nIO2 - From a story teller to a modeling expert: changing requirements for the accounting of financial instruments \r\nIO3 - Digitalization in Auditing \r\nIO4 -  Developing Integrative Learning Resources to examine links in Corporate Governance Mechanisms and tax avoidance practices fostering socially responsible behavior of companies \r\n\r\nPartners\u2019 contacts in accounting firms and finance departments of corporations (groups) will be consulted during the project for subject-specific assistance. The applicant and the other partners have close contacts within the Big Four, MNEs and the Professional and Statutory and  Regulatory Bodies  (e.g. ICAEW, ACCS, CIMA) in the respective countries. This will ensure the professional relevance and practical application of the learning material which will in turn enhance student experience.  \r\n\r\nThe combined subject expertise, and the  dedication and enthusiasm in academia of the partners far exceeds the sum of their individual contributions.

Accountancy includes Financial Reporting, Auditing of Financial Statements, Financial Statement Analysis and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduates of a University or Business School with a specialisation in accountancy do need specific competence (knowledge, skills, values, ethics and attitudes). This competence cannot be acquired effectively through a didactic concept which involves only traditional lectures and seminars. A concept should therefore be developed that addresses all these needs. Graduates will mainly be employed by large institutions (e.g. large audit firms, groups) that work in an international, complex & changing environment. Problem solving skills needed in these institutions have also to be taken into account in higher education. At the moment, no learning concept exists that addresses all these needs in higher education in accountancy (cf. the proposals for improvements in the Report of the Pathways Commission, 2012, AAA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the project is to generate a learning platform in accountancy that supports students in acquiring the specific competences that they will need as accounting professionals. Thereto we plan to:\r\n\r\n(1) Generate integrative cases (including financial accounting, auditing, CSR, evaluating and analysing issues);\r\n\r\n(2) Define a didactical concept of how to use the accountancy cases to create a motivating teaching environment and how to integrate social, ethical and technical aspects;\r\n\r\n(3) Provide theory-based, didactically and practically proofed teaching material relevant throughout Europe so that the content of the platform can be used in the context of different cultures and legislation in Europe;\r\n\r\n(4) Evaluate the learning platform with accounting students on the Master level in ISPs;\r\n\r\n(5) Integrate the outputs of the project in the curricula of the project partners and make the outputs available to HEIs;\r\n\r\n(6) Gather suggestions for improvement of the platform and adapt the content of the platform after the end of the project to keep the platform up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTen higher education institutions (HEIs) will work on this project. All partners do have competence in education in financial accounting, social accounting and/or auditing and carry out research related to accounting, auditing or another accountancy related fields. The partners are part of a network of Universities and Business Schools that has enabled student exchange as well as faculty exchange and has organized an EU Intensive Program for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partners will develop integrative case studies concerning financial reporting, auditing of financial statements, analysing financial statements, and reporting on CSR. These case studies will be embedded in a didactical concept that includes knowledge, ethical and technical aspects. All generated teaching material will be available on an e-learning platform.\r\n\r\nReal life problems will be used as basis for building the case studies. A concept for instructors will be developed to use these case studies effectively. The case studies and the didactic concept will be evaluated in five day ISPs. The results of this evaluation will be used to optimise the concept and the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall result of the project is a comprehensive, unique and innovative learning platform for accountancy that can be integrated into accountancy (Master) programs\u2019 curricula in higher education institutions.\r\n\r\nWe expect that our project will have an impact on a regional, national and European level. The outcomes of the project will enhance the quality of education of the higher education institutions using the platform. The students will raise their employability as the competence that they will acquire through the innovative concept is highly demanded in the accountancy practice. The students will not only be fit for regional or national jobs, they will also be prepared for jobs in internationally acting institutions. In this sense the project could foster international labour market mobility. Overall we expect a significant enhancement in teaching accountancy in higher education institutions in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe competence of accountancy professionals is of existential importance for the economy of the European Union and all Member States. The crisis we are facing in Europe is mainly an economic and financial crisis. Students with a specialisation in accountancy are the emerging professionals who will have major influence and responsibility for the economy in the future.

In 2009 Opera Circus began to develop a long term series of youth and school's exchanges, cultural and arts programmes between Dorset UK and the Srebrenica region. Participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe, Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people by developing their own creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of youth exchanges and youth workers mobility and with non formal learning at its heart. Combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists, will lead to the establishment of an international network of socially engaged young cultural leaders and organisations with last-long impact locally, nationally and internationally.  \r\nAs well as 6 extraordinary European partners, we have also invited 5 UK organisations to take part in TCFT phase 2. The UK has a reputation for being highly advanced in influencing inclusion, social disadvantage and disability through non formal cultural and arts activities and we are keen to share the UK experience with our partners and to learn from them. There are 12 partner organisations in total raging from youth centres, youth theatre groups, a university, leading international cultural organisations, a city and local authorities making TCFT a unique, exciting and robust melting pot of expertise, knowledge and disciplines. TCFT will work directly with 180 young people, 24 group leaders and 48 youth workers over the 24 months period in a combination face-to-face meetings and ongoing online training.  Young people involved in the project are socially disadvantaged and TCFT will work directly with at least 70 disabled young people. The numbers above reflect the individuals engaging directly with the project, many more will be impacted via the work of partners, youth workers and young people locally.

We hope that this pedagogical learning process will have important results in assimilating the messages of safe and creative Internet use.Two are the main type of project\u2019s activities:-Teachers training will take place in two parts: (a)at the first part (theoretical part) the teachers will be trained using a learning platform in topics related to learning basic rules of internet and ways of mobilizing children in educating digitally illiterate adults (b)at the second part (practical part) the teachers will attend experientially workshops regarding safer internet issues in schools and delivery of working sheets with the process and results of the intervention. These workshops will take place in schools with the participation of students.  -In order to promote the actions of the project and trigger the children two categories of competition will be organized in the countries participating in the consortium; (a) school competitions will be organized in order to highlight schools with most digitally illiterate adults who were trained and (b) knowledge competitions for students and trained adults.In order to support the actions of the project a portal regarding adults and old people and Internet Education will be created which will include publicly available educational content in Internet use for beginners and advanced users. Also this portal will provide the e-learning environment, which will be used for the on-line training of teachers. This e-learning environment has as objectives (a) the presentation of training materials and Internet learning courses for trainers and information services, (b) the enhancement of conventional training and introduction of trainees in the new digital culture, (c) the continuous training and access to the contents of the training without time limits that new trainers can educate themselves, (d) the provision of a user-friendly and dynamic learning environment that supports continuous, two-way communication trainers and trainees and individualized learning.Finally, for the needs of teachers\u2019 training, the necessary educational material will be created. This educational material will indicatively include the following axes: (a) browsing the Internet, on-line Services, entertainment, education, communication, (b) secure Internet rules (privacy, secured transactions etc.), (c) dangers from the Internet use (social networks, etc.) and (d) mental health and Internet (excessive use, cyberbullying, grooming, gambling etc.)The EduWeb\u2019s consortium numbers 10 partners and their selection was based mainly on the tasks required to be accomplished. Specifically, four public actors PDEDE, USRV, CPI and MYS, two ICT oriented partners CTI and BU and one school from each participating country.EduWeb is expected  to have a strong impact on its participants. Specifically,  teachers will widen their teaching methodologies on modern ICT based curricula. Students will deepen their knowledge on safe and creative use of internet. Parents will experience the joy of learning on how to use safely the internet with a lot of confidence and a big smile. \u03a4he involved schools will benefit by utilizing the educational tools developed in ICT teaching. Therefore, more and more students will be trained on EduWeb's educational tools and hence more and more digital illiterate parents will be trained by the students, on how to use the internet. Thus, the society will benefit indirectly from the impact of EduWeb in education, since year after year the low scores on DESI will increase significantly.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in foreign countries and gain valuable experience which can\u2019t be acquired by other means. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields is difficult and students have had problems finding apprenticeships in Iceland. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to make sure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to stay abreast of things regarding development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, six students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for four to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nVocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad. TCR emphasizes collaboration with schools in other European countries, making sure that students are informed of the possibilities of studying abroad and encouraging them to make use of the possibilities. \r\nStudents of the School of Web Development have received grants to visit KEA before, this application is for the next years\u2019 class so that they can also get to know studies at the school. The visit to KEA is integrated into a course in the final study year and is an important part of the studies. In Graphic Media Design and other planned group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades. Lately, video presentations have gained popularity among students returning from trips and this has led to increased interest among other students.\r\nIt is important for the students of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in foreign schools. In this application 74 students are applying for 14 day group study trips. It also includes application for six teachers to escort student groups. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers, at least during the first few days while they are getting to know a new environment. In one of the groups applying, one student is in a wheelchair and the application is also for two accompanying persons for 14 days each. \r\n\r\nIt is also important for the teachers and staff of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad. Many of the schools to which visits are planned are by far larger and offer a wider range of study programs than Icelandic schools ever can. TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programmes to meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. Among new study programmes that have been developed at the school to this purpose are a programme in web development and design, a new study programme in technology and science for exceptional students that was set up in cooperation with Reykjavik University, and a completely restructured design programme now named the Design and Innovation programme where design and arts are intertwined with studies in traditional vocational fields. The school also offers a year-long study programme in preparation for university studies in the arts for students who have already completed a matriculation exam. By visiting schools abroad teachers and the staff of TCR acquire invaluable new knowledge and experience that contribute to the development and enhancement of the education TCR provides. \r\nThe grant application includes an application for grants to 19 members of staff for study trips ranging from 5 to 14 days.", "http://www.aub.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA116-026468_2"], [2015, "Euro-anime", "Arts University Bournemouth higher education corporation", 88894.0, 3, 7, "The creative industries are among the fastest growing industries in the world.
