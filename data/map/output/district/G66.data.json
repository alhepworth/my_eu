The school currently provides teaching of French to pupils from Primary 4-7 and all pupils experience Mandarin for 45 minutes every fortnight.  There is currently one member of staff who teaches both languages to pupils; however this member of staff is due to leave the school at the end of the current school year.\r\n\r\nIn support of the school and local cluster group's Modern Languages Improvement Plan (2014-2017), there are two members of staff (one infant teacher and one upper stage teacher) from the school who would like to take part in this project to develop their knowledge, understanding and confidence in teaching French.  These members of staff will then share their learning through a number of planned CPD sessions with the rest of the staff in school and wider cluster group.  Both teachers currently have a very basic knowledge of the French language; however both girls are extremely motivated individuals and eager to build their knowledge and understanding of the language in preparation for the 1+2 Approach.   \r\n\r\nOur future plan is that French will eventually be taught by all teachers at all stages to ensure continuity and progression.  All teachers in the school would like to build their knowledge, understanding and confidence in teaching modern languages and if the two applicants are successful in their application, they will help to train the rest of the team through a number of planned CPD sessions.\r\nThe majority of staff in school require training to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the French language and culture to increase confidence levels to teach French across all stages through a variety of teaching approaches.  This project not only would help to increase knowledge, understanding and confidence; but would also help to promote sharing successful strategies and methods used to support language learning through interaction and partnerships between other European partners met on the course. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide training and invaluable knowledge and resources to our staff which will contribute to our school and cluster improvement plan as well as meeting national policy on modern languages.  \r\nThe two members of staff hoping to participate in this project will be involved in rolling out French CPD training sessions in school to the rest of the teaching team as well as working collaboratively with staff from the other 5 cluster schools to roll out and share good practice amongst all 6 schools.

The first involves them working in the safe supported environment of our  social enterprise garden  project which provides placements to those with a intellectual impairment. This garden center provides opportunities  around horticulture and the environment as well as animal care. For example volunteers will assist with planting and growing flowers and vegetables, designing the flower display beds, daily maintenance of the plants and flowers or feeding and grooming the hens, goats and sheep. In addition the volunteers can have an opportunity to serve customers either in the garden shop or the cafe and can, if appropriate assist in the kitchen preparing food. Volunteers would be assisted in traveling to and from this placement. Within this placement the mentor would provide both individual 1-1 support and small group work support.\r\nThe second  component is working in the Zone Out main office  along side volunteers some of who do not have an intellectual impairment. There are three  options here ; working with groups of Zone out volunteers providing fun based activities to groups of adults experience with a learning disability,  working with groups to provide peer training on issues such as smoking , knife crime etc, and working in our charity shop for several hours a day serving customers and dealing with donations. Ideally we would look to start the individual within the supported volunteering environment and have an individual plan in place for them to move on to the second  more independent placement where they have less support and eventually  have to make their own way to the volunteer placement. Clearly however each volunteer will be different and the 3 months placement will be devised so that they are challenged but not overwhelmed.
