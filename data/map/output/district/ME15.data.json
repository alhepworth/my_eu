Worked out by Hand in Hand Parenting organisation (US), Parenting by Connection is a new approach that offers simple, practical tools to solve everyday parenting challenges gently and to build a more joyful family life. Raising awareness among parents, professionals and teachers and fostering the prestige of parenting is also part of our mission. Instructors of our association regularly hold courses and workshops where they not only offer efficient parenting tools but emotional support as well in Hungary and Europe. In the past 2 years, the number of colleagues taking part in our work and the number of instructors tripled (it is 15 colleagues now and 8 instructors). \r\n\r\nIt is our experience that families are in real need for this kind of positive support, however, the lack of capacity and resources in our organisation in our way for a greater outreach \u2013 in spite of the dynamic growth of the past years. The last year brought several important milestones: we started an organisational development process, more conscious press work, more transparent operation and the concept to be able to offer payment to our devoted members working for the association. Our primary need now is to become more visible and recognised by building an organisation with financial and management stability that helps us set up a grant-fund for disadvantaged families and that backs up educational work with support services such as conscious press work, online communication, strategic planning and management. We would like to reach this goal with 3 tools: firstly through study visits during which we become more experienced in the field of fundraising and communication, secondly, with the help of greater international outreach and thirdly, through the education of our instructors. Our aim is to ensure that our instructors teach outside Hungary and to operate as a Central European teaching centre of Parenting by Connection approach supporting families in the region \u2013 with regard to Hungarians outside our borders. Our process of internationalisation would serve as part of the increase in our prestige and would support our instructors to gain experience in foreign language and foreign environment. Taking part in the courses would broaden our instructors\u2019 skills and would be an important part in keeping their motivation and commitment toward the organisation. \r\n\r\nWe are planning study visits to England and Croatia, teaching in Croatia, Slovakia and Romania, taking part in courses in Slovakia and the Netherlands and in the international Hand in Hand Parenting retreat in England. We put great emphasis on dissemination and implementation throughout which we carry out online campaigns, press work and an innovative event. \r\n\r\nSpreading the Parenting by Connection approach in Hungary and in Central Europe is not only about strengthening as an association and supporting more and more parents \u2013 it is much more than that. This promotes the empowerment of parents throughout Europe and supports our vision to step toward a peaceful world by breaking the cycle of oppression and violence.", "http://www.dandeliontime.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA104-047200_3"]]}}, "0QF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1296518400000, 1391126400000, "Joining innovative Approaches for the integration and Development of transnational knowledge of clusters policies related to independent of Elderly", "South East Health Technologies Alliance Limited", "Citizens are getting older and are increasingly living with chronic diseases, because although their health condition is better than that of earlier generations, they live longer helped by advanced medical care ending up to chronic conditions and minor disabilities well manageable by home care.

With rising energy prices and greater focus on energy efficiency the building sector offers the single largest potential for energy savings.  This is reflected in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, 2002/91/EC. This Directive strongly encourages the use of passive heating and cooling techniques such as thermal mass in building construction and refurbishment. Passive techniques such as thermal mass offer the potential to save up to 50% of energy used in heating and cooling. However, there is a barrier to its effective implementation. In order for thermal mass to work effectively the concrete and brick surfaces must be in contact with ambient air and kept free of insulation, including conventional mineral wool type sound absorbers. The acoustics reverberations (echos) however caused by this can affect the health and work efficiency of inhabitants and in some severe cases rendering the building uninhabitable. Whilst there are some high end solutions to the problem, primarily thick polymer or metal panels, these are too expensive in all but high end applications. There is an urgent and growing need for a low cost, high performance acoustic absorber that allows thermal mass techniques to work effectively yet is at a price comparable to low end mineral wool solutions. The SMEs in this proposal have come together as a supply chain to develop just such a new type of sound absorber, for public and commercial non-residential buildings, Echo2eco. This solution will use an array of laser cut micro slits, of width 100 micron in 200 micron film. There are significant technical challenges in achieving this solution, however with our research partners and innovations in multi-layer polymer material formulation/lamination and novel laser beam/optics configurations we are confident we will be successful.
