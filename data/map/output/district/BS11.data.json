These tools will be based on input-\noutput (IO) modelling for resource (waste and energy) supply-demand matching and process \nefficiency analysis (to understand physical and technological conditions), game theoretical (GT) \napproach for integrating company behaviour in cost-, benefit-, and resource-sharing (to understand \neconomic conditions), and agent-based modelling (ABM) for designing the (economic, \nenvironmental, and social) optimal symbiotic network (to have the holistic optimum). The outputs \nfrom the SHAREBOX controller will provide plant and operations managers with commands for \nactions to be taken and/or recommendations for decision support. It will be ensured that all \ncommands and recommendations a) fulfil plant operations requirements, b) are within the \nconstraints of any contractual obligations, c) are in compliance with all regulatory thresholds, and d) \ndeliver optimal impacts in terms of cost/savings and ecological footprints. The historical data that is \ngenerated by the SHAREBOX platform will be processed by data mining tools that will provide the \nproduction/process BIG DATA for symbiotic shared resources optimisation. The platform will be co-\ncreated, implemented and tested at 4 demo locations in EU, using realistic industrial streams and \nprocess conditions.", null, 4995917.0, 6, 17, "SHAREBOX", null, null, null, "h2020_198388_933035532"]]}}}}
