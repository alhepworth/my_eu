This will in turn motivate and inspire staff to practise their skills and embed the language within their daily routines.  Confidence levels will undoubtedly increase as a result of the project and lead to a positive impact on the teaching and learning within the classroom.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be able to form direct links with partner schools both within the UK and France, enabling children to communicate with other schools. This may be through email, video links and letter-writing.\r\n\r\nWe have 7 participants, profiles are below:\r\n\r\nJulia Connell (BA Spanish/Latin American/Portuguese & 'O' Level French) - Attended Strathclyde University in Summer 2014 \"Train the Trainer\" French and Spanish course.

Kate Smith our Additional Needs Assistant has Higher French and has been a great asset to the staff.  All staff share a common interest and enthusiasm in the learning and teaching of modern foreign languages a primary level.\r\n\r\nMain project activities:\r\n\r\n1. Learning of Languages identified as an area for staff development (February 2014)\r\n2. Staff meeting to introduce the course (June 2014)\r\n3. Julia Connell (Staff Representative) attended 'Train the Trainer' course at Strathclyde University and discussed relevance of course for class teachers with Richard Tallaron. (July 2014).\r\n4.

Weekly Language CPD Sessions (January 2015 ongoing).\r\n7. Regular meetings to share and discuss course information.\r\n8. Meeting  to discuss  travel arrangements and course logistics.\r\n9. Evaluation meeting.\r\n10. CAT Sessions to disseminate information and activities to the rest of staff.\r\n11. Coaching of colleagues when and where necessary.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nTwo teachers within our organisation have already started a programme of CAT sessions to train all staff in both French and Spanish.  This course will provide more staff with the skills and confidence they require to take French and Spanish forward in our school.  This will include taking part in whole school assemblies and team teaching to share many aspects of our language learning. We will plan and carry out open sessions to involve parents and the wider community. Children will lead these sessions with guidance from participants.  Using this immersion course, staff will gain motivation to engage children in their language learning.\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\nThe benefits of this project will help young people understand the importance and relevance of learning modern languages in the primary setting.  Staff will learn skills they can use for the future to embed language in our every day classroom life.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.borderscollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_7"], [2016, "Vocational training abroad \u2013 Learning for the future", "Borders College", 193211.0, 8, 11, "Internationalization is very important for the municipality of Eskilstuna, Sweden, and its schools.   For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

Participating in the project is also a group of students with special needs.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are many objectives of a project like this, and for the students it involves both professonal ones and personal ones.  The 72 students that we'd like to send abroad will get training in their respective field, training that corresponds to the objectives in the our national curriculum.  \r\n\r\nOur goal is also that the students develop on a personal level, as a result of intercultural learning.  Since our students change country for a while, meet and cooperate with people who speak a different language and who have different backgrounds but work in the same field. they get a larger intercultural understanding.   This kind of project gives the students an increased knowledge of foreign languages, and it promotes the study of languages. \r\n\r\nWe want the students to spread information about their experiences doing vocational training abroad, to inspire other students to do the same.  All kinds of international cooperation is beneficial on different levels.

The more positive contact we have with people from other cultures and countries and the more international projects we run the better.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen earlier that the students get increased selfconfidence when they do vocational training abroad, which is very important for their future,  It helps them to complete their studies and possibly start new ones.  Drop-outs is an increasing problem both in Sweden and the rest of Europe and this kind of project can increase the students' motivation to get an education.  The project can also have a positive impact on their belief in themselves to apply for jobs and possibly make them more inclined to look for work somewhere else.  They see that they can handle working far away from home, or they get curious about doing something like this from listening to their friends sharing their experiences.  This is important since unemployment is an increasing problem and it would be positive if young people would be willing to move to other cities or sometimes other countries to find work.

The project SEM 2016-2019 is part of the policy of Scalda and is aimed at the goals of the policy. In 2015 a plan for excellence is written which included the target to increase international mobilities with 50% by 2018.\r\n\r\nAt the moment 5 clusters of Education are involved: Catering, Tourism & Food (HTV),  Health, Technology & Design (T&D) and CIOS (Sports).  For each educational part of Scalda it is very important the student will experience an European labour market. Scalda wants students to become competent on the international labour market and to gain international (technical) knowledge.  Also the student will experience differences in European cultures, not only in work experience, but by living for a longer time in another European country. Foreign language learning is therefore essential to the project; both professionally as well as communicating in general.\r\n\r\nIn this project professionals of Scalda will expand their professional competences through international mobility, which will benefit the educational courses of Scalda.\r\nThe project will be carried out decentralised at the level of education when it concerns educational support and administration. \r\n At a central level the project coordination and financial administration will be organised.\r\nThe project will receive publicity on the Scalda website, web portals and in newsletters.
