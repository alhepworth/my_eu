From a European perspective, the traditional signalling is one of the most conservative parts of the railway system strongly bound to the national traditions by all involved parties.Since 1990 the EU is promoting the reformation of parts of the signalling subsystem under the ERTMS programme.However this covers not the whole signalling system.The implementation of ETCS could be hampered, in areas of the conventional European rail network, where interlocking will need to be replaced, if this cannot be carried out in an economically and technically efficient manner. Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles.

Their low weight, along with their inherent resistance to corrosion and fatigue, enables more fuel efficient and sustainable transport structures. However, for many applications, the biggest factor currently preventing the more widespread use of light high-performance polymer matrix composites is their poor fire performance. This is due to the organic matrices, which first soften on heating, causing a loss of mechanical properties and then, at higher temperatures, decompose. Decomposition results in the production of smoke and toxic or flammable decomposition products. These products are not only hazardous in terms of lack of visibility and toxicity; they can also burn, releasing heat, which can lead to flame spread and exacerbate the fire. Furthermore, loaded composite structures often collapse in a fire within a period of minutes, depending on the magnitude of the load and heat flux. The overall aim of the project is to develop novel, cost-effective, high-performance, lightweight polymer matrix composites with a step-change improvement in fire behaviour. FIRE-RESIST will achieve this by carefully targeted research in five key areas: 1. Micro-layered structural materials that are designed to delaminate extensively when exposed to heat, thereby generating a multiplicity of internal interfaces that provide a fire barrier of exceptionally low thermal conductivity. 2. Hybrid thermoset composites that are polymeric at normal temperature, but which decompose under fire to provide highly protective ceramic char phases. 3.

Based on their experiences, they have an understanding on the difficulties of providing protection for the rights of each individual, or even communities. Therefore, the members of the UNA came to the realization that yielding protection and equal rights for every human being is crucially difficult on a solely institutional level.

To provide youth leaders with tools to promote active citizenship, participation and human rights among young people. 2. To provide youth leaders with a comprehensive reflection on human rights and tolerance.3. To provide youth leaders with an understanding of the institutions fighting for human rights.4. To create action plan(s) for communities in order to encourage their members to stand up for human rights.5. To exchange best practices on involving members of the society in the fight for human rights.A1 - SeminarFor the seminar in Denmark, the participants selected will be expected to have an extensive experience in the field of human rights. As the aim of the seminar will be to create an action plan for human rights education, the participants should be in a leading role within their organizations, and have the mandate to make decisions. Each partner will be expected to select and nominate two members of their organization to the UNA for final selection.A2 \u2013 Training courseFor the training course in Moldova, the participants will be youth leaders, preferably with experience within the field of human rights and human rights education. The youth leaders will have an interest in further extending their knowledge regarding the topic and gain new tools and best practices in promoting human rights and active participation among young people.The partners will select and nominate their participants from their organizations and networks.

Building on our previous Leonado da Vinci Lifelong Learning mobility projects and Erasmus programmes, this project aims to develop participants as international professionals through specialised placement programmes in Denmark Estonia, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. This project will incorporate a range of vocational areas from Derby College's vast array of subject areas and acts as a positive promotion of the opportunities of vocational learning by encouraging participants to develop and acquire new skills and explore international work, training and enterprise opportunities. 120 learners and staff from Derby College will visit Denmark Estonia, Finland, Germany and Sweden, countries which they may not have had the opportunity to visit if not for this project.Typically, level 2 & 3 learners do not consider the opportunities to work or train abroad, especially Eastern and Northern Europe, or opportunities for self employment. This project will encourage participants to consider different progression opportunities by offering challenging and exciting, but safe work and training placement opportunities to a learner cohort which is normally reticent. Further barriers to workforce mobility will be removed by linguistic and cultural preparation and the acquisition of specific industry terminology during the placement period abroad.The project will provide enrichment for the employability unit of the participants' core learning aim and is a pedagogically sound vehicle for learning.  This is supported by specialist work placement opportunities that will provide a rich source of information, skills development and real work experiences. These experiences will enable learners to explore the different approaches to employment commerce and entrepreneurship in each country.

The overarching unit fits well with the intention to promote enterprise and skilled employment through development of vocational skills and work and training placements.  This adds value to the participants vocational subject expertise and links this skill development to further opportunities for them by developing their enterprise skills. The opportunities to work aboard will further broaden learners horizons and instill new attitudes based on real work experiences. The project seeks to develop expertise in the specialist area and complement the particpants' knowledge with more technical and practical training.

Teachers and guidance personnel also get to know and use the ECVET-documents provided by European Comission and are able to make personal plans for contents of each student\u2019s mobility period. The use of new social media enables more people to get to know about the results of the project.   \r\n\r\nParticipants represent different vocational fields. In this project there are 234 mobilities for students and freshly graduates and 42 for Omnia\u2019s staff from different vocational units. The age of the learners varies very much, but mostly all the students are in the final year of their studies. The aims and contents of all mobilities are planned individually. The duration of the mobility period can be from 14 days (group mobility) up to 100 days (individual work based learning). For the staff there are one and two weeks staff training and teaching assignment periods. \r\n\r\nAll participants prepare themselves before the mobility period. Omnia has developed a versatile preparation program including language and cultural preparation, guidance for practical matters and preparation of the documents, personal meetings with international coordinator and vocational guidance. Host partners help with the practical issues like accommodation and finding a work placement, give guidance in the work placement and evaluate the skills and competences. After the work based learning period the skills and competences will be recognized and validated as part of student\u2019s studies. \r\n\r\nIn the staff mobilities international coordinators and assistant help participants with the practical matters.

As most of the mobility partnerships are relatively known institutions, except the French partner organisation, the number of staff member mobilities could be reduced a bit in favour of VET-learners mobilities. They are nevertheless still necessary to maintain and strengthen contacts, introduce new staff members or new courses of study into the cooperation. Additionally, BSZW wants to be able to send the development staff to its partner organisations repeatedly, for several days each time, to smoothly and effectively plan and coordinate the main activities of the exchange as well as for job-shadowing purposes.\r\nThe initial goal, according to the school's and this program's mission, is to be able to globalize all course offerings at the BSZW. It is of the utmost importance to expand foreign language education in a unified Europe where workers have the freedom to live and work where they choose. The creation of a shared European learning space will be defined by the partnership with the help of reference work processes called  \u201eWork Units\"/\"Mobility Units\"/\u201cActivity Units\". In the end these will serve as measurable and examinable evidences of learning of our mobility abroad and are a portion of an externally-obtained (degree) qualifcation. \r\nIn order to suitably represent Germany in Europe interested participants, at least aged 18, will be chosen based on their independence, flexibility, adaptability, and willingness to learn. \r\nThe experience of the participants, in conjunction with the local training and work, is the main focus of this program. As evidence of learning the participants will reflect on and document this process. The plan is for the trainees to be certified through the partner organizations, which will be recognized as part of their actual qualification.\r\nIn the \u201eLetter of Intent\u201c the cooperating partners agree that the hosting organizations will see to the logistical operations and aspects of the trainees' stay.  Questions as to the lodgings, communication with the internship businesses, transfer of tutoring services, and emergency procedures fall under the agreed-upon duties.  \r\nBSZW wants zu sign \"learning agreements\" with his partnerinstitutions to determine the role of each organisation to rule the planned mobilities. Learning agreements as an element of the ECVET-instruments serve to determine the attained learning outcomes achieved by the students during their mobilities. Stuff members of the BSZW contribute with their partnerinstitutions to the documentation, validation and acknowledement of achieved and proved competences of the students at the end of their mobilities and deliver the europass mobility.\r\nThe specific reconfiguration of the workprogram will be decided upon during the initial contact visits with the individual partnering institutions.
