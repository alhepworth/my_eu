Rice is a major staple crop for nearly half of the world\u2019s population and is grown on approximately 160.6 million hectares, with almost a billion households depending on its cultivation for their primary source of income and employment. However current milling and separation processes in small-scale mills are too aggressive and energy intensive. In smaller, traditional mills, a farmer can lose between 50-70% yield in broken rice as a result of poor drying, high pressure milling, excessive handling and destructive high energy processes designed to separate the rice grain from the bran and husk. \n\nKoolmill Systems will address this need by increasing the quantity, quality and value of the rice yield and by-products; supporting small farming communities and socio-economic growth. The patented technology will be a two-stage process that will eliminate waste with minimal brokens, and produce high quality bran and husk by-products. The aim being to achieve reduction in brokens and optimise the production of high nutrition bran, which then can be reprocessed and sold into the food manufacturing supply chain for high carbohydrate and protein rich diets. \n\nIn Phase 1 we intend to confirm the feasibility of developing the grain separation technology that can achieve significant processing and cost benefits in the rice processing supply chain; prepare a product development plan that will lead to the manufacture of a full milling system; complete a business plan covering all aspects of the commercial opportunity, pricing, market size, competition and route to market; and submit an application for Phase 2 funding.", 42955.0, 61365.0, 1, 1, "GREATMILLING", null, null, null, "h2020_205118_918700775"]]}}, "2AF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "P\u00e4dagogische Vielfalt in Europa - Interkulturelle Professionalisierung in der Erzieher-, Sozialassistenz- und Heilerziehungspflegeausbildung", "St Thomas Centre Nursery School", 101336.0, 6, 9, "The vocational training project \u201ePedagogical diversity in Europe\u201d is specifically concerned with social care and education, therapeutic education, social care, and teacher training in all these respective areas.

Road traffic remains one of the major sources of particulate matter, and diesel emissions are by far the largest source of atmospheric nanoparticles in urban areas.  Semi-volatile organic compounds emitted largely in the condensed matter phase are a major component of diesel emissions, and as primary particles are advected from their road traffic source, the semi-volatile compounds vaporise and are oxidised, forming a greater mass of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  However, the semi-volatile compounds are extremely poorly characterised as they are not resolved by traditional gas chromatographic methods, presenting an unresolved complex mixture (UCM).  For this reason, despite being a major precursor of SOA, such compounds are often poorly represented or completely omitted from atmospheric chemistry-transport models.  This proposal is concerned with applying new two dimensional gas chromatographic methods to characterisation of the UCM at a molecular level which will be followed by studies of the physico-chemical properties of representative components of the semi-volatile emissions.

But how are these memories coded in human brains? Any mechanism accounting for episodic memory must accomplish at least two functions: to build novel associations, and to represent the information constituting the memory. Neural oscillations, regulating the synchrony of neural assemblies, are ideally suited to accomplish these two functions, but in opposing ways. On the one hand, neurophysiological work suggests that increased synchrony strengthens synaptic connections and thus forms the basis for associative memory. Neurocomputational work, on the other hand, suggests that decreased synchrony is necessary to flexibly express information rich patterns in a neural assembly. Therefore, a conundrum exists as to how oscillations code episodic memory. The aim of this project is to propose and test a new framework that has the potential to reconcile this conflict. The central idea is that synchronization and desynchronization cooperatively code episodic memories, with synchronized activity in the hippocampus in the theta (~4 Hz) and gamma (~ 40-60 Hz) frequency range mediating the building of associations, and neocortical desynchronization in the alpha (~10 Hz) and beta (~15 Hz) frequency range mediating the representation of mnemonic information.

Reflecting this view, current neurocognitive studies focus on isolating static snapshots of past events in an individual's pattern of brain activity.

The vision behind STREAM is to advance the field beyond its current state of the art by mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of mnemonic reconstruction in the human brain. The research programme contains three work packages that support this vision at multiple levels of investigation, from combined electrophysiological and hemodynamic activity down to neuronal assembly firing patterns in the human hippocampus. These techniques are used in combination with paradigms that decompose memories into their constituent elements, and track the neural representations of these elements as they unfold in time and space when an event is reconstructed from memory. So far, it has been difficult to integrate information obtained by these various recording techniques. STREAM will use an innovative representational mapping approach that combines spatiotemporal information at the level of an individual's neural representational architecture. This approach enables us to directly map memory patterns emerging at a given time point onto a given brain region.

By autonomously modelling spatio-temporal dynamics, our robots will be able run for significantly longer than current systems (at least 120 days by the end of the project). Long runtimes provide previously unattainable opportunities for a robot to learn about its world. Our systems will take these opportunities, advancing long-term mapping, life-long learning about objects, person tracking, human activity recognition and self-motivated behaviour generation.

This facility would be the first of its kind in the world and would represent a significant advance for metallurgy. The novel technology that enables this HTT facility is based on automated, direct laser deposition (DLD). The key feature of this technology is the way in which a mixture of elemental powders is accurately and directly fed into the laser's focal point, heated by the laser beam, and deposited on a substrate in the form of a melt pool, which finally solidifies to create a unique fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. This robotic alloy synthesis is 1000 times faster than conventional manual methods. Once produced, these discrete mm-sized samples are submitted to a range of automated, standardised tests that will measure chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The vast amount of information will be recorded in a 'Virtual Alloy Library' and coupled with computer codes such as neural network models, in order to extract and map out the key trends linking process, composition, structure and properties. The most promising alloy formulations will be further tested, patented and exploited by the 20 end-users.

The epidemiology and clinical features of co-infected subjects are well documented, however, there is a paucity of basic scientific studies addressing the interactions between these pathogens. There is undoubtedly a complex interplay between pathogens and the host immune response. This was highlighted when the Merck HIV-1 vaccine trial was halted due to increased HIV-1 transmission amongst vaccine recipients with previous adenovirus infection, suggesting that immune responses specific for adenovirus vector antigens were detrimental. We propose that pathogen evasion and dysregulation of host immune responses plays a key role in co-infection associated morbidity.

The three key partners have prior experience in STEM education research and will therefore organize and structure the required research activities.  The supporting partners will provide additional relevant data and organize case studies at their universities.  Our network partner will help to disseminate the results of the project.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above objectives are reflected in seven work packages, focusing on (1) survey of existing practice for identification and intervention, (2) qualitative research, (3) quantitative research (questionnaire), (4) quantitative research (case studies at the partner institutions), (5) dissemination and sustainability, (6) transnational meetings, and (7) project management and quality checks.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual output of this project consists of several elements. The most important are (1) a final report on the project website in which the essential key STEM skills,  the associated diagnostic test with predictive power and the effective intervention tools are included (as well as a critical analysis and a conclusion) and (2) a set of guidelines specifically dedicated to our stakeholders (secondary schools, staff of student advisory centers, instructors, and the management).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important impact of this project is expected on the first-year students of the participating institutions since this project will offer them a test and clear view on the key skills required for STEM-studies, giving them the opportunity to anticipate and to select the right subject during secondary education and to participate in intervention programs that help them to develop these skills before or at the beginning of the academic year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis results in several longer term benefits such as an  improved chance to succeed at the end of the first-year higher STEM education (especially for first generation students), a reduced dropout in STEM programs and an improved student orientation.", "http://www.bham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BE02-KA200-000462_3"], [2016, "\u201cIdentifying and Motivating youth who mostly need Physical ACTivity", "THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM", 318634.0, 8, 12, "School Physical Education (PE) is the only setting allowing the diagnosis of physical inactivity and the implementation of inclusive strategies for youth who mostly need Physical Activity (PA) and sport involvement.

Creating a Digital Learning Environment on Cultural Heritage", "THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM", 318294.0, 7, 7, "In the Humanities, there is an urgent need for innovative digital learning material that internationalises the curricula of HEI. Material that introduces students to the latest research in their fields, to new methods and to didactic concepts without the need of physical international mobility. In Classics/Classical Archaeology there are only isolated applications of e-learning elements so far. Their use is restricted to students of the respective universities. The existing e-learning material is mono-lingual. For the topic of ancient cities as an important part of the shared European cultural heritage there is no learning material at all.\r\n\r\nThe strategic partnership (SP) \u201cAncient Cities. Creating a Digital Learning Environment on Cultural Heritage\u201c brings together six European Universities to create an innovative pan-European digital learning module for higher education institutions (HEI) as well as MOOC for a broader audience on an important part of the shared European heritage: Cities of the Greeks and Romans. On the one hand, the network brings together young leading experts in the field of ancient urbanism, enabling them to produce both a digital learning module and a MOOC, based on latest research and state-of-the-art information on the topic far beyond handbook knowledge. On the other hand, the SP brings together local centres of e-learning at different partner universities for testing and producing digital learning material for different audiences on a sound didactic and technical basis.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the SP are twofold:\r\n1.) To produce a pan-European learning module on ancient cities and to implement it into the curricula of the partner universities. This learning module will enhance the students\u2019 knowledge on the subject and methodology of ancient cities on a pan-European level, also their language skills, media literacy and critical thinking. As the students are participating in the development of the digital module and the MOOC the project fosters their didactic skills, their knowledge in project management and in the production of multimedia content, improving their employability.\r\n2.) The objectives of the MOOC are to enhance the knowledge of and the awareness for ancient cities as shared European heritage in the broader public. On the one hand, it strengthens the European idea and on the other hand it promotes acquiring and developing key competences such as foreign languages and digital skills.\r\n\r\nThe digital learning module will use the teaching method of inverted classroom with phases of self-learning and virtual attendance. In a self-learning phase the students acquire knowledge on the methodology, content and important research questions on ancient cities through video lectures. For their motivation, they will attend automatically evaluable tests that use elements of gamification (high-score systems). The phase of attendance will take place as an online seminar led by a tutor. During the seminar, the students work on specific projects (researched based learning) in small internationally mixed groups. Their results will be documented in e-portfolios/group-portfolios. The tutor will guide and advise the students through tele-tutoring (e-mails, skype, video conferences). The students will present and discuss their results online with the audience of the seminar and the tutor (online seminar).\r\nThe MOOC is addressing a broad audience with a general interest and basic knowledge about Ancient Cities and Classical Archaeology. The participants should learn the research history and methodology, the layout and history of the most important ancient cities and about the impact of ancient architecture and urbanism on modern city design. The course is intended to be an eight weeks\u2019 course (each week approx. 1 h of video lectures) with automatically evaluable tests to support the process of self-learning.\r\n\r\nAs results of the project, the partner institution\u2019s curricula in Humanities in general and in Classics/Classical Archaeology in particular will be internationalised and digitalised. Without the need of physical international mobility, the students of all participating organisations benefit from the digital learning module. The students participating in the activities of the SP will improve their employability. The SP develops the quality of e-learning and implements a best practice example of how to use digital technics and didactic methods to improve teaching at HEI. It illustrates how smaller academic fields in the Humanities can design and enhance their respective teaching environments in the digital age in a pan-European collaboration.

People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and early death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, there are benefits at any age. Primary care staff at the frontline: nurses, pharmacists, doctors, dentists and many other healthcare professionals, often encounter on a daily basis, many patients who are regular smokers. A recent systematic review enhanced the importance of providing smoking cession advice by dental healthcare professionals in primary care to their patients (Ramsier and Suvan 2015). By conducting a survey of the educational curriculum among 21 European Dental Schools we have identified many gaps in training during undergraduate education (Davies, Ramsier, Warnakulasuriya et al, 2013).    Currently, there is a lack of accessible training modules for healthcare professionals who have the potential to deliver smoking cession advice. Though, multiple forms of information are available; however, these are mostly in a written form (in English language only) or following old guidance. By carrying out an e-learning project transnationally, we will embrace the different realities in terms of how smoking cessation advice is provided by health professionals to European citizens in different countries. E-learning allows the use of new educational media, providing healthcare professionals with the ability to search and select information, organising their time efficiently (Bogacki et al 2004).Consequently, we aim: \u2022 To provide an e-learning tool, promoting smoking cession advice. This will be accessible to European Union healthcare professionals and translated into several languages \u2022 To strengthen the ties among European Union Educational and Professional Health Institutions for promoting smoking cession advice. \u2022 Increase professionals\u2019 skills and improve personal portfolio, while taking into account the language /content differences between the countries\u2019 education systems. Overall, the e-learning smoking cessation advice project will be organized into several modules, designed to be used by healthcare professionals such as nurses, pharmacists, dentists and doctors. It will be freely available online and translated in several languages. By promoting the content of the e-learning program we believe a high number of healthcare professionals will complete it. Promotion will be in the forms of posters, Facebook, Twitter, articles and communication meetings.In conclusion, by providing this pioneering EU smoking cessation programme, it will increase the possibility of a gradual reduction in EU population smoking rates.

Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work.    The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.

BACKGROUND. 17-18/19 year-old students, attending the IV class of technical and vocational secondary schools in Arezzo, Verbania, and Reggio Emilia.\r\n30 NEWLY GRADUATED/QUALIFIED. They  have received, since no more than 12 months, a vocational qualification or a degree consistent with topics related  to the internationalization of SMEs.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY. The activities of the project are the following:\r\n- Project management (structured in 4 main documents, containing the 4 fundamental aspects for the correct management of the  project: Coordination and Control Plan, Learning and Evaluation Plan,  Management of the Communication Plan,  Dissemination and Exploitation Plan)\r\n- Preparation of the participants (linguistic, technical, pedagogic and cultural training)\r\n- Individualization and activation of work placements (as a result of the selection of the participants, the MATCHING phase candidate-company will be realized through the cooperation of  EU partners that will assess the profiles of candidates paying attention to the effective availability of hosting companies\r\n- Monitoring during and after the mobility experience\r\n- Final  evaluation (results, project, good practices)\r\n- Diffusion and exploitation\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY. The activated methodologies are, essentially practical and are finalized to achieve effective, efficient and repeatable activities.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT. At general level, the project will mainly have impact in the world of VET thanks to: training results of the participants to the mobility; acquired competences (soft-skills, professional, personal, cultural and ethics competences); credit recognition. The dissemination strategy will support the global objectives and the specific activities of project, mainly with reference to the publication of the Outputs of the project ( papers, etc), but also to the OUTCOMES (results) and to the OUTREACH (impact).\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS. In the long term, the expected benefits are: a great involvement of Italian (institutional and not) partners, the improvement and the widening of the foreign partnership, in terms of territories and competencies; the opportunity to finalize exchange and cooperation projects within different other European Programmes (e.g. Progress, EaSI, others); the opportunity to become (as a Consortium) an important partner in the management of mobility and in the adoption of EQAVET and ECVET systems.", "http://www.birmingham-chamber.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004457_20"], [2017, "EU steps up to scale up management", "BIRMINGHAM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY", 203174.0, 5, 6, "The Commission's Start-up and Scale-up Initiative aims to give Europe's many innovative entrepreneurs every opportunity to become world leading companies. There are many start-up initiatives, but very few make it beyond the critical first few years. The European Commission is determined to change that and help start-ups deliver their full innovation and job creation potential. There\u2019s not much of a support system for more mature, small companies with proven business models. With this project we will try to create support system in the field of adult education and training. The Steps2Scale project will create a harmonized qualification framework for the profession Scaling up adviser which doesn\u2019t \u2018exist in any EU country. With the creation of a harmonized occupation we will also create the first network and community of scaling up mentors and envoys. In order to prepare the first scaling up advisers, the project will also develop harmonized training and learning methodology which will be field tested during the life time of the project. The Steps2Scale will use and implement the best existing practices throughout EU. In addition the quality of the products will be guaranteed by the logical three phase approach applied to them:  development, testing and finalizing. \r\nThe project will reach to at least 1000 representatives of the target group and stakeholders through various communication channels. It is targeted to start-ups and spin-offs with at least 5 years of experience, balanced business plan and defined local market niche; SMEs with innovative product which is already well placed on the local market and has export potential; SMEs with export strategy and potential, but still local players. Around 50 entrepreneurs from the target group will be trained while testing the training and learning methodology. The project partners will use every opportunity to promote the Steps2Scale aims in order to raise awareness among the business environment and the respective decision making public bodies. All developed materials will be published and available on the dedicated website, which will serve as an open platform, where members of the scaling-up community will exchange ideas and knowledge and interested entrepreneurs and educators will have direct access to the Scaling-up Envoys network. This way more people can benefit from the project even after its end. The Steps2Scale will create an environment that fosters competitiveness, business thinking, innovation and creativity. The scaling-up adviser is the profession of one more competitive and fast growing future of the EU.

Placements take place between October 2015 and February 2016 with a similar timescale in 2016/2017. All EUGANGS participants are working in gang related environments in Birmingham and across the West Midlands. Between April 2011 and March 2012, the overall crime rate in the Titan area (100.4 crimes committed per each 1,000 of the population) in this area was higher than the city average of 79.8 crimes.

Most left compulsory education without or too few qualifications.\r\n\r\nThis mobility project meets policy priorities for the recognition and transparency of qualifications. The promotion of mutual recognition of qualifications between EU Member States and the implementation of the ECVET framework is high on the list of priorities in Europe laid down in the Bologna Process, Copenhagen Process and Lisbon Treaty also reflected in this consortium's commitment of inserting the two new EUGANGS VET programmes within ECVET mechanisms. Using mobility enables EUGANGS expert trainers to help validate the new learning outcomes agreed by the EUGANGS partnership through: \r\n- 19 EUGANGS accredited trainers co-teaching on the Italian national EUGANGS VET programme, work shadowing their trainers and participating in their related training programmes (5 days).   \r\n- 3 EUGANGS accredited VET trainers exploring new methodologies to apply in their own training practice by adopting drama in education techniques as offered by InSite (Hungary) to create safe places to discuss difficult issues (5days). \r\n- 2 week work placements in CEIS in Italy for level 3 EUGANGS VET recent graduates, to evidence and validate their new skills and competencies in the Italian work place.\r\n\r\nEuropass Mobility will also be used to validate these experiences.\r\n\r\nThe EUGANGS transnational partnership collectively will be empowered to use ECVET tools and instruments following review and evaluation of this first mobility project in the field of EUGANGS. This will enable definitive ECVET documentation to be produced and shared across the EUGANGS partnership including the additional partners in Cyprus, Greece and Romania all signing a joint Memorandum of Agreement. This will enable the EUGANGS transnational partners to submit mobility applications in the future, which might also include VET trainees while on their EUGANGS VET programme in their own country.
