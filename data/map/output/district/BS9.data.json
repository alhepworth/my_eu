Our pupils come from the local area but are very mixed in background and the experiences they have.  Some are well travelled and exposed to a wide range of enhancing opportunities and activities and their parents have high aspirations for them. Others stay very much within the local area and have few experiences outside school.  We want to provide all our pupils with learning opportunities that will enrich their life chances to give them the skills to participate actively in difference experiences so they are able to make good choices and contribute positively to the society in which they live. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, an audit of secondary provision, and with two fluent Spanish PPA teachers, we decided to focus on Spanish to provide a smooth transition for pupils to Year 7, enabling them to build on a single language learned for 4 years in Key Stage 2. Following staff changes, and as highlighted in the MFL Governor\u2019s report, our language provision by class teachers is enthusiastic but undermined by lack of confidence in Spanish language competency. Our last language INSET was in 2012, and as revealed in a staff audit, our teaching methodologies urgently need refreshing and reinvigorating. \r\n\r\nThis project falls into three mutually supporting strands with the aim of raising the profile of language at our school: 1) Equipping staff with the confidence and knowledge to delivering Outstanding Spanish lessons throughout the entire school. 2) Establishing a sustainable relationship with a Spanish partner school for sharing pupil learning and exchanging teaching ideas and to encourage cross-curricular learning. 3) Setting our language teaching in the wider context of the Globalisation Agenda to enhance intercultural understanding of the European Dimension. \r\n\r\nTo achieve these aims, the MFL co-ordinators, with the support of SMT and the MFL Governor, will implement a structured and timetabled two year project within our school with the ultimate aim of an impact extending beyond the lifetime of Erasmus+ project.  \r\n\r\nStrand 1 seeks to send an initial 15 members of staff (including Head Teacher, Key Stage 1, 2 and Early Years Leaders, a range of class teachers from Reception to Year 6, TAs and MFL coordinators) to Spain for a one-week immersive course encompassing Spanish Language, teaching methodologies, cultural awareness and observation in a Spanish School. Learning will be disseminated through the mobility participants\u2019 creation of resources, including a realia box, and a simple training package in teaching methodologies to deliver to non-participants, extending the benefit of the mobilities our whole staff team. Spanish teaching will be extended through to Reception and Key Stage 1 and will be supported for lower abilities by TAs with increased language competency. \r\n\r\nThrough a timetabled programme of working parties and INSET day meetings, staff will collaborate in their planning to incorporate the project into cross-curricular learning, improving outcomes for pupils by raising attainment. We will send a further 5 staff members in the second year, for further training, or because they are new members of staff, or unable to attend in the first round. \r\n\r\nStrand 2 seeks to build a relationship with a Spanish partner school. After agreeing the objectives and scope of our interactions, and evaluating the result of a term of pilot interactions, the MFL coordinators will set class targets in the second year of the project for pupil exchange of interactions with their Spanish peers through the use of ICT, such as Skype, video and photographs etc. MFL coordinators will lead the aspect in a structured programme of collaboration, evaluation and learning from best practice.\r\n\r\nStrand 3 seeks to develop the intercultural understanding and the European Dimension of our school. We will inform and inspire our pupils through a series of high profile whole school Intercultural Event Days, celebrating the cultures of the children represented in the school\u2019s demographic and addressing European issues. We will invite guest speakers to school assembly to galvanise debate and follow up with a day of classroom activities and special events. We will maintain a Current Affairs display board in collaboration with the Literacy team to keep the European Dimension current. \r\n\r\nThis project will benefit our staff through professional development, our pupils through raising attainment, our school community through increase intercultural understanding and real lasting relationships with a partner school.

Bringing Film, Video and Music into the MFL Classroom\r\n\r\nBackground:  At our school we identified a strong need to foster more inter-cultural understanding amongst our students and to integrate this into our teaching practice.  Far too often a modern foreign language is treated as 'another subject' by our students.  We want to jolt them out of this restrictive and subject-based approach to language learning and re-invent language as communication for them. \r\n\r\nObjectives:  The best way to bring a subject 'alive' is to show how it works in the real world; how it can be relevant for students; how it matters, in their lives.  Our conclusion was to recognise that our practice required more use of contemporary, authentic source material that our students would be familiar with in their daily lives.  Hence our focus here on music, bloggers, video and film.  Our  objective is therefore to bring more relevance to all modern languages for our students and to use new source materials to enthuse and engage them in their learning.  \r\n\r\nParticipants:  The key person involved would a modern languages teacher (French, German and Spanish) of ten years standing.  He teaches across a very wide age range (9-18) and is always keen to introduce original source material in the target language into his classroom.  He holds a degree from Oxford University (Modern Languages and Modern History) and a PGCE from Bristol University.\r\n\r\nActivities and methodology:  the main participant will attend two weeks of courses and cultural immersion in France.  The learning will cover the core areas of using cinema, short films, video and popular music in the MFL classroom.  Additional workshops will be attended addressing the motivation of adolescents, correcting pronunciation and re-enforcing and revising key grammar.  The participant will then have te  responsibility to disseminate the learning from the courses attended initially to the French Department of the school and subsequently to all language departments (we currently offer French, Spanish, German, Russian and Italian).   We therefore intend to hold a series of best practice workshops on INSET days to disseminate the new use of authentic material across all MFL teaching within the five language departments.\r\n\r\nImpact and results:  For learners, we would expect to see very positive developments in the following areas:\r\n- engagement, as the teaching resources include more exciting, modern and relevant material\r\n- inter-cultural understanding as we expose our pupils to many more cultural source materials (film; music; video)\r\n- an increased appreciation of language as communication rather than a dry academic and theoretical subject\r\n- creativity, as we encourage pupils to create their own video clips and songs in the target language\r\n\r\nFor staff we want to disseminate the learning from the courses and ensure the participant undertakes an enabling role within the school to ensure that the resources and skills exist to introduce authentic cultural material into the MFL classroom and integrate this into the MFL curriculum as a whole. \r\n\r\nLonger term benefits: the GCSE is changing quite dramatically and we hope with this initial exploration of using more authentic material in the classroom, we can foster in pupils for the longer term an understanding and appreciation of language learning as an experience in communication and cultural enrichment.

All TEM techniques are in fact limited to the imaging and energy spectroscopy of the electron wavefunction. Moreover, when a single sample property is sought, most of the image information is useless, a waste that cannot be afforded in dose-sensitive materials. The Quantum Sorter leverages the recently-acquired capacity to structure e-beams, which implies that if, in a quantum experiment (tunable state preparation, interaction, analysis), the analysis is performed over the \u2018optimal\u2019 basis of quantum states, very few electrons are necessary for the full characterisation of a sought property, i.e. the TEM can be tuned to answer a single question but with maximum efficiency. To this end, Q-SORT introduces a new parallel analysis strategy, based on a suitable conformal mapping of the wavefunction: the starting point is the analysis of orbital angular momentum (OAM), but building a recipe for diagonalising a wider range of observables is one of the planned Breakthroughs of Q-SORT. This will in turn allow Q-SORT to achieve three other high-risk Breakthroughs of vast applicability: assessing the OAM of plasmonic resonances in select nanoparticles, achieving atomic-resolution magnetic dichroism, identifying different proteins based on selected properties. We believe that the Quantum Sorter will become so important that it will eventually be part of every state-of-the-art TEM, since the new technology is easy to integrate with energy-loss spectrometry.
