It has a strong culturally and linguistically diverse community spirit with 492 children on role from approximately 312 families; over 22 languages are spoken by families and staff.\r\n\r\nAlma Park is a two form entry primary school for children aged 3 to 11 years old. There is a nursery for 52 children and Hearing Impaired resourced provision for 14 children who are taught using British Sign Language. Deaf children are integrated into all aspects of school life and British Sign Language is a strong feature of our provision for all children.\r\n\r\nAlma Park has been consistently recognised by Ofsted as being 'Good' with 'Outstanding features'. Children's behaviours and attitudes towards learning are outstanding, children are passionate learners who enjoy the rich curriculum available to them; this includes French.\r\n\r\nAlma Park has a long-term commitment to learning foreign languages and international dimensions; French has been taught for many years and there have been previous projects involving links with schools in China and Pakistan and this Erasmus+ project is the next step on this journey.\r\n\r\nCurrently, French is taught to all children across EYFS to KS2 which exceeds the statutory requirement for modern foreign language (MFL)  provision.  However, it is exclusively taught in discrete lessons by a highly skilled senior teaching asisstant (TA4). The MFL co-ordinator has assessed the current staff skills and knowledge base and has recognised there is a lack of confidence, skills and capability to deliver French in a sustainable manner. She has identified 10 school improvement priorities to raise the profile of French, enhance the quality and frequency of teaching and learning and ensure sustainability for this subject both within the school and beyond including families through Parent Workshops.\r\n\r\nThe MFL co-ordinator and Headteacher have worked collaboratively with an external MFL consultant to identify a highly structured two year project, funded in the main by Erasmus+ to achieve these improvement priorities. The project will be supported by involvement of PQ-France Ltd who will provide immersion training for 12 teachers/TA's in Carcassonne, France and facilitate a link with a French primary school. The immersion training will be significantly supplemented in school through timetabled staff INSET in preparation for the French visit,  on the return to school and over the course of the project.\r\n\r\nA Project Team comprising of the MFL co-ordinator, TA4, Headteacher, School Business Manager and a school Governor will oversee the project and the staff selection process ensuring it is transparent, fair and is accountable to the school Governing Body.\r\n\r\nThe progress made by Alma Park will be reported at interim and end points disseminated to all stakeholders through social media and in house presentations. Alma Park will acknowledge the involvement of Erasmus+ which will make the project possible; this can be achieved by hosting 'multiplier events' which encourage other schools to pursue similar projects.\r\n\r\nThe MFL co-ordinator and Headteacher identified specific successful outcomes for the project alongside the improvement priorities; these will help Alma Park continue its journey on a strong European dimension and international awareness, improving children's  and staff's life and career opportunities.", "http://www.almapark.manchester.sch.uk", "Alma Park Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047291_coordinator"]]}}, "2WL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Words in to Action", "Depaul UK - Burnage Lane", 51376.0, 6, 13, "Our 'Words into Action' Project involves bringing together EVS participants and young people at Depaul homeless accommodation services where they can learn and develop from mutually beneficial interactions and relationships.

The project aims to boost skills and employability by providing opportunities for young people from other European countries to volunteer with CEDE  Foundation in the United Kingdom and gain work experience. It will offer the volunteers the opportunity to learn in an environment with a different culture and language. The volunteers would have the opportunity to acquire the skills to exploit their own potential and abilities.

In 2009 Opera Circus began to develop a long term series of youth and school's exchanges, cultural and arts programmes between Dorset UK and the Srebrenica region. Participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe, Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people by developing their own creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of youth exchanges and youth workers mobility and with non formal learning at its heart. Combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists, will lead to the establishment of an international network of socially engaged young cultural leaders and organisations with last-long impact locally, nationally and internationally.  \r\nAs well as 6 extraordinary European partners, we have also invited 5 UK organisations to take part in TCFT phase 2. The UK has a reputation for being highly advanced in influencing inclusion, social disadvantage and disability through non formal cultural and arts activities and we are keen to share the UK experience with our partners and to learn from them. There are 12 partner organisations in total raging from youth centres, youth theatre groups, a university, leading international cultural organisations, a city and local authorities making TCFT a unique, exciting and robust melting pot of expertise, knowledge and disciplines. TCFT will work directly with 180 young people, 24 group leaders and 48 youth workers over the 24 months period in a combination face-to-face meetings and ongoing online training.  Young people involved in the project are socially disadvantaged and TCFT will work directly with at least 70 disabled young people. The numbers above reflect the individuals engaging directly with the project, many more will be impacted via the work of partners, youth workers and young people locally. Furthermore, we estimate a significant reach to new audiences in every country TCFT operates in via partners\u2019 websites and networks, TCFT Online Platform and public events. \r\nOC is delighted to welcome its first Romanian EU partner. With Romania becoming a full member of the EU, it is important that we can contribute to the spread of knowledge, culture and history that surrounds this beautiful country, helping to combat the current spread of racism and xenophobia connected with their people.  Our programme partners in Serbia and Bosnia have also taught us about their countries and we have learned a great deal from our active engagement with their cultures since 2004.  Cultural awareness, tolerance, inclusiveness, deeper learning, understanding of the other, is at the heart of this creative process. And partners from Italy, Portugal and Georgia adds more expertise, commitment and diversity to TCFT.\r\n\"Culture generally and music and the arts specifically support the creation of environments for tolerance and understanding within divided communities.\u201d \r\nFrancois Matarasso.", "http://www.agenciahub.org", "Opera Circus Limited", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012136_10"]]}}}}
