Since it is a water-based PTO system, the risks of oil leaks in the ocean will also be fully eliminated. The system and components developed will have a broad range of applications, from wave energy, as the main application area, to water desalinization and small hydro power generation, and will therefore benefit a European value chain of SMEs specialised in engineering and green energy generation. To achieve our objectives, we need to develop new scientific knowledge in: design of innovative system components such as a variable speed generator, an adaptative blade turbine, elastomeric structures and the overall hydraulic system; protective coatings for marine environments; modeling the ageing of elastomeric structures; and wireless controlled monitoring of offshore moving equipment. Due to the technical challenges of testing the system, there was a conscious decision to hold the activities of AQUAGEN during a 39 month period. Whilst the SMEs form a supply chain for the manufacture of the ultimate PTO system we have neither the facilities nor the resources to undertake the necessary R&D. The Research for SMEs funding instrument provides the ideal solution, allowing us to outsource the R&D to four RTD Performers \u2013 VP, NTNU, UM and CMG. The Foreground Intellectual Property (FIP) generated in the AQUAGEN project will be owned and exploited by the SMEs, envisaging several market segments and a geographical distribution of non-exclusive licenses for markets outside Europe. If the project meets its targets the SMEs will benefit from sales and licensing of the FIP to several millions of \u20ac's.", null, 1978828.0, 4, 10, "AQUAGEN", "https://sites.google.com/site/aquageneu/", "http://www.checkmateuk.com", null, "fp7_97520_985097081"]]}}, "3LT": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYY", "Sheppey Community Hospital", "nhs_RYYC7"]]}}}}
