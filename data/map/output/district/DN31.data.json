The percentage of children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) attending the school is rising rapidly and is currently 19%. Most of these children are recently arrived in the UK from Eastern European countries, mainly Poland, and start their education with us knowing little or no English. The staff at the school is committed to providing the best education possible for all the children and, as a result, are keen to learn more about the education system and culture in the country of origin of the EAL population they serve.\r\n\r\nThe key aim of our project is to ensure that we have the best possible protocols in place to support our current EAL children and to help our new starters with EAL to settle quickly and begin to make progress. We believe that we can facilitate this by having a better understanding of the cultural and educational context from which they originate. Our strategy is to develop this understanding through a  training course in Poland during a half-term holiday week, enabling key members of staff to be immersed in their host's educational system and experience aspects of their culture.\r\n\r\nThe training will take place in Elblag, a town in Warminsko-Mazuria east of Gdansk. We have already established links with a school there through our work for the British Council\u2019s International School Award, and the Teacher Training Centre in Elblag has successfully supported international education projects in the Lincolnshire region since 2008. We have planned for eight teachers (which is 80% of our teachers) to undertake the training course in Poland, as we know there will be a bigger impact on outcomes if the majority of teachers participate directly this professional development programme.  \r\n\r\nThe principal focus for the training would be to find out how classrooms are organised to support learners from early years through to year 6 and how the core skills of literacy and numeracy are taught. We also plan to develop an insight into how behaviour is managed in Poland and what types of pastoral systems are in place for pupils. It would be achieved through direct observation in schools and discussions with school stakeholders. This would enable us to develop a whole school protocol to support the transition of EAL pupils and their parents that is sensitive to their needs and expectations. We would aim to build lasting relationships with the schools we visit, resulting in collaborative partnerships that enrich the curriculum for all our children.  \r\n\r\nThe strategic planning of the project is being carried out by the Senior Leadership Team with the Vice Principal (International Coordinator) and Assistant Principal (EAL Coordinator) taking the lead roles. All information gathered as part of the project will be disseminated to the whole school community so that the overall aims of the project are achieved through the contribution of all stakeholders. It will also be disseminated through the termly North East Lincolnshire Headteacher meetings, as we have a similar EAL cohort profile as many of our neighbouring schools, which also share our desire to raise standards and expectations across our wider community.\r\n\r\nWe expect to see a number of positive measurable impacts on our school and beyond including:\r\n- improved engagement with parents of children with EAL\r\n- smoother transition for new starters with EAL\r\n- accelerated progress of children with EAL\r\n- improved teaching and learning throughout the school, impacting on all our children,  as we recognise, adapt and adopt examples of good practice from international partners\r\n\r\nOverall we will create a school community that is significantly more knowledgeable, empathetic and understanding of the diverse backgrounds of its pupils.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare. The partners in this project represent animal welfare organisations, major companies in the animal production sector and leading research institutions. This venture will benefit the public, the industry and the animals, and thereby significantly strengthen the sustainability of European agriculture.", 8301.0, 1003769.0, 10, 21, "EAWP", null, "http://www.foodvestgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/54686.jpg", "fp7_88809_995762037"]]}}}}
