At the current rate of clearance of about 500,000 mines per year and assuming no additional mines are laid from now on, it could still take hundreds of years to find and clear all the landmines around the world.\nD-BOX will tackle the burning issue of anti-personal landmines and cluster munitions remaining from armed conflicts. This will be achieved through the development of innovative solutions that will be interfaced and integrated in a comprehensive toolbox that is going to provide demining stakeholders the best tools, methods and procedures. This \u201csmart\u201d Toolbox could be used during all demining activities (from the preparation of the mission until the elimination of the mines including communication to general public and donors) to help operators and end users have the most suitable answer, cheap and \u201ceasy to use\u201d tools for a specific task during the different steps of the demining activities and adapted to different scenarios and conditions.\nD-BOX project, starting by an assessment of the state of the art on related on-going-activities and scenario, the requirements for different tools and toolbox will be conducted with a strong involvement of end-users.

The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance. The \"European thought\" can be considered as a long-term benefit. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. \r\nThe mobility project is going to take place from July until beginning of October 2017.  Seventeen of 27 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad.

It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. \r\nWork on the topic \u201cIntegration of migrants into working life within the EU\" poses the question, which results are to be expected.

E=0 is based on the successful Energiesprong programme in NL, delivering net zero energy (E=0) retrofits with a 30+ years performance warranty; installed within one week at a cost paid off by the guaranteed energy savings (http://energiesprong.nl/interreg/). The retrofit greatly improves quality & comfort, leading to wider urban renewal.\nThis game changing approach is based on aggregating demand from the housing supply side and letting them procure a performance-based product meeting this new standard. This challenges industry and their supply chain to innovate. To widen the opportunity for supply chain integration, this E=0 retrofit market must scale up to the NWE region. The H2020 project Transition Zero is a first step toward Energiesprong scale-up. It funds the setting up of national market development teams in the UK & FR to work on: (a) First studies of business models, regulation, financing & guarantees; (b) Aggregating demand for houses to be retrofitted; (c) Establishing an outcome-based procurement framework for net zero energy retrofit. In addition to that, INTERREG E=0 will boost this development of net zero energy markets in FR, UK, NL & LU, with a focus on: (a) Transnational cooperation, to share best practice in NWE to widen the market & to accelerate deployment to 11200 retrofits; (b) Setting up demonstrators (41 E=0 retrofits) & financing to learn how best to implement E=0 retrofits within existing planning & regulatory frameworks; (c) Activating solution providers (incl.

Conventional optical fibres are small, low-cost and can be seamlessly integrated in materials, in engineering structures and in the environment. By exploiting the most advanced light-matter interactions, these tiny luminous wires can realize distributed sensing, which means that each point along an optical fibre can separately and selectively sense quantities such as temperature, strain, acoustic waves and pressure, in perfect similarity to a real organic nerve.\nThese remarkable features have attracted the interest of different end-users covering application domains as diverse as pipeline protection, oil and gas well exploitation, electricity transport, perimeter, fire alarm, etc., leading to a sustained market growth in the last years. However, the full potential of state-of-the-art distributed fibre sensing is exploited in a fairly narrow range of applications only. This is mainly due to the lack of trained scientific personnel capable of creating the link between the sensors and possible applications.\nThe ambition of FINESSE is therefore to educate and to train researchers in the development of a set of disruptive new optical 'artificial nervous systems' with improved sensitivity, precision and new sensing abilities, and to boost the industrial uptake of these sensors by training these researchers to valorise their work.\nThe ultimate vision empowering the project is the widespread implementation of fibre-optic nervous systems dedicated to: (i) contributing to a safer society by returning early warnings for danger and (ii) ensuring sustainable development through the efficient exploitation of natural resources.
