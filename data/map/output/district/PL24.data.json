These tourist economies are based on a high level of gastronomy; guests receive excellent food quality in restaurants, where the local (Maritime) food finds its way to the kitchens. To maintain this high quality of gastronomy and secure it for the future, quality chefs are need, able to process local food - products in an innovative and sustainable way in the kitchens. In doing so they to promote the region as a tourist and gastronomic region. However, the coastal regions have a shortage of chefs, which are able to make the necessary innovation. The labour market is in need of new skills , because the job is changing. \r\nEach Cooking@Sea will develop the right network with gastronomical companies and restaurants and identify future proof  skills of the gastronomical industry , test them and secure them in collaboration with the network of restaurants and partner organizations from the region. Skills that are highly important for the cook of the future are; the pursuit of excellence, creativity, sustainability and the ability to process the regional product in (new) dishes. The Cooking@Sea VET module will be built on the skills and with 3 pilots with in each region test them with at least 225 students. The partners of Cooking @ Sea will jointly renew the existing gastronomical curriculum in this way, with the right European skills. In addition the partners will make their national qualification cross boarder transparant using EQF and adopt principles of work-based learning duing the Cooking@Sea pilots. Teachers working in Cooking@Sea project will be trained in the new skills during a training program offerred by each Cooking@Sea partner.   After the training they will receive a Cooking@Sea international training certificate (C@SITC) as proof they understand the new skills.  \r\nWe expect the students of Cooking@Sea will find a job easily. The impact will also be big on each region. The touristic economies will be supported and local food products promoted. Most important, VET education will be innovated because Cooking@Sea offers a method and a blue print to extract new skills for new jobs and connect them to VET education.\r\nTo dissemintate the Cooking@Sea project results, promote the job a cook and promote the regions as gastromomical and touristic regions 3 Cooking@Sea festivals will be organised.

Around 180 million tonnes per year of products are extracted in the EU, with an estimated contribution of \u20ac10 billion to European GDP and offering direct employment to some 42,500 people.  A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials. STOICISM will research, develop and demonstrate a range of new innovative technologies along the industrial minerals value chain. This will include developments in extraction, beneficiation, drying, calcining and waste recycling.\n\nSTOICISM is expected to impact significantly on the sustainability of the EU\u2019s industrial minerals industry by decreasing the use of natural resources (both mineral deposits and energy resources) leading to the sustainable production of better and purer products with less waste and lower environmental impact.", 762419.0, 6859720.0, 8, 17, "STOICISM", "http://www.stoicism.eu/", null, null, "fp7_106426_968264283"], [1322697600000, 1448841600000, "New Generation of Functional Cellulose Fibre Based Packaging Materials for Sustainability", "Imerys Minerals Ltd", "The NEWGENPAK ITN is an interdisciplinary research training network of 8 European universities, 3 research institutes and 6 enterprises, three of which are Full partners.
