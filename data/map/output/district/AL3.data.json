We, as global citizens, must realize that sustainable development, energy saving, ecological footprint and climate change are global concepts to be tackled locally and individually.

Various epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the stress related to tests and school performance affects generally one third of the children who attend primary education in Europe. The causes of stress can be identified in genetic, biological and environmental factors, many of which are related to the school environment, such as pressure on high academic achievement. Some of the consequences of failing to timely treat anxiety in children result to school failure. \r\nStress is a taught behavior, literature indicates, and thus it can be treated through well structured interventions to all key players of pupils educational environment, which includes peers, teachers and educational staff and parents and families as well. \r\nThe project aims to achieve such an intervention. The objectives of it are targeted to pupils, educational staff and to families as well, attempting an innovative approach since usually pupils stress is treated at an individual level. \r\nThe main objective of the project is to design, develop, test, evaluate and validate a methodology of educational intervention with the respected training material in order to assist pupils obtain skills in order to tackle stressors and handle a stress situation. \r\nObjectives that are pupils oriented include emotional awareness, personal academic strategies skills, and give room to their expressions needs. \r\nThe teachers and staff oriented objectives aim at providing specific stress management skills and knowledge cooperatively construction by organizing transnational learning events in partner countries. \r\nFamilies oriented objectives aim at providing them with information and validated guidelines to support their children well being. \r\nA well structured set of activities were selected by the partnership in order to achieve the objectives that were set.
