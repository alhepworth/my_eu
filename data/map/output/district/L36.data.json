The objectives for the student's work placements were clearly outlined with the company WILKO beforehand and the project was very successful. In fact the staff at  WILKO were so impressed with the placement that they offered to have students the following year but this time to welcome them in the three WILKO outlets situated in and around Liverpool. For 2014 our project was awarded  funding for 10 grants and 10 students were subsequently sent for their work placement in the three WILKO stores in Liverpool as agreed. Yet once again the work placements ran smoothly with excellent feedback causing the managers in the WILKO to ask for more students  the next year and thus prompting the idea of creating a possible partnership with WILKO in the future.The work placement project LIVERPOOL 2016-2018 aims at sending 20 students from our establishment over the two year period, 10 students in 2016 and 10 in 2017. The students involved in the project will be studying their final year of the  Professional Baccalaureate in business and marketing and Professional Baccalaureate in Logistics/ supply chain management. The reason we have decided to choose students studying in their final year is because they will have acquired a certain level of maturity and meet the age requirements for a work placement in the UK. The choice of candidates for the project is based primarily on their motivation.The week preceding the student's work placement is devoted to helping the students settle into their environment and is called an induction week.  The intermediary organisation SWOP  handles this week by preparing students in the following areas:- Using the public transport network- Learning about the partner company- Raising cultural awareness- Adapting to the workplace in the UK- Using role plays to prepare for work situations- Visiting places of local interest- Adapting to new local food through cookery lessons.- Learning about the history of Liverpool via museum trips- Preparing and presenting a group oral presentationDue to the intensive linguistic nature of this training week the preparation cannot be carried out in France.The running of this project will be based on the european development plan already in place within our school and the participation of the school governing body, the teachers and the students. This school project is expected to receive recognition on a regional and local level. Students attending the European section classes are becoming more and more aware of its advantages. The European professional baccalaureate is an asset for students wishing to continue their studies or work in Europe by obtaining the Europass.

One of these creative methods are circus arts: young people can acquire different skills and competences by doing circus - they are learning much more than good looking tricks. They learn how to learn, how to be persistent, how to respect and believe in themselves and in their surroundings, and how to realize their potentials in this completely inclusive world which is the world of the circus. All in all: circus can be used as a creative and innovative methods to motivate young people and to improve competences. \r\nIn modern circus, the learning environment is positive and creative, so everybody can find its place and talent in it. And last but not least, through performances, it gives a positive image to the society of the marginalized youth groups, who are otherwise often  seen as \u2019future criminals\u2019. So in the end circus workshops can teach tolarace and the value of being different, and can fight discrimination and exclusion. The training focuses on sharing these practices and proposing creative and innovative methods of working with young people with challenging background.\r\n\r\nThe project is a training course involving 22 participants from 8 different countries,  and 3 trainers and the focus is using circus arts as tools for social inclusion.

Therefore, a significant need exists for parallel-computing approaches that are capable to solve such problems within reasonable time frames. Recently, part of our consortium demonstrated proof-of-principle of a parallel-computation system in which a given combinatorial problem is encoded into a graphical, modular network that is embedded in a nanofabricated planar device. The problem is then solved by a large number of independent biological agents, namely molecular-motor-propelled protein filaments, exploring the network in a highly parallel fashion (PNAS 113, 2591 (2016)). Notably, this approach uses orders of magnitude less energy than conventional computers, thus addressing issues related to power-consumption and heat-dissipation.
