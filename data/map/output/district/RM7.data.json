Languages, subject-specific and intercultural competences are being acquired and trained hands-on in direct contact with speakers of the target language in our partner institutions, their training restaurants, kitchens and hotels in the target country. The visiting students and teachers work in tandems with the hosting students and teachers.

These players will typically be between 16 - 19 years of age and it is very unlikely that they will have lived overseas or lived independently (away form their family home), prior to their involvement in the project. As such BDC will provide a highly structured level of support with a detailed training programme each day, for each of the players,throughout their mobility experience. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to run for over a 24 month period, between January 2015 and December 2016, with 5 planned flows throughout this period. Each departure will recruit a cohort of 8 players who will spend 2 weeks receiving coaching and completing training delivered by World Player Internacional. \r\nThe mobility will take place in Seville, Spain and the training programme will work on specific areas of football with a view to improving each players technical ability with a focus on close control and ball retention.\r\n\r\nThe players will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to departure and an in-country orientation once they arrive in Seville and will receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to assist with any issues which may arise. An accompanying person will also stay with the group throughout the duration of their Mobility.\r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that players will gain first hand experience of a foreign training programme that will enhance their playing ability, an intercultural experience and personal development that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the players will develop personal and professional confidence and an understanding of the European labour market.\r\nA longer term and aspirational target for this project, is that the introduction of new training regimes will positively impact the players development and ultimately have a positive affect in terms of increasing the number of Football Academy graduates who go on to secure professional playing contracts. We plan to monitor and evaluate the impact of the mobility in the longer term by looking at players future career pathways and how the mobility has supported their progression within their playing careers. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact for participating organisations is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.bdc.ac.uk", "Barking & Dagenham College", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012271_coordinator"], [2016, "Klessheim goes Europe - Europa wir kommen! - Internationale Kommunikation im Tourismus: CLIL und Fremdsprachen als Arbeitssprachen im fachpraktischen und fachtheoretischen Unterricht sowie im f\u00e4cher\u00fcbergreifenden Sprachunterricht", "Barking & Dagenham College", 6045.0, 2, 2, "Context and Background of the projectKlessheim School and College of Tourism have an international focus. Internationality and competence in modern foreign languages are an integral part of its school development plan. Our school development plan lists internationality, language training and foreign language competence as quality objectives with regard to staff competences. Our 75 teachers teach 600 students aged between 14 and 21 years. In order to implement the above mentioned objectives of our school development plan, we decided to look for a UK-based training institution that teaches the same age range on a comparable level of competence in the field of culinary arts and restaurant skills. After careful consideration and after a long and hard search we were able to find Barking and Dagenham College in London as a project partner.  University College London advised and assisted us in this search. Representatives of both institutions have already made contact and met, and now our aim is to build up a long-term co-operation and start VET staff mobility. Our aim is to meet teaching staff and establish contacts for future projects in which we will possibly be able exchange students.Objectives of the projectOur project aim is to establish a co-operation with an educational institution that teaches the same age range on a comparable level of competence in the field of culinary arts and restaurant skills in a country where the target language English is spoken. One aim is to improve our target language competences and our teaching methods and tools in the field of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and our target language English as a language of instruction in culinary arts and restaurant service skills including the social English that goes along with this. The project is also about an exchange of practice and best practice in subject specific content, knowledge and skills in the field of culinary arts and restaurant skills. Since language and culture are intertwined, our project has also cultural and social objectives.Number profile of participants / description of activitiesIn this VET staff mobility 3 teachers of Klessheim School and College of Tourism will be sent for job-shadowing and teaching purposes to Barking and Dagenham College in London.Methodology to be used in carrying out the projectThe project is carried out in co-operation and in close consultation with both institutions\u2019 stakeholders. Concerning methodology, the tools used to carry out the project are a Memorandum of Understanding and Mobility Agreements. For the reflexion of the project results in our team meetings we use among other things the project aims of this application, our project notes as well as our project documentation during the duration of the project.Results and impact envisaged- improved foreign language skills and competences- improved subject-related competences and understanding of practices, strategies and systems in the job field culinary arts and restaurant skills on a European level- enhanced support and assistance in relation to student mobilities (international internships)- deeper understanding for social, linguistic and cultural plurality- deeper understanding of the connections between formal and non-formal education and training, vocational training and job market- improved knowledge and readiness in relation to innovation and internationality in education and trainingResults and impacts envisagedAt local level we expect improved language skills with teaching staff and consequently also with students, as well an expanded repertoire of teaching methods and tools. We also expect enhanced intercultural awareness in relation to internationality and the European dimension with all those involved in our school and college. At a regional level we want to disseminate the knowledge, skills and competences gained by the teachers taking part in this project in teacher training seminars. Klessheim School and College of Tourism will become even more attractive for students. At international level Klessheim School and College will get known in the United Kingdom.Potential longer term benefits- we can cater for our target groups in a more innovative and improved way; this is owing to our VET trainers\u2019 improved qualification, more and more attractive programmes for our learners, improved recognition of skills and competences gained abroad (ECVET),- increased capacity, to act on EU or international level respectively- increased languages skills in foreign language, empowerment to act within ones institution with more commitment in a more modern, more dynamic and more professional way", "http://www.bdc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016441_1"]]}}, "7LS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1420070400000, 1546214400000, "Built to Specifications: Self-Inspection, 3D Modelling, Management and Quality-Check Tools for the 21st Century Construction Worksite", "Lakehouse Contracts Limited", "Built2Spec brings together a new and breakthrough set of technological advances for self-inspection and quality assurance that will be put into the hands of construction stakeholders to help meeting EU energy efficiency targets, new build standards, and related policy ambitions.
