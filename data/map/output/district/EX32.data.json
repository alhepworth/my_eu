Observation oriented to the development of teaching-learning processes in the classroom and their respective evaluation and comparative processes between different educational centers.\r\n2) Teaching assignment, the development of teaching-learning processes in different countries will favor the link with students and teachers of these centers, showing contents of interest and using methods, techniques and strategies aimed at participation and group work.\r\n3) Improvement in language skills necessary to improve skills and abilities in the participation, development and follow-up of international projects and improvements in language skills oriented to teaching practice in a global context.\r\n\r\nTo this end, activities based on permanent contact with partner centers are envisaged: before, during and after the planned mobilities. The empirical contrast of the different existing training programs, the in situ experimentation of different didactic methodologies for common objectives, the evaluation of other management models of an educational center, the acquisition of better language skills in English and Portuguese based on verbal communication and contextualized to the classroom and the application of new didactic resources more adapted to the needs and characteristics of our students are the main activities that will be developed in the project. No less important is the dissemination throughout the life of the project and once this project has finished all its activities and results.\r\n\r\nThe participating institution that promotes the project has a long and proven experience in the Erasmus + program, having developed projects of the KA102 modality during the last eight years. The educational center established in Portugal also has a great deal of experience in this regard. With respect to the educational center of England will be his first experience in Erasmus + projects but current professors of his staff have participated in international programs.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the expected results, the center expects to benefit in terms of:\r\n1) Knowledge in organizational and teaching systems of other centers, with the objective of applying some of them to our classrooms and educational programs and bilingual section of the center.\r\n2) A greater conviction of the whole educational community in the need to work-share in network with other centers of other countries.\r\n3) Improvement of language skills in English and Portuguese of the teachers participating in the mobilities.\r\n4) Expand new communication links with other centers that present these as an impetus for the future work of new projects and educational actions of an international character.\r\n\r\nIn short, we firmly believe that the realization of our project will achieve the proposed objectives guaranteeing benefits for the entire educational community of the center in the short and long term.", "http://www.parkcommunity.devon.sch.uk/parkweb/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-035932_2"]]}}}}
