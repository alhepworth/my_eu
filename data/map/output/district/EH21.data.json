The participants comprise 20 workers from 11 European Organizations that work with youth and social inclusion, who are interested in exchanging best practices to fight youth unemployment. The project aims to improve the quality of work of each organization at a local and international level, and encourage the establishment of future collaborative projects through the exchange of ideas, tools and methodologies.    \r\nThe project's organizer is CIAJ (Youth Counseling Information Center), one of ten youth information centers in Barcelona. The youth information centers are a free service, created by the Barcelona City Council to provide important information to youth in multiple areas. CIAJ, and all the other youth information centers, fulfill an important role working in youth employment and promoting occupation. We daily advise large numbers of young people about themes related to employment (job search channels, resources to improve their CV or motivation letter, job offers etc).  In addition to these services, for the last 6 years CIAJ, along with Barcelona's other youth information centers have organized biannual employment campaigns.  In these campaigns we coordinate and organize a variety of talks and workshops to improve the employability of youth and new workers.  \r\nGoals of the seminar:\r\n-To promote a space for the exchange of knowledge, ideas, contacts and experiences between organizations working against youth unemployment. \r\n- To explore and highlight specific tools for the integration of youth at social risk of social exclusion. \r\n- To share useful knowledge about training young people, enhancing their individual skills and the important characteristics affecting access to the labor market. \r\n- To create an efficient network between European entities. \r\n- To study successful projects in job creation.\r\n- To work for creativity in specific actions to promote youth employment. \r\n- To emphasize important tools for the recognition of non-formal education\r\n- To promote mobility experience, specifically local and international volunteering as a useful experience for a professional background.\r\n\r\nWorking methods \r\nThe seminar ensures the balance between knowledge and abilities acquired by participants with strong local impact.  To achieve this goal the seminar combines: \r\n- Open sessions in which a large number of youth workers and local organizations will be present. We intend to explore a variety of European youth policies, facilitate knowledge about the new program 'Erasmus +', and create interactions between those European organizations with similar goals.  \r\n- Visits to relevant local organizations in the youth field.   \r\n- Study of the real applicability of the various projects in each participant\u2019s specific context.  \r\n- Creation of a booklet with information relative to the best practices of each of the participants. \r\n- Group work and evaluation sessions, in which participants have the opportunity to initiate international alliances and the design of new projects between them. \r\n\r\nThe seminar has the following impact at a local, regional and European level: \r\n- To instigate the implementation of new local projects, improve employability and better the quality of information and material in regards to employment and international youth mobility. The project also raises awareness in the local population about the importance of youth support systems. \r\n- To offer all participants and invited organizations the opportunity to get to know international partners and begin working at international level against unemployment and social exclusion. \r\n- We will send the compiled project booklet with all the relative information of best practices to each organization, and also to the National Agency.", "http://www.bridgesproject.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-2-ES02-KA105-000745_8"]]}}, "6UU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1412121600000, 1475193600000, "The transfer of connected speech behaviours: \nexternal sandhi and glottalization in English-accented German", "Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh", "The aims of the project are to analyze:\n1) the extent and nature of external sandhi and of glottalization of word-initial vowels in English-accented German as compared to native English productions, in relationship to prosodic boundaries and adjacent segments,\n2) the influence of external sandhi and of glottalization on word recognition by English and German listeners,\n3) the influence of external sandhi and of glottalization on the perception of phrase boundaries by English and German listeners.\nExternal sandhi consists in the modification of sounds at word boundaries in connected speech, and it is reported in English and German. Glottalization ceases or modifies phonation by compressing the vocal folds. In German, an abrupt glottalized onset to phonation is frequent in front of word-initial vowels. In English this is less frequent and more likely to occur at phrase boundaries. The interplay between external-sandhi and glottalization is not clear: glottalizations are supposed to take place in absence of external sandhi, but articulatory gestures related to both phenomena can co-occur.\nI will build on my previous work on glottalizations, which showed the extent to which word boundary glottalization is transferred in language learning and actively used in perception. External sandhi, which is more common in English, can be \u201cblocked\u201d by glottalization: so English-accented German will be compared to English. Acoustic analysis will be accompanied by articulatory analysis in order to detect a possible co-occurrence of both phenomena. Perception experiments with manipulated speech will be carried out with native English and German listeners, to test the influence of glottalization and of external sandhi on word recognition and on the perception of phrase boundaries.\nThis is the first extensive investigation of the interplay between external sandhi and glottalization in relationship with prosodic boundaries by means of articulatory, acoustic and perceptual analysis.", 168179.0, 168179.0, 1, 1, "TRASANGLOTT", null, "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", null, "fp7_187763_986460416"], [1356998400000, 1467244800000, "Innovative Social and Employment Policies for Inclusive and Resilient Labour Markets in Europe", "Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh", "The INSPIRES project aims to contribute to resilient and inclusive labour markets in Europe.

In order to do so, it analyzes in-depth the evolution of labour markets policies, employment policies and social policies. Moreover, it qualitatively and quantitatively assesses the labour market position of vulnerable groups from 2000 onwards. INSPIRES covers eleven countries from all European welfare traditions: Mediterranean, Eastern-European, Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and the continental regimes. The consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team of leading European scholars that focus on the labour market, employment issues and social policies.\nThe INSPIRES project aims to accumulate practice-oriented knowledge on the factors that positively and negatively affect resilience and inclusiveness. It seeks to explain differences within and between countries, and within and between the labour market positions of different vulnerable groups on the labour market. INSPIRES intends to isolate the impact of national policies from the structural demographic, social and economic characteristics on labour market resilience.

Provision of online higher education within Europe is under-developed and this is particularly so within postgraduate global health education. \r\n\r\nThe development of high quality online education has been slow within European universities. This may be due to lack of expertise among teaching faculty, concerns about the effectiveness of technology or reluctance to invest the time required to produce learning materials. The project aims to address potential barriers through:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Promoting and developing the pedagogical and technological skills amongst HE staff to enable them to develop innovative eLearning materials\r\n\u2022 Facilitating digital literacy skills amongst students in order to enable them to reach optimal capacity as innovative learners\r\n\u2022 Establishing a framework for the future accreditation of eLearning and a handbook and guidelines for ELearning and dissertation supervision in global health education. .\r\n\r\nThe three partner organisations (in Scotland, Norway and the Netherlands) have all been involved in the delivery of postgraduate teaching in global health through engagement with the TropEd network. The partners wish to make blended and distance learning options available in order to meet the growing demand for higher education from partner countries within and outside of Europe. As many students face economic or geographical challenges such as high fees, high living costs, visa restrictions and the difficulty of being away from home for a full year blended learning and eLearning offer an obvious solution to many of these challenges.\r\n\r\nKey activities and outputs of the project will include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Staff training in developing eMaterials, mainly through the use of long-term training assignments.\r\n\u2022 Sharing of practice between the 3 partner institutions and in the TropEd network.\r\n\u2022 Development of guidance on supervision of global health dissertations from a distance.\r\n\u2022 Development of 9 eLearning modules, clustered into 3 coherent pathways. These will give students access to a blended learning experience that combines the expertise of the three different partners and allows students to engage in virtual mobility across the 3 partner institutions. Learning materials will subsequently be made available as an open learning resource.\r\n\u2022 Delivery of the first 6 modules and evaluation thereof. 24 students (8 per institution) will be recruited for each cohort, the first in 2016-17 (pilot phase) and the second in 2017-18. Students will be registered at each partner organisation and will come to Europe to study the first semester in classroom. Students will then return to their home countries and undertake the remaining modules online. Completion of a dissertation, supervised remotely, will enable successful students to qualify for the award of European Master of Science in International Health\r\n\u2022 Agreement of accreditation guidelines for eLearning within the TropEd network. \r\n\u2022 The experience of the full three-year project will be used to develop a Handbook for eLearning that can be used by all academics working in a similar field. Two journal articles will also be produced.\r\n\r\nThe main result will be to establish a foundation on which future eLearning developments can build, both within the partner institutions and across European networks, especially TropEd. The agreement of an accreditation framework for eLearning within TropEd will open up the possibility for further virtual mobility and partnership working.  The project will contribute to the expansion of online higher education provision within the EU, enabling European universities to maintain a competitive edge in the ever-growing field currently dominated by the US.\r\n\r\nThe project will increase in digital literacy amongst teachers and learners of global health education.

The partnership will engage in the intensive dissemination of those materials which will tackle skills gaps and mismatches be addressing work-based learning, embedded in real-life practical situations that will support the workplace learning of early-career and experienced professional archaeologists. It will embed international experience and transnational mobility throughout.\r\n\r\nContext / Project Background\r\nIt is difficult for archaeologists to move around Europe to work, as there are not consistent ways to record and demonstrate skills\r\nProfessional archaeology as a sector was heavily affected across Europe by the global economic changes from 2008 onwards, owing to its relationship with the construction industry\r\nThe sector now anticipates growth in many European countries, with concern about potential shortages of skilled workers\r\nThe project proposes a novel and innovative way for practitioners and aspirant practitioners to access VET that they and employers value, in order to enhance their potential to play active roles in the labour market \r\nThe project partners are from Spain, UK, Italy, Austria (German Language), Netherlands and Poland. According to labour market intelligence these countries/language groups have some of the largest European archaeological workforces and so could support increased transnationality \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe project will create freely accessible training materials to teach archaeologists technical skills to a common standard, delivered as digital materials, specifically short videos, in a modular format so each skill would be addressed in a self-contained learning experience that could either be separated out and learned individually or combined into a longer, structured learning VET experience\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nThe materials will be created by researchers, technicians and managers from six partner countries (UK, Spain, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, Poland) who are sectoral experts in both archaeological practice and in VET. Approximately 60 people will contribute to the creation of materials for the project, and several hundred more practitioners will be involved in testing the materials\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nPartners will collectively identify priority area for skills development (taking into account data gathered in previous labour market intelligence projects undertaken for the sector by some of the partners and funded in part by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme) matching these against the requirements of a shared validation tool, the Archaeological Skills Passport \r\nFrom these priority areas the partners will create sixteen focussed training videos with voice overs available in six partner languages, thus creating a total of 96 separate VET training tools (16 videos in 6 languages) allowing their use across multiple countries. These videos will then be freely available as stand-alone training materials, and will also be able to form part of more substantial, structured learning activities\r\nThe materials will be available in a portable digital format allowing access in the workplace on a mobile device such as a smartphone or laptop. The modular nature of this resource means it will be quick and easy to access training for a single skill while working on an archaeological site\r\nThe videos will then be integrated into the Heritage Education Portal, an e-learning platform developed by some of the partners under a predecessor Erasmus+ project (ANHER), and through that and by use of YouTube they will be made available and accessible\r\n\r\nResults and Impact Envisaged\r\nAudiences for this training are early career practitioners and those looking to refresh their specific, technical skills that are common to archaeological practice in most countries, encouraging up-skilling of workforces across Europe. Some materials will be country-specific, so beneficiaries will learn quickly and efficiently the required skills and techniques to begin working in a different country, encouraging a transnational workforce that can meet skill shortages across Europe\r\nThe materials can also be included in formal training and CPD programmes. Because they will be licensed under an open Creative Commons license, universities could integrate them into their teaching. Employers and professional associations could use the training materials as validated CPD for their professional grades \r\n\r\nPotential Long Term Benefits\r\nThis project proposes the development and delivery of materials that could help train up a workforce quicker than a 3-4 year degree in archaeology, in order to meet anticipated increased demand\r\nBeneficiaries will be able to use the Archaeological Skills Passport to have their skills validated and thus demonstrated to employers", "http://www.archaeologyscotland.org.uk/", "Archaeology Scotland", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047943_coordinator"]]}}, "7PQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Tandempartnerschaften im Bereich Gastgewerbe, Gesundheit und Erziehung", "Confluence Scotland Ltd", 90566.0, 3, 3, "\"Teamwork makes the dream work-Buddying up and benefiting from work-related experience in Hospitality, Health and Education\" is a project of the Alice-Salomon-Berufskolleg Bochum in cooperation with Confluence Scotland, Edinburgh College and Future Focus Malta.\r\nVocational trainees or apprentices who have basic English language skills and would like to use and extend them as part of a practical experience (hospitality establishments, educational and health institutions) in English-speaking countries (Scotland or Malta) form pairs made up of higher-performing and weaker students. The primary goal is to foster the personal development and social skills of all students and to increase their self-confidence by overcoming language barriers or insecurity through teamwork and mutual support. The long-term goal is also an increase in intercultural and foreign language skills, an important prerequisite for peaceful coexistence and future work in Europe. In addition, the trainees and vocational students gain an insight into the professional life of another European country, which increases their future career opportunities.\r\nVocational mobility in Europe and intercultural experience in the service sector in connection with the training and practice of social skills due to the teambuilding of higher-performing and weaker students offers young people the opportunity to gain experience abroad. It also lays the basis for a lifelong willingness to learn in an international context. At the same time, the chance of obtaining a school degree as well as the successful participation in professional and social life should increase for all pupils participating in the project. The project strategy is thus closely linked to the fields of action agreed as part of the qualification initiative for Germany \"Advancement through Education\". The stay abroad should strengthen the responsibility for one's own learning processes and encourage professional development as well as personal development. Moreover, improvement of linguistic and communicative ability, but also of \"soft skills\" such as empathy, teamwork, leadership and dedication, will benefit the participants in their further professional career and private life.\r\nThe selection of students who are interested in the project takes place via the successful participation in a mandatory working group \"Professional English\". By means of a coordinated, individualized learning plan focusing on vocational training as well as concentration on the development of individual strengths and differentiated performance feedbacks the educational success of pupils of different talents is promoted by a teaching, which does justice to the heterogeneity of the student body. During this process, the participants get to know each other and with the help of the teacher, the tandems of higher- and lower-performing students are formed.\r\nThe project is aimed at vocational students (catering, hospitality, hairdressing, nutrition, education and health). It is designed to enhance the competences of trainees and vocational students by practising a European foreign language in a professional context and by experiencing interculturality whilst being introduced to vocational training in both countries. \r\nDue to the support offered through the tandems, lower performing apprentices or students who might not have thought about a practical experience abroad are motivated to participate in this project and learn to expand their professional and foreign language skills as well as their self-confidence. \r\nAt the same time, teachers participating in this mobility project will be trained as multipliers to bring newly acquired professional knowledge and acquired foreign language skills into our school life. This serves the intercultural exchange in the education system or the internationalization of the vocational training at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College in accordance with the European Development Plan. A long-term goal is the implementation of a professional bilingual teaching (CLIL) in all vocational subjects at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College as well as the establishment of a long-term partnership or the establishment of an exchange program with Edinburgh College for further professionalization.\r\nThis project has an impact -beyond the Alice-Salomon Vocational College- on the surrounding cities of the region. This was demonstrated by the positive response of chambers, guilds and employers in the field of hospitality and health care to whom this project was introduced. With the help of this project they hope to increase the attractiveness of the professions in the service and health care sector and gain access to qualified trainees with pronounced social and professional competences.

They are work with craft niches and through work with old as well as new methods and technologies, they will secure that Denmark can withstand loss of competences and crafts within the trades of precious metal. By that, they will achieve a range of trade competences, which they pass on to their students and course participants and in the end, they will find their way back into the trade.\r\nCourse and continuing education activities for the smith department shall secure that the trade teachers can keep up with the development and has solid and calculated knowledge to new technologi within the trade.

Also trainees themselves asked for courses to be better able to function in a professional environment becoming increasingly international. The Odenwald region is not far from the Rhein-Main area and many students who have completed their traineeships in our area follow up a career in international companies in Frankfurt. So over the years the school has been offering special English courses in many fields of business.
