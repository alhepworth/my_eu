As a group of partner schools we decided to continue working together at the end of the current project by whatever means and so established a core group of partners willing to apply for a longer and more intense partnership of 3 years, focused on the sharing of good practice in teaching & learning rooted in the shared vision of an environmentally sound Europe for our future. Our core belief that we should be inspiring ecological awareness & global citizenship. The decision to look at issues surrounding Renewable Energies came at a project meeting during our current project. It seemed a natural academic progression from the work already completed. Teachers & Pupils will work together in a blended way to share learning experiences across a range of curriculum subjects through hands on experience, digital collaboration & travel. Teachers will share common & new teaching strategies to come to some conclusions about most effective methodologies delivering this kind of environmental education to pupils ranging from 4 - 18 years. By the end of the project the teachers will have become more reflective & engaged practitioners looking for more creative & successful ways of teaching pupils of all abilities. Staff will have had opportunities to develop professionally, to share/develop innovative resources & to find personal growth from the experiences gained by living/teaching in another European country\r\n*We hope that our stakeholders will envisage a reality where they can make sustainable changes to support the development of a secure European environmental policy & greater understanding of their place in Europe\r\n*All stakeholders will have developed an increased awareness of the science/technology affecting energy development - the wider school & local community will engage with the educational providers to spread the messages of the project even further\r\n*There will have been tangible improvements in key competencies - literacy, numeracy, digital skills, multilingualism, citizenship etc\r\n*New pedagogical training & development will have taken place so that the profile of the 8 schools is raised, teachers are more confident & have developed transversal skills through experience of teaching in the wider European context - the public face of teaching will be enhanced by the work we do on this project\r\n* Pupil designed & led learning will be a priority of the project to create independent thinkers & problem solvers at all ages\r\n* Pupils will be given opportunities to develop their employability skills, entrepreneurial skills  & language/communication skills that will make them able to seek work/training opportunities across Europe\r\n* Staff will have had an opportunity to teach, train & develop pedagogy in a European partner school\r\n* Some pupils will have an opportunity to physically learn & disseminate in a European partner school but all pupils will work collaboratively with the partners involved in the project - including the use of comparative data linked to the countries involved & \r\n* Partners will have impacted the carbon footprint of their own school community\r\n* Families will have opportunities to develop their wider skills\r\n*We are 8 Partner schools in 7 countries - all partners speak english, home language & are developing skills in other European languages. Pupils accessing this project range from 4 - 18 yrs. Partner schools differ in size, management structure, organisational structures but we share an agreed philosophy on citizenship & environmental issues.\r\n* Each country will have a Renewable Energy Focus but all partner schools will complete all of the project activities so that by its conclusion the staff & pupils involved will have a broad view of the key issues & innovations in European energy strategies. There will be a core activity each month of the project & subsidiary activities carried out to support the main activity. All 8 schools will work on the same activities at the same time to facilitate blended working. The activities (some of which are listed in the application) will develop basic skills, challenge high ability learners & cater for all learning styles. By the end of the project it is hoped that pupils & staff will have completed a range of knowledge based, research & practical activities linked to the core renewable energies working with linked agencies & providers. Project coordinators will plan the 3 year overview & subsequent termly planning grids based on collaboration within the 8 schools. All partners will work on the same activities at the same time to maximise outcomes\r\nIn the long term this project has many benefits for all stakeholders participating - we are inspiring pupils & their families to make changes in their approach to energy selection & management, we are giving teachers a sense of wider educational accountability & professional collegiate contacts", "http://www.stmarysrcstudley.co.uk", "SS John & Monica Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000355_4"]]}}}}
