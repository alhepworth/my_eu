Our consortium will contribute to the development of co-creation skills enabling citizens to become social innovators. Based on the exchange of experiences and learning through co-creation, our method will permit to bring in light know-how and competences engaging citizens for innovation and creativity and through this, creating bridges between divers sectors and fields of activity.\r\n\r\nCo-Engage project circle is oriented on work packages, milestones, staff trainings and transnational meetings. The most important activities carried out will be the collection and analysis of good practices and their testing in co-creation labs.\r\n\r\nCo-creation labs will be implemented during three training courses. Co-creation labs typically involve hands-on activities in which a group of peers expresses experiences and explores potential solutions in a tangible way.

We will do so by offering alternative tools - forum theatre methodology (FT) and community reporter (CR) methodology - in the framework of peer to peer learning for secondary schools.  \r\nIn the EU ESL is a key problem. According to the EU definition, ESLers are young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who have failed to complete their secondary education. In 2009, more than six million young people across Europe \u2013 14.4% of the 18-24 age groups \u2013 ended their school education system with a lower secondary qualification or less. Even more worrying is the 17.4% who only completed primary education (Eurostat, 2010). There have been different initiatives to reduce the number of ESLers but the drop out of youth remains a problem. \r\nAccording to statistics from 2012 in the partner countries:in France 11,6%, in Hungary 11,5%, in Italy 17,6%, in Spain 24,9% and in the United Kingdom 13,5% of the youth were ESLers. With the exception of Hungary where ESL rates increased by 1% between 2010 and 2012 - which is a very slight improvement -  statistics proves that the effort required in all the countries represented in this project to improve the situation.\r\nIn previous projects we examined the factors that affect ESL are the following:individual (psychological), social (structural), relational (intra-school) and institutional (educational system). Some of these are susceptible to local interventions. We have chosen to work with FT and CR method since they can have impact on the first and third of these factors.\r\nOur partnership aims to contribute to decrease ESL by involving youngsters from youth centers, in CR and FT workshops where young people will work hand in hand with their facilitators, will take active part in developing actions to raise awareness, participate in developing teaching/learning material to support youth workers and teachers and other youth, so that these too can build awareness and address problems related to ESL. In order to mobilize their peers, our young activists will take actions in schools and other institutions, presenting the results of our work and inviting the public for an open debate.\r\nTargets:\r\nDirect targets are socially disadvantaged youngsters between the age of 13-20, as well as youth workers. Indirect targets are other teachers, stakeholders, educational experts and decision makers, parents, who are affected by the project and can be the key of the change on the long run in their environments.\r\nActivities/results:\r\nWe will:\r\n-develop 2 interactive Video Lessons on ESL with youngsters during CR and FT workshops \r\n-organize 16 Peer Actions in the partner countries when youngsters raise awareness and start dialogue with their peers and other concerned targets.  \r\n-organize an International Summer Camp where youngsters meet, peer up and work on ESL\r\n-develop a Video Blog where youth workers, teachers, professionals, youngsters and students can learn about ESL, our methods and processes\r\n-produce a Case Study Book to tell about the stories of our participants and show the impact of our methods from their point of view. \r\n-organise a 5 day exchange for participants at the end of the project, with a 2 day youth conference, in order to optimise peer learning , information and experience sharing and to make sure the project reaches more people.\r\nMethods:\r\n-FT method\r\n-CR method\r\n-Peer to peer learning\r\n-ICT use\r\nImpact:\r\n-On participating youngsters: changing attitudes, gaining self-confidence and reflect on their own behaviour. Development of competencies, communication, creativity and self-expression skills, individual and group work, conflict resolution, intercultural competencies and problem solving.Youngsters will get to know new countries and new ways of thinking, learn languages and meet new people, develop their experiences.

Younger users need to achieve digital responsibility. Older learners and workers need to be introduced to and made proficient in the navigation of the digital world in order to qualify them for jobs needed today.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to become and stay a \u201cdigital native\u201d is faced by teachers and trainers in all education sectors, in formal and non-formal education. For them it will in future be increasingly important to keep pace with the latest digital methods and technologies in order to keep their curricula up to date.\r\n\r\nAims and Products\r\nThe aim of the project is to evaluate and define good practice of use of digital methods in different education sectors in Europe. In this way it can be ensured that everyone becomes a digital native.\r\nThe partnership developed and applied an evaluation grid, which was used to identify good and smart practices, from which a number of practices are presented in this booklet.\r\nDuring of five transnational meetings every partner prepared and presented two good practices. External stakeholders gave feedback on the evaluation grid and provided external perspectives.\r\nThe lessons learned resulted in recommendations which are shared in a policy brief with decision makers.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nThe project has different impacts. \r\n\u2022\tWe expect the participants of the project to extend their knowledge on digital methods and how they are used in Europe.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe expect participant organizations to professionalize and innovate their curricula through new methods.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe expect the learner to become more motivated to perform lifelong learning and we expect stakeholders to become more aware on the need to include digital methods in teaching and training.\r\nMethodology\r\nThe innovative and unique approach of the project is the connection of methods used in all educational sectors. Since until today a common overview or evaluated summary is missing. Synergies between education sectors or European projects are not used. The project closes this gap. \r\nOur aim is to encourage the use of digital devices in learning, thus making it easier, faster and much more fun. By destroying the disbelief that learning has to be boring and difficult and showing good examples of how exciting and elevating it can actually be, we are breaking old patterns and providing a fresh point of view on lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nWith the evaluation grid on hand more than 40 smart practices had been identified. The results came from all educational sectors. At the moment six topics dominate the teaching and learning of digital topics. The six themes are:\r\n1.\tEntering the digital world\r\n2.\tConnecting offline and online world (blended learning)\r\n3.\tFinding digital solutions\r\n4.\tNavigating the digital world\r\n5.\tDigital Creativity\r\n6.\tDigital participation and empowerment\r\nEntering the digital world is a crucial topic in most education sectors. The older generation has to learn to navigate and self-confidentially use digital tools. The younger generation has to learn how to handle the digital world. Teaching digital literacy is increasing participation and at the same time connecting generations..\r\nBlended learning improves problem solving skills. Learners have to transfer observations, experiences and knowledge from online to offline. Usually based on projects and partly on gamification, the learners work interdisciplinary and are challenged to explore new ways and solutions by themselves.\r\nFinding digital solutions for analog problems directly addresses project management, transfer and entrepreneurial skills. With a set of methods like Hackathons innovative products might be generated in the end, but on the way learners will experiment, discuss and explore alternative perspectives on one problem.\r\nNavigating the digital world is implying that learners have already experience and knowledge on the digital world. However, the methods aim to improve and optimize this knowledge. The methods are designed to help trainers and teacher to become guide in the online world. \r\nDigital Creativity - With the digital age it became affordable and convenient to paint, take photos or videos, create and manipulate. The facilitator is rather a stimulator and observer guiding the learners to surprising and open results.\r\nDigital participation and empowerment is as well related to price, availability and access. Everyone has a voice \u2013 still if everyone has a voice, just those are heard which are unique. \r\nThe project found that specifically digital storytelling has to become embedded in more curricula. Digital participation is the basis to become a smart digital citizen. Smart digital citizens help to build smart societies.
