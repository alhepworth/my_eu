These are mature sectors which create annual revenues in Europe in \u20ac147 billion and \u20ac12 billion respectively and require continues innovation to differentiate in a strong-competition market and to attend a consumer demand with increasing level of quality exigency.  FreshFilm will solve the main concerns regarding flexible packaging market: product time life, plastic weight and multilayer recycling by extending fresh-food life time, reducing the weight of packaging and enabling recovery, recycling or reusing of the materials in the packaging.  The New Approach of the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (EU/94/62) has set new targets for the European flexible supplier chain. Directive 94/62 requires reducing the weight of packaging and enabling recovery, recycling or reusing of the materials in the packaging.  This project will develop an innovative recycling food packaging material for meat mainly and also for vegetables, salads and pasta, with oxygen scavenger properties to enable a slowing of the oxidization process within the food being stored by creating an oxygen poor atmosphere and effectively acting as an anti-oxidant.  The natural oxygen scavenging compounds, which act as antioxidants, will be blended as extracts from natural herbs such as garlic, onion, cinnamon, cloves, thyme, and sage.   Contrasting current barrier layers that prevent ingress of oxygen to manage down the oxygen content of the pack interior, the developed film will be entirely recycled at end-of- life. The science and technology required to do this will be challenging, yet the partnership comprises some of Europe's leading research and industrial.", 28348.0, 1108876.0, 6, 10, "FRESHFILM", "http://www.freshfilm.org", "http://www.parkam.com", null, "fp7_107804_997303173"]]}}, "7JT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1362096000000, 1425081600000, "High performance oil spill recovery system suitable to effectively operate in rough sea waters based on improved oleophilic/hydrophobic materials", "Lkl Tec Limited", "Force 7 aims to develop an innovative oil spill recovery system for operation in rough sea conditions.\nThe new system is based on the use of interconnected mops to create a large, wide mop net which will maximize the oil encounter rate on the surface of the sea whilst it is dragged to adsorb the slick. The system is extremely versatile because it only requires one vessel to operate and that can be any vessel of opportunity at the time of an emergency spill.\nThe mops are made by novel fibres with controlled oleophylic and hydrophobic behaviour in order to absorb large quantities of oil and increase the recovery efficiency.  Once the mops are saturated they are recovered onboard of the vessel and squeezed through a roller system: the oil collected is then stored and the mops are deployed again for another cycle.  Traditional systems, in comparison, are characterised by lower performance in terms of oil recovery and cannot be used in harsh sea conditions, which are typically encountered in case of ship wreckage and often characterize the cold seas.\nProject objectives are related to the development of the oleophylic and hydrophobic fibre materials of the mop and the related treatments, the optimisation and production of the mops, and the development of the overall oil spill recovery system for field demonstration.\nFour SMEs constitute the core of the Project, representing the whole supply chain for the oil spill recovery end product. SMEs are supported by three RTDs providing the necessary experience in the field of technical textiles, engineering and oil spill responding services.
