One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes. This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. \r\n\r\nIn line with these objectives and European policies, through GREEEN II, I.I.S (Institute of Higher Education) MERLONI MILIANI of Fabriano aims to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (renewable energy and environment), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 3 weeks for 80 students of fourth year of technical and vocational secondary school with fields of study related to the renewable energy and other 8 newly graduated.\r\nThe training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the renewable energy and environment to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the participants, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\n\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\". GREEEN II is a project based on the concrete responses to the questions of developing ECVET in the European member States and corresponding to the EU Recommendations on the establishment of the European Credit system for VET.

This person, with the support of the Headteacher and Senior Leadership Team will have responsibility for planning, monitoring and evaluation, and dissemination of the project at each stage using electronic tools recommended and made available by the national agency. The Headteacher will have the responsibility for reporting the progress of the project and the final reporting to the national agency using the reporting tool.\r\nSchool practitioners will have a responsibility to engage with the pre-course tasks and learning, to attend said training, to complete post-course tasks including evaluation, reporting and dissemination in keeping with the agreed project plan.\r\nThe school's Finance Officer, supported by the International Coordinator and Headteacher, will be responsible for ensuring that the project spending plan remains in-budget. They will also have responsibility for booking the travel and course training for all participants.\r\nThe Governing Body, with the support of the appointed local International Support Officer, will be responsible for providing the Headteacher with a level of challenge and support during the lifetime of the programme. This will provide a level of accountability that will ensure that the project's aims are met and that the desired outcomes lead to the level of school improvement being sought.\r\nRESULTS, IMPACT & LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nPractitioners will see increases to their confidence, have upgraded leadership competencies, enhance their teaching skills bringing a revised mindset to the classroom along with new ideas that will raise both expectations and standards across the teaching and learning of all subjects. Language skills will be developed following course immersion. They will benefit from the experiences of each other following in-house sharing.\r\nThe school will benefit from increasing the numbers of leaders with strong capabilities in project management and school leadership. This will in turn place the school in a stronger position to make improvements and change, for example in designing a new curriculum which is modern, stimulating and fit for purpose.\r\nIndividual pupils will benefit from a highly skilled, highly trained, highly motivated workforce.
