Most of world\u2019s flowering plants, including 80% of the world\u2019s species of food plants, rely on pollinators for reproduction. There are clear indications of a loss of wild and domestic pollinators with a number of negative ecological and economic impacts. \"Live and Let Bee: Training for Ecological Beekeeping\" Project aims an exchange of know-how, sharing best practices, providing trainings that are geared towards both urban and rural dwellers, dissemination of pollinator-friendly knowledge and creating awareness to tackle this problem. The project will reach out to both rural and urban populations, since the problem and the solution lie in both places. \r\n\r\nExpected results of the project are:\r\n- Review and documentation of existing ecological beekeeping methods\r\n- Training materials on ecological beekeeping\r\n- Web site for Open Educational Resources\r\n- Training in Istanbul\r\n- Ecological Beekeeping Conference in Istanbul\r\n\r\nA select group of beekeepers from the partner organisations will get to visit the good practices in partnering countries. They will learn from each other\u2019s practices. The group will be selected from people who can personally implement the knowledge and also disseminate it among the beekeepers and honey producers within the network of respective participating project partners. \r\n\r\nFor the on-site trainings, the trainees will be visiting good practices and learning from local bee keepers/honey producers in the partnering countries. They will learn how the bees survive/cope/react/produce in different geographical regions, climates, vegetation and pesticide use. The traditional beekeeping methods still being practiced especially in Macedonia and Turkey will be documented with photographs, videos and in a written manner. This documentation will be used in preparing the training materials and will help protect the traditional methods.\r\n\r\nThe training materials to be developed will include information and guide for:\r\n1. people who want to start hive(s)\r\n2. beekeepers about how to fight the common pest problems ecologically\r\n3. beekeepers about how to maintain and support healthy bee populations \r\n4. beekeepers who want to get organic certification for the organically-produced honey\r\n5. local governance bodies babout how to support bee populations in the region\r\n6. urban dwellers about how to support pollinators in the city, ei creating bee-friendly gardens and balconies\r\n7. honey consumers about what to look for in eco-friendly honey and how to access it through community based agriculture. \r\n\r\nThe website will be structured as an online learning guide, where it will provide a step-by-step guide to bee enthusiasts and people who want to help protect bees and provide habitat for pollinators. \r\n\r\nDemand will be created for ecological, organic honey through dissemination, enabling consumers to access healthy honey and the producers to sell their product. Direct selling to consumers will be encouraged, following the foot steps of Bugday\u2019s community supported agriculture model\r\n\r\nLetBee project will reach 15,000 people via:\r\n1) The online training materials in multiple languages will reach to thousands of internet users\r\n2) The future trainings to be organised by the partners in the UK and the Netherlands on beekeeping will reach to hundreds of trainees \r\n3) The conference in Istanbul will reach hundreds of ecologicaly-minded people, small farmers, bee enthusiasts and governmental officials \r\n\r\nImpacts:\r\n- The beekeepers visiting other partner countries for on-site training will implement the know-how and the knowledge that they have gained in their village/town/city. They will pass the knowledge on to the local bee keepers and co-ops.\r\n- Local and regional beekeeping methods will be documented.\r\n- The British and Dutch partners will include the documentation of traditional beekeeping methods in their trainings, thus spreading the traditional knowledge European-wide. \r\n- The dissemination work will increase awareness on the dire situation of pollinators and their importance, increasing the activities and projects targeting bees nationally and at the EU level.\r\n- Beekeepers, NGOs and policy makers, will be informed and educated through the web site and the Ecological Bee Conference in Turkey. This will lead to work on appropriate policy changes on banning certain pesticides and leaving parts of the farming land as pollinator habitat, as it increases the yields. All partners play a role in the ecological farming and beekeeping methods in their respective countries and will carry out the mission.\r\n- The international cooperation and network will help create lobbies for bee-friendly practices locally, nationally, and at the EU level.", "http://naturalbeekeepingtrust.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA204-022719_2"]]}}}}
