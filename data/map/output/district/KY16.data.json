These signals are direct remnants of ancient atmospheric chemistry, and contain far more information than can currently be interpreted. This project combines novel experimental and methodological approaches with state-of-the-art numerical modelling to significantly advance our ability to decipher the isotope records. A unique \u201cearly Earth\u201d UV lamp coupled to a custom-built photocell will enable direct production of isotope signals under Earth-like conditions, with time-dependent sampling.

These are topical and important questions given the increasing impact that humans are having on the natural world. There are three components to the research. First, we will model SADs and predict responses to a range of events including climate change and the arrival of invasive species. A range of modeling approaches (including neutral, niche and statistical) will be adopted; by incorporating temporal turnover in hitherto static models we will advance the field. Second, we will test predictions concerning the resistance and resilience of SADs by a comparative analysis of existing data sets (that encompass communities in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments for ecosystems extending from the poles to the tropics) and through a new field experiment that quantifies temporal turnover across a community (unicellular organisms to vertebrates) in relation to factors both natural (dispersal limitation) and anthropogenic (human disturbance) thought to shape SADs. In the final part of the project we will apply these new insights into the temporal dynamics of SADs to two important conservation challenges.

There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery.

To increase the awareness of, and evidence base for, the health benefits of golf for European citizens and 2. To drive increased participation in the sport of golf at a pan-European level. The five partner countries of the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal were chosen mainly because of their differing golf cultures, which would allow sound comparison and post-project application to our countries around Europe. They partnered with the University of St Andrews (St And), who provided the research methodology and literature review, and the Professional Golfers\u2019 Associations of Europe (PGAE), whose principal role is golf education. PGAE provided an innovative coaching methodology called P.L.A.Y.I.N.G.: Play, Learning and Activity for Youth IN Golf, specifically designed to meet basic youth needs of autonomy. The GoGolf! programme was implemented using a partnership approach across federations, schools and coaches with the University driving programme-level evaluation. The imperative for interventions for youth participation was realised because of the desire for golf to ensure a flourishing future with strong junior cohorts of players and members who continue through adolescent and youth years to play golf as young and then older adults. Golf can contribute to addressing the health crisis and many young people today are inactive and at risk of related non-communicable diseases, lonely, or disconnected from nature. The golf sector also wants to ensure a flourishing future, with players and members, who continue through adolescent and youth years to play golf as adults, continuing healthy, active behaviours throughout their life span.The students\u2019 progress was monitored and assessed, via a research programme tailored by St And, in terms of their aptitude for continuing in the sport and their recognition of the health and wellbeing benefits being offered. The factors affecting participation and access in golf, especially regarding youth were investigated, and guidelines were produced as an applicable \u201cgreenprint\u201d towards successful youth participation. The guidelines, while intended primarily for golf institutions and organisations, such as federations, Professional Golfers\u2019 Associations and individual clubs, especially across Europe, have wider relevance for state, NGO, school and other organisations and institutions worldwide that are considering developing interventions for youth participation, and they offer insights for sports other than golf.Within the GoGolf! Europe programme, around 2 out of every 5 youths responding to the final survey were interested in playing golf in the future, with almost 1 out of 5 pursuing that interest soon after the programme. The innovative coaching methodology developed coach practice and engaged youth in golf as a sport.We regard the GoGolf!

This strategic partnership creates a pan-European, cross-disciplinary, consortium of experts in the field of small state studies. It will expand the traditional scope of small state studies by targeting new disciplines and thus enhance the possibility for a wider understanding of small states, their capabilities, challenges and interests. This is especially important for European Union studies considering that the EU is a Union predominantly made up of small states. The teaching and research themes developed by the consortium are specifically created to address the common challenges facing small states in Europe today. The primary objective of this partnership is to create a pan-European consortium of experts in small state studies that will train young teachers and researchers from International Relations and Political Science as well as other disciplines, such as Economics, Business, Public Administration and Law, in applying insights from small state studies to their research and teaching. This endeavor aims at promoting and encouraging small states studies within these disciplines as well expanding it into other fields. Furthermore, at the end of the project the consortium will have developed four new and innovative inter-disciplinary curricula in small state studies based on the four teaching and research themes. The ten universities participating in this strategic partnership were all chosen based on their unique and outstanding academic standing in the field of small states and European integration. Their academic expertise lies within different disciplines but converges on their focus on the contemporary challenges and opportunities of small states in the international community. The consortium has developed four interlinked teaching and research themes (TRTs) that are built on the specific expertise of the partners and jointly create new cross-border synergies fostering the interdisciplinary development of small state studies at the European level.

Different sections can be chosen : first education based on hospitality business including cooking, service, wine service, pastry and catering services, then education based on hairdressing and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe different classes our students can attend and diplomas they can get are the \"baccalaur\u00e9ats professionnels\" (vocational A-level) with special sections based on the knowledge of European cultures and languages named \"section europ\u00e9enne\" in English or in Spanish. We emphasise the main objective of the program on enabling our students to go abroad and have a work experience there, in as much as they mostly come from low classes. Then, that will help them find a job more easily in restaurants as the knowledge of different cultures and different languages is very important in hospitality business.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send 17 students to different countries : the United Kingdom (England and Scotland), Spain or Germany. We\u2019ve been working with some of the hotels and restaurants since 2005 and we are looking for new ones that we would like to develop a partnership with in the future. The choice of the students depends on the diploma they want to pass, the motivation shown  and the involvement of the pupil in their training. The selection of the candidates is made by all the teaching team and the heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different activities are related to the requirements of the diploma and the evaluation criteria are translated according to the objectives of the training session. The translation is made into the language of the host business of the student and is sent and explained to the tutor before the beginning of the training period.\r\n\r\nThe project will be organised as followed:\r\n- First, we make a selection of the hotels and restaurants we intend to send our students to, some of them we have been working with since 2005) and others are newcomers. The choice of the traineers depends on the personality of our students and the diploma prepared.   \r\n- Then, we organise an information meeting with all the students to explain the project to them. Another one is held with the students who are interested, their families and the heads.\r\n- The preparation of the students is made by the teacher of the vocational subject with the teacher of English or Spanish, and is coordinated by the contact person through different researches : study on culture and tourism of the different European regions (Scotland and Devon for the UK, Catalonia for Spain and Baden Wurttemberg for Germany). This cultural side is studied through researches on the Internet, tasting of local products, organisation of dinners on different themes, and the study of the touristic and cultural (museums and way of life) as well as other practical aspects of the life in the chosen country. These actions are made to ensure the participants a better integration during their training period.\r\n- The selection of the participants will be made by the teaching team and the heads.\r\n- The translation of all the documents will be made by the teacher(s) of the vocational subject with the teacher of English or Spanish (terms and conditions, evaluation criteria, objectives etc....)\r\n- A meeting is organised to explain precisely to the participants and their family all they need to know to make sure everything will be all right (insurance, transport, lodging, rules to adopt etc...)\r\n- The ticket to reach the firm is booked by the school,\r\n- The during all the training period the student keeps in touch with the teacher who will assess the work done by the traineer with the tutor. He/she will make sure the student arrived safely, contact the tutor to follow the training period, will have some contact with the students, will open a private facebook account and make sure that the student returns safely to France at the end of the training session).\r\n\r\nThis process is shared by all the teachers under the supervision of the contact person. The validation is given by our head.\r\n\r\nWe intend to go on working with the partners we've been working with since 2005 and to create some new partnerships to adapt ourselves to the requirements of the market. The hotels and restaurants that welcome our students are motivated to share their knowledge and working methods as well as their language with the participants. It also contributes to give a good representation of their business.\r\n\r\nOur students are satisfied with the project as it allows them to develop their professional and linguistic skills. It also allows them to discover new cultures and develop their sense of belonging to the European Union.

The project ideas are the following: (i) From micro- to nano-reactors. Actual microreactor have channels of micrometric size. We will develop a new concept based on the use of nanometric size channels. (ii) Vectorial pathway for multisite catalytic reactions. A limit in cascade (or domino) reactions is that there is no possibility to control the sequence of reactions of transformation of a reactant in a multisite catalyst. The concept of vectorial pathway for multisite catalytic reactions is based on the idea of an ordered sequence of catalytic sites along the axial direction of the channels of a membrane, in order to control the sequence of transformation. (iii) Dynamic nanoreactor. The concept of dynamic nanoreactor is based on the transient generation of toxic reactants inside the nanoreactor and the immediate conversion, in order to eliminate the storage of these reactants (which is minimized, but not eliminated in on-site or on-demand approaches). The project concept is that the implementation of innovative and safer pathways for sustainable chemical production requires making a step forward in the development of catalyst-reactor design along the lines indicated above. The project applies above ideas to three reactions of synthesis of large-volume chemicals which are relevant example of innovative pathways for sustainable chemical production: (1) direct synthesis of H2O2, (2) PO synthesis with in-situ generated H2O2 and (3) solvent-free synthesis of DPC with in-situ transient generation of phosgene.
