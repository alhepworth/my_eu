The course will help with the delivery of new national Curriculum for Excellence courses in Spanish and in particular equip staff to deliver the New Higher course this year (in previous years the only candidates have been native speakers). It is also envisaged the training will help inform the development, planning and implementation of further new Spanish language courses in the school and enable experimentation with new teaching approaches in the classroom. The course will also impact on training of other Modern Languages staff in the school. It is hoped it might enable the school to find partners abroad and to give staff opportunities to share good practice. Likewise, it is hoped pupils will have more opportunity to communicate using ICT with schools in the U.K. and abroad. Participation in the project will serve to help to raise the profile of Spain and of Europe as a whole via projects in the school throughout the year.", "http://www.dalbeattiehigh.org", "Dalbeattie High School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001887_coordinator"]]}}}}
