The SolarSoft project aims to solve this problem by developing a novel high purity copper conductor possessing a uniquely low proof stress, thus enabling a substantial contribution to be made towards Solar PV Technology achieving cost parity with conventional power generation.", 324955.0, 1131757.0, 6, 7, "SolarSoft", null, "http://www.striptinning.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/150310.jpg", "fp7_100610_965356417"]]}}, "9BE": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXT", "Reaside Clinic", "nhs_RXT64"]]}}}}
