The standard coating material currently used is petrochemical-based polyethylene (PE). Typical laminate packaging contains about 20% of this material. Increased political, legislative and consumer pressure to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel based plastics poses a major challenge for packaging producers to seek sustainably sourced alternative materials that do not harm the environment in their manufacture, exhibit enhanced recyclability and offer similar performance to their conventional plastic counterparts. There is a need to provide producers of coated carton manufacturers with a bio-based material that will enable them to substitute much of the currently used PE coating without compromising the humidity barrier properties of the resulting packaging materials and overcome the current challenge to the recycling of such packaging.\nThis project will build on past research that has revealed that Whey protein coating can replace existing plastic coatings in multilayer packaging and enhance their recyclability. A coating system will be developed based on renewable raw materials derived from agrofood waste and its technological application for extrusion coating cartons to produce packaging materials for both solid and liquid food products. The innovative coating formulations will be based on proteins from whey and potato starch. The resulting laminates will be validated for their suitability to replace the currently used synthetic plastics in a range of carton packaging materials and the improvement of the recycling process whereby the biodegradation of the extruded bio-coating will allow separating more easily the other combined layers will also be proved.

Conventional cooling methods such as air blast (AB), cold room and immersion cooling depend on heat conduction to cool the inside of the joints, but the relatively low thermal conductivity of meat coupled with the necessity to maintain a temperature of the cooling menstrum above 2\u00baC (to avoid surface freezing) makes it difficult to increase the rate of cooling significantly. Vacuum cooling is a rapid evaporative cooling technique for moist and porous products that offers many advantages over conventional cooling methods, such as short processing time, extension of product shelf life and improvement of product quality, safety and nutritional content. However it leads to considerable weight loss and, due to high moisture loss, vacuum cooked meats are slightly less tender, drier and darker. There a need to provide cooked meat producers with an effective rapid cooling method. A novel combined cook\u2013cool technique known as immersion vacuum cooling (IVC) has recently been researched, whereby the vacuum cooling of cooked meat together with some of its cooking solution was explored for its potential use for rapid cooling of water-cooked meat joints. Reduced yield losses and improved quality for cooked pork ham have been reported. This project will build on this past research in order to apply and validate the technique in industry and to plan for the post-project commercial scale up of the IVC system and its subsequent market entry, whereby its uptake will improve the competitiveness of European SMEs from the cooked meats industry.", 219247.0, 1270863.0, 4, 8, "COOL-MEAT", "http://www.coolmeat.eu/", "http://www.foodmc.co.uk", null, "fp7_96088_974516127"], [1385856000000, 1448841600000, "A novel packaging system for meat safety and shelf-life extension", "The Food Machinery Company Limited", "Meat and poultry products are vehicles for millions of cases of foodborne illness globally each year. Controlling pathogens such as campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Yersinia enterocolitica, is a primary goal for industry. Additionally, processors are constantly striving to lengthen product shelf life. However, consumer aversion to traditional chemical preservatives has left processors with less flexibility in choosing preservation methods. This has opened up a technological gap where process innovation is required and a major business opportunity presents itself for the development of a non-thermal, novel food preservation system to control foodborne pathogens associated with meat and poultry.\n\nThis project will develop a continuous in-package decontamination and shelf-life extension system for meat based on Non-thermal plasma (NTP), offering antimicrobial efficacy without the use of chemical sanitizers and which is non-invasive, leaves zero residues and does not adversely affect product quality. Preliminary studies with NPT on meat products, point to rapid inactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms associated with meat, resulting in significant extensions of shelf-life (an additional 5 days). A laboratory test-rig system will be optimised for its antimicrobial efficacy for in-package decontamination of both red and white meats. Shelf life extension, along with organoleptic and nutritional properties of treated meat will be evaluated. The results will then be scaled up to pre-commercial level and validated in the industry paving the way forward for rapid post-project industrialisation.\n\nA critical advantage of this world-first technology for the meat industry is the In-package treatment, which is desired by the food industry as this approach mitigates against recontamination and provides increased shelf-life.", 173518.0, 1169477.0, 5, 9, "MEATPACK", "http://www.meat-pack.eu/", "http://www.foodmc.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/159189.jpg", "fp7_111005_974516127"], [1346457600000, 1409443200000, "Novel microwave-assisted vacuum drying for heat sensitive foods", "The Food Machinery Company Limited", "'Heat sensitive foods and products that possess excellent quality in terms of taste, aroma, texture, and appearance, such as herbs, spices, seafood, etc., pose a major challenge to food driers. Products such as garlic, ginger, spring onions and shrimps are cellular tissues containing gas-filled pores that tend to collapse when subjected to dehydration. This collapse is more noticeable with prolonged exposure to elevated drying temperatures, such as those used in convective drying. For this reason, hot air drying results in substantial degradation in quality attributes such as colour, nutrients and flavour, sever shrinkage also reduces bulk density and dehydration capacity. Also, chemical changes causing loss of flavour and nutrients occur during convective drying so the properties of dehydrated products are poor. A number of drying techniques have been developed over the years, among them atmospheric forced-air dehydration, a very common method. The major disadvantage of the hot air convective drying of food is the low energy efficiency and lengthy drying time during the falling rate period.\n\nMILD-DRY will build on the positive results of laboratory trails using microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MAVD) for the successful dehydration of selected foods, whereby the drying time for carrots for example was reduced to 2 h compared with 4.5-8.5 h in convectional hot air drying. Moreover, dried carrots showed higher rehydration potential, higher beta-carotene and vitamin C contents, lower density, and softer texture than those prepared by air drying. Further research effort will be performed in order to optimise the approach through the intermittent as opposed to continuous application of MW in order to achieve higher energy savings and product quality enhancement.

Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.
