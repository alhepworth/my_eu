Norway is very similar to Scotland when it comes to fishing, climate, and the landscape surrounding the rivers. Norway has larger salmons in the rivers, but is nevertheless not in any way able to compete with Scotland when it comes to salmon fishing tourism.\r\n\r\nWe want to bring our students to Scotland to watch and learn about the ways in which the Scots manage their waterways in order to observe how they facilitate and organise for both the salmon and the fishing. We will also use two of Scotland\u2019s most well-known instructors, Gary Scott and Ian Gordon, as we enter the fly fishing instructor certification program. This certification is unique in that it is the only one to be found in such a course of study in the world, and in order to achieve immediate recognition for our certification in the world of fly fishing we depend on having well-known names associated with our academy. Gary Scott and Ian Gordon will assist in arranging our participation in seminars, conversations, and practical exercises with professionals in relevant areas within tourism and management in relation to salmon fishing in river Spey and river Tay.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 2 years, we wish to bring a total of 37 students and 6 teachers to the areas surrounding the 2 rivers for 2 weeks in spring 2015 and 2016. In the rivers, we will meet ghillies and the local biologists. We will also visit a large hatchery in river Tay.\r\n\r\nIn each of the rivers, the students will gain knowledge about how the entire system surrounding salmon fishing tourism is constructed. We imagine that this project will be the basis for future additional knowledge and competence in several of the students\u2019 subjects during their three-year studies in the sport-fishing academy. The main objective for this project is therefore to learn as much as possible from the Scottish way of meeting the same challenges related to salmon fishing as we see in Norway. This involves, for instance, river management, fishing rules, accommodation and hospitability, and marketing. \r\n\r\nIn the course of this project, the students will, besides the competence we are working to build up, participate in commercialised practical fishing, practice and develop their language skills, and expanded their contact network. Previous experiences from such trips are that the students increase their self-confidence and develop a new attitude towards the challenges we are facing through becoming acquainted with people and cultures previously mostly unknown to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth and social care project:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag we cooperate closely with local companies in education and practical work within the health and social care services. Our wish is that our students also will have the opportunity of gaining international experiences.\r\n\r\nWe wish to strengthen the students\u2019 attitude, approach, and behaviour when the aim is care and user development, regardless of culture, religion, way of life, and functional level.  By travelling to Derry, the students gain insight in and knowledge about the culture, history, and society development in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland and Derry has a unique history that most people have heard about but do not have much insight in and understanding of. We have an intentional agreement with Foyle international school. This school has high competence in facilitating and organising visits and exchanges. Their representatives will be out contact persons and will be able to organise and prepare each of our visits and organise practical matters involved in all visits. Through cooperating with Foyle we will be able to offer our students:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to different kindergartens with different pedagogical approaches\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to a year 1-3 school\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to a municipal mother-child project focusing on early intervention\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to institutions for the functionally disabled / daytime activities for the functionally disabled\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to institutions for dementia / inpatient care institutions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Visits to day care centres for elderly persons\r\n\r\n\u2022 Work experience for 2-3 days in one of the work places we have visited\r\n\r\n\u2022 2-3 days of language learning at Foyle international school focusing on English expressions relevant for health and social care students\r\n\r\n\u2022 Social activities related to culture and history\r\n\r\nFor our school it is an important objective that the students throughout the trip and subject exchange develop thoughts and ideas about internationalisation and the importance of cooperation between European countries. By having such a project running for several years, we wish to increase what our school and we can offer our students and strengthen the school\u2019s position and reputation, as well as increasing the number of applicants to health care studies.", "http://www.speyonline.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO01-KA102-000210_2"]]}}, "5AL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "The joy of sports and healthy living", "St Thomas RC Primary", 68721.0, 6, 6, "Our collaborative project consists of  6 Primary schools. They are from Italy, Finland, Great Britain, Poland, Cyprus and Germany. Our partners include experienced international collaborators and first timers! Together we have many strengths and we are keen to learn from one another.\r\nOur partnership proposal is to promote and explore sports and a healthy lifestyle, including diet, in a variety of European schools and cultures.  This will be achieved by continuous, concurrent activities held in our schools and communities initially over a two year period.  During this project information about sports and healthy living within each country will be researched, tried out, exchanged and evaluated. All of our activities will be as inclusive as possible and we will seek co-operation from teachers, pupils, their families and our local communities. A wide variety of exciting and motivating activities will take place which will facilitate the cross fertilisation of ideas and outcomes. \r\nThe children and staff from the partnership schools will produce fact-files, a logo, an anthem, artwork, a sporty Christmas calendar, videos, PowerPoint presentations, e-mails, a blog, web pages including eTwinning etc, which will be regularly exchanged and shared.\r\nOur project will involve the joint making of; two separate sports\u2019 competitions, learning and teaching workshops, video conferences, interdisciplinary project days, class trips and presentations covering European traditional/heritage sports and games. As a legacy of the project, and to celebrate our achievements, we will create a collaborative, collective permanent artwork/installation in each school. It will illustrate our common understanding of healthy living (including playing sports) and it will remind us, daily, of our team efforts.\r\nThe pupils in each school will learn about traditional/heritage sports games from their families and the wider community. They will try them out and create new games too. The pupils will participate in a variety of different sports competitions. These events will become a regular feature of their school's calendar. Through these activities we aim to develop a deeper and more meaningful cultural understanding and appreciation of similarities and differences within Europe.\r\nLooking at the diverse food, the attitudes to health, sports, the environment and self-awareness within each country, we aim to develop knowledge,understanding and respect of cultural diversity.  Our project will promote the desire amongst learners to master modern foreign languages, ICT skills and basic life skills, such as reading skills, thus enabling our children to develop into active European citizens.  In our project meetings hosted by Italy, Finland, Great Britain and Cyprus we will learn about different countries and their school systems. We also do different things, introduce places and give experiences that will support healthy life style and well being. We will get to know a local food traditions. In our meetings we can exchange ideas and plan and evaluate our activities.\r\nThe project's impact will further deepen through learning activities and joint staff trainings. The learning activities allow Polish and German pupils in particular to have first hand, unforgettable experiences during the planned workshops in Germany and Poland. These pupils will visit sport facilities, build models for a future sports facility, play sports, take part in PE lessons and create two new games together. They will also visit 'the way of fame' for  Olympic medal winners in Cottbus, take part in sports lessons, cook together , create new healthy recipes and try them out. They will take part in a funny Olympics, dance and write a diary about the activities. Another project highlight will be the teaching activity events where all teachers of our partnership meet face to face and work together, do workshops with pupils in the host schools and share and learn pedagogical methods from one another.\r\nWhen not working face to face we will communicate via video conference. Additionally our regularly updated and dynamic blog will ensure all pupils from all partner schools have equal ownership of and participation in the project.  \r\nWe expect this project to be challenging yet hugely rewarding for all. Lifestyles will be improved and cherished. Our European identities will be enhanced and we will undoubtedly form lifelong friendships and develop lifelong skills.\r\nThroughout the two years of the project pupils, teachers and parents will regularly evaluate and report results of our working.", "http://www.stthomasrcprimary.wordpress.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013512_2"]]}}}}
