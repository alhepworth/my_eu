ASF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and on the Italian island of Sardinia. In 2007 the disease was reported in Georgia. Since then it has spread to Russia, Ukraine, Poland and neighbouring countries. In 2017 outbreaks were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania. Wild boar are susceptible to ASFV and facilitate the continuing spread of the disease in Europe with regular spill-over into in-contact domestic pigs. \nThe capripoxvirus Lumpy Skin Disease virus (LSDV) causes a classic systemic poxvirus disease in cattle and spreads rapidly in warm humid conditions, most likely due to insect-borne transmission. LSDV entered Europe, the Balkans and Caucasus for the first time in 2015. The ongoing epidemic has caused the deaths of thousands of cattle through mortality and eradication campaigns. \nASFV and LSDV represent an immediate and serious threat to the pig and cattle industries in Europe and eastern and central Asia. The aim of the consortium is to control the growing LSD and ASF epidemics in Europe and neighbouring countries by understanding the drivers of LSDV and ASFV emergence, and generating research outputs which underpin novel diagnostic tools and vaccines and authenticate appropriate and rapid responses by decision-makers.

However, the Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) capacity in Europe is not sufficient enough to cover the efficient development of diagnosis, prophylactic and therapeutics means against these pathogens. Moreover, there is no global coordination of activities and harmonization of practice in this field. Therefore, the ERINHA project proposes the creation of a top world-class BSL4 research infrastructure that will address the actual European capacity sparseness. The project plans to conduct five main actions which are: (i) Building additional BSL4 areas in several existing BSL4 laboratories, (ii) Building BSL4 laboratories in strategically selected EU countries that are lacking one, (iii) Building a support infrastructure around BSL4 laboratories mainly dedicated to host scientific visitors and staff, (iv) Setting-up the user access to the ERINHA infrastructure, (v) Establishing coordination capacities for efficient dispatching and control of all activities. For 46 months, the ERINHA Preparatory Phase  will focus on (i) Identifying relevant sites in Europe for new BSL4 constructions or major upgrades, (ii) Getting political and financial commitments from National, European or International concerned entities to support construction, (iii) Establishing a secured and validated financial plan for construction, (iv) Defining and implementing an appropriate governance and legal framework, (v) Harmonising  and disseminating common procedures related to L4 biological resources, biosafety and biosecurity management, (iv) Defining and implementing joint training programs to operate in BSL4 facilities, (vii) Identifying the ERINHA\u2019s users and establishing rules for access.

We have chosen drug repurposing as it has the shortest time for clinical validation and translation. Validation of all putatively de novo discovered drug repositionings within the time-frame of this programme would be unrealistic. To improve efficacy and precision, and to adopt our computer simulation parameters and models, we choose a systems medicine based in-silico approach that identifies mechanistically related disease phenotypes and, as a result,  a virtual patient cohort. We then validate this in-silico drug repurposing via high precision clinical trials in patients with cerebro-cardiovascular phenotypes stratified using an exclusive mechanistic biomarker panel. We thus innovate two biomedical product classes, drugs and diagnostics. With this we will establish generally applicable in silico trials for other mechanistically related or defined disease phenotypes, for which size, duration, and risks will be reduced and precision increased. This generates rapid patient benefit, reduces drug development costs as well as risks, and enhances industrial competitiveness. Scientifically, we will contribute to reducing the uncertainty and vagueness of many of our current disease definitions that describe a symptom or apparent phenotype in an organ rather than defining diseases mechanistically as disturbance of self-regulation equilibria of biomolecular processes.
