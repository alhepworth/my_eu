The number 1 priority is to ensure Europe is growing again and employment rates are increasing. \r\nThis top priority and the social, economic and educational situations in the 4 participating countries, inspired us to work together and tackle the problem of early school leavers by keeping them motivated for their future and increase the opportunities for our students as well as other students in Europe to access the European job market.\r\nLocalised in 4 different geographical and cultural contexts, the 4 schools have realised over the last years the fundamental benefit of European cooperation of the students, teachers and the schools themselves. The experience of working together on a specific project not only in virtual space but also meeting each other and to be in different environments and cultures in Europe has proven an essential step in creating European awareness and fostering a sense of European identity and citizenship amongst students and teachers which could not have been achieved otherwise.\r\nThe fundamental objectives of this project are:\r\n1.  To decrease the number of early school leavers and increase the employment rate in Europe by implementing the concept of personalised learning, both by students and teachers, in an international setting. \r\n2) to learn and research in an innovative way, mostly outside the classroom and on locations that are relevant for the different topics during the Student Visits (\u2018Active Learning\u2019). These locations are typical and relevant for the place/country each participating school is located. \r\n3) to produce the \u2018European Backpack\u2019 and \u2018Briefcase,\u2019  for both students and teachers. How the results from the research carried out by students and teachers are created for the \u2018European Backpack\u2019 and \u2018Briefcase,\u2019  is entirely for the students and teachers to choose on the understanding  that it is publicly accessible for example: a film, info graphic or a blog.\r\n \r\nOver two years 100 students and their teachers from different countries will be actively involved in the project, and cooperate with their partners, virtually and during student visits, conducting comparative research and practice related to 4 topics.  Furthermore, many students inside and outside the schools will be part of the project and benefit from its results. \r\nThe topics have been chosen as they are linked to the EU commission\u2019s priorities, they allow a multi-disciplinary approach and are linked to the school's curriculum. Each topic is strongly connected with one of the of the participating schools, its surroundings and its environment. The  student visits in each country, will be concentrated around that topic.  The 4 topics are:\r\n1.  Discrimination and integration (Sweden)\r\n2. Language barriers (UK)\r\n3. Exploring New Horizons: study/ work/ training in Europe (The Netherlands)\r\n4. Coping with social and economic disadvantages (Greece)\r\n \r\nWe will achieve the goals of decreasing the number of early school leavers by keeping the students motivated for their future and increasing employment rates in Europe by an innovative new approach: Active Learning.  \r\nThe European Commission\u2019s investment says on its website about the top priority: \u2018This investment should be targeted towards education, research and innovation\u2019. That is the centre of our approach ensuring the students and teachers own their own learning process by creating personal and specific research questions which focus directly on the theme.  They will work in international teams of 4 people. This is a big step in the concept of personalised learning. (Education)  We aim to challenge tradition learning styles of learning i.e. inside the classroom.  Instead teachers and students will venture out to address their personal research question in different locations focusing on specific features relating to the chosen topic of each country during the student visits. (Research) This way of learning will enable students to contribute to and make a positive impact on the surrounding society and their own ideas for their future prospects. (Innovation) The project will facilitate \u2018Action Learning' aiming to increase practical skills by developing independent learners and implementing the concept of personalised learning with an international group of students aged 15-18yrs and their teachers. \r\nThroughout the duration of the project students and teachers will have created products such as blogs, films and digital posters which contain the results of their research.  All of which will be contained within a 'European Backpack\u2019 for students and a \u2018European Briefcase\u2019 for teachers.

Companies are struggeling to find well educated and skilled workers in the food producing and processing sectors all over Europe.\r\nMany European countries are seen as frontrunner in the agricultural sectors. From all over the world, delegations visit European countries to look at local production techniques and post-harvest techniques and activities. Not only the sector itself is seen as exemplary. The education sectors, or more specifically a functioning vocational education sector is seen as a key precondition to a successfull agricultural sector. Many regions look at Europe for this system.\r\n\r\nobjectives of your project; \r\nThe project partners aim to enhance food production in Europe. Production methods, processing, transport, logistics and trade should become larger and more efficient.

The steering group of Sedu Adult Education set the goals for 2016-2017 for 5 long term adult learner mobilities with the idea of increasing the number up to 20 by the year 2020. Apprenticeship training took even stronger goals by deciding to coordinate a national Erasmus + KA 1 for apprenticeship providers. A new strategy was adopted in January 2016 (attached) in Sedu. It covers the years 2016 to 2020. In the strategy internationality is highlighted and even more visible  than previously. The vision is: Sedu \u2013 local and global forerunner in vocational competence building.  More detailed description of the vision states that \u201c Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks. Four strategic priorities will be the following: student and staff welfare, partnerships and cooperation with the work life, resources and new megatrends. The implementation of the strategical priorities will be defined in action plans to be published by the end of April 2016. International actions are set to be part of priority: partnerships and cooperation with the work life. The feedback received for VET mobility charter application will be adopted as part of the goal setting process for the future international activities. The indicators of international actions will be more focused and more limited in number. Increasing numbers of adult education learner and trainer mobility will be set as one of the priorities as suggested in VET mobility charter feedback. Erasmus+ KA1 instrument allows new way of raising quality in VET by making it possible to bring in international industry lecturers. This will be piloted in the field of agriculture and bioeconomy.New megatrends as priority will also touch the goal setting of international mobility. According to SITRA key megatrends include the global sustainability crisis, the accelerating pace of technological development \u2013 and its impacts on society \u2013 and the intensification of global tensions and everyday interdependence. Naturally, these trends affect the context to which we are training our learners. International mobility allows us to contribute to increasing tolerance of learners and teachers/trainers and by this way lowering tensions between people from different cultures in Europe where the numbers of asylum seekers has risen tremendously.To name one practical example, our partner in Sweden has been a forerunner in educating immigrants from numerous cultural backgrounds. We will be able to offer our teachers and students placements in this school to learn how to see opportunities not only challenges. In latest technological innovations in vocational pedagogics we can even be in a position to share some innovations (Opinlakeus network). Aming other things one of the definitions of the vision: \u201d Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks\u201d will affect implementation of VET Mobility Charter mobilities. To implement the term \u201cboldly\u201d will bring with it even stronger emphasis on teacher/trainer work placements abroad. Longer term staff mobilities will support the competence building of staff which for example will be engaged in education export activities. Until the end of 2016 the present international action plan will be implemented even though at the same time we are preparing for the openings of new strategical priorities.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA116-022378_20"], [2018, "Vleugels II", "North Shropshire College", 119636.0, 10, 11, "With \"Vleugels II\" we build on \"Vleugels I\" of the schoolyear 2017-2018, when we could sent around 50 students abroad. \"Vleugels II\", is not fundamentally different than \"Vleugels I\". \"Vleugels I\" sprang from different KA1 and KA2 projects from the past. The project name \"Vleugels\" (Dutch for 'wings') has a link with most of our directions at school and obviously refers to the international challenge.\r\n\r\nWe would like to apply for 67 student-mobilities and two accompanying teachers for the schoolyear 2018-2019. Since the schoolyear 2017-2018 we try to give the opportunity of a traineeship abroad to all our last year students, before it was only for the students of agriculture. These students are still the biggest group however and we send all our students agriculture. For animal care, horticulture and biotechnics there will be a selection based on the knowledge of English, attitude, level of motivation,... We keep the disadvantaged students in mind and we consult a lot of people in our school during this selection process. We always try to see the bigger picture and then we make our choice as a group. Because we are now also in a network of animal care schools and because we also send out horticulture students we can reach out more to disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nWe can divide our mobilities into three groups:\r\n- Group A: 23 students of agriculture 6TSO/7BSO going for two weeks to the Netherlands or France, a traineeship at a farm.\r\n- Group B: 14 students of horticulture 6TSO/7BSO going for two weeks to Estonia for a forestry traineeship (new since 2017-2018)\r\n- groep C: 30 students 7TSO agriculture + 6TSO/7BSO animal care / biotechnics going for 3-4 weeks on a practical course in the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Austria and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nGroup A: 23 students agriculture will do a traineeship of two weeks in France or the Netherlands. These students will be put to work on an agricultural company in the Netherlands or France; The countries are very diverse concerning language and culture, but also in the field of agriculture. According to the choice of the student he or she will be sent to a specialized or a mixed agricultural company. The most common branches on the agricultural companies are cattle, pigs, arable farming and/or vegetables. The 'family' character of the companies is something we find really important. This way the students mostly find themselves in a guest family and they experience other customs, socially and culturally. The weekend is the appropriate time to have cultural excursions with the guest family. We are in different countries/regions because each region has its own agricultural specialties. The Netherlands are well known for their pig companies and Normandy is known for cattle and arable farming. The weekend just before the traineeship the students together visit the region where they will be staying (with two accompanying teachers). There is a weekend program with cultural and agricultural visits. Sunday evening the students are all at their working placements and the actual traineeship can start. All students will be visited during their trainee period and will be picked up by the teacher at the end of the period.\r\n\r\nGroup B: 14 students will go for two weeks on a forestry traineeship in Estonia. For this we work together with a in Estonia. The students stay in a school and get practical training in forestry and gardening. During this traineeship two teachers will guide the students permanently and arrange the city trips and national park visits during the weekends. \r\n\r\nGroup C: 30 students will go on a traineeship for 3 to 4 weeks with the choice of different countries and topics. It are all practical, innovative courses with visits, practice, workplace learning,... For this we work together with now more then 10 European agricultural schools, and this in an official KA-2 network. The principle: every school can send 2-3 students to a certain course and like this international groups of about 10 students are formed. VABI has with this network the possibility to choose from a wide range of topics, and this for all our directions: e.g.: sled dogs in Sweden, dairy in Denmark, agro-marketing in the Netherlands. At the same time VABI hosts an international group of students.\r\n\r\nWith these three groups we provide a big part of our final year students with a lot of choice and wonderful experiences. We have a very large network of agricultural schools on which we can count and that have years of Erasmus+ experience. With \"Vleugels II\" we can, compared to \"Vleugels I\", offer a beautiful international experience to even more students.  \r\n\r\nThis is possible in VABI because there is a team of about ten teachers that work intensively to realize the project and more teachers that want to support when necessary.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA116-046784_6"], [2015, "South Ostrobothnia Works", "North Shropshire College", 115208.0, 17, 25, "South Ostrobothnia is a region in progress  what comes to internationalisation.

Some of the network VET-providers are nearly newcomers in international mobility, some are experienced . In this network knowledge and partnerships are shared for the good of the whole region. \r\n\r\nThe coordinator organisation Sein\u00e4joki Joint Municipal Authority for Education (Sedu) has succesfully carried out several mobility projects and has developed ECVET tools and processes for years.

The project meets its goals, if each network school offers ECVET mobilities in 2017 and has developed processes of learning outcomes based education further. \r\n\r\nThere will be an opportunity for 140 students from the network of South Ostrobothian  vocational education and training providers for on-the-job learning abroad and for 44 staff members an opportunity to develop their skills in working life oriented and learning outcome based education through SOWorks project in 2015 - 2017.   The mobility periods will be carried out in the following partner countries: Austria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and UK.

The staff members participating in the exchanges have been mapped out  during January-February 2015 by a survey in each participating school. Personal development discussions have supported the process. The students applying for the period abroad might have special needs. This is taken into consideration when preparing for the placement abroad as well as regarding the tutoring and guidance during the placement. The students of preparatory vocational programme will be accompanied by a teacher for the whole period. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods of the students have been agreed in general level together with international partners and in most cases the cooperation with different qualifications has been formalized in the form of Memorandum or Understanding. The Learning Agreement (LA) sets out the conditions for the mobility period of an individual learner. In staff mobilities the goals of the visit have been discussed during the survey in January-February 2015 and they were communicated to receiving partners. The mobility periods of the staff are tailor made to the needs of the qualification or the developing aspect of the education provision specially named. The topics of the staff exchanges vary, being for example developing the working life connection of the education (work placement in a company), strengthening the validation and recognition of learning and learning outcomes based approach,  administrational development (quality assurance),  job-shadowing of teaching methods, entrepreneurship or international work in general. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the project we are aiming at  the education witch better meets the needs of the individual and working life through strengthening learning outcome approach to education.
