In many European countries including Britain, there is a sense that young people are disengaging with the political process. Young adults are less likely to vote, there is a lowering of the registration to vote in some countries and movements are growing to encourage young people to abstain rather than engage.  If left to continue, this lack of engagement has the potential to destabilise countries.  In the current political climate, therefore, there is  a clear imperative to  tackle this problem to ensure young people see the importance of participation in the political process and are able to use their voice positively and become active citizens.\r\nThe six project partners will all be working with a range of other partners locally, regionally and in later stages of the project, also nationally and transnationally, meaning that there will be a very large number of indirect participants due to the multiplier effect planned into the project.\r\nThe SPACE Award is a student citizenship package that aims to develop young people's understanding of democratic processes. It offers an accessible framework for student councils and committees from which young people can learn how to create and build an effective student council.   This project aims:\r\n\u2022 To promote young people\u2019s active participation and understanding of the democratic process \r\n\u2022 To develop effective student councils.\r\n\u2022 To embed young people's understanding of council roles and responsibilities \r\n\u2022 To enable young people to articulate their own point of view and understand others\u2019 points of view\r\n\u2022 To promote understanding and respect \r\n\u2022 To develop student leadership\r\n\u2022 To give young people an understanding of their place in the world as a member of their own country and as a European citizen\r\n\u2022 To develop transferable skills to prepare young people for the work place \r\nThe project will develop a set of criteria to allow students to develop  a range of skills over time. The criteria builds from Bronze, to Silver  to Gold so that students can refine and develop their skills. The criteria builds from basic skills in terms of running and leading a student council to more far reaching skills that include the local community and beyond.   Once Gold is achieved students can then train to be assessors of other schools and colleges working towards their Award. This allows for a roll out of the Award to partner schools and encourages links between schools as well as links with International Partner schools. The Award will develop student leadership skills. As more schools achieve the Gold Award, Award ceremony events will take place to further promote the Award.  Assessments would be undertaken again after three years to ensure that students continued to monitor and evaluate their practice and to allow for a change in student membership as well as ensuring sustainability. There is also potential for a Platinum Award at a later stage of development.\r\nThe SPACE Award is a complete package with interactive tools that can be utilised by schools and colleges and tailored to individual organisations; for example, all materials will be written in the home language.  Materials will be reproduceable and can be shared with other colleagues.\r\n  Schools will develop effective student councils\r\n\u2022 Students will be empowered to lead their own councils \r\n\u2022 Students will be supported to deliver training to partner schools/colleges/institutions on the programme\r\n\u2022 Students will be trained as assessors for other schools/colleges/institutions\r\n\u2022 A set of measurable common criteria will be used to measure and recognise the work of effective student councils. \r\n\u2022 Students will have a greater understanding of the democratic process and how to actively engage to effect change\r\n\u2022 Students will develop their leadership skills and acquire \r\nThe Award is closely linked to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and meets the requirement to inform all children of these rights.", "http://www.alecreedacademy.co.uk", "Callington Community College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013852_1"]]}}, "6HL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Acting for civic involvement", "Universal Emergency Relief", 29796.0, 2, 2, "Acting for civic involvement it's a bilateral youth exchange involving 60 participants, 50 young people aged 18-25 and 10 group leaders from England and Romania which will take place in Marabu Camp in Romania between 10 and 20 August 2018.\r\n\r\nAim and objectives:\r\nThe aim of this project is to strengthen young participants to become active citizens in the countries they live in no mater their economical situation, religion, color of skin or others specificity's which define their identity\r\n\r\nThe main objectives: \r\n1. to increase the knowledge for 50 participants about identity \r\n2. increasing the civic involvement and  sense of initiative for 50 young people \r\n3. to develop the self esteem for 50 young people from Romania and England\r\n4.to develop the skills and competences of 50 participants about oratory, rhetoric and theater,\r\n5. to develop the  cooperation between youth NGOs from Romania and England\r\n\r\nIn this project we will have 3 big activities:\r\n1.

Implementation of the project\r\nThe youth exchange will take place in Romania and will have the same aim and objectives like the project. The activities were decided together with the young people to respond to their needs and fulfill the objectives of the project. The methodology will be based on non formal education. You  can see a more detailed program attached.\r\n\r\n3.
