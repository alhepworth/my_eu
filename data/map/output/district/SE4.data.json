Ultimately the project aims to contribute towards improved skills amongst trainee and new chefs, in conjunction with college and work based learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditional methods of delivering vocational qualifications are no longer fit for purpose, they lack flexibility and currency and do not match the needs of learners or the requirements of employers. Students who struggle to understand things first time do not always grasp the principles from practical lessons. Limited time in teaching kitchens (in schools/colleges or work placements) mean that it is very difficult to catch up. Groups often have a wide range of abilities and less able students do not always want to highlight that they have not understood, this is sometimes not captured until assessment stage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNACKS\u2019 aim is to support vocational trainees in the areas of Hospitality, specifically trainee chefs. It will do this by creating online video resources to supplement their main course along with built in opportunities for learners to earn Open Badges as recognition of their subject knowledge.  An Open Badge is a digital reward which can be stored inside a student's \u2018digital backpack' and used to supplement their qualifications when applying for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first phase, partners will design the structure of resources, including a range of core skills which are common to all trainee chefs and some local speciality dishes from each partner country. We will then create the first 30 resources and pilot them with trainees to inform the final product and review the remaining planned resources to ensure that they are still the most appropriate in light of feedback from the pilot. In total we will create at least 100 short video resources and accompanying activities such as quizzes. Trainees can complete activities to receive Open Badges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lends itself particularly well to a transnational project as core kitchen skills, especially preparatory skills, are international, as are the pressures in a commercial kitchen to produce consistent, high quality food to tight deadlines. The additional resources, including local specialities, will also have international appeal either as familiar or new dishes. For example, English cakes, Italian pasta and Turkish kebabs are already known in most countries, although young chefs might not yet know how to make them, and other dishes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNACKS will target professional trainees, allowing them to fit their studies around their work and family commitments and to learn at their own pace.  The resources will be focused on the commercial environment and be available for learners to remind themselves of lessons already learnt in class or catch up on missed sessions. We expect at least 500 trainees to use the resources, although they will not be formal project participants. The actual number of participants will be approximately 50 students (attending project meetings, testing resources and providing feedback and assisting with videos, eg as chefs\u2019 assistants) and 40 staff form the four partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three vocational schools offer an alternative form of education to the traditional academic route. Several of our trainees come from disadvantaged backgrounds and often do not live with their parents, either because of geography (in the case of Didim) or because of family circumstances, for example they are in the care of the state or their parents live abroad. We have found that there is a particularly high incidence of learning difficulties such as dyslexia amongst chefs and many also benefit from additional support with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan to hold four project meetings - a kick off meeting in London followed by one meeting at each partner school. Interim meetings will take place using Skype. The project working language is English, as this is learned by students at all three vocational schools, although resources will be created in other languages too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll resources will be Open Access, so trainees have full flexibility about how and where to use them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrainers will have a bank of materials produced by subject specialists to supplement classroom delivery, with the option to use them as part of their revision programmes or simply allow trainees to use them on an ad hoc basis.

It is a problem of pandemic proportions. Any moment, in any country of the world, a woman is victim of any kind of violence: rape, sexual assault, murder, stalking, genital mutilation and so on, being each form of abuse strictly related to the social and cultural context in which it is produced. We want to carry out transnationally such a project both for the overall scale of the phenomenon and for ceating a front unit in the prevention. We need that young people from each country involved in this partnership can learn to defend and respect human rights and gender balance because the silence is a guilt, it would be acceptation or resignation of daily crimes.  The project would like to pursue the following objectives: to enhance the quality and European dimension of teaching/learning process; to promote language learning and linguistic diversity; to improve the competences in foreign language communication skills for both pupils and teachers; to explore new possibilities by the use of ICT in learning, developing innovation and creativity at school; to compare the different systems of education; to promote equity and active citizenship; to educate young people to respect themselves and the others; to improve the knowledge of international institutions aimed at defending human rights.\r\nAll these objectives have been calibrated according to the target goups to be addressed (students from 14 to 19 years old) and their needs as well as the achievement of horizontal goals like developing appropriate assessment and certification methods and reducing disparities in learning outcomes affecting learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover, there will be a solution of continuity with the eTwinning project \"Stop violence against women\",  that will be done in parallel, involving all the members of this partnership. Symbolically, the white rose represents the woman and embodies her beauty and fragility at the same time. It will be the emblem of our awareness and prevention campaign. This partnership is composed by seven partner organisations, selected  after a long search via e-twinning platform according to their background ,  experiences and deep interest towards the main topic because of the high level of violence/abuse of women in their own countries. The selection tried to respect also a proper distribution of European areas so that,  as tiles of a mosaic, all  the countries  partecipating can compose a global vision of the problem in Europe . Project results and all outcomes / materials will be uploaded on the twinspace and the project website.

Beyond this direct participation, other people (hundreds for each country partner) will benefit from the programme indirectly.  Specifically, in a systemic way, the results will affect not only the entire workforce of our schools, i.e. all students and the whole teachers and staff, but also  will reach the wider local social context thanks to the  dissemination of the outcomes. Consequently a strong impact will be expected at a local level but also at a regional, national and European one. The results will be visible both in learning new competences and in acquiring new attitudes (awareness and struggle for human rights). This impact will be emphasized by local press and schools websites, while the eTwinning network of ambassadors will amplify the effects of changes  also at the regional level running meetings in the schools and regional events. The partecipation to seminars ,conferences or competions will ensure the effects nationally and  some echoes internationally thanks to eTwinning platform, bolgs, websites, social networks.

Based on the idea that the tourism industry is not only a major source of income, but  also harness potential dangers, such as social dislocation, loss of cultural heritage and ecological degradation, we found each in other in wanting to work together with our students on learning how to appreciate and protect our region, finding innovative ways of dealing with entrepreneurship in tourism and at the same aiming for a reduction of our ecological footprint by joining the ECO-schools and aiming for the Green Flag award after completion of our project.\r\n\r\nEach partner school will directly involve 60 to 70 students aged 16-18 years. These pupils will come from different backgrounds: some from middle class families, some from lower social status ones, some live in large towns, deprived areas or minority ethnic groups, others are from rural areas. With this project, we aim developing in them an environmental conscience and an understanding of their cultural heritage, in order to start innovating in a protective and respectful way. We want to instil in them the first seeds of green entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe main activities consist out of analysing students', their family's and staff's typical way of travelling, comparing traditional tourism to newer kinds, field trips, workshops, group works, seminars and surveys regarding environmental and cultural sustainability in tourism, short internships or job shadowing in hotels or agencies. Moreover, they will set up business simulation working with national tourism offices, local partners and municipal services in order to have or work in real-life experiences on which they will report through videos and interviews, next to the standard evaluations. Ultimately, all of the research will be presented on our \"Virtual Travel Agency\", a website showing our results, but also a manual for others who are aiming at travelling and living in a more sustainable fashion.\r\n\r\nStudents involved will establish personal contacts with pupils from other countries inducing in them the feelings of mutual respect and facilitating the elimination of prejudices. Having contact with other cultures, they will gain knowledge both about their national cultures and those of the partners, and will find similarities that unite them and differences that enrich them.     \r\n\r\nThe project period will be interspersed with interdisciplinary activities carried out in different fields (science, geography, history, citizenship, law, ICT, and foreign languages).

They are confused about their identity and where they belong to. They can make sudden and wrong decisions and may be affected easily by media or people around them. Therefore, adolescence is a very crucial period of each human where a lasting guidance is much-needed to offer support. Role models are a kind of instrument in developing career aspirations, educational goals or comprehensive abilities to overcome obstacles and contribute one's personal efforts for a sober community. However, they also motivate youths towards disrespectful behaviour like bullying, substance abuse, joining illegal groups, leaving school early or absenteeism. In some cases pupils are even influenced by leaders of malicious and illegal groups hurting both themselves and other people with their actions in order to prove themselves. Undoubtedly, terrorist activities in recent years have made the urgence to work on the topic of this project obvious. It has become clear to everyone that democracy is a goal to strive for in unison, it is an ideal a community has to spend efforts for to reach.In order to achieve this goal, we will raise awareness of the value of the world peace and democracy by introducing the students some historic(al) individuals who were peaceful, supported democracy and the world peace, devoted their lives for these ideals and thus made their names written in the history books because of their virtues. Our aim is a young generation who are against war, away from terrorism, supporting the world peace, being open-minded, understanding and respectful to the other people.The European youth has often grown up with the feeling of animosity against other nations. Being six partner schools we can critically reflect on the phenomena of tolerance, world peace, human rights, democracy, friendship or identifying with EU-citizenship in our societies. Under the guidance of role models with social and cultural sharings in combination with the art of theatre and music \u2013 which are anyway universal and far-reaching means to bring different cultures together \u2013 we can support the students ideally.In accordance, each partner school will select role models who devoted their lives to these ideals. The participants will prepare theatre plays about these people and send one episode to each partner. The students will act out the plays assisted by their teachers. Beside the theatre plays, in each school, student choirs will be formed. They will sing peace songs. Thus, all the participants in the project will coalesce to achieve the common objectives. Some students taking part in the project might have severe problems in recognizing the importance of a sober education and who even might face early school leaving. By giving them responsibility, we will raise their self-confidence and support them to contribute to the world peace. The young will open gates through intercultural dialogue and transnational cooperation. Our partnership consists of teachers who participated in Erasmus+ seminars, who did some project management in their own countries, who are altogether experienced, dedicated, highly motivated and gifted supporters of teamwork. The key persons have known each other from eTwinning portals and have been in touch to exchange opinions via modern media.The six schools intend to reinforce cooperation between schools, families and community for a safer and more peaceful world promoting exemplary role models to decrease students' misbehaviour issues in schools, to prevent them from illegal groups and violence, but also to increase their inner attitude of being citizens of the European Union who support human rights, who perceive world peace a key prerequisite to prevent terrorism, besides the importance of academic engagement to become resilient citizens ready for the challenges of the 21st century.A detailed dissemination has been planned to promote the objectives of the project. The students will put out all the performances on the stage. Students, families, teachers, city repesentatives and regional media will be invited to the performances. All the documents produced will be published on project websites, Facebook, Youtube channels and eTwinning platforms. Monitoring and evaluation is very important to create quality documents, too. An external evaluator will also contribute to an effective evaluation process. With such an innovative approach many people will be welcomed to join and discover new facets of European co-operation.

This applies especially to the large group of students at each of our schools who have a migrational background to a lesser or greater degree. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, we are convinced that making these very personal stories of migration known to a larger public will make it easier for them, especially the young refugees who have come to our countries in recent years to find a home at our schools and in our local communities, as they will realize how diverse European culture already is.

In school year 2016/2017 we are expecting the reorganization of two schools - RCCS and Janis Rozentals Art Highschool into vocational education competence center, that also means the need for adaptation to the new situation.The objectives of the project are:* finding new international professional and personal contacts,* improving adaptation and communication skills for individual participants of the exchanges,* improving the level of spoken English and the knowledge of professional terminology,* for students - improving the general attitude towards learning,* for teachers and staff - searching for new teaching/learning methods, analyzing interdisciplinary educational programs we could develop and invent in our professional education competence center.During two school years 16 students and 8 staff members of RCCS will participate in international mobilities. Partner schools of the project are:* Rijn IJssel (The Netherlands)* Kainuu Vocational College  (Finland)* Conservatory of music and ballet Ljubljana (Slovenia)* Neue Jazzschool M\u00fcnchen e.V.  (Germany)* Lewisham Southwark College (United Kingdom)* Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 College (Finland)In the project we plan three types of activities: student, teacher and staff mobility. Student mobility includes attending music lessons, rehearsing together with partner school students in school collectives (choir, orchestra, big band, jazz combo etc.), learning new music repertoire and performing in a concert, in that way collecting training lessons. Teachers will have both - teaching and training assignments in partner schools. In the beginning they will have to watch their lessons in specialty and learn new teaching methods, later - they'll have to host lessons/workshops/seminars by themselves. Staff members will learn from the experience of Finnish colleagues about managing international longterm educational projects. Both teachers and staff will have to find out about partner school experience about interdisciplinary educational program development, so we could integrate such in our vocational education competence center.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project will include setting individual goals for the exchange period together with career consultant, actively participating in the lessons, cooperating in rehearsals and concerts, hosting lessons, workshops and/or seminars, presenting project results for other colleagues - students or teachers, school administration, expressing the ideas and the experience orally and in written form.As the result from this ERASMUS+ project we expect that the participants will obtain new professional and personal contacts, their English language  and communication skills as well as the results of State English exam will improve. The work in lesson will improve because of new integrated methods. In next school years there will be several new interdisciplinary (art and music) education programs in our vocational education competence center. One more important point would be the variety of the music repertoire including different European traditional and popular music pieces students and teachers will have been taken home from exchanges. As a result of the project all the participants will have better management skills - starting from surviving in international environment, and ending with experience in managing other international cooperation projects.In longer term we predict that Riga Cathedral Choir School and Janis Rozentals Art Highschool together will turn into creative, modern and innovative educational institute and it will become even more attractive to its potential students. The number of students coming to entrance exams will increase and school and its students will strengthen their competitiveness not only at state, but also international level.", "http://www.lesoco.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LV01-KA102-022517_5"], [2014, "Europ\u00e4ische Ausbildungskooperationen auf den Spuren von Robert Schuman", "Lewisham Southwark College", 36911.0, 3, 3, "A student exchange may not become a privilege of the educational elite. What our school, the vocational college BBS1 \u2013 Mainz, strives to foster in future is the mobility to other European countries of those who do an apprenticeship in which our school is involved. In former LdV-mobility projects we successfully sent our students from the hospitality department to a partner school in London/Great Britain and students from our department of electricity to Racib\u00f3rz/Poland. \r\n\r\nWe are especially proud to have reached the following aims, \r\n\r\n- support for students who do their apprenticeships in small companies\r\n\r\n- assistance and furtherance of socially and economically disadvantaged young people \r\n\r\nToday as Europeans we feel it to be our vocation to participate in the European movement towards greater mutual understanding and closeness. With our application under the title \u2018European cooperation in vocational qualification following the footsteps of Robert Schuman\u2019 we would like to contribute to an enhanced cooperation of schools in Europe with respect to professional, cultural and socially integrating contents. The following quote by R. Schuman as one of several founding fathers of the European Union explicitly points out our intention:\r\n\r\n\u2018You are not a real European by birth but by education.\u2019\r\n\r\nFurthermore we would like to confront our young apprentices of both departments within 40 flows and a project duration of 24 month with the following aspects:\r\n\r\n- gaining insights into their trade in the host country\r\n\r\n- mastering everyday life in a foreign country\r\n\r\n- encountering a new society with empathy and tolerance whether at the workplace, in shops, in their free time, at the partner school or in the public in general\r\n\r\n- successful active communication in a modern foreign language\r\n\r\n- getting to know foreign cultures, customs and ways of behaving in general\r\n\r\n- active cooperation in forming the partnership of the companies and schools involved in the exchange\r\n\r\nOur newly planned project including the departments of hospitality and electricity and involving our school as a whole pursues the following general aim: \u2018Support for disadvantaged young apprentices preferably with a migration background.\u2019\r\n\r\nSubject-related practical cooperation in vocational qualification on an international and intercultural level represents an integral part of the quality of vocational education in Germany and in Europe as a whole. Together with our partners we would like to further Europe-wide cooperation in vocational education as we see this as a chance for a united Europe which comprises ever so different cultures and languages.

It is the united Europe which is a symbol of the all-encompassing solidarity of the future.\u2019", "http://www.lesoco.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000307_1"], [2016, "musician - a profession withouth borders:  Internationale Kompetenzen in der Berufsausbildung f\u00fcr Jazz und Popularmusik (Sekundarstufe II)", "NCG t/a Lewisham Southwark College", 17296.0, 6, 7, "Education at Bavarian secondary vocational schools of music is too much focused on the requirements of the local job market. Therefore the nonprofit association Neue Jazzschool M\u00fcnchen e.V. wants to turn the attention of its secondary vocational school of Rock, Pop and Jazz more to international job market demands. With the help of the mobility project \u201cmusician \u2013 a profession without borders\u201d  the Munich institution will have the chance to get to know different concepts, training methods and learning aids of other European secondary vocational schools of music. On the basis of this knowledge the association will identify, if and how its vocational education has to be supplemented and/or upgraded.   The exchange program encourages students to acquire cross cultural skills, to improve their specific English terminology and to prepare them to work with international colleagues. They will also establish first international contacts for their own artistic work. The challenge of staying abroad will further the personal development of the students and teachers involved in the project. By getting to know other approaches the participants will broaden their artistic and intellectual horizon. Teachers gain more expertise and educational competence.The mobility project will also favour the cooperation with other European secondary vocational schools of music and thus create prospective mutual educational standards. In this way European musical apprenticeship on secondary educational level can become more comparable.For each mobility action Neue Jazzschool M\u00fcnchen e.V. chooses two students of their second and third grade whose school performances justify their participation.  Because these have to catch up with the missed subjects taught during their stay abroad. In addition the head of school chooses one teacher for each mobility action who\u2019s interested in getting to know new educational methods and is willing to realize them at the Munich institute. These are the planned activities of the attending students during their stay at the partner organizations: attendance at ensemble rehearsals, attendance at practical and theoretical musical subjects, directing a choir or an ensemble in English during a lesson, preparing a gig with the school ensemble, getting to know the musical scene in the partner country by visiting concerts and jam sessions in the respective musical clubs.These are the planned activities of the teachers during their stay at the partner organizations: attending classes of their partner teachers, directing of choir and ensemble rehearsals with own arrangements and compositions, teaching the practical and theoretical subjects of the partner teacher, communication and exchange of educational matters with the teachers of the partner organization, analyzing and comparing the individual curricula.The project language will be English. In accordance with the partner organizations   the learning targets and the necessary activities of the attendees will be agreed on in writing. Mutual training project will be discussed before and agreed on in writing with the partners.The attending teacher will work together with the partner teachers in groups.  In the partner country the educational project leader will take care of the attendees. He or she will inform Neue Jazzschool  M\u00fcnchen  e.V. of any actions and achieved   improvements .  The attending students and teachers will also send emails to their Munich school reporting briefly on their experiences made. If possible video clips and sound recordings of the gathered musical creations will be made.In the long term the project may help to establish more professional networks and more communication between European secondary vocational schools of music. In the consequence new mutual educational standards will be generated and the experiences may help to design the prospective training profile on the Bavarian vocational schools of music.", "http://www.lesoco.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003015_3"]]}}, "2ED": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "arTABOO", "ARTmongers", 21004.0, 4, 4, "The youth exchange ARTaboo takes place June 11th to 18th in Sant Boi de Llobregat.
