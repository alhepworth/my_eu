It underpins many national curricula and guidelines but, on closer inspection, has different interpretations - to respond to the children's needs and interests, to support their development, to offer them children choice and agency \u2013 which reflect the context and history of ECEC services.\r\n\r\nThere are potential tensions between the different interpretations of 'child-centredness' and what these mean for the support of children with different needs or from diverse backgrounds. Questions arise as to how, in reality, ALL children can be at the centre of pedagogical practice, how ALL children\u2019s developmental needs can be supported and whether democratic approaches can be combined with a focus on tracking individuals' progress against developmental milestones. Furthermore, in supporting the needs of children from communities towards the margins of society, there are strong arguments against adopting an approach centred exclusively on the child\u2019s own interests or cultural background in favour of an approach that offers child and family a bridge between their home community and the mainstream society.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate \u2018child-centredness\u2019 as a component of high quality ECEC to support children\u2019s development, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. Through taking part in specially designed training modules, practitioners from a wide range of early childhood contexts will develop awareness of the different facets of child-centredness. The aim for these modules is to enable participants to develop greater confidence in their own capacity to address the individual needs, rights and interests of diverse learners, while working within national curricula and guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe project will start with analysis of existing academic literature and examples of practice of child-centred approaches to supporting diverse learners in six countries:  - Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK \u2013 with different structures, histories and approaches to ECEC.  The analysis will inform an assessment of training needs, which in turn will lead to the development of innovative approaches to extend and develop educators\u2019 child-centred competences.  This will include transnational online modules, webinars and video capture of workshops, supported by a toolkit of resources offering advice and guidance on supporting diversity and child-centred practice.  Questionnaires and reflective writing tasks will both evaluate  the success of the modules while probing practitioners'  understandings of child-centred practice and what these might mean in practice. Evaluation of the modules will also explore the effect of the training on both the quality of ECEC and the effectiveness of support for children with diverse needs. It is anticipated that the findings from the module evaluation will be pivotal for informing future European Commission recommendations on the provision of ECEC services, building on the existing ECEC Quality Framework. Finally a Manual of Good Practice will draw on all stages of the project and provide an easily accessible document that offers both interpretations of child-centred practice and examples from practice. The manual will include activities and guides to support the wider ECEC community to consider their own understandings of child-centred practice and how it relates to their views on quality ECEC and supporting diverse groups of children.\r\n\r\nProject findings will be shared through presentations at academic and professional conferences and publication in journal and professional magazines. The modules will be freely available as open access educational resources with potential longer term benefits. Through taking part in the project, practitioners will have opportunities to engage with learning materials developed in different contexts, prompting them to reflect more deeply on their own practice through making the familiar strange and the strange familiar. This will help them to develop their understanding of the underlying complexity of the familiar term 'child-centred' and to engage with inclusion as systemic, transformative process creating learning  environments that can better respond to the needs of all learners.", "http://camborne-nursery.cornwall.sch.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036798_7"]]}}, "8DJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Crofty Academy Trust Language Partnership", "Crofty Multi-Academy Trust", 57218.0, 2, 4, "This project has been formed and developed using the framework from a school based project from Treloweth CP School (lead school in the consortium) in the last academic year. The original project allowed staff to attend a language school to develop their own language acquisition of Spanish and then later in the year return to observe how languages are taught across the curriculum in Spain. During this project, the school staff suggested that more teachers and staff need to visit each school to establish the partnership further across the cluster and to utilise the skills and resources that the seven schools have. This would allow the children in both schools to communicate with others in a different country and learn about the similarities and differences in culture but also to learn Spanish or English (speaking, reading and writing) though a native speaker. One of the ways to encourage and embed languages that was observed in a previous project was teaching language in a cross curricular approach. By observing these practices, staff will be able to see how we can enhance our language skills across the curriculum not just in Spanish alone. This was such a drive in both schools that the part of the project where teachers job shadow each other was established. \r\nThe first part of this project is to enhance and strengthen the staff in the learning cluster's Spanish linguistic skills. This is due to Modern Foreign Languages being compulsory for children in Key Stage 2 in England in the 2014 National Curriculum. As a cluster, it is a priority for us to develop and enhance our staff's linguistic capabilities to ensure the children in our care receive the level of Spanish that the Department for Education has set out. \r\nFrom this background, the objectives for the project were set out in co-operation across the learning cluster: \r\n- to develop staff knowledge and confidence in speaking and teaching Spanish across KS2\r\n- to develop understanding of Spanish culture to develop cross-curricular links\r\n- to develop children's knowledge and understanding of 'real' Spanish language and pronunciation\r\n- to explore Spanish being taught in different subject areas (CLIL)\r\n- to compare and evaluate teaching methods in both countries to inspire and develop the delivery of languages in all schools involved\r\n- to create links between the schools visited to allow children to learn from each other (culturally and linguistically)\r\nAs part of this project, four participants from each cluster school will be attending a week long intensive language course in Salamanca to enhance their knowledge of Spanish and to use in context. The participants are responsible for teaching Spanish to Key Stage 2 in their respective schools and have a varying degree of linguistic knowledge. By attending this course, the level of language will be increased and the quality of Spanish taught to the children will be improved. \r\nIn the second part of the project, four participants from each school will be visiting a group of schools in Salamanca to take part in a job shadowing exercise to experience English being taught under the CLIL initiative. By doing this, the participants will be able to evaluate and reflect on how they can use Spanish in all areas of the curriculum and not just as a stand alone subject.\r\nThe impact of this project will not just be for the participants alone. There are many benefits that both schools will receive from working together and spending time face to face in each others' teaching environments.\r\nIn terms of the participants, we expect each participant to have increased linguistic competence and confidence in delivering Spanish to the children in their care. The language course will have provided native pronunciation and grammatical skills that they will be able to use to progress the children's language skills further. This will include modelling and reading short pieces of writing.\r\nIn terms of the children, we expect them to have energy and enthusiasm passed on through the participants experiences. Their own linguistic skills will be increased and they will be challenged to apply these skills in terms of reading and writing. The children will also have a wider knowledge of Spanish and European culture through joint projects and exchanges of work and letters between the children at both schools. \r\nIn terms of the English and Spanish schools as a whole, the staff will be in regular contact. This will allow a wider breadth of ideas and resources to be accessed not just restricted to the acquisition of language. A more cross-curricular approach to language teaching will be understood through this project and Spanish will be used in different subjects using CLIL as an excellent example of practice to follow. By carrying out this project, both sets of schools will strengthen their partnership enabling them to go forward and plan more experiences but ultimately this project will benefit the children by uniting them through language.", "https://www.croftylearningtrust.org.uk/", "Crofty Multi-Academy Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035585_coordinator"]]}}}}
