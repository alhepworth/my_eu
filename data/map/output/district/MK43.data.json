This novel coating will be able to contribute to the stiffness and rigidity of an elastic metallic structure, to withstand the expected loading conditions safely, to enhance the integrity of a damaged structure and at the same time to protect it from corrosion. Such coating can bring multiple breakthroughs from the design level to the maintenance and repair level of the structure. The innovative compounds of the proposed coating are elements of smart materials - Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). SMA elements are designed materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli. They can sense temperatures or stress as a function of change in damping, stiffness, electrical resistivity and deflection. It is specifically the latter aspect, which makes SMAs highly interesting for the particular application, since it is the actuation function built into the material. The innovative concept of the coating is described briefly as follows: upon mechanical loading the structure and hence the coating are deformed together as a system. However, by heating the coating, the SMA elements tend to recover their experienced deformations and return to their original shape. At this point, shear forces will be developed to the interface between coating and structure. The developed shear forces are expected to mitigate the deformation of the structure and reduce the level of the stress field. The latter is a great benefit for the regions, where cracks exist, since the local reduction of the stress field will delay the crack propagation and hence the structural failure.

The UTM infrastructure will also benefit from the GAUSS Galileo-EGNOS based ADS-B solution and encrypted air-ground communications.

Due to versatile usability both devices also offer aerodynamic benefits by shape adaption in cruise flight.   Morphing devices imply the integration of drive systems into tailored lightweight structures and therefore reduce complexity and mass. Furthermore, focussing on electric actuators the energy consumption can be reduced. However, the high elasticity required for efficient adaptability of the morphing structure is diametrically opposed to the structural targets of conventional wing design like stiffness and strength.

Health professionals and their organisations often find themselves in a unique position to prevent or reduce violence and to promote peace. Since 2004, the European Medical Peace Work Partnership has developed training material on peace issues for health professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011, seven Medical Peace Work (MPW) online courses were launched as a self-study option for health professionals. The courses, as well as a web-based resource centre for medical teachers and trainers, are available free of charge at www.medicalpeacework.org. By now, nearly 7.000 users have created an account at the online learning platform, and more than 730 certificates have been issued. The courses are accredited by the Norwegian Medical Association as standalone CME-credited courses (continuous medical education). They have also been applied in medical and health science education at various teaching institutions across Europe. \r\n\r\nFeedback has revealed that self-running online courses require a high level of self-discipline on the part of the students. Albeit a variety of online discussion solutions, individual online students also report a lack of peer contact, which is important to their ability to complete the course and to their practical skills training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith MPW3, we wish to introduce Case-based learning (CBL) as a new teaching methodology. Our consortium of project partners plan to produce twelve new cases that will complement the existing MPW online courses. The new material will focus on skills training in teamwork and problem solving, and it can be used in face-to-face settings or in blended learning solutions when combined with the online courses. It can also be used outside educational institutions and even independently from skilled facilitators; our planned audio-visual case material and new team-focused online course will contain video guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary target group for MPW3 encompasses institutions of higher education and VET for health workers that provide teaching in MPW-related fields of study. Such fields include international health/global health, public health/social medicine, domestic violence prevention, crises prevention/intervention, trauma care, medical ethics & human rights, international humanitarian law, health diplomacy, communication, and conflict management. MPW3\u2019s secondary target group comprises individual health workers and teams of health workers interested in improving their performance in peace building and violence prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ten partners constitute a combination of the expertise deemed necessary for this project. Organisations such as University of Bergen, IPPNW and Klinikum Nurnberg have extensive Medical Peace practice and education, and they have all formed part of the MPW consortium since 2004. We have also brought in a special organisation with particular expertise in creating and managing case-based learning material \u2013 the UK-based Case Centre. Also contributing to this project are new training institutions and organisations with the type of field and situation practice that will feed into the case development and ensure realistic, high quality scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplier events during the project period include co-organisation of the congress \u2018Medicine and Conscience\u2019, where there will be a special thematic focus on challenging peace-health situations in Europe. A workshop to train health educators in CBL methodology and gain their feedback on our material will be organised further into the project period. Finally, a symposium gathering peace-health educators from Europe and around the world will be held towards the final stages of the MPW3 project period. Dissemination will additionally be ensured through various channels that include our extensive peer networks, lobbying activities, the publication of texts and articles in relevant media, public relations events, MPW information material distributed at conferences, meetings and institutions, as well as accreditation and assimilation of the new CBL material into more health education institutions across Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that MPW3 focuses on case-based learning solutions is a symptom of the MPW network\u2019s eagerness to design sustainable training solutions. CBL comes up as a learning method that caters for the learning capacities and needs of the next generation of students. MPW3 will enable us to bridge the material already produced in MPW 1 and 2 with a methodological approach designed for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Peace Work as a field of expertise has gradually developed over the past decade. Our network of partners and supporters continues to grow, as does the demand for designated and freely accessible teaching material.

The machine will feature capabilities for additive manufacture, machining, cold-work, metrology and inspection that will provide the optimum solution for the hybrid manufacturing of large engineering parts of high integrity, with cost benefits of more than 50% compared to conventional machining processes.\nFor large scale engineering structures material needs to be deposited at a relatively high rate with exceptional properties and excellent integrity. To ensure this the machine is based on wire \\ arc additive manufacture for the additive process. A unique feature of the machine will be the capability for parallel manufacturing featuring either multiple deposition heads or concurrent addition and subtraction processes. To facilitate parallel manufacturing the machine architecture is based on robotics. To ensure that the surface finish and accuracy needed for engineering components is obtained for the subtractive step a parallel kinematic motion robot is employed. This robot is also used for application of cold work by rolling between passes. This ensures that material properties can be better than those of forged material. \nA key part of this project is the development of ICT infrastructure and toolboxes needed to programme and run the machine. The implementation of parallel manufacturing is extremely challenging from a software perspective and this will be a major activity within the project.\nTo deliver this extremely demanding and ambitious project a well-balanced expert team has been brought together.
