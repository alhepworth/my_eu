The reasons for this phenomenon are many and varied. They arise as a result of mixed organisational patterns, educational behaviour of individuals and are caused by structural, procedural and individual initial conditions, which have a common relevance to adult education. The often-mentioned structural change facing Europe in general and specifically each Member State, which particularly refers to its migration and diverse society, can only be dealt with by providing equal and suitable conditions for accessing educational opportunities to people, who because of their personal situation have difficulties in accessing education due of for example lack of educational qualifications. The responsibility of the provision of these fair and adequate conditions for the participation in education should also be borne by adult education providers. They must be empowered to develop solutions to reduce barriers and offer educational programs that address diversity to especially those people who may not yet have found a satisfactory entry route into education or for those who have \u201cfinished\u201d with education; so that they can reopen the education window for them.\r\n\r\nIn.education will focus on the development of strategies to increase the enrolment of educationally disadvantaged people especially those with basic education needs into relevant educational programs.

This will result in the activation and expansion of multipliers. Besides the identification of relevant target groups, application-oriented settings (pilot workshops) targeted towards stakeholder groups will be developed. From this experience, in.education will develop an application oriented curriculum (output: Outreach concept).\r\n\r\nIndividual level: The hypothesis that that the enrolment rate in education increases when informally acquired educational qualifications are collected, described and recognised, leading to the admission of those concerned into the education system, emerges from a cycle of transnational cooperation in the collection and validation of informally gained  educational competences of  educationally disadvantaged people with basic education deficits. This will be implemented by the provision of formal compulsory education measures in each partner country in order to validate whether shorter possibilities of accomplishment of compulsory education for adults can be yielded from this cooperation (Output: validation concept for application of educationally disadvantaged people).\r\n\r\nOrganisational level: Starting from the presumption that adult education institutions have not yet adjusted sufficiently to the challenges generated from a diverse society and based on the implementation experience of in.education specifically derived from the learning outcomes and the competence-based training events in the systemic and individual levels, implementation competences that organisations dealing with educationally disadvantaged individuals must have in order to increase enrolment and guarantee the quality of results for this groups of persons  will be extracted.

NADIR is organised around four types of activities: i) three networking activities, consisting of internal and external communication, knowledge and best practices sharing, and biological resources joint management; ii) three research activities, made up of characterising animal lines, improvement of infection monitoring tools, and development of new infection models for emerging diseases; iii) as many transnational access activities as infrastructures involved in the network; iv) one project management work package.", 368419.0, 7951715.0, 9, 17, "NADIR", "http://www.justbrain-fp7.eu", "http://www.defra.gov.uk", null, "fp7_90984_999904713"], [1238544000000, 1348963200000, "Management and monitoring of deep-sea fisheries and stocks", "The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs", "Deepwater fisheries pose particular difficulties for management.

It supports EU policy goals on food security, resource conservation, renewable energy and climate change, and the aims of the H2020 Societal Challenge 5 Work Programme for sustainable management of the environment and its resources. The scientific objectives focus on developing (1) management techniques which mitigate environmental impacts of agricultural practices on soil, water and climate systems, and support sustainable intensification using new production methods; (2) 'smart' environmental monitoring, biotechnology and modelling tools to predict the outcome of measures and practices in (1); (3) decision-making tools with sustainability indicators to implement sustainable agricultural production methods. This will be achieved by linking lab-scale studies of processes with field-scale evaluation of novel management concepts, analytical tools and modelling, using state-of-the-art methods.

In addition, all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. There is a need to elevate the status of coaching, so it becomes a recognised and respected profession. This will enable coaches to achieve their full potential. More importantly, it means the standard of football played by their students will inevitably improve. This current project will address key Eramus+ priorities by targeting and upskilling FAI Coach Educators who will make maximum benefit from inclusion on the mobility. The future development of football in this country is reliant on better coaches. At all levels of the game we need coaches who possess the expertise, knowledge and attitude to positively affect the players and teams with which they work.A key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved career progression opportunities and so the FAI will track participants' employment history for a period of three years updated annually, following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition, FAI International teams\u2019 performance at men's, women's and disability senior level will similarly be measured annually for a period of 3 years following the mobility. The Project Manager, Niall O\u2019Regan, will be key to the evaluation process. Knowing the candidates personally and being on the mobility, he will be able to provide a balanced judgment in relation to individual benefits and enhanced learning for each participant. Following the mobility both participants and the partner organisations will be required to produce a final report identifying project outcomes and areas for improvement of future mobilities, critically assessing skills acquisition, language training and cultural integration.All parties\u2019 contributions will be correlated in an overall report evaluating the merits of the project in relation to the learning objectives and outcomes as well as identifying areas for improvement for subsequent coaching study visits within the EU.", "http://www.thefa.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IE01-KA102-016808_3"]]}}}}
