The competition is increasing in this area both for the full launching systems and the key subsystems. Cost-effectiveness becomes the main driving factor.\nHYPROGEO ambition is to study a propulsion module based on Hybrid chemical propulsion. Hybrid propulsion is not a new technology but its application to a transfer module or to a re-ignitable upper stage is very innovative. It is an interesting alternative for the GEO transfer, between the chemical propulsion (bi-liquid) and the new trend of Electrical Propulsion (EP).  There are very good synergies and complementarities with the other propulsion activities.\nThe proof of concept (specific impulse, thrust) has been demonstrated. The main technical challenge is the long duration firings. The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies:\n- Combustion chamber.\n- High endurance nozzle.\n- Catalytic injector.\n- Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThese R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results.\nAn innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements.\nMain expected benefits are:\n- Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid).\n- Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)\n\nA TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project.\nThe impact of the project is secured by the composition of the consortium led by Astrium with the main European actors of the hybrid: it contributes to the consolidation of the European industrial supply chain for Hybrid propulsion.\nProject duration is 36 months.", 97762.0, 2414635.0, 7, 17, "HYPROGEO", null, null, null, "h2020_193294_943851032"]]}}, "0QW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1199145600000, 1262217600000, "Wireless Alliances for Testing Experiment and Research", "Copsey Telecommunications Limited", "Very and Ultra high speed radio platforms are key developing technologies for emerging applications but raise issues of efficient radio spectrum management and interoperability of technologies, from radio to media access control levels. Among these radio platforms, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) is a very promising technology for the broadband transmission of data using spectrum efficient and flexible radio techniques. Initiatives such as the WiMedia Alliance have developed concepts to use UWB as a standard radio platform allowing transport of upper level protocols such as the wireless USB (WUSB), wireless Firewire and the next generation of BluetoothThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is producing harmonised standards to foster UWB adoption in Europe but Europe is still late compared to USA and others. If not corrected, such a situation could hinder the European innovation potential to develop new applications and services based on this extremely high capacity networks.To pursue the needed European standardisation and regulation efforts, while reinforcing the European leadership in the field of wireless networks, a new range of UWB testbed has to be developed.The WALTER project will address this need and overcoming the associated technological issues of measuring ultra-high frequency signals; will develop a pan-European interconnected testbed. This testbed will make use of the strong European expertise in conformance and interoperability testing. Based on a deep needs analysis and specifications definition, it will be flexible enough to address both from short-term needs (industry and regulators) to long-term needs (research communities), while allowing testing of mitigation techniques.The deployment of this testbed will be supported by dissemination activities and liaison with international stakeholders.

One of the significant barriers restricting the penetration of composite polymer components is the lack of an effective method to join the components. Designers and OEMs have looked towards adhesives for this application. Due to the wide variation in surface chemistry presented by the range of materials employed, adhesives manufacturers have formulated a plethora of products tailored for specific materials and end performance requirements. These products often require different surface preparation processes to achieve the desired level of bond strength and are not optimised to bond dissimilar materials. SEAMLESS offers a solution by presenting a single adhesive chemistry that can be used with multiple materials. Our novel technology (SEAMLESS) minimises the surface preparation requirements, can bond both similar and dissimilar lightweight materials, is lower temperature curing and thus is less energy intensive than currently used adhesives, possess faster cycle times (faster curing and less process steps) and can facilitate better design of complex shapes using lightweight materials.", 44058.0, 62940.0, 1, 1, "SEAMLESS", null, null, null, "h2020_210387_924006966"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "POWDERTECH (BICESTER) LIMITED", 43613.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and seamless European transport system (06.03.03.01)", "fts_2017_57524"]]}}}}
