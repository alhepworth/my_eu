The overall aim of SOILCARE is to identify and evaluate promising soil-improving cropping systems and agronomic techniques increasing profitability and sustainability across scales in Europe. A trans-disciplinary approach will be used to evaluate benefits and drawbacks of a new generation of soil improving cropping systems, incorporating all relevant bio-physical, socio-economic and political aspects. Existing information from literature and long term experiments will be analysed to develop a comprehensive methodology for assessing performance of cropping systems at multiple levels. A multi-actor approach will be used to select promising soil-improving cropping systems for scientific evaluation in 16 study sites across Europe covering different pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Implemented cropping systems will be monitored with stakeholder involvement, and will be assessed jointly with scientists. Specific attention will be paid to adoption of soil-improving cropping systems and agronomic techniques within and beyond the study sites. Results from study sites will be up-scaled to the European level to draw general lessons about applicability potentials of soil-improving cropping systems and related profitability and sustainability impacts, including assessing barriers for adoption at that scale. An interactive tool will be developed for end-users to identify and prioritize suitable soil-improving cropping systems anywhere in Europe. Current policies and incentives will be assessed and targeted policy recommendations will be provided.

Setting up a green vertical walls is a concrete passive yet effective contribution to the sustainable decreasing of energy consumption and environment protection and at the same time raise the quality of bioclimatic development of the building themselves.\r\n\r\nHow education can cope with the facts identified?\r\nOne of the basic quality requirements of vocational education and training systems is the capacity of responding and adjustment to the labour market demands.  \r\nWith this in view the project  \u00bb Vertical Plant Life\u00ab  directly refers to the relevant items within Bruges Communiques 2011- 2020 i.e. \u00bb The transition to a green economy is a mega trend which affects needs across many different jobs and sectors.

One area earmarked for major improvements is commercial\nrefrigeration, which is responsible for 85TW/h of energy consumption per annum and has so far been exempt from Eco\nDesign and Labelling regulations. This is about to change with regulators demanding a saving of 58TW/h by 2030, clearly a\nmajor challenge. Within commercial refrigeration, beverage cooling consumes 21.2TWh/year. The European fleet of\nbeverage coolers consists of remote open fronted cooling cabinets and plug in beverage coolers. Open fronted display\ncoolers are the main sales channel for a wide range of bottled beverages. They encourage impulse purchases by making the\nproduct easy to see and access.

In contrast to convenience\non a domestic level, V-Tex technology also has the potential to enable major energy savings in commercial refrigeration.

The most visible are vending machines and open or closed refrigerated cabinets such as open display cabinets. Combined commercial refrigerator/freezers are estimated to consume 85TWh of electricity per annum.

These trends thus pose a significant risk to the EC\u2019s overall commitment to reduce energy use by 20% to 2020; improve overall energy security of European and reduce green house gas emissions. Beverage cooling accounts for a large proportion of commercial refrigeration covering products such as vending machines and display coolers. Compared to chilled or frozen food products, the majority of beverages have a relatively long shelf life and it is therefore not required to keep them at drinking temperature prior to consumption. However, this is currently the norm as it is often necessary to provide a chilled drink immediately upon purchase. As a result a wide range and number of beverages are kept chilled for eventual purchase. The logical consequence of cooling a drinks container efficiently and rapidly on-demand is a reduced need for chillers to run continuously. RapidCool aims to develop such a flexible, modular cooling apparatus that can accommodate drinks cans and bottles and chill them rapidly from ambient to around 6\u00b0C. The cooling chamber will be designed to be directly operated by the consumer and meet with usage demands associated with vending machines and open cabinet fridge, with both a standalone unit and multi-can variant providing a faster vending solution.

This implies a system which is easy to set up, portable, and straightforward. Thus, BackHome will (1) develop BNCI systems into practical multimodal assistive technologies that will provide useful solutions for communication, web-surfing, and environmental control, and (2) provide this technology for home usage with minimal support. These goals will be attained through three key developments: practical electrodes; telemonitoring with home software support; and easy-to-use applications tailored to people's needs.
