For example the Tensile strength of a single walled nano tube is ~ 1TPa. The thermal conductivity at room temperature for single Multiwalled CNT was measured to be greater than 3000 W/m\u2022K and perfect CNT are also able to conduct electrons without heat loss. Most of the known properties related to CNT&apos;s come from the investigation of a single CNT while the main goal remains to exploit those properties in the macro scale through the use of highly oriented and aliened CNT&apos;s. It is possible to exploit the exceptional properties of CNT by producing fibres which are based on CNT&apos;s as building blocks. These kinds of fibres may be called CNT fibres or CNTF. One approach to produce CNTF is the process of spinning from a CVD process. This process was selected as a potentially applicable process for industrial scale production of CNTF. It has been proved that scale up of the process is feasible while maintaining an affordable and stable process suitable for large scale manufacturing. In order to cross the gap between feasibility in the lab scale and industrial pilot a research effort needs to be carried out in this field. The CNTF by itself is a material suitable for various engineering applications. This is achieved due to the fact that in the CNTF all the remarkable characteristics of CNT&apos;s are expressed. Another route to exploit the material properties of the CNTF&apos;s is to incorporate them in a polymeric matrix to result in a CNTF based composite material. Since we are dealing with a new and innovative fibre type further research is needed in order to find and optimize the polymeric matrix type for the various applications suggested. These applications are: structural and conductive composites, composites for the automotive industry, composites for the aviation industry and even as an armour material.", 14299.0, 559742.0, 2, 4, "CNTF COMPOSITES", null, "http://www.q-flo.com/", null, "fp7_95820_986258656"]]}}, "2PB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Opening up multilingual opportunities at school", "The New Beacon Educational Trust Ltd", 4648.0, 1, 1, "Even though The New Beacon School has excelled in French provision, there is a project objective to develop language learning in other European languages, namely Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and English as a foreign language. The staff have high quality teaching methods in French, yet there are 5 potential staff members who have Spanish, Italian, Russian and German in their repertoire which they have not used or learned since university. They will need to improve their language skills as well as update their methodology specific to the European languages mentioned. For example, one can identify various language courses abroad that are open to ERASMUS plus funding in Spain, Germany, Austria, Latvia and Italy which not only fulfill the requirements of intensive language learning over a period of 2-3 weeks but also offer a European dimension to the culture of these different European nations which can be added to the school curriculum at New Beacon.\r\n\r\nTherefore the key objectives are to train teachers to a good enough standard to offer after-school clubs in Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and English as a foreign language. Furthermore, The New Beacon is looking to use its facilities and staff for outside projects to help grant-maintained pupils learn languages at the weekends.\r\n\r\nThe main activities would involve staff training abroad  on structured language courses in Riga, Latvia, Spanish in Valencia, Spain, German in Vienna, Austria and Italian in Florence, Italy. The trained participants will bring enhanced language teaching within the school and their new knowledge will be disseminated to the rest of the staff of the MFL department and create new teaching materials for the department.   \r\n\r\nAs well as offering these new languages in after-school clubs to 400 boys and Saturday morning taster sessions to the residents of Sevenoaks (300-500 adults and children), the school will look to celebrate the European Day of Languages on 26th September each year from 2015 and subsequent years with multilingual events. This will include specially prepared and translated menus to link languages and culture with the pupils' everyday experiences at school. The events can be promoted in the local media, school website and European databases to highlight New Beacon's intent and action to promote multilingualism and a better understanding of EU members' Latvia, Austria and Italian.", "http://www.newbeacon.org.uk", "The New Beacon Educational Trust Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013234_coordinator"]]}}, "3PG": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYY", "Sevenoaks Hospital", "nhs_RYYD9"]]}}, "3UE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1351728000000, 1477872000000, "Coordination Action to enable an effective European 450 mm Equipment & Materials Network", "Future Horizons Ltd", "5 major global semiconductor companies Intel, Samsung, TSMC, IBM and Global Foundries, have decided to work closely together to bring 450 mm semiconductor processing  to a mature level, within a consortium called G450C.

The major drivers of this effort are Intel and TSMC, which have provided roadmaps towards full 450 mm production. European semiconductor Equipment & Materials (E&M) companies have decided that to secure their global activities, being the major part of their business, they should take an active part in these developments. Therefore in 2009 a European E&M 450 mm initiative was established: EEMI450, to bring the European interested E&M companies and institutes together and to initiate activities in this innovative direction. This Coordination Action will support the activities of this initiative and further 450 mm activities in Europe, for instance the establishment of a 450 mm pilotline. Strong links to existing 450 mm funded projects: ENIAC EEMI450, Catrene SOI450 and NGC450 plus ENIAC EEM450PR are required. Inputs from the recent EU funded study SMART2010/0062, concerning 450 mm production in Europe, have to be taken into account. Much importance will also be attached to tighten the link to global activities and expertise, especially of course with G450C  in Albany. Intensive contact with the driving semiconductor companies is key part of the project; one of them, Intel Ireland, is a consortium member. An Advisory Board seated with accepted experts in the field will supervise and guide the European applicability of the solutions. In addition related Standards will receive special attention.

The ENIAC project EEMI450 is complete and projects in CATRENE (SOI450 & NGC450) and ENIAC (EEM450PR & E450EDL) are proceeding, the latter two targeting a 450mm pilot line at imec.

The Bridge450 Support Action seeks to run in parallel with Enable450 to expand its scope with more focus on Asian semiconductor manufacture. Bridge450 will support the European E&M companies and specially the SMEs to become aware of and understand Asian technical requirements and to develop solutions to address this market. To assist the information flow, a Semiconductor Board will include Samsung and TSMC.A second objective of Bridge450 will be to establish the possibilities of 450mm semi-manufacturing in Europe and what would be needed to facilitate such an operation, which will be vital for the future of advanced nano-electronics in Europe.", 80976.0, 459660.0, 7, 12, "Bridge450", null, null, null, "fp7_110973_955142123"]]}}}}
