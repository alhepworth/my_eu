It emphasises the importance of working closely with the international community and related organisations to share practice and build the capacity of practitioners.\u201d\r\nThe 1+2 Languages Approach is an essential part of this international strategy. It will only succeed if practitioners are given the opportunities they need to achieve the highest level of professional practice. \r\n\r\nIn line with this approach, modern languages are and will continue to be a priority in our School Development plan. This application is for ten Primary teachers (including the school\u2019s 1+2 Lead Learner) from Lasswade Primary to participate in immersion courses in France and Spain over the next two years. These courses aim to improve and develop conversational language skills, to deepen cultural knowledge and to give practitioners a chance to explore new language teaching methods.  Although we have begun our journey towards implementing effective language programmes in Lasswade Primary, our goal is to develop our skills and knowledge so that all teachers feel confident about leading modern language learning and providing exciting and engaging experiences for our pupils.  \r\n\r\nA number of the staff in this application are either new to this school or new to teaching. Both this group of teachers and more established or experienced staff have identified the need to develop their language skills in order to provide the best possible learning opportunities for the children in our classes. With such a range of staff, we naturally have very different experiences and levels of French or Spanish, but the immersion courses seem to all of us to be the best way of boosting our skills and confidence: visiting France or Spain, being fully immersed in a  programme of study with native speakers and experiencing the culture first-hand would be the most invaluable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we intend to share our experiences with our colleagues both at Lasswade and across the whole authority, in order to instil a real enthusiasm for teaching and learning modern languages.\r\n\r\nIn its publication \"Modern Languages: Principles and Practice\", the Scottish Government recognises that young people learning a modern language is an important factor in our nation\u2019s prosperity. We therefore have a duty as teachers to enable children to develop the skills they will need in the new Europe and in the global marketplace by planning a wide and rich range of learning activities in modern languages. We see our participation in this project as an essential step towards the young people we teach becoming successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.", "http://lasswade.mgfl.net/", "Lasswade Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036001_coordinator"], [2016, "Language Training", "Lasswade Primary School", 3515.0, 1, 1, "Two teachers from our school (Lasswade Primary School) volunteered to attend the immersion course training to develop our French spoken language but also to develop an understanding of French culture.

The courses offer valuable training in the teaching of European languages to young learners via observations and tutorials. The languages selected will be French as this is the L2 language chosen by Midlothian, in line with the 1+2 Languages recommendations from the Scottish Government.  This will have an impact on the school plans and at a local and national level.The anticipated outcomes resulting from this project are an increase in language capacity, staff confidence in teaching French and an improvement in the language learning experience of our pupils, earlier accessibility of language learning (P1), increased use of ICT to support linguistic development.  Through our first hand experiences of French culture we hope to pass on our enthusiasm to our learners and open their eyes to the possibilities available across Europe.The ultimate goal in the longer term will be to raise attainment in languages, increase the uptake of languages at secondary school and ensure the young people of Midlothian are given every opportunity to broaden their horizons for life and employment opportunities across Europe and the world.", "http://lasswade.mgfl.net/", "Lasswade Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023681_coordinator"]]}}, "2NZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Language Training", "Hawthornden Primary", 7553.0, 1, 1, "The application is for 4 primary teachers to take part in one of the immersion courses taking place in France in Summer 2017/ Easter 2018.
