The focus on transferable skills for faculty and students will make them more competitive in the labor market.  Graduates would also serve as future teachers, thus increasing the number of faculty with PhDs.  The training provided to faculties and students will also prepare them to think more entrepreneurialy and be given networking opportunities with the Vietnamese and European healthcare industry. All of this activity will take place in 3 regions that have been targeted as in need of development by the Vietnamese government.", "http://www.essex.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_573863-EPP-1-2016-1-EE-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP_1"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", 556948.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.essex.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046756_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", 424137.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.essex.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035353_coordinator"], [2017, "Intellectual Disability, and Equal opportunities for Active and Long-term participation in Sport\u201d. = \u201cIDEAL project\u201d", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", 348889.0, 7, 9, "In an IDEAL world, everyone has the right to participate on an equal basis with others in society. In sport, more and more participation opportunities arise for people with a disability, and unprecedented media interest is generated, particularly by Special Olympics & Paralympic Games. However, the reality in many EU countries is that the majority of young people with an intellectual disability (ID) still find it hard to access sport (European Commission White Paper on Sport, 2010). They have fewer opportunities for full and equal participation, and limited opportunity to specialize/excel in the activity of their choice. Being active is a public health priority focus by the EU, but having an ID is related to lower general activity rates, and a vulnerability factor for poor health. The aim of the IDEAL project is to address these inequalities through increasing the quality of sport interventions and structures, empowering young people with ID and improving their physical and mental health. Six institutions specialized in ID-research across the EU, promoted this collaborative partnership, and established a network with local and global disability sport organizations. They have common experience, respectively with research on the impact of ID on sport, and delivering sport programmes of certified quality. The IDEAL project seeks to translate what is known about ID in relation to sport (benefits, barriers & facilitators) into concrete suggestion for action. The main objectives are to (1) Assess if the currently existing sport programmes & -structures across the EU meet the needs of all people with ID in society, (2) Set-up joint, evidence-based interventions to improve the quantity and quality of initiatives in 4 focus ID-sport areas: athletics, aquatics, teamsports, & wintersports; focusing on coaches, and athlete role models, and (3) Develop EU standards for high quality ID-interventions and make these guidelines easily and widely accessible through online platforms.", "http://www.essex.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_590514-EPP-1-2017-1-BE-SPO-SCP_3"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", 308215.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.essex.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023109_coordinator"], [2016, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX", 246017.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

In this project we aim to increase the number of participating schools, increase the professionalisation of our staff and give more attention to social inclusion while also continuiing our current activities.\r\n\r\nWe do so from the following core beliefs:\r\n\r\n1. In a world which is fast becoming more internationally oriented, we want to make sure that our students have the best start\r\nqualifications to meet this world and its labour market with confidence\r\n2. we want to contribute to the improvement of the public image of VET in the Netherlands and beyond, to make sure that our\r\nstudents are awarded with equal value to their peers in higher education\r\n\r\nFor the current mobility project, we have five specific goals:\r\n1. to improve the linguistic and communication skills of our students\r\n2. to improve the chances of our students in the international labour market\r\n3. to foster the idea of European citizenship and belonging and a sense of intercultural awareness in our students\r\n4. to improve our cooperation with European partners\r\n5. to foster (quality) improvements in education.\r\n\r\nTwenty of our professionals will go to Spain, Britain or Germany for job shadowing: to learn from and collaborate with experienced\r\ncolleagues at partner organisations and to set up lasting international collaborations that will benefit our professional skills of our\r\nstaff and the development opportunities of our students.\r\n\r\nThe students who participate in our work placement in this mobility project have different backgrounds and experiences, but for\r\nmost students it will be their first chance to live, study and work abroad for a longer period. They are in their second or third year of a\r\nthree-year vocational education programme and through evaluations and meetings have shown their capacities and great enthusiasm for international work placement. They are part of the Schools of Economics & Entrepreneurship, Healthcare & Social\r\nWork, Tourism, Recreation & Events, Hair & Beauty, Hotelschool, and the Sports Academy.\r\n\r\nOur students will go abroad to do internships and receive training and education. They will go to Spain, United Kingdom, Mallorca, Belgium and various regions in Austria. They will do their internships at acknowledged work placement institutions and businesses, will work on their linguistic , job, entrepreneurial and intercultural skills, and receive support from MBO Amersfoort, the Erasmus Programmme and respective host institutions.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that students receive the support they need, they will be monitored by their internship coaches from MBO Amersfoort\r\nand individual mentors abroad. To monitor and evaluate their progress on the levels of linguistic and job skills, our students will\r\nmaintain personal development portfolios, do language courses and write and present their internship reports.

We believe that this will\r\nfoster their intercultural awareness and sense of European citizenship. Moreover, their linguistics skills will greatly improve. We\r\nexpect that such opportunities will also have a beneficial effect on student motivation.\r\n\r\nCombined, these results will have a positive impact on our students' chances on the international job market and/or will be\r\nbeneficial to their transition into higher education, inside and outside of our country. Consequently, such international exchanges\r\nwill also have a positive effect on our staff members and institution as a whole, as their international orientation by necessity will\r\nimprove and MBO Amersfoort's position as an international player will become solidified.

Through this grant, covering a total period of two years, MBO Amersfoort  is able to organise several mobility activities, allowing students to visit, study and work in another European country. In total 34 students will visit Finland (Hotelschool), United Kingdom (Hotelschool and Economics & Business)or  France. For a short period (2 weeks) or longer (maximum of 4 months). They will follow (in English) lessons at a similar school as they are used to. They combine this educational programme with a work placement in the same country. The objectives of the project are to increase the capacities of the students and to improve their (vocational) skills, personal skills and competences by offering them educational training and work experience in a different environment. All in order to offer them a unique learning opportunity, to develop as a person and have a good starting point for employability at the (European) labour market, as employer or independent entrepreneur.The students will be selected by set criteria and supported by the teachers and the international managers of MBO Amersfoort. They will follow an educational programme at the partner school abroad and will fulfil an internship in that country via the school they are visiting.
