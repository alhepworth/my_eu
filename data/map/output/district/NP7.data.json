It also includes certifications for the skills acquired during the learning pathway both for teachers and for students. The project is about exchanging the best practices to implement better Green Life Styles in fact it aims  to create a network of good practices to deal with those environmental issues  that are threatening our own local areas (air, water and soil pollution, garbage disposal, etc), but also with unhealthy behavior (eating junk food,  sedentariness, use of chemical cleaning products, etc.).As a first step in the development of the project, the students should acquire knowledge and be inspired by green good practices, already  successfully implemented in each partner country. In the second year of the project activities, they should plan how \"to  import\", to replicate, that \u201cgreen\u201d idea/solution in their own local area (\u201cgreen\u201d products, technologies, sustainable alternatives etc.). In the end, 6-11year old students should be able to plan a \u201cgreen\u201d advertising campaign and 12-15 year old students should be able to draw up a simple \u201cgreen\u201d Business Plan to be submitted to the local organizations and institutions to support  and \"to sell\" the chosen green idea.The project and  the study visits as well will be focused on experiential, environmental, and entrepreneurial learning expanding  the students\u2019 sense of global citizenship and environmental responsibility and fostering entrepreneurial, technological education.The objectives of the project  are in step with  the common political priorities and transversal priorities established  by the E.C. in the field of education and training (ET 2020) whose essential purpose is supporting the improvement of education systems, mutual learning, exchange of good practices and  professional development  of teachers as well.All the  educational activities  expected in our project  as:- Providing training for teachers; - Considering and appreciating  the best practices of our  partners' countries in the field of sustainable lifestyles,- finding  a way to ensure the exchange of information on best practices in this field (using English, modern technologies);visiting our partners' countries with  surveys and on-site workshops; -  mentoring young students to produce business ideas in order to \"export\" and / or \"to import\" the healthy /eco-friendly lifestyle which is efficacious and innovative in our partner's country;- steering the  students, future citizens of Europe, towards thinking and planning  a Green Economy that can be on the basis of future production and consumption systems based on the sustainable use of resources and reduction of negative impacts on the environment, are widely in line not only  with  the Strategic Objectives set by the E.U. for 2020 but also  with the strategic priorities redefined in COM (2015) 408 final del 26/08/2015 for European cooperation in education and training:  -  Strengthening the development of transversal skills and key competences, in line with the Reference     Framework on Key Competences for lifelong learning, in particular digital, entrepreneurship and      linguistic competences;- Promoting  awareness and education in the environmental field developing skills reflecting growing    sectors, such as the green economy;-Acquiring  and mainstreaming innovative and active pedagogies such as inter-disciplinary teaching and   collaborative methods, to enhance the development of relevant and high-level skills and competences; - Supporting continuing professional development of teachers  especially to deal with work based    learning, digital competences and innovative pedagogies, including through EU tools such as eTwinning; -  Supporting the mobility of students, teachers and the development of strategic partnerships and joint     courses by increasing internationalisation of education.Dissemination is a very important phase in  the project  focused on two main aspects of it:- knowledge and dissemination processes, habits or products belonging to the sphere of Green lifestyles;- education of the students from primary school to the culture of entrepreneurship and business. The outcomes of this transnational  cooperation will be widely disseminated among all the relevant stakeholders through events, fairs, exhibitions and all the  path and activities  will be published on  T.E.S. and Junior Achievement  sites  that collect all the good practices related to teaching entrepreneurial skills and shared with E-twinning community.", "http://www.gilwernprimaryschool.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA219-024333_2"]]}}, "7AD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1370044800000, 1483142400000, "Multilaser Additive Layer Manufacturing of Tiles", "Materials Solutions Lbg", "Laser Additive Layer Manufacturing of tiles in various nickel superalloys has been demonstrated at TRL4.

This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_22"]]}}, "9HH": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Natura 2000 Rivers  - Safeguarding Natura 2000 Rivers in the UK", "English Nature", 1819483.0, 909741.0, "The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_160"]]}}}}
