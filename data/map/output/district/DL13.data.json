They store 2x as much carbon as all of Earth\u2019s standing forests.\u00a0Europe contains 265,000 km2 of various peatland types and if dried out, will go from being a carbon sink to a massive, unstoppable carbon emitter. This is the current cause of one third of global CO2 emission. However, these effects on\u00a0climate change are moslty ignored.\nCarbon Connects (CConnnects) will reduce C02 emissions by 50% in agricultural peatlands where traditional practices have unnecessary high emissions (20-40ton C02/ha/y). The land practices drain and strip peatland for energy use, crop production, and animal husbandry. CConnnects will promote an alternative practice of wet agriculture land use that reduces carbon by raising water levels, introducing new crops (eg. Cattail, reed), and isolating carbon in land outputs (biomass, building material). CConnnects will also develop financially viable business models by developing value chains & use blue and C-credit schemes to enable widespread implementation and scaling-up without public subsidies.\nCConnnects delivers 8 pilots of 3-10ha in NL, FR, BE, UK, IE, jointly representing all peatland types in NWE. Solutions are scalable in NWE to 4,500,000ha peatlands (Larger than NL). CConnnects can reduce 90-180M ton emissions in NWE, equivalent to removing 40-80 million cars. CConnnects\u2019 transnational Farmer-2-Farmer learning programme allows land users to directly share and scale experiences, while actively targeting new adopters with a transnational toolbox of state of art land use and farming practices. CConnnects has all 6 NWE peatland countries each with 10-20% of the budget, with 50% of budget for purely transnational activities of international innovation and network partners and for the innovative transnational exchange programme.

Actual PEM fuel cells presents Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) architecture corresponding to a proton conductive membrane hot pressed between two catalytic electrodes. However, the MEA performance is limited by the interface effect between catalytic layer and membrane.  To overcome this problem, the SMAllInOne project introduces a \u201cSMart All in One\u201d membrane concept. In this approach, a catalytic network is directly implanted in the thin film protonic membrane. This novel composite material is particularly well adapted for fuel cell technologies as there is no boundary between the membrane and the electrodes. Moreover, several functionalities will be added to this material in order to confer it smart properties such as water and crossover management, tailored porosity and 3D conformability.
