From the deployed implementation to embed an internationalization @ home in 2020 in all educational curricula, the awareness of the relevance of internationalization within management and education teams has been increased. This has a huge impact on the interest in physical mobilities of both students and teachers. After a successful year in which students and teachers have gained foreign experience, the question is even more at this moment. The quality of the students and teachers is visibly improving and this year more students will go to level 3 and 4 to different countries within Europe. The clear structure that has arisen within the two MBO Colleges works very well for both the management and lecturers and students. Students know where they need to be when they want to do an internship abroad. The classrooms and regional companies are also very impressed by the interest in this foreign experience. The activities of the two international coordinators of ROCvF consist of setting out a broad policy on mobility in collaboration with coordinators of the ROC of Amsterdam, vision policy and mission, the implementation of internationalization within the framework of the new qualification structure aimed at sustainable contacts and cooperation with foreign partners or companies. The collaboration creates new sources and opportunities for the ROCvF, such as the cooperation with the Amstelveen branch for Sport and Wellness, where we set up a project with each other to London and Rome / Reggio and students go on a 2-week internship and professionalize teachers. Another example is through the joint platform Rocva / vf and The Dutch Alliance we come into contact with a Vocational School in Finland where teachers and officers from the professional field will go for a research with issues surrounding crossovers in the neighborhood-oriented work on well-being, care and sport. The cooperation that has been established between the Entrepreneurship department and two schools from Austria is an example for other departments, which means that many departments are now crossing the border. This year, 151 students and 22 teachers will cross the border. That is considerably more than in previous years. With this we indicate that the ambition is to grow to 6% mobility for the entire ROC. In terms of quality, as described in the project, we will also make improvements in the preparation, execution, monitoring, contact maintenance, dissemination and evaluation in various areas.

The toolbox will facilitate the following tasks on a spatially disaggregated level: (1) Mapping heating and cooling energy situation including renewable and waste heat potentials in GIS layers; (2) Model the energy system, considering hourly matching of supply and demand, demand response etc.; (3) Supporting the comprehensive assessment of efficient heating and cooling according to the Energy Efficiency Directive; (4) Comparative assessment of supply and demand options and of given scenarios until 2050 regarding e. g. CO2-emissions, costs, share of renewables.\nAn open data set for EU-28 will be created to perform those tasks in virtually any EU region up to a 250x250m level, which will reduce barriers for authorities to heating and cooling planning. HotMaps will allow for updating locally available data and links to existing models. The software will be developed in close cooperation with the target group, within the consortium and beyond. Moreover, the toolbox will be validated and demonstrated in 7 pilot areas to provide a tested and user friendly software entirely based on user needs.\nIn the proposal we present a strategy how to ensure the wide usability, adjustability and application of the toolbox within and beyond the project duration: (1) The consortium is fully committed to the open source idea: All EU-28 data and the source code will be open and we will link with open source energy modelling communities; (2) Training activities will be carried out, including a strategy how to continue after the project; (3) Academic partners will train students on HotMaps in their teaching activities.

Our specific objectives are:\r\na) Develop a Good Practice Catalogue (IO1) to introduce business advisors to the value of using and teaching digital competences to entrepreneurs and SMEs\r\nb) Create a Digital Changemakers Toolkit (IO2) providing them with practical guidance on how to incorporate 20 of the best digital (online) learning tools into their work \r\nc) Craft an online learning course (IO3) to consolidate advisors\u2019 skills and confidence in using mobile and digital learning resources and their ability to recommend digital solutions to their clients.\r\nd) Engage business advisors and VET organizations in the development of the above, train the first group of Changemakers as coordinate an aggressive dissemination strategy, in order to facilitate the mainstreaming of systematic professional development opportunities for the business advisory community on this topic.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impact of the project will be an increase in the digital competences of advisors and trainers involving attitudinal change, knowledge acquisition and skills and confidence development. Business organisations that support their advisory staff to upskill in this area, will progress along their own path to becoming digitally competent educational organisations.\r\n\r\nBy improving the skills and attitudes of business advisors to increase their own digital competences, use of digital pedagogy, we will increase the overall effectiveness of entrepreneurship education (across all areas of entrepreneurship training), and also become agents of change to improve the digital competences of entrepreneurs and SMEs. Locally and regionally, more entrepreneurs will achieve more success in growing their businesses; this could lead directly to increases in employment as well as broader economic growth.  Because of its focusses on the key competences of entrepreneurship and digital skills, the project will also broaden and deepen the pool of entrepreneurial talent in the regions helping close the skills gaps.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that embedding digital skills in VET, and especially business VET, are still an emerging area of work, we believe that by joining forces with European partners we will be able to leverage a more focused and effective approach. In particular, we will be able to contribute in a more meaningful way to the debate around and implementation of the recently published and updated competence frameworks, such as DigComp, EntreComp, DigCompe Org and DigCompEdu.", "http://www.nationalenterprisenetwork.org", "Omagh Enterprise Company Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048211_1"], [2018, "Ambition to Employ", "National Enterprise Network", 211846.0, 5, 6, "Small businesses are one of the main components of economic growth, social development and quality of life for EU citizens. However, the first steps of growth, especially the transition from being a sole trader to hiring a first employee(s), are not always easy. Lack of knowledge about the regulatory environment is a factor, but studies show that barriers are often perceived, and so hiring a first employee essentially requires sole traders to \u201ccross a psychological threshold for which they are ill prepared.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis lack of preparation has become more evident as reasons for moving into self-employment in the current economic climate have as much to do with the \u201cpush\u201d away from other forms of employment, as with the desire to start and grow a new business. The skills gap is further aggravated by the fact that the majority of public sector investment in business training has been directed to high potential growth start ups, while there has been little improvement in the quality of mainstream training for \u201cstandard\u201d businesses, including sole traders.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ will develop a new training model to enable self-employed owner-operators to hire their first employee with knowledge, ability and confidence. This requires teaching the practical, legal and financial aspects of employment and sustainable business growth, but also applying new insights into overcoming the psychological barriers and risks involved.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet these needs, our specific objectives are:\r\na) Create a self assessment tool enabling an objective assessment of readiness to employ and generating a personalized learning pathway. (IO1)\r\nb) Develop a new training model with comprehensive support for business trainers and advisors on how to impart the knowledge, skills and self-belief required to hire a first employee.(IO2)\r\nc) Create and market an open, free online course so that busy self employed individuals can access this new training directly. (IO3)\r\nd) Train the first  group of business trainers from key VET providers in each region contributing both to quality development, dissemination, and above all, the exploitation and sustainability of the project\u2019s outputs.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ will involve participants in pilot testing and a train-the-trainer learning activity, as well as in multiplier events. As a result, the results will be: \r\n- 20 VET providers will integrate this new topic of teaching to their entrepreneurship training and business support services with 40 more planning to use the model /OERs in following 2 years. \r\n- 220 self-employed entrepreneurs during the lifespan of the project, and 800 more in the following 2 years, will acquire the skills to take on their first employee, boosting their ability to achieve sustainable business growth and contributing to job creation overall.\r\n- Stakeholders in VET and wider business development will increase support for the integration of activities which improve the quality and contribution of self employment above and beyond a regulatory or financial incentive approach. They will recognise the value of combining knowledge creation with new pedagogical approaches to developing entrepreneurial mindsets and softer skills, including risk management and leadership.\r\n\r\nAgainst a backdrop of ongoing political and economic insecurity and weak growth, which has caused a notable rise in the number of self-employed entrepreneurs across Europe, Ambition to Employ stands to make a significant contribution to updating our VET systems and  increasing our capacity to teach much-needed entrepreneurial competences. The project will also generate strong return-on-investment in terms of its direct relationship with job creation.  \r\n\r\nThe overall impact will be a strengthening of our VET systems to respond to the changing patterns of employment and entrepreneurship. To date, many policy makers have either turned a blind eye to the fact that the recent rise in self-employment does not correlate to a rise in growth-oriented businesses; or if they are aware of the structural problems pushing people into self-employment, they have favoured fiscal incentives to encourage growth through employment.  This ignores many of the real reasons why self-employed solo entrepreneurs are not growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ establishes a new approach to ensuring the latent potential for solo entrepreneurs to contribute to job creation and wider economic growth are capitalized upon: by creating a new training model and the capacity to roll it out to dozens of training providers across our countries, we provide very practical assistance to this growing target group and show that responsive education strategies can make a difference.", "http://www.nationalenterprisenetwork.org", "Banbridge District Enterprises Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048089_2"]]}}}}
