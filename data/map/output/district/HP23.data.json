Examples include additive manufacturing parts, micro parts, and fibre reinforced composite parts. Common to these workpieces is the dependency of their performance on internal and inaccessible elements. Nevertheless, customers in multiple sectors are requesting certified quality and reliability.\n\nFor the last few years industrial Computed Tomography (CT) has been regarded as a promising technology, which can evolve towards integrated quality control of complex workpieces combining dimensional metrology and material defect analysis. However, major challenges remain in order to exploit its full potential. Meeting these requires a broad range of expertise, including physics, dimensional metrology, non-destructive testing, material sciences, precision engineering, and manufacturing engineering. Due to the distinct interdisciplinary character, there is a strong need for young researchers with a broad range of competences to achieve the envisaged innovation breakthrough in the EU industry.\n\nThe INTERAQCT project has been conceived as a pan-European industrial-academic initiative that will provide the unique and encompassing training environment required, by bringing together expertise from industry and academia in each of these domains (CT-equipment, CT-software, NDT, dimensional metrology, additive manufacturing, micro-manufacturing, composite manufacturing).\n\nThe research will develop procedures for fast and accurate CT model acquisition, with special emphasis on multi-material parts.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare. The partners in this project represent animal welfare organisations, major companies in the animal production sector and leading research institutions.
