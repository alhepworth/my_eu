Recruiting and qualifying employees is also essential in order to ensure that companies maintain and develop their innovative strength and competitiveness.  A stay in another country can bring lots of positive outcomes. You can gain insights into your field of study from an international perspective, improve your foreign language skills, learn about a new culture, make international contacts and improve your career prospects.\r\n\r\nTraining abroad  is a unique opportunity for the development of professional knowledge and gaining new practical skills. The particular field of training depends on training needs defined by a participant. A significant component of the internships will be the acquisition of new work habits specific for a given foreign environment, improvement of language skills and multicultural competence. \r\n\r\nAn internship abroad is useful for several reasons. It is advantageous for future job applications, it helps with language skills and fosters intercultural competence. Furthermore, interns abroad encounter new work routines and mentalities, become more open and tolerant and learn to find their way in new environments.\r\n\r\nApprentices who have been selected for an internship abroad , will learn to become an industrial mechanic, electronics engineer for automation technology, engineering mechanics, mechatronics, technical product designer. The apprentices are already in the second apprenticeship year and must be at least 18 years of age\r\n\r\nFundamentals practical skills and knowledge in:\r\n engineering duties in planning and designing tools, engines, machines, and other mechanically functioning equipment, operation, maintenance, assembly and repair of equipment have already been laid.\r\n\r\nMARK WAISTELL , Senior Partner of Accent International, arranged for the participants to be met upon arrival at  Airport by our Airport Transfer Service and taken to their respective host family addresses. On arrival the participants were given their \u201cWelcome Packs\u201d, which contained useful information about their programme. During the meeting, the students were given information about their work placements, host family accommodation, social and welfare programme and emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nThrough the welcome meeting, participants receive specific information about:\r\n- The appropriate contact person of Accent International\r\n- Course hours for the language course\r\n- Information on the use of public transport\r\n- For more information about internships\r\n\r\nOn their first day of work, each student was accompanied to their work placement and introduced to their Supervisor by a member of Accent International  staff. The Work Placement team continually monitored the students and the work placements throughout their stay in the UK.\r\n\r\nMobility means collecting new experiences in the context of vocational stays abroad, e.g. via internshipsor further education programmes. Mobility offers the chance to acquire cross-country technical and social competencies, to further improve one\u2019s qualification and, as a result, have better chances on the international job market. Especially in an internationally oriented sector such as the aviation industry, the readiness for mobility plays an important role.\r\nKey competencies such as initiative, ability to work in a team and flexibility are an essential prerequisite for living and working together. \r\n\r\nThey help people to react quickly to new situations and to design work flows in an effective manner. Skilled personnel with intercultural competencies represent a decisive competitive advantage to companies. Improving language skills in a sector oriented towards international relations, language as the basic means of communication is of utmost importance. \r\n\r\nMobility means collecting new experiences in the context of vocational stays abroad, e.g. via internshipsor further education programmes.

Delivering a highly successful Leonardo mobility project of similar focus in 2013 has lead us to the conclusion that such projects are highly desirable in terms of up-skilling participants, improving their future employability and mobility in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of our project is to vastly broaden our learners education, make them more desirable workers for employers and give them a unique vocational experience, and by extension improve the quality of vocational education delivered by Bicton College and its partners, by providing participants with a realistic and seasonal work experience placement with a skilled industry specialist and their associates in Andalucia, Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is our intention to select 10 participants from our Level 3 Diploma in Arboriculture and Forestry course on the placement. They will be of different ages and backgrounds but will have all attained a suitable degree of skill to participate in the specialist activities of the placement; it is also highly likely that this will be the first European experience for some of them.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the placement will consist a wide range of seasonal activities, including logging for biomass, removing dangerous trees from biologically sensitive sites and municipal areas, surveying biodiversity, agroforestry practices including organic pest control and formative pruning and professional development focusing on risk and firefighting and prevention. For a full and detailed list of activities see section G.\r\n\r\nBicton's project manager has extensive local knowledge of Andalucia, a tried and tested working relationship with Alcaparain and their associates, and speaks fluent Spanish. Our project manager, lecturer in Arboriculture and an industry worker and Bicton volunteer, with previous experience as a participant, will accompany our learners and monitor their progress, handle travel, accommodation and logistics, provide translation and mentor them during the placement. Accompanying adults are familiar with the rural area, services and have previously worked with our Spanish partner Alcaparain during the delivery of a Leonardo mobility project in 2013.\r\n\r\nWe expect that the skills and competencies gained by participants will set them apart from their peers and that they will pass on the knowledge and good practices that they learn to vocational associates and co-workers. Regionally we hope that through projects such as Erasmus+ we will send highly knowledgeable and skilled participants into the work place. On the European level we expect that our project will strengthen our ties with industry specialists in Spain, the Department of the Environment of Andalucia and forge new links with the forestry school IES Andres Perez Serrano de Cortes de la Frontera that will allow us to learn from each other and pass on that knowledge and good practice. We expect that continued participation in projects with industry specialists in Spain will facilitate a European wide transfer of knowledge and good practices whereby each party can learn from the others methods and rationale.", "http://www.bicton.ac.uk", "Bicton College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000241_coordinator"]]}}}}
