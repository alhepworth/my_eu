The project will research and develop a novel process involving electrospray to deliver biomolecule-based drugs into cells. The action requires intersectorial collaboration between partners with complementary expertise in biological drug delivery, mechanical and manufacturing engineering and microfluidics technologies. The problem will be tackled by researching the parameters that influence electrospray generation and its ability to successfully deliver active biomolecules into cells. The term \u2018electrospray\u2019 refers to the process where electrical charges are provided to a fluid in order to generate a very fine spray of the fluid. Applications of electrospray technology include mass spectrometry, chemical deposition and colloid thrusters. Recently, the process has been applied to areas of biology such as protein mass spectrometry, depositing biological material during tissue engineering and the production of protein microarrays. However, the fundamental parameters underlying electrospray formation are poorly understood, limiting full exploitation of the potential of this phenomenon. We have developed a novel electrospray system which we have successfully used to demonstrate a novel application of delivering biological molecules into cells such that they remain functional within the cell. This technology holds substantial potential as a novel drug delivery method. In this interdisciplinary action, we aim to increase understanding of the physical processes involved in electrospray generation, to develop the technology and to determine its potential to deliver of a wide range of biological molecules into cells.

Starting from their most simple multicellular ancestors, the cells that compose animal bodies have become increasingly diverse; each cell type distinguished by the unique set of genes it expresses. This increase in diversity of cell types over evolutionary time is recapitulated in the process of development during which a single undifferentiated cell - the fertilised egg - divides and its progeny differentiate into the countless cell types of the adult body. Currently we do not even know how many distinct cell types animals posses, how new cell types arise in evolution, how many are in common between different animal groups and how many unique cell types have evolved in different lineages. Our aim in EvoCELL is to lay the foundation for a new branch of evo-devo focussing on cell types. We will study these fundamental questions in animal evolution and development using a new technology - single cell sequencing - which we will for the first time employ outside of lab models to sample the great diversity of animal phyla. Europe is home to world-leading expertise in evo-devo and single-cell genomics, but research and training efforts are as yet uncoordinated and their potential for synergy underexplored. EvoCELL will harness and expand this European excellence by training a new generation of multidisciplinary scientists skilled in exploring the vast breadth of animal differentiation.
