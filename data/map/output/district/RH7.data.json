K\u00e4o Elementary School has been running for the past three years, therefore getting important information from other schools\u2019 experiences could be necessary. Even though it is possible to find similar schools in Estonia, teachers still need to further their knowledge in other countries where they have longer history in that field. K\u00e4o Elementary School works closely with K\u00e4o Day Care Center \u2013 it enables students to get different therapies (occupational therapy, music therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc.). K\u00e4o Day Care Centre educators help students during their schoolday and in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe main goals for the project are:\r\n- examine the use of intensive interaction and ABA, which are essential part of working with autistic children. According to K\u00e4o Elementary School, these methods are not widespread in Estonia.\r\n- examine different augmentative and alternative communication opportunities that are used in UK special needs schools\r\n- examine different opportunities for sensory rooms\r\n- get knowledges about planning a lessons and schoolday for students with severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disabilities \r\n- get knowledges about how teachers cooperate with other professionals (social workers, occupational therapists, music therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists etc.).\r\n\r\nThere will be three teachers participating in the job shadowing in special education schools in England. All the teachers have their own (home)groups. Additionally, they teach following subjects to all studens: cognition and perception; art and fine motor skills; social relationships and group work. Therefore teachers need to use augmentative and alternative communication and intensive interaction every day. Even though all the partner schools have students with severe with severe cognitive/ developmental disabilities, each school has an individual approach that the teachers from K\u00e4o Elementary School would like to familiarize with. \r\n\r\nDuring the job shadowing, teachers can broaden their knowledge and get practical experience working with similar study methods. Gained knowledge could raise the competency that again would help to create better environment for a personal growth in obtaining secondary education according to ones capabilities. With this current project, K\u00e4o Elementary School is also hoping to find long time partners from abroad with whom the partnership could continue even after the project. \r\n\r\nThe main communication between partners will take place via email (through the contact person of the school). Schools in England offer suitable dates for the job shadowing. Main goals of the visit will be specified again prior to travel. \r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing, all the participating teachers share the new information and knowledges with the staff of K\u00e4o Elementary School, K\u00e4o Day Care Center and parents. Additionally, all the relevant information about the project will be revealed on the schools\u00b4 official website. Participating teachers will write an article about their job shadowing experiences to \u00d5petajate Leht (weekly newspaper).", "http://www.youngepilepsy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EE01-KA101-000106_2"]]}}}}
