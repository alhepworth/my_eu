Current treatment options for ESRD are dialysis or renal transplantation, which have significant drawbacks in terms of increased morbidity and mortality, besides placing an increasing economic burden on society. The development of interventions aimed at preventing ESRD, including drug- and cellular-based therapies, is made difficult by the lack of availability of primary human renal cells for in vitro drug testing and by our inability to accurately assess the effectiveness of cellular-based therapies in appropriate animal models. However, due to recent advances in the fields of stem cell science, biomaterials and bioelectronics, we have unprecedented opportunities to generate the following tools that will facilitate important breakthroughs in renal medicine: (i) human kidney-derived stem/progenitor cells (KSPCs) for drug discovery and cellular therapy; (ii) biomaterials for regulating the differentiation of the KSPCs in vitro for use in drug development programmes; (iii) electronic devices capable of measuring renal function, enabling the effectiveness of stem cell-based therapies to be properly evaluated.

We are situated on the outskirts of Frodsham, Cheshire.  There are currently 91 children on role and 17 staff including 3 midday assistants.  The vast majority of pupils are White British and no pupils speak English as an additional language.  The surrounding area is not culturally diverse and is predominantly White British.  We have a very strong ethos of opportunity, aspiration and community.  Parents have very positive views of the school. Several travel quite a distance to Aston because they value the focus on caring as well as the high academic expectations.  Pupils really enjoy attending our small school because they know everyone and have many friends. Staff know every child, not only those in their class, and this contributes greatly to pupils feeling safe and secure.  The school is in a well-balanced socio-economic catchment area.  \r\n\r\nAs a school, we have identified our needs as: to upskill the staff in term of their ability to teach French and their knowledge of the language; to improve staff and pupil confidence; to develop robust schemes of work which will inform high quality lesson plans and teaching to ensure rapid progression; to develop the multicultural dimension throughout the school and to ensure that the subject leader is able to support staff and learners with their French.\r\n\r\nThese will be five participants whose needs can be met by this course; who will create a real 'buzz' around languages learning; who have clear goals and expectations for the project; who will create displays on returning from the mobility to provide discussion prompt between the students and between staff and students; who will continue to engage with professional development to improve language learning throughout the whole school; and who will work to raise the profile of French throughout the school.\r\n\r\nTo address the needs identified within our school, we plan to send five members of staff to a high quality immersion course in the South of France over a two year period.  The activities on the course include high quality language lessons delivered by native speakers, who are experienced in teaching their mother tongue as a foreign language. Participants will be grouped according to their language proficiency. Links with teachers and children can be established during a one day work shadow in a French primary school.  The course provides the opportunity for immersion in the village life of provincial France which includes carefully selected activities such as: a formal welcome from the Mayor, traditional dancing and a game of p\u00e9tanque with the local club. Learning activities will take place during the day and cultural activities during the evening.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will affect not only the participant but also the school, colleagues, children, scheme of work and lesson plans, our cluster of schools, parents and governors.  From this impact we expect to make a real difference to the knowledge, skills, practice, attitudes, behaviour, motivation, confidence, life chances, employability and opportunities of all the stakeholders involved.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of this project are; fostering a life-long love of languages, creating a 'buzz' around language learning and learning about the culture of other countries.

In addition, dynamic seals related friction, damages the seal surface overtime, thus reducing its lifetime. Although, it is of common knowledge that low-friction dynamic seals can be obtained by specifically designing and engraving micro-patterns on the seal contact area (area in contact with the moving mechanism), current seals' mass production processes do not incorporate this crucial step. To get a low-friction dynamic seal, the micro-pattern needs to be individually engraved, seal by seal at an independent later stage, once the seal has been produced.

The proposed project aims to extend the applicability of composite moulds into the more demanding regime of RTM production, as well as to extend the application of the open mould and light RTM techniques in the field of advanced resin systems, where elevated temperature is required. Most important Innovations are: i. embedded heating elements, based on the carbon reinforcement of the mould, close to the mould-part interface demanding less energy. ii. Incorporation of flow, temperature and cure sensors that will enable full automatic control of the process. iii. Layout of a cooling system consisting of a conformal (following the contour of the part) tubing network. iv. Use of piezoceramic film actuators which will induce micro-vibrations and thus assist resin flow inside the cavity.
