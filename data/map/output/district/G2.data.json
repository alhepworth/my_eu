There is a growing emphasis on \u2018housing-led\u2019 solutions, which involve promoting sustainable exits from homelessness into permanent housing as rapidly as possible. The Housing First service model for tackling long-term homelessness amongst people with complex support needs has been identified as an evidence-based innovation. In the above context, a shift is currently taking place in the EU, whereby homeless services increasingly focus on \u201cending\u201d rather than \u201cmanaging\u201d homelessness. There is a need for field workers to engage in continual training in order to help their clients efficiently. According to the experience of the Ways out of homelessness in Central Europe Erasmus+ strategic partnership, as well as own national data collection in Hungary, there is almost nothing in form of training offered to those working with homeless people moving into independent housing. Support workers learn as they go, often from their own mistakes \u2013 which also means that they might gather negative memories and be less enthusiastic to work with homeless people in real housing. Peer-support work or hiring experts with lived experience has been growing in the social sector, mostly in the area of substance abuse and less so in the field of homelessness. However, people who have experienced homelessness can offer support in a unique way as they have knowledge, skills and abilities that cannot be taught in courses. Still, to be able to work efficiently, as well as for their own protection, they need to acquire new knowledge, skills and abilities on how to support people. The partnerships thus gathers organizations who have vast experience not only in helping homeless people sustain housing once exiting homelessness, but also in training various groups of support workers.The TrainHouse project aims to share experience and good practice in the field of housing support. Through five joint staff training events the partners will introduce each other to the work they carry out in the five cities of the partnership: Barcelona (Spain), Brno (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary), Glasgow and London (United Kingdom). Participants (about 45 trainers, field workers and peer support workers) will develop three training guides for three different target groups: professional staff, peer support workers (\u201cexperts by expertise\u201d) and volunteers offering support for homeless people in independent housing. The three guides will be shared, and if possible, tested by a wider audience through a series of multiplier events (workshops, conferences, pilote-teaching sessions). They will be made freely accessible to anyone online in English, Czech and Hungarian.The partnership hopes that this will help to shift the focus on non-institutionalized support of homeless people.

Its name should be understood as \u201cDecisionShip Ahoy!\u201d, a reference to A. G. Bell, the Scottish-born scientist who patented the first telephone and originally suggested 'Ahoy' as the standard greeting when answering a call. Its purpose is to investigate, over 3 years, innovative educational ideas around Decision Making, with a view to deeply reinforcing Decision Making skills for renewed and rejuvenated integrative educational programmes in Higher Education (HE) and Vocational Education & Training (VET), and promoting the internal exploitation and intensive dissemination of such framework, for continuous development of HE and VET practices. \r\n\r\nThe nature and dynamics of change creates unpredictability in the European society. Professional life environments are more than ever Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA). This context makes decisions even more strategically critical. Entrepreneurship and Leadership skills have been extensively investigated during the last decade to meet EU Modernisation Agenda strategies It is now time to explore \u201cDecisionship\u201d. Yet, decision is not only about knowledge, it is also about skills. Whether they are to act as experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths (STEM) or other fields, future Decision Makers should also be specifically prepared to making decisions in VUCA environments. This is the responsibility of HE and VET institutions: training future graduates, through a transversal skills approach, in Decisionship, so that they are able to turn knowledge into skills, and provide the best professional answer when faced with VUCA circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe first innovative aspect of D'Ahoy is to support the coherent inclusion of active and engaging pedagogical models. The second is to investigate Decision Making as a transversal skill, in association with three complementary dimensions:\r\n* Maths-based Decision Making, with rationality;\r\n* Social-based Decision Making, including people\u2019s interdependencies and social identities;\r\n* Career-based Decision Making, to better choose owns career path.\r\n\r\nD'Ahoy is grounded in a clearer understanding of the perceptions and expectations of students and fully aligned with the strategic challenges of the partners to accelerate pedagogical innovations and nucleate their HE and VET systems. Through an exchanges of best practices among Schools, in the STEM and Business fields, D'Ahoy seeks (i) to share and confront HE educational innovations, practices and methods, in light of professional needs, (ii) to catalyse the engagement of learners with innovative courses, integrated in existing but evolving programmes, through novel educational initiatives, (iii) to develop and disseminate tools for assessment of such skills, via the learning outcomes approach, and (iv) to assesses their quality and achievements. D'Ahoy exploits and complements prior EU and national project results (FP7, H2020, LLP, Erasmus+ KA2, or French-like ANR) to create inclusive, active and experiential pedagogies for Decision Making skills, so as to render education systems more accessible and attractive.\r\n\r\nD'Ahoy aims at defining and evaluating innovative Teaching and Learning activities to be integrated in educational frameworks at a systemic level, in line with the Bologna processes and quality assurance purposes, as ENQA and EQAVET recommendations for accreditation and quality enhancement. D'Ahoy will bring positive and long-lasting effects on the participating organisations and their staff and learners, and on other regional, national and European Institutions as formalized in its 8 target groups. It will output 3 guides, a Youtube channel, several publications and conference presentations. The guides include:\r\n1. a taxonomy of Decision skills requirements and unified learning outcomes syllabus;\r\n2. innovative models and kits for Decision skill training, transferable in many educational fields;\r\n3. a D-SKILLS Framework, continuously integrative for programmes renewal. \r\n\r\nThe D'Ahoy partnership consists of a consortium of 7 top level expert partners (in France, Scotland, Spain, and Iceland) with a complementary expertise in Decision and specific expertise in HE and VET educational development, to produce high quality outputs.

However, in most EU countries that have implemented an NQF, only formal qualifications can be referenced to it, while very few countries have introduced systemic solutions for the inclusion of non-formal qualifications (e.g. Scotland, Ireland, France).

The increased interest in a variety of musical styles by music listeners and a decrease of state support to arts generally are examples of these developments. As a result, a shift from fixed types of employment to a situation where musicians are self-employed and combine various professional activities in the form of a portfolio career can be seen all over Europe. The future music profession needs musicians that are flexible in working methods, musical styles and able to work in different professional contexts. Improvisation is seen as a significant skill in the music profession, giving the musicians better opportunities for finding jobs in a wider spectrum of music styles and contexts as artists, teachers and community musicians.\r\n- In the 21st century, improvisation is seen as a crucial pedagogical tool for the training of transversal skills, which are fundamental for future musicians. Reflective attitude, peer-learning and team working are basic principles for improvisation practice and these are exactly the skills that will support the musicians to prepare themselves to be reflective participants in their portfolio careers. Therefore, the partner organisations of this project find improvisation to be a vital tool for modernizing higher education in the area of classical music. To support this, strong courses on improvisation need to be developed in higher music education institutions, as they will have a relevant role to play in the mainstreaming of improvisation and its pedagogical and artistic benefits to the professional musician\u2019s training.\r\n\r\nThe project brings students, teachers and leading experts together from different musical backgrounds in 13 European higher music education institutions to develop new and effective approaches and methods on the teaching of improvisation, both from an artistic and pedagogical as well as a professional integration point of view. Teaching staff will be updated or re-trained with information on innovative teaching and learning methods, leading to higher quality teaching. This will result in an increased awareness and understanding of the potential of improvisation in the participating institutions and, through a set of targeted dissemination activities, the higher music education sector at large. Eventually, this will lead to improved employment opportunities for future music students. \r\n\r\nThe project will implement the following activities:\r\n1. A series of working group meetings meeting twice a year to develop intellectual outputs in the form of new teaching and learning (online), and assessment methodologies in improvisation. \r\n2.

The project intends to fill the need of new teaching ways in music, especially in the most susceptible age group of children (5-10 ys), who usually receive 1 music lesson/week from the general class teacher who have no skills and training to teach specialized subjects, and have a very vague music repertory (except some specialised music primary schools in Hungary).  There is no modern curriculum or specific content for music education in primary schools yet. The current teaching methodology is based on  the passive attitude of the pupils, focuses too much on theory rather than creating an atmosphere where the kids can actively be involved in music making, while having a \u201cpositive flow\u201d. That\u2019s why currently music lessons are among the most denied and disliked subjects. Why should anyone like or make music, is there any benefit? Why is it important to start music education in early childhood? The key is the proven benefits of music, the so called \u201cmusical transfer effect\u201d. Those children who receive appropriate music education in their early ages will have more developed cognitive functions, linguistic, arithmetic skills, fine motoric capabilities, will possess a more open social attitude, more autonomous thus flexible personality compared to those children who received no music education. Therefore the stake is the quality of our future society. The innovation of our approach lies in the new approach of two new models which connect creative movements with singing and music listening, as well as applying elements of the pedagogy of Klara Kokas, a Kodaly alumna, who developed a new, children-focused holistic approach combining music listening with free movements.  The two models truly reflect the findings of how active participation in music making, be it through instinctive movements, improvisation, etc. enhances the understanding, absorption of music. A recently finished pilot scientific study in Hungary serves as a starting point for the job of creating new didactics based on these models. In parallel the critical review of the current learning materials and music repertoires used in primary schools will be completed along with importing new pieces. The pieces have to serve the needs of the children of the digital era, to help their joyful involvement in music lessons, via using carefully selected, high-quality music listening materials of various genres with analysis, authentic folk pieces of the given countries, singing games and choreographies. This will be executed by experts and students of the 3 HEI partners, the first steps being done through Intensive Programmes in each seat.  The materials (cca 900 items by the end) will be tested in a population of children of primary school age and their teachers coming from partner institutions who have been invited by the HEIs in each countries. These partners (HU: a primary school, NL: Vocaal Talent, SC: NYCoS) have children choirs as well as CPD programmes, so the testing procedure could be extended to practising teachers, too.A new IOS platform based app (KODA) developed specifically for music teachers with features like games for developing musical writing, reading skills, and a lesson-planner will be used. The third intellectual output is a special platform, the Kod\u00e1ly-hub which will be designed to meet the unique needs of music educators. All other  intellectual outputs will be uploaded to the Kod\u00e1ly-hub throughout the project and will be made publicly available.

ADVOCATE will test this model in a natural environment, and provide evidence-informed policy measures towards its implementation, both for oral health care systems as well as other health care systems.\nGiven the comprehensiveness of the topic, ADVOCATE uses a targeted approach that is entirely focused on the five major root-causes underlying the current suboptimal performance of oral health care systems.

To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

The overall aims are:\n1. Improving the quality of life of the citizens, by offering the citizens a clean, safe, attractive, inclusive and affordable living environment.\n2. Reducing the environmental impacts of activities, by achieving a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, a major increase in the investment and usage of RES and an increase in the deployment of electric vehicles.\n3. Creating a stimulating environment for sustainable economic development, by generating more sustainable jobs, stimulating community involvement in smart solutions and to boost start-up and existing companies to exploit the opportunities of the green digital economy and Internet of Things.\nTo achieve the aims, a key innovation challenge in all three lighthouse cities of RUGGEDISED is to arrange successful combinations of integrated smart solutions for energy and e-mobility (enabled by ICT platforms and open data protocols) and business models with the right incentives for stakeholders to invest and participate in a smart society. Specific challenges relevant for the lighthouse cities are: \n- to manage peak load variation in thermal and electrical energy supply and demand; \n- to develop appropriate cooperation structures and business models for exchange of energy;\n- to develop Smart City (open) data platforms and energy management systems\n\nRUGGEDISED has derived 10 specific objectives and planned 32 smart solutions to meet the challenges.

Advances in the identification of highly performing solvents and solvent blends in CO2 absorption, the design of innovative separation equipment internals, and the development of optimal process configurations enable a cost of approximately 16 euros per ton of CO2 captured. Such achievement can have a tremendous impact in several industrial applications such as gas-fired, coal-fired, and lignite-fired power plants as well as quick-lime production plants where solvent based post-combustion CO2 absorption can become a viable solution.\nThe current project adopts a holistic approach towards the fulfillment of the outlined goals accomplished through research and development at multiple levels within an integrated framework.\nAt the molecular level, the use of computer aided molecular design tools supported by accurate and adequately validated thermodynamic models enables the exhaustive investigation of the performance of multiple solvents and solvent blends in post-combustion CO2 absorption processes. The solvent blends are systematically assessed and rank-ordered against their performance towards the satisfaction of relevant process, economic, operability and sustainability criteria. The optimal solvents and solvent blends are expected to exhibit significantly better characteristics than currently used solvents in terms of energy requirements and overall environmental impact.\nAt the unit operations level, the design of innovative process configurations and column internals that are specifically tailored for the employed solvents enhance the efficiency of the absorption based separation. Advanced modeling and optimization tools in conjunction with thorough experimental procedures ensure the achievement of high mass transfer rates and optimal flow patterns.\nAt the plant level, the comprehensive analysis of the interactions among an existing power plant and the added solvent based post-combustion CO2 capture unit enables the optimal allocation of resources for improved energy savings and the efficient integration of the new CO2 capture process components.\nPilot plant testing of the newly developed technology under operating condition encountered in practical applications ensures process stability and consistency.\nSeveral industrial applications in power production and chemicals manufacture are scheduled for comprehensive study, analysis, and evaluation thus resolving all related technical and engineering issues.", 85068.0, 2692402.0, 6, 12, "CAPSOL", "http://www.capsol-project.eu/", "http://www.scottishpower.com", null, "fp7_100978_967922358"], [1301616000000, 1367280000000, "Future INternet for Smart ENergY", "Scottishpower Energy Retail Limited", "The energy sector has entered a period of major change which will continue for many years to come. The increasing proportion of electricity from renewable sources means that the architecture of the energy grid will have to support the distributed, in addition to the centralised, generation of energy and to adapt to a highly volatile supply e.g. from wind and solar generators. From the consumption perspective, electric vehicles will demand new load management patterns in the grids.  At the same time, private and commercial consumers are being encouraged to reduce their energy use and electronics manufacturers are striving to reduce the energy use of their products.  The energy supply will need to evolve into a dynamic system to provide the smart energy infrastructure needed to support society in 2020 and beyond.<br/>Future Internet technologies will play a critical role in the development of Smart Energy infrastructures, enabling new functionality while reducing costs.
