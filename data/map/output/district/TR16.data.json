One of the main obstacles to the exploitation of natural fibres is the limited consistency of supply, with batch-to-batch variations in quality. Retting \u2013 a process whereby plant stems are left to weather in the fields \u2013 has been identified as being the weak point in fibre processing in the as a result of variable weather conditions during the retting period. Mechanical decortication \u2013 the removal of the outer layers \u2013 is often damaging to the fibres. UltraFibre will develop a clean processing technology called \u2018hydroacoutstic decorticaton\u2019 to extract the fibre from the plant after harvesting avoiding reliance on degree of dew retting. The fibre produced will be of much higher quality, without the physical damage caused by mechanical decortication, circumventing reliance on unpredictable weather for completion of dew retting in fields. Chemical treatments have been used to modify fibres to improve matrix to fibre adhesion in composite materials. However, these chemical treatments use hazardous materials, are time-consuming and create a significant level of waste. Therefore, a treatment process that does not pose a threat to the natural environment and that is reproducible, whilst creating little or no hazardous waste, would be extremely advantageous. To achieve this end, UltraFibre will develop a \u2018soft plasma\u2019 treatment process that will integrate with the hydroacoustic decortication process to produce high quality fibre for the rapidly expanding composites materials sector.", 164034.0, 1888991.0, 7, 14, "ULTRAFIBRE", "http://www.ultrafibre.org/", "http://www.movevirgo.co.uk", null, "fp7_94697_991761757"]]}}, "6QA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Outdoor learning - the way to understand each other better", "Highway farm activity centre LTD", 39529.0, 3, 3, "Project \"Outdoor learning - the way to understand each other better\" tries to answer the most important question: How to improve the quality of preschool education integrating outdoor learning on purpose to facilitate the integration process in the multicultural classrooms?\r\n\r\nThe project is going to improve the quality through connection of both - outdoor pedagogy and multicultural integration. Children conflicts, misunderstandings, sneer - often problem in multicultural environment among children in preschools. Because of this reason is decreasing the quality of education. Researchers from UK and USA have proved that children when they are outdoor are less aggressive, more creative and positive, so outdoor education form could be nice improvement of integration process in multicultural children groups. This integrated approach would help to increase the quality of preschool education level in multicultural environment. \r\n\r\nProject objective - improve the quality of preschool education with sharing new methods and best practice of outdoor learning integration into multicultural environment.\r\n\r\nThe project tasks:\r\n1) share the knowledge and raise the competence of employees (teacher and administrative staff) in outdoor education; \r\n2) share the knowledge and raise the competence of employees (teacher and administrative staff)  in multicultural integration;\r\n3) adapt outdoor pedagogy methods in multicultural preschool education environment.\r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to:\r\n- 420 preschool students (children) - the main target group\r\n- 52 preschool/school teachers and administrative staff \r\n- 3 preschool organizations (like institutions)\r\n- 760 parents\r\n- 30 relevant stakeholders\r\n\r\nProject participants of Learning/teaching/training activities (C1, C2, C3):\r\n1 teacher, 1 person of administrative staff from Lithuania (2 participants for each activity);\r\n1 teacher, 1 person of administrative staff from Turkey (2 participants for each activity);\r\n1 teacher, 1 person of administrative staff from United Kingdom (2 participants for each activity);\r\n\r\nDescription of Learning/teaching/training activities - C1, C2, C3 (each activity duration - 5 days +2 days traveling.):\r\nC1)  Program: Practical applicability of outdoor learning education method in multicultural preschool environment. \r\nProgram includes -Introduction of VSI Lauko darzelis, interactive multicultural event- \"Outdoor games - the way to understand each other\", training presenting of education quality based on outdoor education philosophy, outdoor learning integration to the public education sector, multicultural integration issues (expert), Interactive event (long hike in the regional park of Pavilniai), Job shadowing and open discussion, International partners sharing the best experience and practice.\r\n\r\nC2) Program: Practical applicability of outdoor learning education method in rural, Cornish preschool environment.\r\nProgram includes: Introduction of Little explorers outdoor preschool, community and meeting team presentation, Tour of the setting and spend a bit of time with the staff and children and seeing how this work, Interactive multicultural event with local community, Training - presenting of outdoor education philosophy from the U.K. and how that looks internationally, Hands on Outdoor curriculum ideas, activities, workshops so that project participants can take away ideas and start making changes, in order to deliver outstanding curriculum outdoors.
