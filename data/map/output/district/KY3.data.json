The project directly addresses all key objectives of the NMP.2010.1.2.1-2 topic.

Our highest priority and main objective  is to increase our teacher's competence and boost confidence in delivering exposure to Modern Languages. \r\n\r\nNumber/Profile of Participants\r\nAfter a presentation of the project, 2 of our teachers were identified as having a clear need to increase their language skills to allow them to gain greater confidence in delivering languages as part of the new curriculum.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nTo complement the training provided by the local authority, the 2 teachers will take part in  language immersion activities in Spain. The course content will have to be adapted to meet the needs of our teachers provided - language teaching methodology in Early Years Education combined with gaining enhanced skills in the target language, therefore boosting confidence in speaking the target language.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used:\r\nAs head teacher I have identified with my teachers their development needs and looked for  high quality providers to run immersion courses abroad in conjunction with the Consejeria de Educacion.\r\nTogether we have developed the course content to the specific needs of our teachers' requirements in line with advice for the new national curriculum in Scotland.\r\nAs head teacher I will monitor the experience of the course - there will be an evaluation of participants by the course provider\r\nand a evaluation of course  by participants:\r\nThrough the evaluation of the course and the subsequent interview with each participating teacher I expect to get a clear picture of how successful / effective the course was.\r\n\r\nDescription of results/impact envisaged:\r\nAs head teacher I expect  longer term benefits as we are looking forward to our teachers becoming more fluent and more confident in their understanding and talking of the target language. Our pupils will greatly benefit from an enthused teacher who is able to speak accurately in the target language and will learn about foreign cultures first hand.", null, "Kinghorn Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002061_coordinator"]]}}}}
