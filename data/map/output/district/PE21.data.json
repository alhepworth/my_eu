Its objective is to identify ways to improve the education and inclusion of these students, to strengthen their skills in the language of the host country, to allow access to culture and facilitate employment, to better train teachers of French as a Second Language (FSL) and all teachers who participate in the inclusion of these students in regular curricula. \r\n \r\nThe consortium counts 24 members and cooperates with 13 international host institutions. Different profiles of staff are concerned by the inclusion of migrant pupils and students not speaking the language of the host country, and participate in the project: teachers involved in UPE2A \u2013 classes meant for newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, regular class teachers, senior management teams of schools and executives of the local education authority of Strasbourg, inspectors and pedagogical counsellors, \r\nproject managers of different departments of the local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe welcoming and training practices in Alsace are managed by the CASNAV - academic centre for the schooling of newly arrived students and students from traveling families - and can be enriched according to each situation - initiation, improvement, enhancement, broadening, diversification) by the expertise of our European partners and the devices they have put in place.\r\n \r\nThis is why the local education authority of Strasbourg has decided to set up a consortium to apply for an Erasmus + mobility project, in accordance with European values and its regional educational priorities: inclusion in schools, social integration, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality, employability of youngsters, fighting against school dropout and radicalization.\r\n \r\nThe host organizations were selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- diversity of their experiences in the field of welcoming migrants, refugees, asylum seekers not speaking the languages of the host countries, \r\n- situations in countries which are first faced with massive waves of migrants;\r\n- quality of the historical cooperation that binds them to the local education authority of Strasbourg\r\nTaking into account the destinations of the mobility and therefore the choice of the host partner for each delegation, the steering committee considered it relevant to take into account the matching with the teaching cycle, the level and the specialization of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to carry out 128 mobility for the staff of the whole education authority of Strasbourg according to 3 strategic levels:\r\n- level of institutional steering;\r\n- level of management of schools;\r\n- school level of EANA - newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country.\r\n \r\nThe activities will consist in work-shadowing lessons, shared teaching and exchanging of best practices, meetings with local, institutional or non-profit organization partners. They will cover the practical aspects of hosting migrants, teaching, methods and material, also the transmission of European values and access to culture and to different forms of artistic expression that are the roots of social cohesion and democracy as well as the education to citizenship.\r\n \r\nThe result of the mobility project will fuel an analysis and a reflection on transferable practices in our local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe eTwinning platform will be the tool of choice for the organization and communication of the project. This platform will serve as a means of exchanging, sharing and disseminating the results.\r\n \r\nThe expected impacts are at three levels:\r\n - academic steering and institutional management of welcoming migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country, \r\n- the management of schools in terms of welcoming strategy;\r\n- support of newly arrived pupils and students who have newly arrived in the class and their inclusion in the regular curricula.\r\n\r\nThe transferable practices that we have observed during the mobility will make it possible to improve the education of newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and their inclusion in the regular curricula to allow a fluent schooling and follow up of the newcomers in regular classes. To put it in a nutshell, all pupils and students with special needs will benefit from the results. \r\nGiven the current political and climatic trends, it is highly likely that the migration phenomenon towards Europe will keep increasing in the forthcoming years.

Therefore, the students of all participating European countries create an online platform for sharing the information with their peers. Beside the competencies that they acquired in class concerning their choice of career, the students use their experiences and their insights which they gain from being hosts for a workshop with visitors from abroad. These workshops take place in the five participating countries and show the participants the \u201cpath from the chosen course of study to enrolment\u201d abroad. The students gain practical experience in the process of their application by giving presentations, taking part in consultations, acting out role plays, filling in forms, and taking part in discussions with their hosts. A \u201cday at uni\u201d with information about organizational aspects of the course of study, possibilities of getting financial help, as well as panel discussions with foreign students at each partner university complement the project. \r\nExperiencing everyday life and country specific living conditions in host families abroad describe the framework of a stay abroad. The contacts the students made can be helpful for commencing studies abroad in the future. The host students and teachers plan, organise and accompany the stay (the same framework for all countries!). They use the time of the stay to create, edit or complement materials (worksheets, videos, interviews, reports, contacts etc.) for the online platform.
