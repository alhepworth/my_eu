The partnership aims at uniting the strength of five European schools from the same number of respective states, bringing forth their own past and their own gathered experience during WW II, thus helping the young to tightly connect with history and its deeper meanings by using an open, correct and balanced approach. \r\nThe objectives of our project (developing active citizenship, basic and transversal skills, promoting innovative methods in education, developing international partnerships) result from the needs identified in the five partner institution. \r\nThus, the theme of our project offers the students and teachers directly involved and the communities of the partner schools valuable support in developing observable relevant competences such as: communicating in English, IT skills or development of international partnership, but also civic competences. Ensuring the equality of chances and eliminating any type of discrimination will be aimed at through the development of teamwork skills at a national and international level. All the above will contribute to developing active citizenship among young people.\r\nThe target group will be formed of high-school students (15-18) and teachers of different specialization (History, Social studies, Religion, Literature, etc.). In order to counter-balance the difficulties raised by the complexity of the topic we propose a different approach through non-formal educational activities, such as the Living Library and the Forum Theatre, in which over 100 students and 10 teachers from each partner institution will be involved. \r\nIn the case of the Living Library method innovatively adapted to our project, the students will discuss with survivors of WW II or witnesses of its effects and they will function as resource people (Living Books) for their classmates who may wish to find out more about the WW II realities and the impact on people. The Forum Theatre, in which students from the 5 partner schools will be directly involved after research (books, films, interviews, study visits, etc.), consists in dramatizing different relevant situations and then participating to the debate of the matters in question.\r\nAnother activity is the founding and functioning of the Club for Peace and Conflict Mediation in each of the partner school, aiming to reduce violence and discrimination in schools and in the community, thus promoting and developing competences such as: tolerance, multiculturalism, openness towards understanding others and towards ethnical religious social diversity, etc.\r\nThe teachers will devise and hold two open lessons with interdisciplinary approaches to WW II. \r\nWe estimate numerous results with relevant benefits for students, teachers and their respective communities and, in this context, the 3 Intellectual Outputs (\u201eListen Past \u2013 True Stories from WW II\u201d Book, Methodological Brochure \u2013 \u201eNon-formal activities in Education with applications on WW II\u201d, \u201cWW II \u2013 Educational Resources\u201d platform) will contribute to their maximisation.\r\nThrough direct involvement in the project activities, the students and teachers will improve specific competences regarding the topics at hand during the activities and will reflect upon the way in which a major conflict can affect the lives of all those involved and the evolution of the society they are party of. \r\nAt the level of the whole partnership there will be a good practice transfer, including between the management teams of the project, a transfer which would create the premises for successful and long term partnership in the future.\r\nThe creation of a tradition in developing project activities will widen the impact, involving hundreds of students in each partner school from the first stage alone, and then, indirectly, the entire community which they are part of. The gained experience will be shared with other students, teachers, parents, representatives of the local communities, in order to improve the school\u2019s image and its relationship with relevant stakeholders.\r\nWe strongly believe that through the obtained results within the project we shall support students in becoming global learners on the long term, endowed with: ways of thinking (creativity and innovation, critical thinking, learning skills), ways of working (communication and collaboration), tools for working (information literacy, media literacy, ICT literacy), skills for living properly in the world (citizenship, personal and social responsibility).

The \u201cSong for Europe\u201d will be developed, rehearsed and recorded step by step at the teaching and learning activities taking place in England, Spain, Turkey and Germany. In addition to the music recording a video is produced giving an insight of the production of the song as well as the cultural backgrounds of the countries. The highlight of the project will be the final concert in Hamburg, Germany - the \u201cSong of Europe\u201d played live by students from all participating schools \u2013 and the music video of the \u201cSong of Europe\u201d which will be released on YouTube (and further websites). For further impact the playback will be available as a free download so that other schools in Europe follow our example and create more verses for the \u201cSong of Europe\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs the majority of the student body of the participating schools can be described as socially as well as racially diverse and disadvantaged, social integration and the integration of refugees play an important role.  A further objective is to show that we all share similarities - no matter where we were born, where we have grown up, which language(s) we speak - thus combat discrimination and racism. Expected results are an increase in tolerance, democratic behavior and awareness of the EU.\r\n\r\nA special focus will be put on the work of the lyrics: the teachers of the language departments are asked to work with the students on different topics and themes concerning Europe and thus support them in the acquisition of skills and competences concerning language learning and EU awareness. The goal is to build on the diversity found in today's increasingly multilingual classrooms. In addition, during the activities as well as the transnational teaching and learning activities social and intercultural skills will improve.  Last but not least, composing, arranging and playing music together is the heart of the project. Music is a language understood by everyone. It is the medium young people often feel comfortable in to express themselves.  While taking place in the project they will not only improve their skills in vocals and playing instruments, but acquire special (IT-) skills in the field of composing, producing and recording a song in the field of music.\r\n\r\nThis project will be put into practice transnationally to encourage the students to find similarities concerning human values as well as common ground concerning their problems and challenges in life. Social disadvantages as well racial prejudices appear in all the countries and we thus have to work together on integration and sensitize the students for that matter. Especially the field of music has a tremendous potential to unify people. It is a language understood by everyone, no matter which mother tongue(s) each individual speaks.

Thus, keeping in mind the existent diversity in the eligible school in relation to religion, socail status, cultural level and individual competences; from our school we expect to learn and improve our already undergo programmes\r\nso that, integration succeeds and what is better than such an experienced parter whose school is seat od a wide diversity in culture and linguistics.\r\nTherefore, we have proposed two teachers who due to their profile best suits this project. On the one hand, one is technical agrarian tecaher and tutor in FPB. This is a group that comes from a school failure in ESO and teh tecaher's job here is essential to reconduct them towards ending the secondasry education school first, and then show them the way to further studies or to the world of work, which implies internships. On the other hand, the other is the Coordiantor in Formation, an English teacher in ESO and Spanish and Catalan teacher in the group above mentioned, FPB. All along her career she has been tutor of many different groups, she has laso taken part in programmes such as PROA and the fact that the eligible partner belongs to an English-speaking country goes beyond and  improves the project objectives. Since one never stops learning, the linguistic competence, English in this case, is going to be improved and, thus, making our SS beneficiaries of  the knowledge acquired. Since in the target school there are a wide number of foreigners, the English language is learnt as a foreing for them too; therefore, on of the main objectives in relation to this factor is the study of different strategies and tools used in order to adjust them to our SS.\r\nToday, our school has several innovating and interdisciplrina on the go witihin the Contrato-Programa, being both participants on them. Among the several actions, there is a need to mention: honey and ecologic tomatoes production, management and development of thenew library to enhance reading skills, paths and forest routes in cooperation with the Town Hall, charity cooperation with ASPROMIVISE (occupational workshop for disabled people), taking part in 4 eTwinning projects (Greece, Norway, England and Hong Kong). Through job shadowing, benefits are not only for participants, but for the whole school, from teachers to SS. In order to succeed, we will plan an assessment intrument and basic objectives to be accomplished, so that when the participants return form their stay, they could explain to the rest of teachers their experience and everyone can get benefits form it. Thus, they might create a kind of memo with images, recordings and comments of target teaches and SS (like a photo story) that clearly ummarises the methodology used in the target school, different problem-solving situations englobing integration, school abandonment and failure, strategies in TEFL, actions in and extra curricular ( as the charity breakfast at the target school).\r\nThis memo can also be worked through SS tutorials analizing the actions at the target school and improving their English at the same time. To achieved the expected results, before the job shadowing, real school abandonment and failure cases would be studied in depth, SS would be assessed in English;  so that, on their way back, teaches would put into practice what they have learnt in relation to integration, school abandonment and failure; on the other hand, new teaching methodologies would be launched and wherever it is considered, the same assessment would be held during one or two years in order to see the evolution.\r\nResults cannot be seen a-working-day, so the monitoring must be thorough.\r\nTo sum up, this job shadowing is just one step on our race towards success. Next step would be a KA2, so that our SS can benefit one from each other of the acquired experience of our teachers. So, obviouslty, keeping in forming our teachers is a duty so that they can \r\nproyect on our SS their wisdom and talents and, therefore, make our SS adults ready for the  work life.", "http://www.tisbham.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-015270_1"]]}}}}
