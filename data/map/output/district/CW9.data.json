This requires an in-depth understanding of all stakeholders\u2019 roles (Generation and flexibility providers, Transmission system operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSO) and regulators) at all system levels (interconnected system, national transmission and distribution sub-systems and consumers).\n\nFor doing so, EU-SysFlex joins a multidisciplinary team of 34 partners from 14 European countries, led by the (Transmission System Operators) TSOs representing four different synchronous systems that integrate the pan-European interconnected electricity system: EirGrid & SONI (Ireland), PSE (Poland), AST (Latvia), Elering (Estonia), supported by the necessary (Distribution System Operators) DSOs, technology providers, and research & experienced entities. In addition, a group of three other European TSOs: Fingrid (Finland), LitGrid (Lithuania) and Ceps (Czech Republic), will join the advisory board of the project, in addition to EDSO for Smart Grids and USEF, in order to help the project maximising its impact.", 65347.0, 23107105.0, 15, 34, "EU-SysFlex", null, null, null, "h2020_212400_915498417"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "UPSIDE ENERGY LTD", 65344.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (32.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_902"]]}}}}
