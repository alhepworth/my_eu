A distinctive feature of these mature forests is the 'granny pines' with their thick knarled trunks and large canopies, some of which are over 400 years old. Unlike the commercial pine plantations we see nowadays, these ancient forests support a very rich diversity of animals and plants which makes them a priority habitat under the EU Directive. However, the forests have, over the centuries, sustained a massive reduction through a combination of socio-economic and natural causes and, today continue to suffer from overgrazing, burning and mismanagement. High populations of red deer, in particular, are a serious obstacle to their natural regeneration. With no more than 1% of their original range left and much of this is in a degraded, senescent and isolated state of low regenerative capacity, a concerted effort of both government and non-governmental organisations is vital if the remaining stands are to be brought back to a level that makes them viable in the long term.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=131", null, "life_319"]]}}}}
