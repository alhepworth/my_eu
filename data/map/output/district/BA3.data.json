Most countries have developed their own training courses fitted to the local regulations or in some countries there is no educational means at all. But people who work on this profession often have the same technical knowledge and competence all around European Union, but even though they can not work abroad without starting the process of gaining permission to blast from the beginning in each different country. As this problem is real and affects many countries, international companies and different industries in wider sense the European Federation of Explosives Engineers - EFEE decided to create a technical competency certificate for shot firers to make it possible for them to prove their skills and competencies in order to work abroad without going through additional learning processes. In 2008 the ESSEEM- (European Shotfirer Standard Education for Enhanced Mobility) under the program of Leonardo da Vinci project proposed by EFEE -( the European Federation of Explosive Engineers) developed a Powerpoint material organized in 6 chapters, in English. With this project called PECCS - Pan European Competency Certificate for Shot firers /blast designers, EFEE's aim is to create a course, according to the valid European Shotfirer Requirements, for a standardized assessment of technical competencies for the shot firer / blast designer profession in European Union.The Course will be based on a material with 6 chapters from a previous project and an additional chapter will be added about tunneling, the materials will be worked through and modernized if necessary. During this project all partners collaborate to add exercises, exams to the materials and all this will be put together for a course which also will be available as online course in order to reach as many people as possible. The outcomes of this project: the materials with examining questions, exercises, the course based on these materials and the online courses, will be available on the internet for free on www.shotfirer.eu. In order to maintain a good quality and appropriate educational outcome of the courses we will create a Guidebook based on the learning material for trainers and shot firers who want to learn independently online. The examining questions and courses will be tested and validated by specialists. Those who successfully pass exams after they have followed the course, can apply for a Pan-European Competency Certificate from EFEE. The certificate will be acknowledged in all EFEE member countries. By doing this we wish to improve the overall level of knowledge and skills of shot firers in order to improve the safety at work and give good knowledge of environmental friendly techniques and innovative skills. The course will consist of modernized learning materials, practical exercises and exams, composed to educational level 4 according to the European Qualification Framework.Our aim is not to change any existing regulations but to create a possibility of proving real and good technical competencies in this profession in different European Union countries. This will also, to a high degree, increase the overall safety when handling explosives and better awareness of the environment for those who work in quarries or mines.The work will be done by partners, who have good and long experience on this area of expertise. The outcomes will be validated and approved by specialists who have well acknowledged background on this subject. The partner countries represented are United Kingdom, France, Czech Republic, Portugal, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Estonia. The project will be carried out in three years, starting in the autumn 2016.After the end of the project, all created materials will be maintained and kept available by EFEE who will take care of the web page created during this project, the online course and certifications.", "http://www.demrock.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA202-022057_5"]]}}, "3AL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "EUROPE: Experimentando Unidos Replanteamos Objetivos Para Educar", "The Partnership Trust", 40219.0, 4, 6, "Context\r\nOur project \u201cEUROPE: Experiencing United we Consider Aims To Educate\u201d, is designed to give an answer to our institutional needs, a public school of SEN of the city of Valencia, Spain. It has 188 pupils (3 to 21 years), with serious and permanent SEN. In our school we are 70 professionals working hard to achieve the highest levels of autonomy and independence for our students, that allow them to participate in their social environment, in tight collaboration with their families, who are very important in this process. We also have an adapted basic qualification training programme. \r\n\r\nNecessities and aims\r\nOn one hand, our pupils\u2019 heterogeneity requires that all the professionals do a continuous learning on many different fields for attending the students,e.g.: augmentative and alternative systems of communication, intervention in conduct, sensory integration, music therapy, basal stimulation and multisensory stimulation, transition to the working life period\u2026On the other hand, the Administration is aiming to the adoption of functions as resources schools by the SEN schools, so that we support the mainstream schools of our environment for attending their students with SEN.\r\n\r\nThe learning aims of our project refer, on the one hand, to autism and specific motor disability  methodologies, teaching practices promoting creativity and innovation, music therapies, language therapies, sensory therapies, behavioral therapies... and, on the other hand, programmes for the transition to the working life period. We could get to know educational systems that promote inclusion, where SEN schools  are resource institutions, and see how they organize and manage it. Finally, this project also aims to improve the linguistic competence of our professionals, to promote the international dimension of our school and to establish synergies with other organizations for new projects in the future.\r\n\r\nProfessionals' profile \r\nFor designing and developing the project, we count with 14 professionals who carry out different functions: therapeutic pedagogy teachers, hearing and language teachers, physical education teachers, a music teacher, a community worker and a guiding psychologist. Most of the staff, also has coordination tasks:  stages, services, projects... In addition, the management team has also been involved in its planning and development.\r\n\r\nMobilities\r\nThe project will take 2 years: from June 2018 to May 2020, during which the professionals will carry out different mobilities:\r\n-4 professionals will participate in an English course during the month of July 2018 to improve their language competence and \r\n-2 in a course on the use of art as therapy. \r\n-In addition, there will be other courses linked to the objectives of our project related to creativity and arts, involving 2 persons and          -another course related with inclusion and SEN in which 3 people will participate\r\n\r\nThe job shadowing mobilities from September 2018 to May 2020:\r\n-Two will be in Bath (United Kingdom) where 2 people will visit a school that cares for pupils with autism and they also have an employability project. \r\n-The other school is a creative one that will visit 2 people. Both institutions serve as resources schools in their context supporting the attention of students with SEN.\r\n-In Dorset (United Kingdom) 3 people will visit a school that provides education for students with autism and develops specific methodologies as: music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy...\r\n\r\n-Finally, in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 (Finland) we will visit 2 schools:\r\n-1preschool and primary education and another for professional training, 3 and 2 people respectively. The first offers counselling, assessment and rehabilitation services.The second one, points out for inclusion, with programmes that prepare for the students\u2019 incorporation to their working life period.\r\n-In Horsens (Denmark), 2 person will visit a school for young people who need help to find a job.\r\n\r\nDissemination activities\r\nAll the mobilities will end with dissemination activities:highlights of the experiences on our homepage, facebook of the parents association, communication media, training courses led by the participants in our and in other schools, awareness-raising activities with students of degrees and of Magisterium or Pedagogy, Conferences on dissemination of good practices in SEN schools...\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nTo conclude, the development of our project will result in a personal and professional enrichment, for the participants and for the rest of the staff of our Institution, which will help us to improve the quality of our work. This will directly affect our students\u2019 life quality and of their families, as well as the schools of our environment where we will spread this project or where we can support caring their students.

There is today a growing proportion of caretakers, who are of different ethnic background. It creates some challenges within a discipline where values, attitudes and communication are very important to the work environment and to the user-experience. Most European countries are lacking ways to strengthen employees' ability to manage multicultural workplaces. Furthermore, the project partners' experience that there are special circumstances in the care sector, which impedes the acquisition of new skills. Professor Dominique Bouchet from the Department of Marketing and Management at the University of Southern Denmark has for many years done research in cultural differences in workplaces, and he has developed educational material for employees in the integration sector. The material consists of videos, description of small cases and questions for group discussions etc. that supports a dialogue about the caretakers daily activities and these activities relation to more general values. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is intended that this teaching material will be the inspirational source to adapt training programmes especially dedicated for the employees in the Caresector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project's aim is to strengthen nursing staff skills in managing different value systems in so called \"Care Groups\" and also to strengthen the nursing staff ability to communicate with people, who receive Careservices. So the target group for this project is the nursing staff in nursing homes or engaged with nursing people in their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operational objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n1) Caregivers have achieved new key competences in connection with discussions of value systems in relation to their current and future needs\r\n\r\n2) Employees perceive that they have been presented with new methods employees experience that opens their readiness to learn in the future\r\n\r\n3) To adjust and evaluate new teaching methods to support improvements in formal and informal vocational education and training systems\r\n\r\n4) In general, to be better to deal with cultural differences and create a greater readiness in relation to changes in the cultural maps on their job.\r\n\r\n5) Facilitating adjustment within the care sectors vocational training through the transfer of knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n6) Improving the interaction between vocational training with learning in practice in different national contexts . \r\n\r\n7) Improve the effect in everyday work situations by putting together a curriculum with an interaction between workplace and school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium is structured so it involves a care organization and an educational institution from Germany, Italy, UK and Denmark. In addition, LederForum Denmark participates as coordinator and external facilitator of the project results. This external communication occurs through the European organization EDE, representing leaders and providers of continuing care for the elderly.
