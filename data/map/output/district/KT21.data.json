The project responds to the urgent need to monitor and map time-dependent hazard and vulnerability, by triangulating space-based and in-situ data-collection, according to the type and extent of the natural hazard. The project will analyse the data needs of the end users through the three civil protection partners.\nA novel sampling framework will be developed that guides the in-situ data collection and integration process. Novel in-situ data collection tools (e.g. omni-directional imaging) will be included. Advanced analysis and processing of current and future space-based products will enhance the approach. Uncertainties will be fully considered. Soon-to-be-released space products such as DLR Global Urban Footprint will be validated and their integration with the proposed methodologies explored. Data needs for post-disaster recovery will be addressed within the same framework, resulting in a comprehensive methodological solution to the monitoring of time-varying indicators at multiple spatial scales throughout the disaster cycle.\nThe consortium of 8 prominent scientific institutions and highly skilled SMEs has considerable experience in their respective fields. Many partners currently collaborate on the Global Earthquake Model Inventory Data Collection Tool (GEM IDCT). The ultimate goal is to produce a multi-resolution time varying indicator monitoring framework that applies to the whole disaster cycle. The framework is intended to become the de-facto standard for future mapping of vulnerabilities.", 154016.0, 2019873.0, 6, 8, "SENSUM", "http://www.sensum-project.eu/home", "http://www.imagecatinc.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153712.jpg", "fp7_106561_958432460"]]}}}}
