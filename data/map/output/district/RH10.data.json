The idea for this project came from the very positive feedback from students and accompanying staff following the mobility project developed by our Construction department. The current project aims to further internationalise our college by inviting several departments to send out students. We find it important that our students gain European experience and see their profession in a European context and thus contribute to the objectives of Education and Training established in the ET2020 strategy.  The Europass Mobility Document and the Certificate of Attendance issued by the German partners at the end of the mobility programme will be a plus in the learners' portfolio, fostering their personal and professional development.The training content is tailor made for each flow/curricular area and  includes learning new green technologies for the construction and automotive sectors as used in Germany, learning traditional methods of sheet metal work used side by side with modern techniques such as laser cutting, learning to work in an international business environment , learning local cuisine-specific processes and hands-on practice in German companies. Germany has been chosen for our mobility project because we would like our students and accompanying staff to experience the German \u00b4dual \u00b4vocational training system, which is seen as a successful European model of vocational training and which results in one of the lowest youth unemployment rate in the EU. As far as the project \u00b4s impact is concerned, the immediate benefits would include: increased self confidence for our students, losing their fear of travelling or job searching abroad, opening their horizons through travelling abroad, learning about a different culture and comparing work-related and other mentalities. The envisaged long term impact at participant level would be that the learning outcomes from this overseas work experience will enhance the participants\u00b4 opportunity for future employment in both the UK and the European labour market.At organisational level  we hope this project will lead to the possibility for developing other mobility, or partnership projects in the future. We expect that the positive experience with developing an Erasmus+ project, shared through the dissemination of the project\u00b4s results,  will encourage other colleges in our area to develop similar projects as part of their internationalisation plan .

Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

The integration and interpretation, plus a validation of key features observed, will be made by the corresponding national Geological Survey for the towns concerned.  It is planned to deliver the service for two Urban Atlas towns in each country of the EU (Luxembourg and Cyprus only 1), equalling fifty-two towns in total.  The geological survey concerned will choose the towns for processing from the Urban Atlas list using their own knowledge as to where the information will be of most use, probably the largest towns, which, when extrapolated, would equal (13% of total EU urban population).  User input to design will be facilitated by the Surveys contracted into the project and initiation of  \u2018Local Authority Feedback Group\u2019.\n\nTerrafirma has shown the potential for the self-sustainability of services providing InSAR-derived terrain-motion data, as 30% of users have gone on to procure further product on a commercial basis.  In PanGeo, it is anticipated that, by adding considerably more value as described above, and promoting the clear benefits of such key environmental information, that the local authorities of neighbouring towns will begin to demand similar.", 81833.0, 2707803.0, 28, 43, "PANGEO", "http://www.pangeoproject.eu/", "http://www.cgg.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/156084.jpg", "fp7_97900_949405640"], [1456790400000, 1582934400000, "Understanding subduction zone topography through modelling of coupled shallow and deep processes", "Cgg Services (Uk) Limited", "The SUBITOP ETN is a framework for training and career development of young researchers in Geodynamics, Geophysics, Geology and Geomorphology.  It has a scientific focus on the dynamics of continental margins where tectonic plates are recycled through subduction.

The Training Network will imbue 15 young scientists with the ability to address the links between the geological processes within subduction zones and the processes that impact the Earth\u2019s surface above, using a comprehensive range of modelling and observation techniques and exploiting the full diversity of active and ancient subduction systems within Europe.\nSUBITOP fuses research and training at ten leading centres of the Earth Sciences in Europe and forges partnerships with 15 companies for its fellows, with participants in eight countries. It will train Early Stage Researchers (ESR) through a structured programme of cross-disciplinary, collaborative research, and integrated skills and outreach activities. This experience-based training is centred on PhD projects, covering a spectrum of topics from the deep mechanics of subduction zones to the erosion of their uplifted topography. Together the projects probe the functioning of the subduction system in its entirety, and they are welded together by shared techniques, study sites and data sets. Through their projects, the ESRs will acquire skills in modelling and observation of coupled processes in complex geological systems.
