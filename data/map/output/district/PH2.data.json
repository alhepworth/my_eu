In addition, the participants feel that with French being the main language introduced in to the primary schools in our Authority, their knowledge of French language and culture would need to be improved in order to help meet the needs of the school in all aspects. The most important aspect being the creation of enthusiastic and motivated learners of all ages. On completion of the Course, the participants will be instrumental in developing the learning and teaching of languages following the Local Authority's strategy for the 1+2 Approach.\r\n\r\nIn time, the participants will lead on developments to ensure links with European countries to further raise awareness and bring to life the cultural dimension of the language learning. This in turn would lead to connections from pupil to pupil and teacher to teacher in each country. This will also help in developing the use of IT as a learning tool for pupils and to realise its importance in making such connections. The participants would also be expected to encourage IT in connecting and exchanging with schools nearer to home, across our cluster. This will further help foster the idea that our children are Europeans as well as Scottish, British or Polish for example.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also be expected to be the language \"champions\" within the school, acting as models of good practice and providing support and guidance both on an individual as well as a school level through in-house and cluster collegiate times for example. The ideas, methodologies and resources provided on the Immersion Course will play a big part in this. Knowledge gained from visiting a French School will also provide topics for discussion both in terms of practice and its education system in general.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also be given the responsibility of co-ordinating the dissemination of information to parents along with the Head Teacher. This will be firstly in the form of a Parents' information evening where the 1+2 Approach will be delivered along with its rationale for their children, both now and for their future. Suggested resources, websites and activities will be made known to them for their own perusal. It would be expected that with increasing confidence among teaching staff, they too would be able to give some input about what is happening at each stage of the school if appropriate.\r\n\r\nA whole school approach and policy to the learning and teaching of languages involving all teaching and support staff and SMT in conjunction with the Local Authority is expected to have a considerable positive impact on the learning and teaching of languages. It will be designed to ensure increased motivation and enthusiasm in staff and pupils alike and make the learning more meaningful and relevant than in the past. The whole question of the European dimension being brought in to policy and practice will also serve to increase the importance of Modern Foreign languages once again in our society.\r\n\r\nThe Head Teacher will rigorously monitor the participants work, both in terms of her own practice regarding the planning and school development as well as her own classroom practice in relation to all aspects of the Immersion Course she attended. The Head Teacher will also look for improved quality resources and ensure that these are being used and meet the needs of all staff and pupils Most importantly they must be seen to be having an impact on the achievement and attainment in the school.  Continuous monitoring of the learning and teaching of languages (French) within the whole school will be measured through observations and the development  of the whole school approach. \r\n\r\nIt will be imperative that the participants continue to engage with the Course Provider's online network to continue the sharing of good practice on a bigger scale.", null, "Dunning Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002186_coordinator"]]}}, "7EY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Language Training", "Kinnoull Primary School", 8788.0, 1, 1, "This project is to support our school meet the National, Tayside , Perth & Kinross , cluster schools and our own school priorities in delivering modern languages as part of the 1 +2 approach.

Continuous monitoring of learning and teaching of languages (French) will be udertaken in a variety of ways including classroom observations, learning rounds, moderation of practice, pupil discussion groups and parent feedback to measure the impact of the project and identify next steps.

The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species.

This project proposes to foster entrepreneurship, from an early age, and the idea that anyone has the capability of being an inventor.  It aims to inspire young people, build on their sense of initiative and to show them that through team work, cooperation, hard work and good leadership, they will be the next generation of inventors.

Due to the nature of this project local manufacturing, marketing, media and business organisations such as the Chambers of Commerce will also be involved.The project has been carefully planned around meetings and tangible, achievable outcomes.  The following activities will take place during the lifetime of the project:- Project blog - this will detail the project progress on a weekly basis-Logo-Erasmus Corner at each school -Inventors and invention research - pupils from each school will undertake research on inventors and inventions from their own country in their own language.  They will create fact sheets and presentations which can then be used to go into an e-book. - Production of a multi-lingual, multi media E-book will be produced.  - Pupils from all partner schools will replicate some of the inventions which they have researched.  This creating models of inventions will be filmed and photographed with a view to creating a \"virtual museum of inventions\".Production of a \"virtual museum\"video. - Competition time! Each school will set up a competition inviting pupils to think of an invention and to present their ideas.  There will be a competition held at each school.  This competition will be filmed.  The winning team from each country will bring their ideas to the next partnership meeting. - manufacturing of the pupils inventions -  An assembly presenting the inventions involving staff, pupils, parents, governors,press will be held.  The next phase of the project will be discussed, including the production of the E-Book on inventions. - Ebook of inventions produced and the manual on product design will be prepared and written. The impact of this project on teaching staff and pupils will be hugely beneficial both in terms of being able to work on a meaningful cross-curricular project in school and trans-nationally.  It will increase both staff and pupils sense of initiative and entrepreneurship and will enable them to learn and practise a variety of foreign languages.  The skills learned from this project will stay with the pupils as they go into the world of work thus increasing their employability and confidence.  As pupils will have been working closely together with and visiting partner schools this will create a better understanding of different social and cultural diversity.
