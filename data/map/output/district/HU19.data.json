'This is an essential component for a successful, professional and social life.' (European commission, thematic working group, 2010-2013) So many pupils of primary age are underachieving, up to 20% of young Europeans are not reaching a minimum level of skills in mathematics and science. In Ofsted, raising standards, improving lives report, (UK) it was found that when planned and implemented well, learning outside the classroom contributed significantly to raising standards and improving pupils' personal, social and emotional development.  It is thought that learning outside the classroom can make learning more vivid and interesting for pupils and enhance their understanding. This project will address the under-achievement  in key areas of our curriculum and through training, help us to develop ways to motivate children's learning and motivation. Linking the outdoor experiences as stimulii for maths, literacy and science work will improve the quality of the pupils work.   There will be 8 partners involved in this project. England, Belgium, Spain (Tenerife), Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy and Denmark. The partner schools are made up of different types (public, private, big and small) from various economical and social backgrounds. This will have a greater impact on the project in relation to experiences, training and outcomes because of precious experience, needs in their schools and expertise to offer through planned training events and shared ideas for dissemination. A wider range of innovative learning ideas will be experienced by using these partners. Some partner schools include a pre-school, important for the early development of key skills. This will be incorporated into training activities planned. The activities will include short term training programs, transnational meetings for coordinators to maintain organisation of the project and activities putting training into practice and high quality materials. This will include data to measure impact such as questionnaires, numbers of participants of training events, training materials for others, DVD's of evidence of materials, blog linked to schools websites. We hope that Methodology to be used to carry out the project will include how the outdoors can have potential on out children's learning. We will use our rich urban and rural environments and we will endeavor to use these to maximize and enhance our children's learning experiences. The rich cultural differences in learning styles and experiences that this project can offer to staff and pupils where possible, we hope will embed progressive and sustainable learning opportunities in our curriculum's through learning about each others initiatives and innovative projects. Well planned activities of this kind, when well planned, can help develop the skills of enquiry, critical thinking, and reflection required for our children to meet the social, economical and environmental changes of life in a rapidly changing EuropeWhen we have shared ideas and initiatives and training specific to our institutions and European countries we hope this will cause a motivation in our attitudes to teaching, impacting on the pupils learning and therefore causing a 'buzz' that can only be experinced in the teaching profession in an energizing project such as this. The results will be vast for all involved within the project due to experience of European projects and an understanding of the importance of dissemination tasks to reach a wide audience to have a long lasting effect and really make us change our views on what we can teach, learn and experience 'beyond the classroom walls'.", "http://www.withernseaprimary.co.uk", "Withernsea Primary School Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024434_coordinator"], [2018, "Job-shadowing - sd\u00edlen\u00ed zku\u0161enost\u00ed", "Withernsea Primary School Academy", 20907.0, 8, 10, "Job-shadowing - sharing experience\r\nZ\u00e1kladn\u00ed a Mate\u0159sk\u00e1 \u0161kola Kl\u00ed\u010d s.r.o. decided to put this project into motion in order to keep progressing towards long-term aims, which include development of methodology and European plan of development.\r\nThe project has two major objectives: to develop competences for using other innovative methods during classes and to gain a wider perspective on sharing pedagogical competences in European framework. Lately, many staff members (both teachers and management of the school) have made progress in honing their language skills. We would like to take advantage of that to also develop other than language-related skills.\r\nNine of our teachers will participate in job-shadowing in nine different schools in Great Britain, Finland, Hungary, Greece, Lithuania, Spain and Cyprus, which will focus on innovative teaching methods. The school were carefully chosen according to their expertize and experience. These teachers will also become \u201cmentors\u201d and will actively participate in implementing the new methods into the teaching process according to the conditions of the school.\r\nThanks to the fact that job-shadowing will also be attended by the management of the school, represented by the headmaster of the elementary school Kl\u00ed\u010d, an environment encouraging a positive change of the work of not only individual teachers will be supported, but also in the organization of the school as a whole.\r\nWe believe that this project will not only contribute to the overall improvement of competences, but also to development of language skills, enrichment of knowledge about other cultures and education systems as well as providing new friendships and contacts for further cooperation.\r\nBy having the teachers attend these courses, our school aims to use technology more effectively, to get experienced mentors to help school staff with implementing technology to the teaching process and to gain the chance for potential international cooperation with other educational institutions.\r\nEven though it will be teachers attending the courses, we believe it will be the students who will benefit most from the project\u2019s achieved objectives.", "http://www.withernseaprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA101-047527_1"]]}}, "2QB": {"nhs": {"data": [["RV9", "Withernsea Hospital", "nhs_RV913"]]}}}}
