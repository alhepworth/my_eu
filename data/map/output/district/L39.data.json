In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.\n\nThe aim of TYPHON is to provide a methodology and an integrated technical offering for designing, developing, querying and evolving scalable architectures for persistence, analytics and monitoring of large volumes of hybrid (relational, graph-based, document-based, natural language etc.) data.

Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery. The course, once developed, will be deployed to 45 trainees each in UK, Spain, Norway and Denmark over 4 days during a 7 month period. In parallel, the eCourse will be deployed in one region to test the right balance for blended learning and assess the most suitable platforms for its deployment. The toolkit will be built on the project website.\r\n\r\nThe third phase will focus on evaluating the course and assessing its impact on the target group and external stakeholders. During this phase, the curriculum and course will also be tested in a Central and an Eastern European country with differing cultural and health and care system characteristics. A sustainability plan laying the foundations for the future of the project and its intellectual outputs will be delivered towards the end of the project.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and impact: The ALTAS project will deliver a fit-for-purpose standards and curriculum, assessment framework and course materials for  health and social care professionals. These deliverables will be supported by an eCourse, a course deployment toolkit and a comprehensive evaluation report. The ALTAS project is expected to (1) raise awareness and increase knowledge of ALT for front-line health and social care staff and their managers, (2) increase motivation in staff to take ALT courses, (3) increase staff willingness and confidence to promote ALT, (4) increase interest in the ALT workforce to exchange and share good practice across Europe and (5) increase collaboration and cooperation between training organisations and ALT suppliers.", "http://  www.edgehill.ac.uk  ", "NHS Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013710_6"], [2017, "Promoting and Supporting Good Governance in the European Football Agents Industry", "EDGE HILL UNIVERSITY", 184710.0, 5, 5, "The focus of this proposal is to undertake evidence based research in order to promote and support good governance in the context of the regulation of football players\u2019 agents (now referred to as \u2018intermediaries\u2019) in the EU.

By extension, our research will inform the approach taken by other sports to the question of player agent regulation. The issue of good governance is relevant due to longstanding concerns regarding the operation of the player agent industry. As acknowledged by successive EU documents, these concerns tend to be of an ethical and legal nature including financial crime and the exploitation of young players. These issues threaten the fairness of sporting competitions and the integrity of sportspeople. The issue is of particular current relevance given recent changes to the way in which football agents are regulated. In response to concerns that the then current regulations were not working effectively, in 2015, FIFA introduced the Regulations on Working With Intermediaries replacing the previous Player Agent Regulations. The repealed regulations placed qualitative requirements on access to the profession of an agent, such as acquiring a license following an examination. In contrast, the post-2015 system has dispensed with this licensing system, opening up access to the profession, and thereby causing some good governance concerns regarding standards of professionalism.

About five hundred years later the colonies disappeared. Scientists still do not know exactly, whether they abandoned Greenland or starved. Nevertheless some elements that led to the end of the settlements can be understood by analysing remaining objects: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORESTATION: The early settlers cut down the forest not knowing that regeneration would take longer than in Scandinavia, as a result wood became a scarce resource, \r\n\r\nMARGINALISATION: Trade relations with Norway decreased, because after the Crusades cheaper sources of ivory were available in Africa compared to the walruses hunted in Greenland,\r\n\r\nCLIMATE CHANGE: Climate change led to the late and unpredictable arrival of seals, an essential source of food as stocks declined at the end of winter,\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS: To create social cohesion the Vikings separated themselves from the Inuit and thus could not draw on Inuit traditional environmental knowledge. They were also involved in conflicts that reduced the labour force of the Vikings to a critical level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of these causes can be compared to contemporary environmental risks. Therefore evaluating the end of the Vikings in Greenland may provide an inspiring example to discuss issues of sustainability. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE: In the 14th and 15th century all over the North Atlantic, the Vikings adjusted their lifestyles but still it was impossible to survive on Greenland. Today we might slow down climate change, but it is already certain that the rise in temperatures will demand adjustments (e.g. town planning) and will result in climate refugees. \r\n\r\nTRADE RELATIONS: As trade shifted to the South and East the settlements became marginalized, a threat Europe fears today when the focus of the global economy shifts to the Pacific region. But also the question arises of how to deal with least developed countries, which are largely excluded from international trade. \r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES: The Vikings in the vulnerable settlements in Greenland developed law codes, while contemporary issues such as overfishing and unsustainable logging of wood, especially in the rainforest, are unsolved problems and demand regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interdiscilinary project team of Wissenschaftsladen Bonn (D), Center for Design, Innovation and Sustainable Transistion (DK), BAOBAB (AU), Faculty of Education of Edge Hill University (UK) and Projektagentur Andreas Joppich (D) supported by the Danish National Museum and the Danish History Teachers Association will develop workshop material based on the research about the Viking settlements in Greenland. Children can explore the artefacts found by researchers in the ancient settlements and apply scientific methods of analysis to interpret what has led to their end. Newspaper articles allow the students to compare their findings to modern issues of sustainability and draw conclusions for lifestyles and policy making. Their ideas for environmental policies are compared to European environmental policies, so that the students can understand regulations and participate in political decision-making. \r\n\r\nThe resource materials, which can be provided by the partner organisations but also lent to schools for the application in lessons of history and geography, includes reconstructed artefacts, maps, guidebooks on research methods, newspaper articles, maps and data sets on contemporary issues, along with guidelines for comparing the findings to modern times. An outdoor setting offers the children a more adventurous experience as the items may be hidden and have to be discovererd first. Some outdoor games are used to create an adventurous atmosphere and stimulate the cooperation of the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop provides an example of how competence-centred education can be put into practice and therefore supports the efforts of the European Union and national governments to replace knowledge-centred practices in schools. To support this goal, the project partners also formulate a survey based recommendation on learning through inquiry and its benefits for the development of competences, especially learning to learn and scientific approaches but also social and civic competences, language and mathematics. Based on the experience, guidelines for learning through inquiry are produced, integrated into the manual, and transferred to a concept for train-the-trainer seminars. An instruction for self-assessment in the manual will make teachers aware of the learning impact on students and allows a promotion of learning through inquiry even after the project has ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the method supports interdisciplinary teaching and thereby more cooperation in schools.

For example, since the judgment of the European Court in Walrave (1974), the economic, and consequently organisational, aspects of sport have been subject to European law, particularly the Treaty provisions regulating freedom of movement and competition law. The adoption of Article 165 of the TFEU has resulted in the social aspects of sport also becoming a matter of EU concern. In recent years, the sports sector has experienced commercialisation, litigation and sporting scandals and these have revealed the need for improvements in sports governance. There is a need for those employed, or seeking employment, in the European sports sector to have detailed knowledge and understanding of EU affairs and its implications for their professional practice.
