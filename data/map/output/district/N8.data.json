The Deputy Head has previously taught French in another primary school and would like to build on his linguistic skills and cultural understanding. The MFL Coordinator taught in France, has been teaching French for seven years, 5 as a qualified teacher and would like to build on her fluency, cultural understanding and create a partnership with a school in France. The ICT Coordinator has previously studied French up to a GCSE level and would like to gain the opportunity to become emerged in the culture and build on his language skills in order to support the aims of the project. He would also like to create engaging ICT MFL tools that can be shared with the partner school.

Children from poor families are unlikely to get support from their parents/carers and are at a higher risk of becoming early leavers. In some cases, parents are intimidated by the school system because of their negative educational experiences or because they were educated outside of the local system. \r\nOther barriers are lack of expectations for their children, work and childcare commitments and lack of confidence. People from poor families particularly from migrant and refugee communities are at a significant disadvantage.  Structured creative arts activities, developed with the involvement of the target group and delivered in a non-formal environment, can provide life changing opportunities; they will help beneficiaries to gain new skills and enable them to become aware of the skills they already have; boost self-confidence; and instill a positive attitude to learning. Some parents do not understand the value or the role the arts can play in improving young people\u2019s achievement and employability skills, and undervalue their own creative skills. The Family Threads project aims to help break down the barriers and attitudes that result in young people dropping out of education and deny better career opportunities and social mobility; and also to enable parents and carers to realise their own potential as advisors, educators and a resource for their children.   \r\nEach of the partners has identified specific challenges which they feel are imperative to address around the issue of family learning and which include the importance of family talk, enabling families to discuss common topics so that children can develop both listening and speaking skills.  Although a well-developed concept, it is often poorly executed. It is essential to address this problem as families do require the support and opportunities that this project seeks to develop.\r\nThe Learning Families project will target primary school children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are at risk of leaving school early because their parents are not able to help them with their school work and do not have high expectations for their children\u2019s achievement. The partners will devise methodologies and techniques that will help to develop a strategic approach to tackle this problem as opposed to the common practice of intervening in a fragmented and uncoordinated manner. Partners will develop and adopt good practice models \u2013 a variety of activities that will help parents / carers to understand how the education system works, to improve communication with children, to advice and encourage them with their learning and, above all, enjoy quality time with their children.\r\nKey characteristics of the activities that will be tested with 400 parents and children in 5 countries are they are non formal, beneficiaries will be involved in the design of the activities and the activities have fun and enjoyment built in to them. There will be informal chats during which the activity leaders/ trainers will introduce topics that will raise parents\u2019 awareness of the importance of their active engagement with their children\u2019s learning; a better understanding of the world of work and how to help their children with their career choices. An incidental outcome will be parents developing key skills that are essential for finding employment. The target group will be from severely deprived neighbourhoods and probably themselves are early school leavers and long-term unemployed. The partners will maintain close liaison with the schools and attend some activities as participant observers.\r\nLearning Families: A Training and Resource Package: The partnership will analyse the outcomes of the pilot activities and the case studies in order to create a package of family learning toolkit that can be used to train school staff, parent groups, relevant NGOs (e.g. migrant and refugee groups and organisations working with single parents and children in care) in intervening early to help children and parents who need help;  in integrating the strategic framework in their schools as a whole school policy and culture.

Pushed by civil war and terror and pulled by the promise of a better life, hundreds of thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa, risking their lives along the way. The scale of the crisis has put huge pressures on some destination countries. Focusing just on applications from citizens of non-member countries , there was a gradual increase in the number of asylum applications within the EU-27 and later the EU-28 through to 2012, after which the number of asylum seekers rose to 431 thousand in 2013, 627 thousand in 2014 and close to 1.3 million in 2015.

The objectives are:- to characterize what constitutes a good practices- to identify one good practice in each organisation, focusing on each field of expertise- to provide a virtual and face-to-face space to share and learning from each others- to improve the competences of the educators involved in the areas of house policy, job integration, language teaching, awareness of the local communities - to extend the educators competences of using the ICT for learning- to support the organisation involved in starting a reviewing process of what they offer and how to their target group, by importing elements of good practices acquired during the learning mobilities- to learn how to import some elements of the good practices in each institutions' work- to create a network of organisations that can work together in other projects on this topic (such as Daphne, KA2-development of innovation)The methodology we are going to use is based on the following pillars:- a proper balance of local work and transnational meetings. Even if it is a project of exchange of good practices, MINE does not include only face to face or virtual exchanges. - experiential learning.

Peer learning should be mutually beneficial and involve the sharing of knowledge, ideas and experience between the participants.

Participants become acquainted with transnational topics which broaden their linguistic skills as well as their personal maturity and tolerance. Key qualifications like the capacity of cooperation, teamwork, communication and last but not least learning aptitude are fostered. The creation of international contacts and networks is supported, options and opportunities with regard to the European labour market are facilitated (London as part of a global network of advertising agencies).

Furthermore, the professional and linguistic quality of their education is increased, which is decisive especially in the field of advertising, marketing and media. Increasingly, graduates are employed at globally operating companies or agencies, which above all emphasise the readiness of mind, flexibility and adaptability to new situations, as well as the linguistic, transnational and cultural knowledge of their employees. Trainees are provided with the basis for entering the European employment market. The programme\u2019s implementation creates a competitive advantage for all parties involved (imk, agent, partner institution, participants), strengthens their international competitiveness and facilitates the adaptability to sociopolitical transformations of a united Europe. In order to succeed in their future career, participants are supported to independently develop problem-solving strategies. The programme as well as imk\u2019s strategies and those of its partner institution EBMS focus on the philosophy that participants are only able to develop capabilities and competences of rapid problem solving by individual experience of new surroundings and its divers facets.

Although outcome for patients has improved, stents still fail because of the occurrence of restenosis and thrombosis at the site of implantation. While drug eluting stents have helped to reduce the problem of restenosis, neointimal proliferation causing restenosis can still occur. Additional concerns exist regarding drug eluting stents as there appears to be a small but real increase in late and very late stent thrombosis, particularly after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.\nThe novel concept we propose is use of a biodegradable magnetised stent (BMS) to deliver a novel biological therapy offering regenerative medicine solutions to the coronary artery vessel wall. Specifically we will develop the stent technology as a platform to attract autologous progenitor cells tagged in vitro with iron nanoparticles. Once deployed, the cells will be attracted to the already implanted BMS and proliferate to form a new endothelium. We will also use over-expression of the NRP1 gene in the artery wall where it will dimerise with NRP1 receptors on the deployed cells. The NRP1 gene will be transfected by adenovirus delivered from the wall of the BMS. Over time the BMS will undergo a predictable degradation to leave a wholly biological artery through regeneration of native tissues.\nCurrently, about 12,000 European Citizens a year suffer from late in-stent thrombosis and 120,000 from restenosis. With the knowledge and technologies developed through the BIOMAGSCAR project we aim to halve this number of patients and save 66,000 people from unnecessary suffering, saving the European healthcare system \u20ac275 million p.a. in direct costs, only 10% of the total associated costs.\nOur consortium includes a vascular disease therapy company, a stent research and manufacturing company, four universities and a specialist in innovative technology investment, all of whom believe our technology will dramatically change this field.", 481924.0, 5448831.0, 4, 8, "BIOMAGSCAR", "http://www.biomagscar.eu/", "http://www.magnusinvention.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112640.jpg", "fp7_102275_961940465"], [1356998400000, 1546214400000, "Does vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy safely improve outcome in severe early-onset fetal growth restriction?", "Magnus Invention Management Ltd", "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) globally occurs in 8% of pregnancies, is severe and early onset in 1:500 cases, affecting 11,000 babies annually in the EU. In most cases, reduced uterine blood flow restricts substrate delivery to the fetus causing growth to slow or cease. There is no treatment. Currently the fetus is delivered very preterm before fetal death or irreversible organ damage occurs. Affected neonates suffer intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, with heart disease and diabetes as adults; mortality is high. Recent improvements in the care of premature growth restricted neonates, means that more of them survive delivery, but at great cost. Small increases in fetal growth and gestation at birth are associated with major improvements in survival and morbidity.\nImproving uterine blood flow is key and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to achieve this. In preclinical animal models we showed that local VEGF gene transfer to the uteroplacental circulation using adenovirus vectors increases uterine blood flow, attenuates constriction of uterine arteries and increases angiogenesis; these changes result in improved growth of severely growth restricted fetuses. This is the first clinically-applicable evidence based therapy that could improve perinatal outcome in severe early onset FGR in man.\nIn collaboration with an SME experienced in gene therapy trials, our aim is to complete an agreed toxicology programme, identify specific ethical issues in stakeholders, and to perform a Phase I/II study in women with severe early onset FGR at four EU centres of excellence, using interventional radiology to deliver an adenovirus vector containing the mature processed form of human VEGF-D into the uterine artery.

This benefits the project immensely as it not only allows us to compare the very best of practice in our varying education systems but also allows all participants to learn about the cultural similarities and differences of our European neighbours and friends. Each partner school has identified that improving the well-being of students is a priority in their school. Base line assessments suggest that more than 60% of students did not feel that they were part of the school community and 50% suggested they did not feel supported by the school. When we looked at research in this area we found this was a national trend, particularly in Romania, Spain and the UK. We also found that each partner school had their own strengths to offer each other and that through collaboration we could develop best practice and work to improve our well-being in each of our schools.The key aims of this project are:1. To improve the variety and quality of innovative teaching and learning techniques.2. To improve well-being in our schools by promoting inclusive initiatives.3. To develop the common European identity by exploring national characteristics.We plan to meet these objectives by working to our strengths:Italy has a strong mentoring system and will run mentoring workshops during a mobility to their country, this will involve preparation online using eTwinning, collaboration between current mentors on best practice from each country and then the training of participants leading to the creation of a Mentoring Guide offering training ideas, situations and structures. The UK and Finland are both using innovative pedagogy in their schools to improve educational attainment, the UK has a strong focus on Growth Mindset pedagogy and Finland has a strong focus on holistic learning through teamwork. There will be preparation online using eTwinning prior to mobilities to these countries, on arrival participants will work together collaboratively and work in multicultural groups to teach and evaluate mini-lessons based upon the pedagogy studied. This and further collaboration online will lead to the creation of a Good Class Guide which offers teaching and learning ideas and examples linked to well-being which can be utilised in various subjects in various countries.Spain and Romania will focus on the promotion of innovative learning through extra-curricular activities, in this case we will be focusing on participants investigating their school environment and the ways in which it can become more environmentally friendly. Through the creation of environment societies students will be empowered to make change in their schools to improve the environment for all in addition to learning life-long skills which will be useful in future employment for example project management, data collection, analysis and evaluation. During each mobility there is also the chance for students to explore the culture and attractions of the country they are visiting. Being Geographically apart from each other each region has something unique to teach participants about the similarities and differences between cultures and their place in the world.Throughout the project there is a big emphasis on engaging and involving as many socio-economically disadvantaged students that we can who would otherwise not have the opportunity to take advantage of the experiences this project can provide. We envisage that these initiatives will benefit students by improving their confidence in academic studies through the use of teamwork and growth mindset pedagogies, that students will have improved understanding, empathy and respect towards cultural differences and that students will have an improved sense of citizenship, belonging and support from the school community through the mentoring and environmental initiatives. The impact of the project will also benefit those who are not participating, teachers will receive training in good teaching practice which will then filter into classrooms to the benefit of students and mentoring systems will help many throughout the school.

Buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. While new buildings generally need less than three to five litres of heating oil per square meter per year, older buildings consume about 25 litres on average. It is also estimated that 90% of building today existing in the EU is destined to remain and the renovation is, sooner or later, inevitable. And this process could create 2 million jobs.\r\nThis represents an opportunity for European architects, as it can stimulate innovation and the economy. Thus professionals able to offer an innovative contribution are strongly needed. The labor market will present a growing demand for qualified professionals capable of performing energy audits and design competitive and innovative strategies for energy retrofitting on existing buildings.\r\nMatching this perspective with the shared need for greater job opportunities for architects, project NET_Learning aims at drafting a new professional profile by enriching the already recognized Energy Auditor with skills, competences and knowledge enabling Architects to become European Energy Auditors and Renovators. The project aims at creating a workforce of qualified professionals, whose skills are recognized and able to operate at European level and contribute to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of climate change and energy efficiency, as well as increase competitiveness. \r\nFour partners coming from Italy, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic, all dealing with training and the promotion of a culture for sustainable architecture, will therefore cooperate to provide these opportunities to a wide number of individuals and organizations. First of all to the community of European architects who are currently suffering the financial crisis and unemployment in a saturated market where big and renowned firms play a major role, leaving small firms and freelance architects struggling , regardless their age and experience.\r\nEnterprises involved in the renovation of existing building will benefit from the presence of a recognized professional role with specific competences on energy efficiency improvement related to existing buildings. Because of its economic importance, these economic sectors can significantly influence the development of the overall economy and have a direct impact on the quality of life of Europeans. Finally public national and local authorities and private/public owners of buildings which need to be renovated and reduce their energy consumption will benefit on the long term from the competences of qualified professionals who can also be involved in the programming of tenders and competitions.\r\nTo reach project objectives and these target groups, NET_Learning will implement an e-learning Platform, fostering an on line basic course open to all architects coming from the participating partners regions and, based on result achieved upon its completion, 43 young architects will be selected to participate to a training activity abroad. This activity will take place in all the involved cities (Rome, Turin, London and Prague) and will focus on the analysis of selected case studies, chosen according to a detailed analysis of regulatory frameworks, technologies, methodologies and approaches today available to deal with energy efficiency and deep retrofitting of existing buildings. This analysis results will be collected in the so-called NET_Learning Handbook, a publication which will be made available and disseminated to all interested public.\r\nThe project has the ambitious objective to define a policy recommendation to tackle the issue of today fragmentation at European level of the topic related to the energy certification and auditing and provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation.\r\nThis means that the project will not end upon its closure, but is designed to become sustainable and continue on a long term.\r\nThe NET_Learning platform will remain on line and will progressively supply more courses focused on specialist topics, having the Handbook as a textbook for all attendants. The platform will also become a virtual job placement space with a network of firms/enterprises offering jobs or internship opportunities, as well as an exchange space for experts and architects to compare and confront .\r\nThe problems addressed by the project are common to all project partners and this makes it really important to work at European level: many architects wish to work in a foreign European country, but mobility is seen as difficult due to practical problems and to the scarce knowledge on other national and local contexts.
