Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery. The course, once developed, will be deployed to 45 trainees each in UK, Spain, Norway and Denmark over 4 days during a 7 month period. In parallel, the eCourse will be deployed in one region to test the right balance for blended learning and assess the most suitable platforms for its deployment. The toolkit will be built on the project website.\r\n\r\nThe third phase will focus on evaluating the course and assessing its impact on the target group and external stakeholders. During this phase, the curriculum and course will also be tested in a Central and an Eastern European country with differing cultural and health and care system characteristics.

In that way artworks become active artefacts that react on users' attention and emotions and provide more information about them!

The final beneficiaries targeted by the project are adult learners in non-formal education, but also students from formal education, in need of a holistic discovery of new technologies. The starting point, which motivates the project, is the fact that ICT literacy considers only a limited approach in this field. It showcases the software used in desktop applications (for future professionalizing goals), and services to citizens and consumers (for goals of citizenship and social inclusion). Other important aspects are overlooked, and important dimensions of the society's transformation by new technologies are sometimes ignored.The project aims to involve (basic) ICT trainers and teacher (and all educational staff people) in a different approach, with a wider vision of ICT emergence in our society, and a wider understanding about the way that ICT influence our culture,  our professional life and everyday life. It aims to increase the critical thinking about new technologies. It aims to act on usual educative actions about ICT, implemented by regional, national and local governments, by demonstrating its wide openness on different view angles, and its motivational virtue.The project is centered on the production of open educational resources (OERs) to be used for professional purposes in the area of ICT learning, with adults and students. These OERs are structured in: \"raw\" educational resources related to 45 learning objects in the field of programming, narratives methodologies, rich media production, and digital art ; a skills reference and validation guide; two curricula of 120 hrs each (one for ICT training for adults in non-formal education, the other for students in formal education), in 3 levels each, structured in 2 LMS platforms, including all educational resources, pedagogical informations and assessment processes. Five multiplier events aim the dissemination of all OERs in all partners countries. Two joint-staff trainings are specifically made in order to help the staff involved in the project, to be able to execute the tasks of OERs productions.The project involve 5 partners from 5 countries: a research center in Art studies of a university (UALG-CIAC, PT), three organizations working with adults, in the field of ICT and Arts, for digital inclusion, and for digital key competencies with job seekers (Perspectives, BE - ADPI, FR - FACT, UK), and an organization active in the field of cultural diffusion to a wide audience (Melting Pro Learning, IT).", "http://www.fact.co.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE01-KA204-016280_3"]]}}, "4HY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Eurpean Trainee Mobilities - Ausbildung in Europa", "News From Nowhere Bookshop", 4992.0, 4, 11, "The Berufskolleg Bachstra\u00dfe in D\u00fcsseldorf, place of education for the academic part of training, is applying to take part in the mobility project \u201eEuropean Trainee Mobilities \u2013 training in Europe\u201c for the fourth time. By participating in this project, the college not only wants to make a contribution towards giving young people good career prospects and a positive perspective in life, but is also making a contribution to co-existence within Europe.\r\nAchieving intercultural and linguistic skills can be expected to open up a multitude of career prospects at a European and even international level.\r\nWith this project application, we intend to send two trainees for studying Management Assistant for Tourism, three Specialists in Media and Information Services and one Bookseller abroad.\r\n \r\nThe three tourism trainees all work at the same travel agency and will be spending their period of practical training at the partner agency in England . This will clearly improve their chances of finding work abroad in the future. Since many companies in this branch operate throughout Europe, or indeed internationally, work can be found in many countries. Participating in this project will help the students develop their language skills and improve their technical vocabulary. Experience gained during a training period abroad strengthens their self-confidence in their own abilities, thus broadening and developing their opportunities on the work market.\r\n \r\nThe three Specialists in Media and Information Services will be in three different countries during their practical training period. One student in her second year will spend her training at the British Library, where she will get to know an institution with an international reputation. A further student in his second year will be at a library near Copenhagen. As this library aims to extend an attractive selection to international guests, this will also contribute to intercultural competence. The third participant of this course is currently in her first year of study and will be going to the Austrian National Library. On the one hand, this project will focus on intercultural differences between two German-speaking countries and, on the other hand, concentrate on work in a national library, which cultivates international contacts due to its assignments.\r\nThe necessity for Specialists in Media and Information Services to have a command of specialist vocabulary is ever increasing due to the expansion of the use of electronic sources of information. Specifically in scientific and technical fields, these are often, and sometimes exclusively, in English.\r\n\r\nThe bookseller will spend her internship in a bookshop in Liverpool. She is in her first traing year and has a very good command of English which she hopes to improve regarding her technical vocabulary. All staff of the bookshop in Liverpool is responsible for all kind of decisions. Also the range of  booktitles is very different to the bookshop in Germany, it holds a lot of scientific and bilingual literature.\r\n \r\nFor all of the trainees, their stay abroad will be an opportunity, not only to learn to adapt to new social structures and ways of life, but also to get to know new work surroundings with their own specific demands.\r\nThe trainees will all take part in a preparatory seminar before they leave. This will take place in a youth hostel in the vicinity and will include an overnight stay. The seminar will focus on intercultural and linguistic preparation and will clarify technical formalities.
