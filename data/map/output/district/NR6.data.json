Partner institutions in the project are two schools for students with disabilities from the UK and Portugal. The aim of the project is synergistic and systematic approach to the issue of independence of a disabled child, to work out methods and forms of therapy which will enable individuals in the competence to be self-reliant member of the society. The project participants will be students and teachers of Polish, British and Portuguese schools, including senior management. It is expected that 68 students and 41 teachers will take part in the project. During extra-curricular activities students will implement the three training sessions: economic, communication and social development. There will be implemented four workshops: I AM IN A TOWN, I AM IN A SHOP, I AM OUT OF TOWN, I AM ABLE TO DO IT. The project involves three visits in each of the partner school. Students and teachers will take part in the mobilities. During mobilities  students' activities will be finalized and evaluated. Implementation of planned tasks will be based on the project method , the students' practical action, show and education through play. There will be established co-ordinating teams in every participating institution consisting of the headteacher as a coordinator, deputy head, teachers of English , maths, native languages, speech therapist, psychologist and two pedagogists (or other professionals depending on the qualifications which are  required by partner schools). Coordinating team will be engaged in planning, proper implementation of the project and  tasks, monitoring, implementation of innovations, evaluation, dissemination of final products, and project summary and account. Team members will take care of all the project participants. Within the organizational support we will make reservations, buy tickets, prepare plans of the visits. Within language support, the members of coordinating team, who speak English fluently, will take care of the other participants of the project. During implementation of the project, we will monitor undertaken activities and project progress. Evaluation of the project will be carried out in order to check the degree of achieving the intended goals. The team will take care of the promotion and dissemination of the project results by local media, organizing meetings, conferences,  publishing a leaflet, a book and a brochure. We want to achieve following products:\r\n-publication describing the objectives, implemented and achieved results of the project, \r\n-photobook for each school- prepared by the students on their own; each student will receive an electronic version of photobook,\r\n- project website with free outlines of the lessons,\r\n-20 outlines of the lessons will be created for specific implemented tasks (5 outlines for each tasks) for students with different level of disability and functioning,\r\n-verbal and pictorial book containing the outlines of  daily activities training.\r\nAfter completing communication, economic and social training, students will be equipped with the skills and competencies that are the basis for independent functioning in the community. These are: \r\nI The ability to plan to go out and travel on their own\r\nII The ability to prepare meals. \r\nIII The ability to make purchases.\r\nIV The ability to work in a team.\r\nThe project results will be felt not only by the students. The added value will be closer cooperation between teachers and professionals working with students with disabilities. Teachers will learn new methods of therapy with students with disabilities and they will change their mind about becoming independent of disabled students. The ability of using the tools of ICT  and practical use of computers and Internet during lessons will increase - 90 % of lessons will be implemented by using ICT. The project will have an impact on the local community. The attitude towards people with disabilities will change into accepting one and people will become more open in relation to non-verbal person.  Competencies gained by participants will raise their standard of living, they will give opportunity to fully participate in the community.

Hall School, located in Norwich, is a special school with a specialism in Communication and Interaction. There are approximately 80 students on roll, each with severe learning difficulties and complex needs. The students are aged between 3 years and 19 years old. There are approximately 60 staff, most of which are highly experienced and qualified experts in special educational need.\r\nThe project has clearly defined aims and objectives which will strengthen the quality of teaching and learning whilst developing a better understanding of international methods and technologies.  Communication for our students, in both partner schools, is extremely challenging and often provides a real barrier to learning. This project aims to remove all barriers to learning, by sharing expertise, knowledge and understanding. New communication technologies will be explored and fully developped across both environments.\r\nSpecialist staff teams will be deployed to develop tailored objectives around teaching, learning and communication.\r\nStaff mobility is essential to the success of this project. Highly trained staff, who can demonstrate the use of latest technology, will be deployed to travel and share expertise.\r\nThe final result will show a real improvement in student communication skill and measureable improvement in student academic progress.\r\nThe project will, when complete, be sustainable and provide a lasting partnership with all stakeholders.\r\nHall School and our Polish partner have already started to develop highly desirable aims and objectives. Staff mobility has also been initiated with a member of Hall School staff visiting our Polish partner special school.
