The learning materials are based on innovative teaching methods to make learning in this area really effective, modern and attractive for students. Modern teaching methods used in this project are Flipped Classroom, Inquire-based Learning, Critical Thinking, Peer Instructions, CLIL etc. We managed to start collaboration with car companies and have invited their experts to share their knowledge with project schools. The Toyota, Porsche and Hyundai experts have been giving hands-on trainings for teachers from our project VET schools.Below the main project outputs are listed. Up to now, we have achieved the following results: Worksheets-All 82 (more than the planned 80) worksheets for practical assignments based on innovative teaching methods are ready in English version and have been translated to CZ, SK and HU versions. We have all 82 worksheets translated to national languages. The worksheets are not only translated, but are also being tested and piloted by consortium schools, sector bodies and national regulatory bodies. Thus the piloting and feedback process is a 3-phase process.Teacher\u2019s Guide- this guide will be a part and parcel of the worksheets that will cover the methodology and the methods used, as well as practical examples of correct answers. So far, we have a methodology sections to each worksheet. Later on, we will take out the methodology sections from each worksheet and will create a separate Teacher\u00b4s Guide out of this material.E-learning activities to go with the worksheets- these online activities are for teachers and students to practise the topics and themes of he worksheets in an interactive way. All the e-learning screens are ready in English and are now being translated to other 3 local language versions.15 Flipped classroom videos- these videos are based on the Flipped Classroom Method and are available in English, the other 3 language versions have been translated and are now piloted by sector skills bodies and regulatory bodies \u2013regarding the correct terminology and the content.20 CLIL Worksheets  with their own methodology- all the 20 worksheets for English in automotive using the CLIL method are available in English version, 10 worksheets have been translated and piloted to CZ, SK and HU, the rest is being translated and piloted.LMS User Manual- this manual of how to use the LMS environment where all the learning material and e-learning activities of the project are placed is now being prepared and will be finalized after the development of the e-learning materials.Online picture and sound based dictionary- this dictionary is being created under guidance of our partner school Holice that has been preparing a list of key words for each worksheet in English together with its translation to the other 3 project languages. As soon as all worksheets and other learning materials have been piloted (expected by December 2018), we will use the template for this interactive dictionary and will work on it. We have had such an online dictionary tool from our previous projects, which means we only need to put the vocabulary there with pictures and have it recorded by native speakers in 4 languages (EN, CZ, SK, HU).Teacher Trainings- not only do we develop innovative learning material, we also focus on teaching the teachers to work with such innovative material to be able to use them in an optimal way. So far we have trained all country mentors, teacher trainers at project schools and we have done several trainings for teachers from non-partner schools. Also, we have prepared some online webinars for any teachers interested- these webinars have not been placed on the project website yet as they need to be technically amended by an expert on video and sound.", null, null, "erasmus_575014-EPP-1-2016-1-CZ-EPPKA2-SSA_3"], [2014, "Flash Electro", "ATT TRAINING LTD", 229195.0, 4, 9, "Project is addressing concrete need specified as lack of vocationally-orientated modern teaching and learning materials in the vocational electrician schools in Slovakia (and also in the Czech Republic). Therefore, we expect project results to directly contribute to fulfilling this gap at VET Slovak and Czech schools, in the specific field of electrician and other related professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the project we have 8 partners (5 VET electrician schools, CfME CZ, ATT UK and Kouvola College in Finland).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATT Training from UK will bring their expertise on blended learning and provide the consortium with 1000 learning object (pictures, animations, videos etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVocational school from Finland will bring the knowledge about the state-of-the-art vocational language education in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCfME SK as well as CfME CZ has great experience in eLearning development as well as vocational language content development (projects Volant, ALT, InterCar, Enter SK, HAIR etc.) in both \u2013 paper and electronic versions. CfME has long term experience with teacher training (more then 20 courses accredited by Ministry of Education). CfME SK as a consortium leader has great experience in project management including Leonardo Transfer of Innovation project management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlovak and Czech schools will focus mostly on testing and a real usage of the developed materials. They will also have important role in methodology and dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interest of schools in the project (5 partner + 15 Letters of Support = 1/3 of all electrician schools in SK + we expect additional schools from CR) shows a real and urgent need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, the electrician content oriented language teaching materials are very limited in Slovakia. Most of the schools use only \u201chome-made\u201d materials. Because of this teachers tend to practice only general English not related to the future student profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as we know there are no online interactive language learning materials online which would be used by electrician schools in Slovakia (and the Czech Republic).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the project following education materials will be developed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. 600 e-Learning interactive screens of electrician vocational English and German (grades 1-3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Combination of individual online home work with group work during the lessons with be adapted into the methodology and teaching materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediate feedback is essential for language skills development. The next day feedback (for example for homework) is simply too late. Monitoring of personal development helps the student to concentrate on his/her real needs. It also helps teacher to monitor and evaluate student work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll materials will be systematically tested at all development stages by partner schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the project end, we expect the increase of vocational foreign language skills and ICT competencies of the minimum of 500 students participating in testing period by using the LMS and eLearning.
