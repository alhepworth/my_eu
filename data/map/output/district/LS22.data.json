We aim to know our children well, be their partners in learning, help them to enjoy and aspire, and develop character for achievement.\r\n\r\nWe were awarded the International School Award in 2014. This was as a result of work over several years, taking the school through the stages of intermediate and building on that the following year. The project required coordination of the 7 activities across the school involving the majority of children and several staff from different curriculum areas who were coordinating activities. We will apply for reaccreditation in July this year.\r\n\r\nWe need to upskill modern language staff and further embed the international dimension throughout school and raise the profile of our International school status and learning languages.\r\n\r\nWe will involve members of staff from a variety of areas in the school in immersion courses in France and Spain. This project will last for two years and include 5 mobilities to France and 3 to Spain to take part in 8 day structured immersion courses involving language, methodology, culture and opportunities for professional discussion. Staff will also spend time in a partner school in the country looking at their specialist area and whole school issues which relate to our school development priorities. The members of staff involved will come from different roles and backgrounds within the school including MFL, other departments and support staff.\r\n\r\nWe will Increase the skills of our MFL staff to be able to teach their second language to a higher level which will increase flexibility within our MFL department and mean that we are able to offer our students more choice whilst ensuring consistency and a high quality, sustainable provision.\r\n\r\nWe will Increase capacity within other departments to support languages and the international dimension. Staff will feel more confident to deliver international activities and use their language skills on international days and support other staff.\r\n\r\nThe main objective for this project is to offer our pupils a better experience of language learning and a better understanding of the global dimension within different subject areas. To achieve this we want to ensure that our staff have access to the best possible CPD opportunities to enable them to teach to a consistently high standard and support others across different departments. We want to ensure that our staff are maintaining their professional profile to enable them to perform well in their jobs and ensure that they thrive in their future careers.\r\n\r\nPupils will benefit from improved teaching methodology, staff skill and confidence, better, more authentic resources appropriate to their needs. They will have more opportunities for learning and more choice. They will benefit from the links made with schools in the target language countries and joint projects with them. They will have a real audience for their work and understand the purpose of language learning as well as getting a clear insight into life, developing friendships with pupils there through eTwinning and improving their speaking and listening skills through regular communication and more use of target language.\r\n\r\nThe impact would be felt across the whole school, staff, pupils and local community, an d we will evaluate this impact regularly.\r\nThe results of the visits would be disseminated in a variety of ways to ensure all aspects of the school community and local community would be aware of the impact and skills gained.", "http://www.wetherbyhigh.co.uk", "Wetherby High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036344_coordinator"]]}}}}
