We formed a partnership with six different partner schools from six countries. They are Lithuania, Turkey, Romania, The United Kingdom, Portugal and Cyprus. We built this partnership via internet. Objectives and activities of the project are in particular:- it encourages EU teaches more to use kinesthetic teaching/learning style with a purpose to satisfy the educational needs of every student;- it enables EU teachers deeper differentiate and individualize the education;- it consolidates teachers qualification with innovative teaching methods;- it completes the lack of the knowledge about kinesthetic teaching/learning. This teaching/learning style is underused as auditory or visual styles. Teachers have the least experience of working with students having kinesthetic learning style;- it let to use EU funding and so maximize the learning process about kinesthetic teaching/learning point;- it helps to prevent the early school leaving because kinesthetic teaching/learning style is very suitable for weak students;- it improves students' learning motivation and knowledge of different subjects, special of STEAM platform subjects, which influence the development of students\u2019 enterprising skills;- it develops and strengthens cooperation between the EU states, including languages and cultures;- it discovers the personal differences and provide education in accordance with the students\u2019 learning need and ability;- through mediation and application of kinesthetic teaching/learning methods it develops the methodological expertise of teachers;-it increases the use of cooperative learning and teaching methods. It creates teaching materials and shares the results with the colleagues and local authorities;- by working with the teachers from European countries, all the teachers will benefit from each other and they will have chance to develop their Education plans;- we will perform open classes during the Project activities. This will create an opportunity for shadowing, collegial exchange and comparison of curricula; - it aims to decrease school dropout rates and increase the performance at learning activities;- it initiates entrepreneurial skills and creates the active citizenship consciousness.With this Project study we focus on promoting innovative approaches at local, regional and European level. In particular, this Project is an important contribution to achieving the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation of the \"Education and Training 2020\u201d (ET 2020) as well as to the educational objectives of the strategy \"Europe 2020\".All partners will pursue the priorities \"revise and strengthen the professional profile of the teaching profession\" and \"improving the performance of young people at school. During these Project activities will be promoted social inclusion and ICT skills, as well. ICT will be used in all phases of the Project - communication, presentation, evaluation, dissemination and so on.We will organize two transnational project meetings.  All the partners\u2019 schools are responsible to organize one learning, teaching and training activity. Will be organized 6 training meetings. Both the transnational Project meetings and learning, teaching, training activities will provide an active experience and testing by the previously presented kinesthetic teaching/learning style.Our Project is oriented to the teachers of different subjects and to the 13-16 years students. All the participant teachers will be cooperative, open minded, supportive and eager to learn about Kinesthetic teaching/learning methods and use them at his/her own class.During the meetings new learned kinesthetic methods will be tested and integrated to the lessons. After that qualitative and quantitative analysis will be done in the purpose to evaluate the influence of kinesthetic teaching/learning to the development upon the students' educational quality. Results and impacts of the project will be based on the mentioned aims above. There will be increase in the willingness towards school subjects; in consequence, students will get better test results and thus there will be a reduction in sit still during the lesson and early school leaving. It will be accompanied towards increasing motivation and a change of attitude to lifelong learning within the European framework, namely on the part of colleagues  and the students. The long-term individual and social benefits will be seen in the fact that all participants will be well equipped with kinesthetic teaching/learning methods. The partner schools will have a common website and produce presentation and dissemination of their work and the project results on this website. Will be implemented very wide  dissemination of the project through the teachers\u2019 workshops, international conference, articles, teachers\u2019 training programmes.", "http://mountkelly.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT01-KA219-023141_2"]]}}, "8DD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "European Vocational Education and Training", "Tavistock College", 236961.0, 6, 38, "Bromangymnasiet in Hudiksvall is situated in a region of very high unemployment, among the young it is the highest percentage in the country (25 %).

Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland.
