They need to be able to solve problems, make decisions, think critically, communicate ideas effectively and work well within teams and groups. These skills and attributes are increasingly recognised as being essential to succeed in other areas of 21st century life too, including many workplaces. These skills and qualities cannot be developed without the use of active learning methods through which pupils learn by doing and by collaborating with others.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities / methodology\r\nYear 1 - Mindfulness and its effect on the brain - preparing to think - how to learn better and live better\r\nYear 2 - Critical Thinking and Philosophy for Children - acquiring the skills for thinking\r\nYear 3 - Gobal Citizenship - making a better school, community, world - using thinking for good\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nPupils:\r\n- understanding of mindfulness and the role it can play in improving self-esteem, managing behaviour and building successful relationships\r\n- an increased capacity to think critically and engage in philosophical debate so strengthening their resilience to extreme views and digital media overload\r\n- increased sense of the global community and the significance of European collaboration\r\n- sense of working together as global citizens towards shared values\r\n- develop their ability to be responsible and effective global citizens who will continue to care about the community that they live in\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- a better understanding of mindfulness techniques, not only to use with the children in school, but also to take home to improve the quality of life/work balance\r\n- increased opportunities for professional development - continuing CPD - increasing a teachers' toolkit of skills\r\n- impact on teachers adopting collaborative and innovative practices\r\n- greater confidence in the teaching of global citizenship\r\n- increased motivation and satisfaction in daily work\r\n\r\nParticipating Organisation:\r\n- more longer term benefits\r\n- increased skills in collaboration and learning\r\n- nurture attitudes of openness to Europe - policies might be more reflective of ongoing European priorities\r\n- broader network of local institutions as resources for education and educational tools - local institutions as a resource that schools can go to\r\n- the management of the schools are committed to evaluating pedagogy in line with the thinking toolkit, which will continue to develop sustained critical thinking practices across the school.

Our school, which has been involved for a number of years in European Comenius and Erasmus+ projects (our current school project 2015-2017 being an excellent illustration of our past involvement), wishes to offer to a number of voluntary and chosen teachers the possibility to immerge themselves for a week in the life of either an English-speaking school in the UK and/or Malta or a pioneer school in the field of collaborative pedagogics in Finland.This project finds its origin in a deeply felt need for further training, to make our fundamental teaching more lively and therefore more motivating. Participating teachers will collect films, photos and practices during their stays, which can then be used in class to improve their teaching and make them more relevant in the current context. These tools will also be shared with other colleagues via the e-twinning platform.An active pupil participation needs to be based on an assessment of the pupils\u2019 needs and learning profiles. We think that we will be able to benefit from our partners\u2019 successful experience in this field and we wish to learn from them to create an environment that allows our pupils to have fun while learning and that therefore boosts their curiosity and enthusiasm to learn.During their one-week stays abroad, the teachers will be able to observe and participate in a diversity of educational systems. They will focus their attention mainly on the following aspects :- Co-operation within and between classes.- Awareness of multiple intelligence levels and ways of taking them into account when developing differentiating pedagogical practices.- Ways to involve parents in their children\u2019s work and progress at school (parent-teacher relationship and educational co-operation). - Role of the parent-teacher associations in the everyday life of the school and use of web platforms to promote collaboration.- Importance of pupils\u2019 participation in assessment practices.- Role of new technologies (smartboards, blogs, platforms, videoconferences, etc.).- Links between foreign languages and other subjects to promote European citizenship.Albert Camus Elementary School has already been recognised as a pole of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages and wishes to develop its skills in the fields of collaborative and participative work as well. In the longer run and encouraged by this momentum of discovery and openness, our school will undoubtedly manage to transform these new pedagogical practices in order to satisfy the demands of both our pupils and their parents. It will use the practices observed and learned abroad to boost our pupils\u2019 willingness to learn.To train our teachers so that they can become active partners in our pupils\u2019 learning experience is a prerequisite for them to grow and develop into active European citizens.On a side note, we will also apply for a new Erasmus+ Action 2 Co-operation and Partnerships project on parent-teacher relationships.

Very few children at Mayflower travel to Europe, but tend to fly over it on their way to the Middle East, Asia and Africa!  Continuing the raise the profile of Europe within school will develop the children's sense of European identity.\r\n\r\nCreative Curriculum:\r\nMayflower Primary School offers a creative curriculum designed to engage the children  through topic based work which covers many different areas of the curriculum.  We aim to make links across the curriculum so reinforcing the learning in different disciplines.  This is working well within school, but with the new curriculum coming into English schools in September 2014, we want to maintain the momentum of creativity and ensure that teachers are re-energised with ideas for developing their classroom practice.  \r\n\r\nModern Foreign Languages: \r\nThe new curriculum requires a modern foreign language to be taught in school from September 2014  Although we have been teaching French for a number of years, it needs a boost of inspiration and ideas to carry our French teaching to the next phase.\r\n\r\nBroaden the European experience of our staff\r\nThese mobilities would enable the European dimension to be fully integrated into our new and developing creative curriculum.\r\n\r\nMobilities:\r\nOver the course of 2 years, we plan to have 6 mobilities by members of school staff to visit a partner institution and shadow outstanding teachers in their classrooms. \r\n- The teachers would plan to learn more about the creative learning-through-play opportunities in Early Years, cross-curricula activities  and active learning opportunities with the older children (particularly in relation to the arts and culture, including digital technologies) and language learning throughout the whole institution\r\n- The visits would improve the teaching and learning of languages and promote the EU's broad linguistic diversity and inter-cultural awareness.\r\n\r\nActivities will include: \r\nworking with a variety of teachers across the school to observe how creativity is promoted through the curriculum.
