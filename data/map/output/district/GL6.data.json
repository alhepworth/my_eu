The concept of Social Farming is not yet present in vocational education and it is not recognised at a government level in many CEE countries, however the number of social farms is continuously increasing. Our needs assessment confirmed our assumption that social farms, interested organic farms and other social institutions, would highly benefit from a social farming training, especially one that includes an economic viability module.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, our project, Revitalist is a new initiative that intends to take further the concept of Social Farming by elaborating a new curriculum based on a social and therapeutic method of education (Practical Skills Therapeutic Education, PSTE), by creating and collecting a pool of background materials and by establishing a network of professionals, and this way responding to several European regional and local policy needs. The target groups of the new curriculum are social farm employees, and social and agricultural professionals.\r\n\r\nThe core method PSTE is tested and validated in one of our project partners (Ruskin Mill Trust) in the UK for over 20 years, providing social directions for young people with learning difficulties. Their results have been proven by the recorded physical and mental development of their clients, to which PSTE also opened a window towards social inclusion.\r\nWe want to work towards the creation of new national (Hungarian) legislation that recognises Social Farming as an efficient tool of the future. We also believe that Social Farming represents new potential enterprises for the agricultural sector: any land based initiative that wishes to work organically can attract other sources of income by engaging disadvantaged end-users.\r\n\r\nTo bring it all to life, the project involves 7 different organisations that will equally contribute and benefit from this project:\r\nHungarian Quality Compost Association (HU) is a professional organization with extensive experience in education, training development, agricultural practices and international project management.\r\nDiverzit\u00e1s (HU) has a well-established work practice developed with end-users and will develop it further, by creating new training programs and develop local social farming initiatives.\r\nRuskin Mill (UK), founder of PSTE, will create and deliver training programs adapted to different multi-national demands. They will also test the potential of PSTE when working with new clients, which can further their operational capacity. \r\nThe Municipality of Tiszasas (HU) and WWOOF (HU) are situated in socially deprived areas of Hungary. As they have the necessary infrastructures to address the end-users needs, Revitalist will help create two completely new social farms and respectively, bring many new jobs for trainers and end-users.\r\nUniversity of South Bohemia (CZ) is developing training programs in Social Farming, and they will contribute with their economic viability knowledge to make social farms sustainable on the long run.\r\nAgricoltura Capodarco (IT) is one of the oldest examples of Social Farming in Europe, integrating socially disadvantaged people in the community, in an ethical and ecological way. \r\n\r\nThe main activities of the project include the elaboration of Social Farm mentor training curriculum with methodologies, containing 5 modules: 1. The basics of PSTE: theory, 2. The basics of PSTE: practice, 3. Characteristics of the end-users, 4. Economic viability and implementation strategies; 5. Localization. For the understanding of the PSTE method and the operation of social farms, three short-term joint staff trainings will be included in the project. To support the Social Farm mentor training, educational materials and an Open Education Resource will be created on social farming, and an active, supporting professional mentor-network will be established. We will test all theory and practice described above, on two pilot trainings (5-5 modules each) in the different levels of all our training courses and in carefully chosen locations, always with specific outcomes in mind: engagement and revitalisation of end-users in the communities.\r\n \r\nThe Social Farm mentor training will use a practice-oriented approach that involves learning handcraft activities promote cognitive development (focus, coordination, etc.) and sense of personal achievement for the disadvantaged indirect target group of the project, focusing always on the specific needs of each learner. We aspire for lost craft activities to be sustainably reinstated in order to economically boost local communities, while guaranteeing the passing on this cultural heritage to future generations.\r\n\r\nIn sum, we propose to revitalise people, land and communities, able to embrace but overcome deeply rooted social obstacles.", "http://www.rmt.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA202-035932_2"], [2014, "Training-the-trainers for ecological small scale production", "Ruskin Mill Trust Ltd.", 348794.0, 4, 7, "The ECO-MOTIVE project is aimed at providing training tools for disadvantaged and unemployed adults to provide sustainable development solutions to entrenched rural poverty. The roots of poverty and social disadvantage are complex, and there is no wholesale solution within the scope of any single project, but we believe that one starting point for building opportunities for disadvantaged, low-skilled rural people is to explore individual human development (both life and employment skills) in connection with agriculture-based training opportunities. The ecological approach offers multiple benefits, including a recognition of the central importance of the social context of agriculture and its resource-efficient nature that complies with the long-term strategic goal of the sustainable natural resource management. A number of local government initiatives have already started up over the last few years, aimed at developing skills and knowledge appropriate for rural areas in basic agricultural areas. At the same time community employment programmes (\u201eK\u00f6zmunka program\u201d) have begun, in an attempt to address entrenched rural unemployment. Unfortunately there is a lack of capacity at local government level that justifies the need for employment trainings, reskilling programmes and human development resources on which our project focuses.\r\n\r\nThe ECO-MOTIVE project will provide the training background, including technical knowledge and skills coupled with knowledge transfer methodology and social sensitization and motivation practices to provide user groups (primarily local authorities, and their programme staff) with course materials and training modules for trainers (practitioners, unemployed adults with an agricultural background, or with working experience in agriculture) by preparing capacity to train trainers of disadvantaged/ unemployed/low skilled adults (end-users) of rural areas in the field of small-scale ecological production. In order to facilitate the training of trainers we will prepare the following 6 modules, which together will constitute the main intellectual output of our project: social sensitivity skills and motivation, ecological small-scale farming (introduction), ecological small animal husbandry, ecological vegetable production, ecological fruit production and direct local marketing of ecological produce. Each module will include applied pedagogical methods and will be submitted for accreditation as distinct modules, but together will form the complex training-the-trainers curriculum for ecological small scale production.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum will be accompanied by training-the-trainers teaching materials that will facilitate the teaching work of trainers in ecological farming. The 6 distinct sections (corresponding to the curriculum modules) of the teaching material will provide professional knowledge based on the collection of well-established good practices appropriate for teaching approached in a holistic way.\r\n\r\nThe end-users course materials will support the learning of end-users during trainings in ecological small-scale production facilitated by trained trainers. The content of the end-users targeted course materials will be closely linked to the accompanying training-the-trainers teaching material. The end-user course materials, which will be rich in graphic illustration for the purpose of easy understanding, will be produced as self-contained teaching aids, in order to facilitate their use.\r\n\r\nThe well-established good-practices incorporated into the professional context will be transferred from partners according to their area of expertise. In the project 7 prominent institutes with different institutional structures will participate from 4 European countries (Hungary,Romania,Spain,UK). The common feature of all partner institutions is their focus on rural unemployment and social disadvantage related to agricultural activities for what the solutions based on partners\u2019 competencies and experiences will be elaborated together. Pilot courses organized for future trainers and end-users during the project lifetime will provide the opportunity to test out the transferred solutions before they are incorporated into the final project outputs. Localization mechanism will ensure that all elements of exchanged, transferred and developed best-practises are adoptable under Hungarian conditions.\r\n\r\nOur vision with the project is to provide tools to local authorities to initiate training in small scale organic farming practices which will lead into the creation of, not just utilising the manpower, but providing human development opportunities, which can lead to longer-term solutions. We expect that the project will have important impacts at all levels including the social dimension, as the trained trainers will influence the thinking of the decision makers in local authorities and by becoming acquainted with the global, holistic approach of organic farming  they will also influence higher level decision-making.", "http://www.rmt.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-HU01-KA202-002315_2"], [2018, "Crafting links through drama and textiles", "Ruskin Mill Trust Ltd.", 29570.0, 3, 3, "This project will benefit 32 young people with special needs from the UK, Norway and Germany who will explore cultural themes through drama and weaving.  \r\n\r\nShakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' was selected as the theme of the drama workshops, as the resounding themes of passion, love, betrayal, rejection and redemption are powerful images for young people to explore. Love in Romeo and Juliet is a brutal, powerful emotion that captures individuals and catapults them against their world, and, at times, against themselves. A series of workshops over seven days will explore the relationship of the human to nature and to each other, and culminate in a performance. The themes of cultural strangeness in the play will be echoed in the cultural differences between the participants; only the death of lovers brings everyone to their senses so their families and friends can live and work together peacefully. Shakespearean drama is full of powerful archetypes and characters that create opportunities to explore many aspects of humanity. This is particularly relevant for autistic young people that struggle to understand social behaviours and interaction. \r\n\r\nCultural themes are also woven through the textiles workshops, with an exploration of colour, pattern, function, tradition and aesthetic through weaving. The two groups of young people have totally different ways of working; this exchange brings then together to share their skills, knowledge and to learn from each other, with trips to cultural institutions in Norway to understand how traditional weaving and other crafts have been influenced by nature and human ingenuity. \r\n\r\nUndertaking this youth exchange will be a developmental milestone for disabled young people who have poor self-image and lack of aspiration, feel socially isolated, lack confidence and experience in cultural exploration and overseas travel.

Another focus, is that local and school festivities have joined together to try out recipes. This part is used to achieve the key themes of the project; in particular, the implementation of key competences in the field of literacy, language and writing skills. creativity and culture.  The joint implementation and documentation of experiments, is the expression of the mathematical and scientific literacy and provides knowledge, skills, teaching and learning methods.  All participants benefit from those, far beyond the project period.  We deepen effective strategies to improve basic skills by tracks, left by us from country to country, from culture to culture and from person to person.  We carry out various activities and combine them into finished products for the kids to get in touch, without inhibitions with other nations and through the diversity of the people, to talk with them, to deal with the life and traditions in other countries and learn all differences as normal to look at. Thus we achieve openness/acceptance of all participants towards people with impairments, that make as active participants in the project and participate in the mobilities.  At the beginning of the project, a map of Europe with footprints is made by all partners, which points the way from country to country, from school to school and from city to city. The geographical location of the partner country/the partner cities are interdisciplinary developed and transferred to a provided map. Each school created a PowerPoint presentation in collaboration with parents about the school and its environment.  As a result of the project, a hardcover book and a DVD is created:-Footprints in Europe-children are searching stories and traditions.  Students deal in the curriculum and throughout Europe, project weeks and project issues.  This results in two annual calendars, puzzles, memories, posters, photo books and a European Experiment box.  We also work during the student and teacher meetings with these products. The activities and results/products of the entire project period will be documented and presented. During the student and teacher encounters, concrete insights, in the lives of others and the direct interaction, are the particular importance of children so that they learn and can know the different facets of the cultures and traditions and the differences/similarities in Europe, to introduce and better understand and explain it. The participants should own and appreciate the values of other countries and thereby develop their intercultural competence.  Through this cross-border cooperation, we are strengthening the quality of the project.  While the teacher encounters the project meeting as well as the common short-term training courses for staff and the exchange of student groups, we expect a constructive cooperation of all participants in the interest of the development and dissemination of European thought.  Joint consultations with project issues and inclusion, education visits and exchanges of experience within the colleges and mutual understanding of school systems, opportunities to promote inclusive education, teaching methods and materials. We want to bring about an improvement in the quality of teaching, the learning environment to develop the basic skills further and thus to achieve an improvement of learning outcomes.
