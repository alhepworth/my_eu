The exposure will help the pupils to understand the very principles of respect and compassion for these individuals/groups and we would imagine, it will challenge any prejudice the groups may have. During the week in each country, the pupils will have the opportunity to get to know what it is like to walk in the shoes of one of these people. On the penultimate day of the mobilities, the pupils will use the arts to perform what they have learnt in their groups, through dance, music, drama or whatever form of expression the pupils wish to use. These performances will take place in front of local dignitaries and decision-makers in a bid to promote the acceptance of these groups in our society.

This will be through sharing good practice and developing a strong professional relationship.  \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nWe intend to send a maximum of 6 members of staff to Holland for a week per year (for a two year period) for job shadowing in the areas relevant to this proposal. The group of 6 staff will also have a member of the management team, who will liaise with the team in Holland and look at different approaches in management and use the opportunity to share good practice and learn from the experience and bring back good practice to our Trust. \r\nThe staff involved will spend the time in Holland working alongside staff of the same discipline sharing good practice. This will then lead to delivering sessions with the pupils in Holland.

Enhancing teaching and learning standards through sharing best practice from foreign partner schools. Enriching the education that the school provides will involve a wide range of subjects and departments that will all benefit from the Erasmus+ initiative. Besides, the teachers involved will also gain management experience both from running the project and disseminating the results of  their mobility in the whole school.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\r\nOur project of teachers' mobility developed in a secondary school in which teachers have been constantly considering how teaching and learning standards can be enhanced so that teachers can become more aware of their action in class and more conscious of the strategies and methodology used with students. This goal can be achieved only by reflecting on the use of innovative tools and methods, different from the ones we already know. Sharing practice with foreign colleagues would inspire our teachers to adopt new strategies in order to:\r\n1. help strong students outperform national standards\r\n2. develop for the better skills and competences of weak students or students with learning problems\r\n3. promote more interactive and less academic activities  such as : problem-solving, cooperative learning, workshops and use of laboratories...\r\n4. enhance students' motivation\r\n5. embed a European dimension into  daily lessons, promote awareness of European, and extensively global, citizenship.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY\r\nWe mean to start by involving in the project three  main subject areas: science, sport/PE, foreign languages although our ambition is to open up to other areas such as mathematics/physics and history.\r\nOur school has been working for over a decade in departments (subject areas), so the heads of departments involved together with the headteacher will select the staff participating in the project. \r\nTogether with our partner schools (which we have been working in collaboration for years on bilateral exchanges with students) we identified the following stages:\r\nA) work-shadowing and observation in class (with a grid to fill in) in an agreed and significative number and variety of subjects in order to give foreign colleagues a good picture of the best practice of the school. Observations will be debated later.\r\nB) planning of modules shared by same departments of partner schools on the topics as pinpointed at number E of the form and arranging of same assessemnt test for students.\r\nC) sharing of results of tests with reflection on assessing parameters.\r\nD) possible exchange of staff among schools, teachers will swap and replace colleagues in partner school giving lessons on agreed topics.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nTeachers involved will have to relate to the headteacher, the heads of department and the whole school staff on the activities done. They will be directly responsible for the positive outcomes of the project and will be expected to promote and disseminate the results, firstly inside the department, then among the whole group of teachers and finally outside the school uploading positive educational developments using appropriate portals, the blog and site of the school, e-twinning portals, local mass-media (press, radio) and any other possible way of communication.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT ENVISAGED\r\nAs already highlighted the entire school will be, in the end, the one to benefit from this project that will help staff  improve the school's good pratice and embed in the curriculum and ethos of the school  both European citinzenship and  internationalization. We are positive that enhancing teaching standards will lead to a tangible improvement in students' learning strategies and skills too.

The school believes this project will give great insight into important global questions which European communities are facing. It also believes that the cultural relations it will foster will help to tackle these issues through co-operation and educational exchange.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nThere are two main objectives:\r\n\r\n- To embed European citizenship and by extension global citizenship within our curriculum. We wish to turn the school's vision outwards to embrace our European, international world. We want to achieve something which is abstract and yet which can be embedded in very tangible ways by working in collaboration with colleagues in schools elsewhere in Europe and across departments st SCCHS. Each staff member travelling abroad will be expected to establish at least one international theme in their return to Newcastle. In addition all staff participating  will disseminate and upload all positive educational developments using appropriate portals and project management tools (e.g. E-Twinning desktop, Diary and Twin Space)\r\n\r\n- To enrich the local and global T&L education which the school provides by raising T&L strategies in the wide range of subjects we offer to fully support the changes to the Curriculum. The school believes that enriching our curriculum through shadowing and observation that we can support the students of SCCHS and within the wider community to fully achieve their potential, both locally, nationally and globally. These strategies will also help to promote the confidence and sense of belief in British students, prepare students for linear assessment, help to close the gap in attainment between boys and girls and support UK students in their strive for success in PISA assessment.\r\n\r\nThere is another aim which underpins the first two\r\n\r\n- To enrich staff development and develop future school leaders. Those directly involved with this project will benefit personally, culturally and professionally. They will also gain management experience both from owning and disseminating  their mobility through their whole school role in doing this. The project will also lead to SCCHS opening its doors to future incoming collaboration with all European partners. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nThree teaching staff will be involved and will come mainly from either Heads of department or department assistant leads to assist the dissemination of good practice.\r\n\r\nDescription of  activities and methodology\r\n\r\n- Prior to each visit staff involved will have worked with their designated contact so that the  T&L, ISA and personal professional aims have been clearly established, relating to work-shadowing, lesson observation and working on suitable ISA themes.

Each staff member travelling abroad will be expected to develop and embed at least one international theme on their return to Newcastle. The three main themes which we will focus on are Energy and resources ,Health and wellbeing and EU Citizenship, EU awareness and Democracy. These overlap with several others from the list in section E and dovetail with the key ISA themes of Sustainable Living,Identity and belonging and  Conflict and Peace for example.\r\n\r\nresults and impact envisaged \r\n\r\n\u2022 To cement the school\u2019s international ethos and to help raise T and L to outstanding across the school curriculum.To raise aspirations among the staff with reagard to both of the above aspects.\r\n\r\npotential longer term benefits\r\n\r\nThe project will allow St Cuthbert\u2019s to raise student and staff aspirations through practical developments which will underpin an ideal  which we are seeking to embed:we are global,interdependent citizens.\r\n\r\n(2895)", "http://www.st-cuthbertshigh.newcastle.sch.uk", "St Cuthbert's High School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000201_coordinator"]]}}}}
