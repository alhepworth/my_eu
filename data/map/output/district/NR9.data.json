The most commonly available renewable energy sources are hydro, biomass, PV, CSP, Wind, Geothermal & Wave power. Of  these wind is increasingly becoming cost competitive and the cost of wind turbines are dropping as volumes increase. This proposal deals with distributed energy production by small to medium wind turbines in the 10kW-100kW range, used immediately close to the point of power production\nWind energy conversion is a long standing process that has been employed for hundreds of years, but it is complicated and difficult to capture the maximum possible amount of power at any given point in time. The amount of power output from a WECS depends upon the accuracy with which the peak power points are tracked by the MPPT controller of the WECS control system regardless of the generator type.\nFor any wind turbine the maximum point of the power curve occurs at a particular rotor speed for a given wind speed. Even a small variation from this rotor speed will cause a significant decrease in the power extracted from the wind. Rotor speed, for a given wind speed, is dependent upon generator loading as well as the fluctuation in the wind speed. Power extraction strategies assess the wind conditions and then introduce control actions to adjust the turbine\u2019s rotational speed so that it will operate at the turbine\u2019s highest aerodynamic efficiency. Conversion strategies that have not been optimised can lead to significant wasted wind energy.\nThere have been many attempts to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms but these have not been successfully translated from academic studies to reliable working industrial implementations in our power range.

The reason for the project realization is to arrange for the best students of the secondary school and college the trainee-ships of the best quality in foreign companies in GB, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Austria. The training abroad represents the continuation and extension of special practical education which forms an integral part of the studies. The effort to improve practical training quality led us to implementation of ECVET principles. The project activities are focused on 4 target groups of participants: apprentice vocational school pupils, secondary school pupils, college students, and teachers of special subjects. 4 apprentice vocational school pupils who study the second grade of farming and horse breeding will perform their 2-week practical training in GB. The group of 11 secondary school pupils that study the third grade of business management in agriculture, veterinary nursing, horticulture, and natural science lyceum will carry out their 1-month training in GB, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The pupils of all branches have sufficient level of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, the pupils of the third degree of secondary school even manage to use some special terminology in English. The main aim of the trainee-ships is to obtain first short-time experience from the companies of the given EU country and to compare it with the experience got in Czech firms, to check theoretical knowledge of the pupils, to gain independence and responsibility, to test and improve language skills. With regard to the fact, that the pupils of the second grade will not be 18 at the time of the training, a responsible adult person will accompany them and will monitor the running of the trainee-ships. 4 students of the college who study agricultural enterprising will perform their 20-week practical training during the 2nd year of their studies in the companies in GB, Norway, the Netherlands, and Austria. Another group will be formed by 3 graduates that will be sent to GB for 10 months. By arranging these long-term trainings we reflect the ErasmusPro initiative. Before the long-term trainings start we will realize two preparatory visits, namely in GB, where we will send most of the long-term trainees, and in the Netherlands, where we will place the long-term participants for the first time. The goal of the preparatory visits will be to set the trainee-ship conditions and targets and, in collaboration with the receiving organizations, elaboration of learning units for the long-term trainee-ships. The participants will meet innovative techniques and methods, work with modern machinery, compare economic conditions in agribusiness of the concrete country and the Czech Republic, and also get to know the socio\u2013cultural environment of the host country, which benefits to a positive perception of the European area integration. The placement of the participants is thoroughly chosen according to the study branch and priorities of the participants. We have been collaborating for a long time with family farms, horticultural companies, or veterinary surgeries in Norway, and also in GB, Sweden, Denmark, and Austria, where we utilize for the arrangement of the practices relevant contacts of our partner schools. All the receiving organizations have had experience with trainees and people experienced fin mentoring of trainees work there. The project activities also comprise professional development of the school staff, allowing the teachers to gain some new special knowledge and to improve language skills by means of practical trainee-ships. 2 teachers will perform their 2-week training in a partner school of similar study branches in GB. These teachers are either qualified for teaching both special subjects and English language, or they are completing their qualification. The goal is to obtain experience in teaching special theoretical subjects and practice in English, to exchange knowledge and to implement new teaching methods to our school. The chosen activities of the project are in accordance with European internalization strategy. The trainee-ships of our teachers correspond with the Plan of a further development of teaching in English.

Coordinators with cooperation of receiving organisation arrange suitable accommodation and meals, cultural programme, mentoring and tutoring of trainees. Coordinator will regularly and personally monitor trainees and check the quality, terms compliance and aims achieving of practical training. Each of practical training will be before its end evaluated. We prefer the students living individually at farms so that they could practice foreign language more effectively. The sending organisation arrange both practical and language preparation according to placement of trainee. Our coordinator will regularly monitor all trainees per email or by phone. Very important is for us personally visit of school management at farms. Coordinator with cooperation of school management visits all receiving organisations in all countries and check personally quality of placements. The aim of the practical training abroad is to practice and strengthen knowledge obtained at the studies, acquire new special skills, meet alternative methods in agriculture dealing with organic farming, know economics of agricultural business in the particular country, become familiar with the function of EU institutions, know all details of subsidies and quotas in the particular foreign countries, consult business and market opportunities, know the rules of fertilizing, plant protection, veterinary hygiene and prevention,  improve foreign language including special vocabulary and terms,  know the social-cultural setting of the particular country. The students will benefit from their practical training abroad: they can utilize all the innovative knowledge and experience in their job or in their own business. The acquiring of new social-cultural experience from a different region will contribute to a positive perception of European territory unification. We also expect them to use their knowledge, language and communicative skills in getting jobs, particularly in agriculture. The practical training abroad could help them to enter on the European job market. Their ability to make independent decisions and to be responsible is a great contribution too. The students will produce practical training diaries describing all acquired knowledge and skills together with some cultural notes and photos. They prepare their job portfolio including describing of farm, activities and new expert knowledge. Trainees will present their practical training. The dairies will be present together with written evaluations given by farmers, the base of evaluation.", "http://www.eastonotley.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CZ01-KA102-000859_2"], [2017, "Travel2Learn", "Easton & Otley College", 41411.0, 6, 6, "After several successful mobility projects under the Leonardo da Vinci program in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and later Erasmus + Green Academy (JU) has achieved a high standard of work with student mobility, which is expressed in Green Academys international strategy.\r\n\r\nThis project, \"Travel2Learn\" is as in previous projects designed to maintain the current level of and quality of student mobility as well to contribute to the continued capacity building and quality when it comes to internationalization in general and student mobility in particular.
