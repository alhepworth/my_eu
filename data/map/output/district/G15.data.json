The national policy is that all pupils should have access to 1+2 languages. Staff are lacking resources and confidence to deliver this. The school profile is currently mono-cultured mainly made up of white European, English only speaking children, some from a disadvantaged background. The school is prioritising the issue of child poverty and is engaged in the 'Cost of the School day' project. The school is one of a select number to be involved in the 'Raising the Attainment: Closing the Gap' to improve standards and attainment in Literacy and Numeracy.We are trying to provide a richer experience for the children, widening their horizons and raising their ambitions to be responsible citizens, confident individuals, effective contributors and successful learners.", "http://www.blairdardie-pri.glasgow.sch.uk/", "Blairdardie Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023348_coordinator"]]}}, "8PR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Raising attainment using SOLE in mathematics for 11-12 year old learners", "Antonine Primary School", 139730.0, 3, 19, "This project addresses the development of key competences in pupils and teachers in the teaching and learning of mathematics for pupils aged 11-12 years in Glasgow, Warsaw and Valencia in order primarily to raise attainment. This approach of innovative learning of mathematics is a development of the ideas and beliefs of Professor Sugata Mitra of Newcastle University. Sugata Mitra showed by experiment in India that if motivated and suitably led pupils will in effect teach themselves. His 2013 TED talk showed his success and won first prize. During the 2015 British Council eTwinning Conference Sugata Mitra explained his ideas and beliefs by Video Conference and this Project results for that Video Conference. \r\n\r\nSixteen schools will take part in the Project, five in Glasgow, six in Valencia and five in Warsaw. Over the three years of the Project 486 Activities will take place in all 30 classrooms directly effecting over 3000 pupils. Glasgow will lead the Project.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Activities of the Project is to work in groups to answer a \"big question\" derived from the maths curriculum being taught. The teacher does not teach but helps the pupils with their SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment)    \r\nThe key competencies addressed by this Project include: teamwork, responsibility, commitment, motivation, decision making, communication, leadership, digital skills. \r\nThey will have to communicate and present their findings using digital technology to pupils in other countries.\r\nThe Project is entrepreneurial and develops self confidence and belief. \r\nThe acquisition of the above skills will make the participating pupils more employable, increasing their ability to make a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nThe \"big questions\" used in the activities of the Project will address  the mathematics curriculum requirements and specific Learning Outcomes. In this way the teacher will be able to measure the true impact and effectiveness of the Activities on  attainment during the evaluation process.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that the teaching of mathematics is still very traditional in the three cities of this Project.  The common practice is for teachers to stand at the front of the class and teach, then for the pupils to work. The pupils are fed knowledge and understanding and are then asked to use it. This project involves the pupils finding it out by and for themselves by employing critical thinking and using social skills. This innovative method of teaching mathematics can be considered open and in this digital age is dependent for its success on pupils fully using the internet to acquire knowledge and understanding and using social media to communicate and disseminate findings and conclusions.", "http://www.antonineprimaryschool.co.uk", "Glasgow City Council Education Services", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036777_9"]]}}}}
