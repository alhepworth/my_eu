Made up of five partner countries in North West Europe (NWE), the three and a half year H4.0E project will facilitate the uptake of low carbon and digital technologies, products, processes and services in the NWE housing sector to reduce carbon emissions and improve quality of life for homeowners in the region and beyond.\nThe Issue\nThe EU 2030 Framework for climate and energy sets targets for cutting 40% of CO2 emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy to greater than 27% and providing at least 27% energy savings across Europe. The North West Europe (NWE) region is the most industrialised region\u2014as well as the most prolific CO2-emitting region\u2014in Europe. Within this region, the private housing sector alone accounts for nearly one-third of all CO2-emissions, as there is currently no great push within this industry to achieve EU targets. Meanwhile, decreasing household size, changing patterns of regional population density and other social factors have led to a significant decline in demand for large, expensive and energy-inefficient homes; and in turn, this has led to the increased desire for smaller, more affordable energy-efficient high quality living spaces. The main goal of Interreg North West Europe Housing 4.0 Energy, therefore, is to offer people in NWE access to new affordable near-zero energy/low carbon homes (NZEHs) and zero energy/low carbon homes (ZEHs), effectively aiming to reduce home building costs by 25% and carbon emissions by 60%.\nHousing 4.0 Energy for a better North West Europe\nHousing 4.0 Energy (H4.0E) will develop an affordable ZEH market by adapting and applying new technologies, thus creating both consumer and supplier interest. Made up of five partner countries in North West Europe (NWE), the three-year H4.0E project will facilitate the uptake of low carbon and digital technologies, products, processes and services in the NWE housing sector to reduce carbon emissions and improve quality of life and affordability for residents in the region and beyond.\nDigitization (4.0) techniques and the development of a H4.0E digital platform\u2014designed to facilitate the digitalization of building homes and transferability of these techniques\u2014will ignite fundamental changes in design, manufacturing and construction within the housing industry to meet both EU targets and the needs of homeowners in NWE. Using a client-based approach, H4.0E partners will work with local stakeholder groups\u2014especially local authorities, housing associations, architects, self-builders, construction companies and current homeowners\u2014across North West Europe. Starting from the needs, budget and expectations of end users, the project will identify and remove financial, legal and other obstacles related to housing preferences to meet the expectations of investors & diverse groups of small households. The project will be tested and monitored for viability in six pilot sites (in IRL, DE, NL, BE) representing varying levels of industry and carbon emissions, ranging from cities in low carbon regions to rural areas in less carbon conscientious regions. H4.0E is funded by \u20ac 2.5 Million in European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding with a total budget of \u20ac 4.2 Million. \nProject pilots and outputs will include 48 NZEH/ZEH units in four regions & consumers\u2019 evaluations, and partners are to attend regular seminars and events throughout the programme to monitor project progression and ensure effective collaboration. All NZEH/ZEH units will be constructed within the first 18 months of the project, allowing for extensive monitoring during the following months. Parallel testing in the six pilot sites will allow for transnational comparisons & learning; however, every pilot will maintain a distinct focus. The six H4.0E pilot sites include:\n\nAlmere (Netherlands): WikiHouses in urban area, demonstrating digitized (4.0) self-building (WP5)\nProvince Flemish Brabant (Belgium): NZEH/ZEH units in disadvantaged rural areas (IP1)\nEIfI-Tech (Germany): Multiple NZEH/ZEH buildings for students (IP2)\n3CEA (United Kingdom): NZEH/ZEH units for low income groups in rural areas & monitoring user behaviour (IP3, 4 & 5)\n\nAll pilots feed data into the main output: the H4.0E Energy Building Technology that enables zero energy/emission housing building on a larger scale.\nThe Housing 4.0 Energy partnership includes eight organisations from five different countries in North West Europe.", 1514764800000, 1640908800000, 202011.0, "nweurope_28_6"]]}}, "9AA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Engaging farmers in social farming", "Rural Support", 254059.0, 6, 7, "SoEngage will develop new technologies with easily accessible onlne and digital platforms to  upskill farmers with relevant training to develop their competence to engage in social farming.  This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them to provide a more professional service for economic benefit.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the SoEngage project is that family farms represent an important resource to maintain and improve the social, economic and cultural sustainability of rural areas. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective is to support farmers to engage in Social Farming by developing their knowledge, skills and competences through training to consider, plan and deliver a professional Social Farm service for the economic benefit and sustainability of the farm and the rural community.\r\n\r\nSocial Farming, also known as Care Farming or Farming for Health is an innovative multifunctional activity which offers farmers the opportunity to use their agricultural expertise and resources to promote therapy, rehabilitation, social inclusion, education and social services for entrepreneurial and economic benefit. The farm remains a working farm where people who need care support can benefit from participation in farm activities in a non-clinical environment.\r\n\r\nThe quality of a Social Farming service depends on the expertise and training of the farmers engaged in its delivery. \r\n\r\nThe partners of the SoEngage project represent 6 regions (UK, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain) and provide a range of training and support for farmers and have identified the gap in information and training on social farming which enables farmers to make informed decisions on whether or not this innovative entrepreneurial activity is suitable for them and the farm family.\r\n\r\nThis gap can be addressed by collaborating to harness the competent mix of expertise and materials that exist between the partners to produce training that brings resources together to create a comprehensive set of digital and online resources. \r\n\r\nThe innovative approach is that unlike existing training, which is delivered on-site and restricted by availability of trainers and financial resources, SoEngage training will make training convenient for farmers to complete by using digital and online platforms for accessible self-learning. Such online learning is not currently available in the partner countries. \r\n\r\nThe partners will share each of their expertise on design and implementation of social farm training; identify and use real life best practice case studies of social farms across the partnership to encompass the different methods, practices, procedures and structures to develop the training and professionalism of farmers delivering social farm services.\r\n\r\nThe training will be delivered to over 300 trainees who will be involved in the testing of the training materials from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe SoEngage training will be available in the 5 languages of the partners (English, German, Polish, Spanish and Romanian) and available as an OER which can be shared across the EU where Social Farming is less developed. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the development of these new technologies with easily accessible onlne and digital platforms the training can be easily shared across Europe to engage and upskill farmers in social farming. This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them, the people who avail of social farm services by providing more professional services and the wider rural community through the social, economic and cultural sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe partners are grateful to the European Union through Erasmus+ funding for the opportunity to engage farmers with social farming.", "http://www.ruralsuport.org.uk", "The Rural Centre", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047975_1"]]}}, "9AR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1367280000000, "Electronic paper message board for outdoor use \nwith carbon NanoBud display module and GPRS I/O layer", "Fsl Electronics Limited", "'The general objective of the \u201cElectronic paper message board for outdoor use with carbon NanoBud display module and GPRS I/O layer\u201d (E-SIGNAGE) project is to develop a large area, low-cost, high brightness and contrast level, robust, energy efficient (bi-stable; no backlight needed), high information content two-colour electronic outdoor message board that is able to receive data via GSM communication and uses solar energy as a power source.\n\nTwist-ball e-paper material developed by Invent Research O\u00dc (coordinator; SME, Estonia) has the principle capabilities to meet all the quality requirements set by the end-users for active front-plane layers of outdoor electronic signage and message boards (OEMBs).
