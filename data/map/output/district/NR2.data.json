This is a new project working with partners we have worked with previously. Over the last 12 months we have all been talking with our partners about the situation in diversity. Due to their concerns around this topic, Young People working with our projects have come up with a informal educational programme to highlight the situation in the world today. The theme of this exchange is Appreciating Diversity  This project has 4 partners - 2 from the European Union programme countries and 2 from Eastern Europe. This project will give the young people the opportunity to gain an understanding of the diverse cultures across Europe. The young people during the project will be in mixed groups of both gender and country undertaking the workshops around Diversity. The 60 young people, all of which are from disadvantaged backgrounds, and 8 leaders will be staying in the same accommodation with 3 meals a day which would include a packed lunch if we are off site. There will be a cultural visits as well as a cultural evening. The Cultural Evening will involve  each country presenting their city and country.  The accommodation for this project has separate accommodation for males and females. There are also extensive grounds to use for outdoor activities.  There will be a day of outdoor activities where the young people will work together and learn new skills and challenge themselves pushing their comfort zones to partake in new experiences.  During the evening activities the young people will be able to learn from one another and reach a mutual understanding from people from another country through dancing, singing and socialising.\r\nThere will be daily evaluations; the evaluations will look through the planned outcomes from Our organisation and Erasmus Plus, which will be pinned up at the start of the project.  We are expecting the young people to gain in confidence through this programme as it will have a big impact on them and after the project it will have a big impact on their peers.\r\nRecorded Soft outcomes through Outcome stars and SMART goals will monitor and evaluate soft outcomes, such as confidence, assertiveness, Aspirations, Learning, Communication and Support. Outcome stars will be used to evidence the distance travelled for young peoples learning, etc. by completing a 'Shooting Star' both at the beginning and end of the exchange. The SMART Goal tool that feeds into the star scaling will be updated in the evaluation session at the end of each day. \r\nDuring the project the young people will be working on their youth pass. The participants will find time after the project to finalise it with their leaders then put it on the youth pass system then print it off.\r\nThere is a session set aside towards the end of the project to discuss where we go from here.

The commitment of sequa in the field of occupational mobility began in 1991 with the founding of the SESAM program for journeymen, which was initially restricted to the cooperation between German and French Chambers of Crafts. Going abroad allowed the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country and increased their language skills and intercultural competences. The funding opportunities of the EU Leonardo da Vinci programme, now Erasmus+, allowed the extension of the programmes and lead in 2008 to the establishment of the sequa mobility programmes SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL.

Rud videreg\u00e5ende skole is applying for funds to finance two second year EF students for a whole year. The same applies to HO, DH and TIP. We are also applying for funds for twelve students for a period of two weeks in the course of the academic year for HO, DH EF and TIP. In addition we are hoping that funds will be available to cover the cost of two teachers in the same subjects who will take part in the lessons together with the students while also being involved in further planning. We also hope representatives of trade organizations within the relevant subject areas will participate. Project coordinator Kari Gr\u00f8nli also wishes to be present for a number of periods to do follow-up work and further planning. Rud vgs has as its goal to offer educational programs for students who have completed Vg1 (first year) within the HO, EF, DH and TIP program subjects. The students are made aware of this offer already in their first semester at Vg1. The entrance criteria include sending in an application and an interview. This goes for both shorter and longer exchange periods. The students\u2019 motivation, attendance and grades will also be taken into consideration in choosing exchange candidates.The teachers at Rud vgs and YC  and CCN have cooperated in planning educational modules so that teachers from Rud vgs will be able to be present during parts of the subject modules. This allows both the sending school and the receiving one the opportunity to develop teaching methods that provide the groundwork for stronger bonds between our two schools. After passing all modules the students will take an interdisciplinary test. Teachers from both Norway and England will be present. The teachers have developed a much improved understanding of vocational thinking though this international cooperation. This forms the basis for entrepreneurial and innovative skills in the respective subject areas. We will also enable both our long- and short-term exchange students to be awarded a Europass. In addition to English and Norwegian teachers and guidance counsellors partaking in educational activities, there will be biannual cultural activities together with the students, such as concerts and excursions to cities and local sights. The use of digital tools is integral to lessons. Social media are used for communication purposes and as part of the marketing of the exchange program. The use of digital tools is an important element in all educational programs. We at Rud vgs are experiencing an increased interest in this exchange program both at educational trade fairs and amongst parents and students who inquire about exchange programs in conjunction with vocational subjects. This exchange program has given us the opportunity to improve the development of quality and qualifications in the skin care educational program. We hope to expand our offer to encompass other vocational programs so that more students will have the opportunity to take part of their education abroad and be able to contribute in a wide range of subject areas. This will further strengthen innovative projects and improve recruitment to vocational studies, all the while reinforcing cooperation across Europe.", "http://www.ccn.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA102-021975_1"], [2014, "ACER VETPRO4", "Norwich City College of Further & Higher Education", 62975.0, 8, 17, "ACER VETPRO4 will continue a series of mobility project which enable colleges from the East of England to build links with European partners to enhance professional development and share expertise.

This is in response to increases in obesity and diet-related chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases amongst their populations. Also an insufficient nutrient supply in subgroups of the populations and special demands in ageing societies are identified as abiding challenges. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily though do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement is a demanding task and requires further systematic research and innovative approaches. One main question that this research needs to tackle is the role that innovations in foods (e.g. improved nutrient preservation through the use of mild pathogen inactivation) and new basic research technologies (e.g. for gaining greater insight and understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of food intake on health) could play in counter-acting the alarming rise of food-related health problems.
