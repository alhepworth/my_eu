In the EU there is 1.3 out of 15 million persons with CP in the world. This neurological disorder affects body movement, balance and posture and almost always is accompanied by other cognitive or sensory impairments like mental retardation, deafness and vision problems. The severity of these problems varies widely, from very mild and subtle to very profound.\nThese disabilities lead to an inactive lifestyle which reduces the patient\u2019s physical health, social participation, and quality of life. Therapy costs can be up to \u20ac45,000 by year, a cost that cannot be afforded by most of the families. Playing Video games is a useful treatment that promotes and maintains more active and healthful lifestyle in these persons. This in turn contributes to reduce medical and social care cost and improve well-being of their families. However accessibility to videogames is hardly applied for them.\nGAME-ABLING is to create a software tool for creating interactive video games in an intuitive manner in such a way that non-expert personnel (e.g. parents) can develop customized games. Games will be controlled using body movements and voice. To this end, Computer Vision and image processing techniques will be developed to improve accessibility.\nGAME-ABLING  will create a web portal to make up a disabled gaming e-community in where users will have access to use the software tool, play games and upload own creations to share it. SMEs envisage GAME-ABLING exploitation following a subscription business model to have full access to the web portal.\nGAME-ABLING represents a business opportunity for the SMEs, who expect to reach 0.5% world market penetration and an accumulated income of \u20ac9.9 million in 5 years. In addition, GAME-ABLING will contribute to reduce medical and social care costs in the EU by at least 0.5% which supposes additional annual savings of \u20ac200 million.", 169999.0, 1249827.0, 7, 11, "GAME-ABLING", "http://game-abling.eu/el/", "http://www.ubitechit.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112119.jpg", "fp7_106022_957370310"], [1477958400000, 1572480000000, "GAmification for a BEtter Life", "Ubitech  Limited", "Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a frequent neurological disorder in childhood (2 per 1,000 births).

Participation in daily activities with other individuals and inclusion in cooperative learning paths by playing digital games can promote health & well-being with such disabilities as is identified in Europe 2020. GABLE is a highly innovative online service platform to personalise games to enhance the living adjustment of people with CP avoiding a gamification process where one fits for all. GABLE will be an open platform combining (i) the results of phase from the very successful FP7-SME-2012 \u201cResearch for SMEs\u201d project (GA 315032) that ended in Nov 2014, (ii) the results of RAGE project and (iii) the technologies derived from machine learning under a multiplayer approach combining fixed and mobile devices. It enables carers & clinical staff to easily create (using visual programming & no special IT skills) interactive games customised to individual\u2019s abilities using unique computer vision & image processing techniques. Caregivers will adapt content and difficulty levels of the games according to the interests, abilities and progress of each individual user.\nMoving from the currently TRL6 to TRL8, five of the original partners in the Research phase will adapt the GameAbling platform to the new scenario and will develop a testing period piloting trials to operate/validate the system productisation at 8 diverse reference care centres over 18 months. The project will produce a total of 30 personalised games (5 per pilot). \nThe strategy of the consortium is to take advantage from the good results on the remedial use of games for children with CP in order to develop new business scenarios based on the success in that niche, where further inclusion & learning gaming markets will be addressed.

Cellular communications systems are planned using accurate/strict link budget allocation mechanisms, in order to keep the probability of outage in an acceptable range. The whole communication chain (coding, signalling chain, but as well as higher layer protocols) is optimized for the operation in this range. Therefore, communication services perform poorly or fail completely in unpredictable environments. Future networks will most likely be heterogeneous and dense, a structure which can be exploited if communication schemes are constructed on an appropriate the theoretical, technological, and practical basis. In order to establish this basis, RESCUE proposes the integrated concept 'links on the fly' which encompasses the key technologies of distributed joint source/channel coding in lossy wireless networks,\uf02d exploitation of multi-path information transfer in wireless mesh networks,\uf02d distributed and centralized MAC/network protocols for channel access, and routing,\uf02d cross-layer design for interference management and error control.This will allow to achieve successful and robust information transfer through multi-path networks that are constructed from lossy point-to-point links, \uf02d adaptability of information quality to the specific quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications and devices for higher spectrum and energy efficiency and  the integration of diverse communication infrastructure such as base stations, relays, and satellites, and terminals for network robustness and fast provision of communication.
