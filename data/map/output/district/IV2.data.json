New emerging competencies and learning concepts, also taking into account the needs of microenterprises are required by both sectors: the traditional simple and repetitive tasks are evolved to multidisciplinary tasks in order to deliver more complex products and services.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools.

With this being delivered fully and confidently, we foresee developing:\r\n\r\n-Communicative competence.\r\n-Active citizenship.\r\n-Connections made with different people and their cultures.\r\n-Pupils better equipped with the skills needed in Europe and in the global marketplace.\r\n-High level of skills in listening, talking, reading and writing which are essential for learning, working and life.\r\n-A secure understanding of how language works, and use language well to communicate ideas and information in English and other languages.\r\n-Continuity of learning.\r\n-Informing and improving future learning.\r\n-Common standard within Primary Language Learning.\r\n-Support staff with topic/vocabulary/pronunciation.\r\n-Confident teachers in Primary Language Learning.\r\n-Economic benefits of language learning including employability skills\r\n-Progressive and coherent CfE curriculum for Primary Language Learning ( PLL)\r\n-Learners will experience challenging, quality learning experiences in PLL\r\n\r\nWith 1+2, the delivery of the first additional language (L2) is a little different in that it continues with the discrete lessons, but supplements them by embedding language through routines, songs, games and interdisciplinary learning. This is when spontaneity and knowledge about culture become an absolute must and call for immersion courses.\r\n\r\nImmersions courses, such as those applied for, do a lot more than fill the gap mentioned above. They nurture global citizenship and give practitioners first-hand experience of the culture of the country which in turn would give their learners a measure of the European and World dimensions. These courses also focus greatly on pedagogy and the country\u2019s education system, a matter all at school relate to, be they teachers or pupils. The use of modern technologies such as the Internet or apps only adds to the relevance of the selection.\r\n\r\nOur applicants have varying degrees of knowledge with regards to the French language, with some having secondary school qualifications in French and need to focus on improving their language skills, confidence in delivery and their knowledge about culture, others have little to no opportunity to develop this other than online CPD and inset day training. Immersion in this respect would be ideal and key to successful learning of this language at Milton of Leys and across the ASG. The immersion activities organised by LFEE Europe encompass all with language learning and a look at pedagogy, professional discussions, culture focus, visits of education venues, where practitioners will be trying out classroom and language activities but also typically local ones, all of which they will take back to their pupils.\r\n\r\nThe need to articulate their learning on their return whether in class or while disseminating during school or ASG collegiate activities or for a community event, will help their learning to materialise further. Their learning would also be shared with the community and staff through local papers, twitter and blogs and with the rest of their Highland colleagues through postings on our Highland Primary Languages Newsfeed or resource upload in the immersion folder.\r\n\r\nOn their return teachers will be able to embed the target language in school and help further define the school improvement plan and modern languages policy. They will follow up on their search for school and /or class partners abroad and as a class they will try out various technologies to communicate with them.\r\n\r\nUnable to attend workshops and courses which usually take place hours away from Highland, practitioners find themselves lacking in the interaction and the human aspect of language learning and immersion courses seem to be the answer. We have hoping this year\u2019s Erasmus + application to be the first of many, and for practitioners to regularly be given the chance to bring back home a little of continental Europe to share with those remaining behind.", "http://www.miltonofleysblog.wordpress.com", "Milton of Leys Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036076_coordinator"]]}}, "6RE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Language Training", "Inverness Royal Academy", 3909.0, 1, 1, "The Scottish Government's ambition is to expand and improve language learning, by 2021, so that young people are equipped with the skills and competencies they need in our increasingly globalised world.  This ambition contributes significantly to the Scottish Attainment Challenge agenda which is about achieving equity in educational outcomes and ensuring that all of Scotland's children and young people reach their full potential. \r\n\r\nIn order for this to be successfully achieved it is vital that teachers are given opportunities to train in languages and learn methodology to embed two modern languages into the Broad General Education and beyond.  The modern languages department at Inverness Royal Academy are a very enthusiastic team of teachers who committed to embedding the 1+2 languages policy within the school curriculum.  Furthermore, we strive to bring out the best in all of our pupils and we intend to contribute significantly to the preparation of pupils for various adult roles in society, namely continuing education, employment, leisure, parenthood and citizenship.  We also hope to foster awareness of their place in society in the wider international community.  Consequently, there is a strong emphasis on language learning and we offer French, German, Gaelic (Learners) and Gaelic (Fluent) as part of the Broad General Education and Senior Phase curriculum and we wish to add to our pool of expertise and offer another modern language (Spanish) to help us follow the new national curriculum. \r\n\r\nMy participation in the LFEE Europe Spanish immersion course will undoubtedly improve my confidence, competence and performance in Spanish and it will also improve my expertise in the learning and teaching the young people of Inverness Royal Academy, while also providing me with the GTCS Full Standard for Registration.  This will allow me to introduce and embed the Spanish language into the curriculum at Inverness Royal Academy which will help further define our school and departmental improvement plans in light of the 1+2 languages policy.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the training programme will allow me to continue to develop and refresh my language skills and bring vitality to my teaching.  I also believe that spending time abroad gaining greater cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain is something which I can bring back to the classroom to share with my pupils and colleagues alike.  As a result, my pupils will gain a deeper understanding of how language is taught and they will be able to make links between the modern language and their mother tongue.  \r\n\r\nAs the dissemination of good practice is a key to lifelong learning, upon my return from Spain I intend to provide feedback to colleagues at national, local, ASG and school level, through self-reflection, dissemination activities and collaborative work.  I aim to provide my colleagues with fresh perspectives and equip them with a range of strategies and techniques to revitalise their teaching and bring enthusiasm to the classroom, thus raising pupils\u2019 standards of achievement and quality of learning.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that my participation in the immersion course will benefit the young people of Scotland as it will promote the concept of global citizenship through encouraging positive attitudes towards speakers of other languages and developing the pupils\u2019 knowledge and understanding of different cultures.  It will provide me, my school, my ASG and my local authority with the opportunity to harness our pupils\u2019 learning potential and enthusiasm by recognising that language skills are central to breaking down barriers.", null, "Inverness Royal Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047443_coordinator"]]}}, "6XU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "CHS International 2018", "The Craigdarroch Inn", 117262.0, 12, 25, "CHS, Centrum Humanberuflicher Schulen des Bundes Villach, is a secondary vocational school providing higher education with entrance qualification.
