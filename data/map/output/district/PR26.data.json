This will be achieved by focusing on a market segment called \u201cpremium class\u201d, which covers medium class, upper medium class and luxury vehicles up to SUVs. This segment is facing severe problems in reaching European environmental exhaust targets, when running on fossil fuel only, not the least due to the considerable vehicle weight.\n\nIn ADVICE three physical demonstrator vehicles are built, ranging from mild-hybrid, plug-in-hybrid to full-hybrid and \u2013 concerning fuel type \u2013 from gasoline to diesel-driven.\nIn addition, it will be shown that the whole range in between these demonstrator vehicles can be well covered by means of validated simulation, yielding a complete coverage of the whole \u201cpremium class\u201d segment.\n\nADVICE aims for a reduction of exhaust and CO2 emissions on WLTP of 20% and a 25% increase in electric driving range for P-HEVs at a maximum premium cost of 5% for HEV (15% for P-HEV) with respect to the best in-class non-hybrid diesel vehicles. Particular attention is devoted to optimum driveability and drive performance, which are essential when purchasing a \u201cpremium class\u201d vehicle and thus crucial to achieve the market penetration aimed at. These objectives will be accomplished by:\n* Architecture-level  hybrid powertrain solutions, suited to be modularly applied to different segments  to increase their volumes while reducing costs\n* Advanced predictive control strategies and model predictive control strategies, taking the entire vehicle into account (not only the hybrid part)\n* Novel optimised approaches in the aftertreatment system\n* Newly developed high-temperature electronics, enabling novel strategies and approaches for energy- and thermal-management\n* Multi-core processor architectures, enabling sophisticated control strategies and models processed on-board the vehicles\n\nADVICE results will be verified through vehicle validator independent tests", 594873.0, 11100910.0, 8, 22, "ADVICE", null, null, null, "h2020_208459_922161832"], [1485907200000, 1498780800000, "Low-cost, High-efficiency FLYwheel Energy Recovery System for On-highway Commercial Vehicles", "Flybrid Automotive Limited", "The aim of the feasibility study is for Flybrid Automotive Ltd, a world leader in high-speed flywheel energy storage, to evaluate the technical, market and commercial opportunities of developing an innovative kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) for On-highway commercial vehicles, based on an existing, low-cost Off-highway product.\n\nCommercial vehicle operators are under continuous pressure to reduce operating costs of which fuel is a significant part.
