It will help them to:\r\n- understand other countries professional methods\r\n- open their mind to other cultures\r\n- acquire more autonomy.\r\n\r\nWe would like to support the increasing demand of our learners for european workplacements (3 mobilities in 2009, 10 in 2015, 16 in 2016, 20 in 2017 on a class of 100 learners every year). In line with this regular increase we would like in this project :\r\n- to obtain 22 placement mobilities for our learners\r\n- to improve the quality of these mobilities by sending 2 coaching teachers at the beginning of the placements. We choose the welcoming organisations according to our professional fields (English or Mediterranean gardens, natural spaces).\r\n\r\nWe would also like to obtain 2 staff training mobilities:\r\n- to reinforce the teaching team for our English european sections,\r\n- to improve the teaching, educational and technical skills of our teachers and staff, \r\n- to have more staff implied in international projects.\r\n\r\nMethods: \r\nThis project will help us to improve the quality of our mobilities. \r\nWe would like to continue the development of partnerships with european schools in order to have more placements and more educational and technical exchanges. Our steering committee defines objectives, plans our actions, selects candidates and works out monitoring documents. We organize mentoring meetings to help applicants to achieve their project and we plan preparation days before the departure.  \r\n\r\nImpact: \r\nOur target is to yearly increase learners placements in order to reach finally a high rate of foreign placements: 60% in Bac Techno STAV and 20% in Bac Pro. \r\nWe plan to improve the quality of our placements by more coach visits. Every learner mobility will be certificated for their exam and all mobilities by europass. We will monitor our results by survey on school-to-work transition and participant reports analysis.\r\nWe want to organize regular staff mobility and we plan to certify the skills acquired by language tests and participant reports analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDissemination:\r\nAfter their return, students and staff present their experience to new classes. Teachers present their new skills, knowledges and projects to the team. Communication will be planned and systematized towards parents, students of agricultural education, local partners, professionals and authorities.\r\n\r\nThis whole process should help us to improve the quality of our education, enhance our learners employability and the lifelong education of our community.", "http://www3.hilliergardens.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036833_2"]]}}, "5RU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1241136000000, 1304121600000, "Methodologies and Tools Advancing the DesiGN and Validation of EGNOS/GALILEO Aware Applications", "VMW Solutions Ltd.", "Positioning applications (especially in Europe) are based on positioning data mainly provided by GPS (and in the medium-term GALILEO), which in many cases may become problematic due to the low accuracy provided (thus preventing the take-up of services with high accuracy constraints), the low availability of satellite positioning signals particularly in urban areas and the reliability of the positioning information, the so-called integrity.  GNSS Augmentation Systems like WAAS (in United States), MSAS (in Japan) and EGNOS (in Europe) has been a consistent attempt to overcome these GNSS problems and improve the positioning applications attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability. These systems have reached today a quite mature state, however related technology and algorithms on the applications side have being certified and used with efficiency only in niche areas like the air navigation systems. Still the significant technological know-how of embedding EGNOS (in Europe) functionality in positioning applications, has prevented European SMEs, developing location based applications, from adopting these new technological opportunities, thus not getting them in a position to be able to exploit the accuracy, reliability, and availability offered by EGNOS (and future GALILEO) in their applications. This fact also prevents them from presenting new pioneering positioning applications, as it would require a huge EGNOS/GALILEO technology investment, which usually is outside of the core business of such companies.  The MAGNA project aims to provide a viable solution to the aforementioned SME problems, by supplying the software libraries and tools required for the design and validation of EGNOS/GALILEO aware positioning applications, targeting SMEs who are seeking to improve their existing positioning applications, and launch new applications making full utilisation of the EGNOS/GALILEO technologies.", 5989.0, 1312874.0, 5, 10, "MAGNA", "http://www.magna-egnos.com", "http://www.vmwsolutions.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58242.jpg", "fp7_107797_998084023"]]}}, "7ZA": {"nhs": {"data": [["RW1", "Romsey Hospital", "nhs_RW1FY"]]}}, "9DG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1262304000000, 1356912000000, "Polymer Photonic multiparametric biochemical SENSor for Point of care diagnostics", "Stratophase Ltd", "The detection of chemical or biological substances increasingly appears as an essential concern in order to prevent human or animal health and security related problems. Present analytical techniques are expensive and often require highly specialized staff and infrastructures. The principal need is to perform screening tests, which can be carried out in non-specialized infrastructures, e.g. Point of Care, schools and field, before unambiguous identification in a specialized laboratory. There is thus a need to develop a new detection system that has low-cost and is portable but at the same time offers high sensitivity, selectivity and multi-analyte detection from a sample containing various components (e.g. blood, serum, saliva, etc.).<br/>The objective of P3SENS is to design, fabricate and validate a multichannel (50 or more) polymer photonic crystal based label-free disposable biosensor allowing for a 'positive/negative' detection scheme of ultra small concentrations of analytes in solution (&lt; 1 ng/mL). The biosensor will be encapsulated in a specifically designed microfluidic system in order to deliver the sample to the multiple sensing zones. The design of the biochip will allow it to be easily inserted in a compact measurement platform, usable by non-specialized practitioners outside of specialized laboratories for carrying simultaneous multi-analyte detection, delivering real-time monitoring, and with an assay duration that will not exceed a few tens of minutes.<br/>The photonic chip proposed in this project will be based on polymer Photonic Crystal (PhC) micro-cavities coupled into a planar waveguide optical distribution circuit. The photonic chip will be fabricated with available fabrication technologies - and with an emphasis on low cost substrates (polymer) and fabrication processes (nano-imprint lithography).
