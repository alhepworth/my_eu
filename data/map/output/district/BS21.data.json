As a result, the collaboration between the four schools is the first project of such grand scale within the educational framework of the twinning history of the four towns.\r\n \r\nThe project consists of students and teachers of the Albertus-Magnus-Gymnasium in Germany, Clevedon School in the United Kingdom, the Lyc\u00e9e Polyvalent Europ\u00e9en St\u00e9phane Hessel in France and the Royal Atheneum Centrum Ostend in Belgium. The main product will be the elaboration of the schools twinning magazine in digital and print version with title \u201cTwinningVilles Plus\u201d. The 100 students involved in this innovative endeavour are aged between 14 and 17 years and will be working together in the various areas of the editorial and production/printing process of the magazine. \r\n\r\nThe main content of the magazine will include the activities held during the learning, teaching and training sessions. In addition, it will incorporate the collaboration between the participating schools and the involved stakeholders. The working language of the project in English, however, the magazine will be multi-lingual (English, Flemish, French and German). Four editions of the magazine are planned for the entire run of the project, they are exempt from advertisements, are available for free in digital version and in a limited number in print version. \r\n\r\nThe students will meet in weekly sessions in the Erasmus+ club of each school. They will be in constant contact with the other students from the other participating schools via eTwinning \u2013 the platform on which the product will be uploaded, discussed and edited. They hereby use the necessary digital media and tool during the conception of the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe students will also take part in different workshops dealing with journalistic working. Additionally, they will learn how to work with the essential ICT-based methodologies such as digital media, tools, software and programmes which will be required for the design, layout, photography and further section of the magazine. The workshops related to the topics mentioned above will be organised and taught by ICT- teachers and expert students. This way the project will help the students improve basic skills such as digital skills, media literacy and language skills.   \r\n\r\nThe project will offer a set of lessons focusing on European topics. Indeed, the students will be taught together in certain subjects such as History, Social Studies or Geography and will deepen their knowledge thanks to the study trips to the European institutions during the short-term exchanges. Furthermore, the celebration of \u201cEurope Day\u201d on May 9th will take place at each school with an official event in order to commemorate this special day.  \r\n\r\nThe project will have activities reflecting the variety of the project itself and all its participants. The students will organise and produce official and international events for instance the sports competition, the project exhibition and  \r\nthe project concert. All these activities and products will enhance the students\u2019 transversal skills such as creativity, initiative, decision taking and further basic skills such as entrepreneurship and interculturality. \r\n\r\nThe project will improve the teachers\u2019 professional skills and will involve the entire school community which foster the corporate identity within the school. As a matter of fact, teachers will prepare and teach lessons in teams in an international environment and as a result they will be more confident to use such pedagogical methods in their daily work.\r\n\r\nThe different stakeholders will benefit of the opportunity to work with teaching staff and students from diverse cultural and traditional backgrounds, to make their work and scope public thanks to the multitude of activities and the dissemination of the project results in digital and traditional media. In the future, students might be interested to start a professional career in one of the sectors explored during the project and have access to the world of work.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, our project\u2019s aims to increase the European dimension of schools and to raise awareness about the importance and the benefits of twinning and exchange between Europeans by providing to our students a new and attractive education approach and methods. The project will also allow students be active citizens since they will foster the European twinning spirit by producing a magazine for their communities and organising official events. Hence, they will contribute to a more cohesive society with a pronounced openness and understanding for diversity within our continent.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035619_1"]]}}, "6QQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Knowledge and Competence Progression for ONE European Employment Market", "SKF UK Ltd", 414268.0, 10, 18, "The foundation of the consortium consists of the public technical schools run by SKF, Volvo Cars and Perstorp. These schools have cooperated for many years in different networks. Lerum Adult Education, and more specifically their apprentice program for blacksmiths, was invited to the consortium to give new perspective on validation of knowledge obtained at an internship, something which also initiated a cooperation concerning ECVET with our foreign partner organizations. A common trait for all partner organizations is the specific vocational competence they can contribute with \u2013 a trait that enhances the quality of the education we offer our students/apprentices. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the consortium is to give the participants of our Erasmus+ project the extra dimension that internship/job shadowing abroad can bring. We expect our students to strengthen their vocational skills, vocational identity, language knowledge and understanding of cultural differences and similarities between countries and organizations. As a whole, this will contribute to making our students more attractive as future employees. We expect our staff to further develop their ability to identify different competence levels regarding vocational skills, to enhance quality regarding internship and to learn more about digitalization. All this to improve the results of our students and to contribute to the development of our schools, the industrial society and society as a whole. Mainly, our European Development Plan is about making the students see Europe as ONE employment market. The schools of the consortium will influence the development in society by attracting more young people to technical vocational programs since our focus towards the industry of the future will contribute to enhanced competiveness. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, 219 mobilities will take place. Out of these, 184 mobilities are for upper secondary students at the Industrial technology program, Electricity program and the Technology program, 15 mobilities are for handicraft apprentices and 20 mobilities are for school staff and/or supersvisors at the companies. Generally, students and staff from all schools are required to apply for participation in the project and they will be accepted as long as they are vocationally skilled and are good representatives for their schools, the companies, Erasmus+ and Sweden. An extra requirement for students and apprentices is that they have fulfilled previous internships in Sweden with a satisfactory result. All schools use Learning Agreements to ensure high standards, and Learning Outcomes are documented in the Europass Mobility Document. The OLS language test and the web-based language courses are used to make sure the students/apprentices have linguistic abilities to be able to benefit from their internships. Grant Agreements are established so that the students are in control of their budget. The apprentices at Lerum Adult Education, are given a greater responsibility for their international internship regarding their budget as well as initiating contacts and communicating with their supervisors to be. \r\n\r\nExpected impact and learning outcomes for teachers, supervisors and organizations, are an increased understanding of the production and processes at plants/work places in other countries, a greater understanding of how to use ECVET for validation of knowledge and competences within vocational courses, an improved and quality assured process for internship and an extended network in Europe. Expected impact and learning outcomes for students and apprentices is mainly greater employability due to enhanced vocational skills, stronger vocational identity, improved language skills, a larger understanding of the connection between technical development and the development of a more sustainable society \u2013 ecologically, economically and socially.  Everything to raise the students/apprentices interest concerning future work in Europe.\r\n\r\nEvery school spreads results from the project at their websites, educational fairs and open houses for potential students and their parents. An idea is to give some students the opportunity to create a film that can be used for these purposes. The apprentices from Lerum Adult Education partake in various handicraft competitions and fairs in order to spread knowledge and experiences. The different parts of the project will be presented at staff meetings and contribute to organizational development.

The participants need expertise in several special areas such as: maintenance, grinding technology, steering techniques, etc. The project aims to enhance participants' employability through greater understanding and awareness regarding the way the value chain affects individuals, business and society.  The project is supposed to strengthen the participants\u00b4 commitment, so that together with their future colleagues they will be able to develop new methods and approaches aimed at enhancing quality and improving utilization regarding all kinds of resources. The project does focus on  Business Excellence  which is the SKF interpretation of Lean Production. Three driving forces, continously changing conditions in production and society are studied namely: The rapid technological developoment, sustainability and the effects of internationalisation. \r\n With respect to the idea of Life long learning and within the framework of Lean Production, the project will  also focus on diversity in general and gender equality in particular. Sending organisations are strongly linked to international groups, whose activities are increasingly dependent on  Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR. A caring company is a sucessfull company! While comparing production processes, work organisation and management, the participants will stay in touch with 15-year-old students in public compulsary schools using modern IT. The idea is to motivate and enhance compulsary school students and teachers so that more young people will take the opportunity to participate in the renewal process. Since this project also has a focus on gender equality the project will focus on girls getting more intrested in modern technology as well as in industrial business.          \r\nAnother important objective, strongly linked to the previous one, consists of the European dimension and its focus on increasing understanding between nations and peoples in Europe: the EU is a peace project! The participants will prepare themselves by studying the way the European Union aims to increase understanding through economic, cultural and social cooperation.  Most\r\n activities will be conducted abroad, because it is more than likely that in the future the participants will be offered jobs abroad. In order to create a deeper understanding of cultural features, the project needs to include an intercultural perspective.

Our desire for this European dimension is part of this approach and fits in perfectly with this ambition. All the students who have completed their studies in Business and Administration in our school have been offered a trip abroad to a major European city at some point. Since 2004, the school has taught European Classes in English and Spanish on a voluntary basis with vocational subjects taught in English. The school has been involved in three European funded projects for nearly ten years : The Comenius, Leonardo and Erasmus Projects. A financial contribution has been granted by the school for each student having a work experience abroad. This 24-month mobility project is intended to students in our vocational school studying Administration, retail or Sales. The target group consists of students who were not allowed to attend  schools that teach academic subjects therefore seeing themselves as failing at school. Only a few of them came here because they wanted to , most of them being here because they have no other choice. The factors that could motivate the students  do not seem to appeal to them. This project will therefore  help  to remotivate them, to highlight their efforts and restore their self-confidence, to bring them back the pleasure of learning and doing their schoolwork regularly but also to make them aware of the European reality in all its diversity and richness and help them realize all the opportunities that Europe can offer. This  group of 8 boys and girls who are in the final year of a 3- year course  will go to Bristol for five weeks from mid-September to late October. Most of them who are 17 to 19 years old, belong to the European class designed to prepare them at school for this experience abroad including extra English lessons and extra lessons of vocational  subjects taught in English every week. In Bristol, they are placed in a host family on their own with no other guest. The mobility starts with a week  of intensive English Language courses organis ed by Acad\u00e9mie Aquitaine,our intermediate partner for five years, Debbie being also the contact person and their tutor during the stay. Practising English and role-plays in working situations help them build  self-confidence before the training period starts the following week. This 4-week internship from late September to the mid-term holiday  is set,  according to the dates of the fifth training period done by all our students in their final year. On their flight to Bristol, the group is accompanied by their English teacher who takes this opportunity to meet the companies and shops\u2019 managers again and remind them of the objectives to reach. At the end of the mobility, two teachers in Sales and Administration visit each workplace to fill in the official Assessment grid together with the student and the tutor and then fly back with them. This project also supports the attainment of training objectives in a  European context where company practices are different. These  assessments are taken into account in the vocational subjects of their final exam. This experience abroad is also tested during an oral exam which helps the beneficiary graduate with the European class option. The Europass portfolio and the Europro certificate are given to the students on a special European evening at the school. Through mobility the beneficiaries can certify the skills acquired and the competences developed such as integration, independence, open-mindedness, communication in a foreign language. We have been able to assess the progress made by the students in:\r\n- the need for mobility as many plan to have other work experiences in Europe\r\n- job and career opportunities on the European market\r\n- their ability to adapt to a new context (personal or professional)\r\n- European citizenship\r\n- diversity of European culture and cultural understanding\r\n- increased self-confidence and a greater maturity\r\n- more educational opportunities at a higher level.\r\nToday our school wants to play an important role in the European projects and disseminates the benefits.

This Partnership seeks to show the potential farms have as an educational setting and to increase the uptake, quality and quantity of VET courses on offer across Europe.   The sharing, development and transfer of this knowledge has a clear goal.  The goal is to provide strengthened social inclusion through improved competences in VET curricula so that SEND learners can be provided with permeable pathways into employment.\r\n\r\nThis goal can be recognised through the more precise objectives of this Partnership which are to:\r\n-  Share knowledge of outreach to promote access for disabled learners onto courses in farms as permeable pathways into the labour market,\r\n-  Develop inclusive and accessible schemes of work for learners with disabilities,\r\n-  Provide stimulating, inspirational collaboration to motivate and aid VET teachers\u2019 and staffs\u2019 continuous professional development.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Partnership consists of three countries: the UK, Italy and Romania.

They seek to enhance the Erasmus +\u2019 aims of sharing best practice internationally in order to provide better educational opportunities and therefore exceptional career pathways for all. \r\nWithin Italy Avofid, a farm hosting SEND learners and their families,  seeks to be part of this innovative Partnership. Avofid will be new to the Erasmus programme and opportunities it offers.  Avofid provides support, VET learning and socialisation for those with disabilities.  The courses include creative and educational workshops.  Additionally there are cultural excursions and free social time for SEND learners.  This in turn provides rest-bite for families involved.\r\nSimion Mehedinti in a high school in Romania for students with disabilities.  It teaches 250 students between 14 and 26 years of age.  The courses include mechanics, carpentry, tailoring and construction.

Throughout the Partnership there will be collaboration through shared virtual platforms.  There will be two initial meetings to refine plans and activities for the 5 day learning event.  The initial meetings will take place at Avofid in Italy and Simion Mehedinti in Romania.  This will also provide all participants with an opportunity to observe and discuss VET courses in situ.\r\nThe main 5 day learning and training event will take part in the south-west of England.  Here, all activities will be prepared to meet the objectives of the Partnership.  This will include the sharing, collaboration and review of outreach material and schemes of work.  During these 5 days, other local organisations who have also expressed an interest will be involved such as city farms and employers of SEND learners.\r\n\r\nThe Enso Group and Simion Mehedinti already have experience of the precise methodology needed for carrying out this project.\r\nThe project work plan will be written and shared with all partners so it is clear what is expected of each partner.  Enso will monitor all development (preparations, budgets and logistics), two initial meetings will provide short-term deadlines for much of the preparatory work.\r\n\r\nThis Partnership envisages better quality VET curricula available on farms and material available to increase the uptake upon these courses.  The longer term results will aim to have more SEND learners on courses on farms and also to have an increase in paid employment.  This impact could not only change the lives of SEND learners and their families but could also change how companies value SEND employees.    \r\nThe way to ensure that this is transnationally available is to disseminate the results of the Partnership on platforms such as EPALE, Start Academy and the European Federation of City Farms' websites and social media pages.
