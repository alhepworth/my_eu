This time will allow participants to discover an other way of life accross few activities like agriculture towed by animal, discovering of savage edible plants, hiking with donkey....Moreover , this project will be the opportunity for the youngs to know an other country and others cultures...In this way, young people could create some exchanges time across some cohesion games or during evenings parties , meeting, debates...It's important for young people to understand that ecology concernes everybody, not only politicians, countries... They have to change and adapt their behaviour to create a better future.Trainning citizens of tomorrow, it's work our futur way of life.

Use of the technique demands an accurate knowledge of underground utility assets and other obstructions in the drill path.\nThis proposal is to progress the prototype HDD bore-head radar technology developed under the project ORFEUS  to a commercial stage.\n\nORFEUS (\u201cOptimised Radar to Find Every Utility in the Street\u201d) was a 6th Framework collaborative research project. One of its aims was to design a prototype innovative ground probing radar (GPR) based real-time obstacle detection system to increase the safety margins of HDD to allow its use in the widest possible range of conditions. A successful outcome was a working, rigorously tested, prototype \u201cbore-head GPR\u201d.  Most of the objectives of ORFEUS were fulfilled, with results in crucial areas giving confidence to carry out further development to produce a commercial system.\nUnresolved technical issues requiring further work are associated with the optimum antenna configuration and electrical/mechanical interface to the disposable drill head; identification and validation of the most effective bore-head GPR data processing algorithms; validation of performance, and ruggedisation of the data communication link; validation of performance, and ruggedisation of the connector systems.\n\nExtensive testing and validation, as well as supporting the demonstration and exploitation of the final product, is proposed. The crucial testing and evaluation phase will assess the risks, confirm environmental benefits and increase end users\u2019 (public authorities and industry) confidence, awareness and uptake of this new technology.\n\nTechnology transfer, training and standardisation, in cooperation with European standards organisations, will also be a significant element of the project.", 60496.0, 2808612.0, 7, 11, "ORFEUS", "http://www.orfeus.org", null, null, "fp7_105520_957564116"]]}}, "3BP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1351728000000, 1425081600000, "Composite Pipes and Fittings for Aero-Engines Dressing", "Sigma Precision Components Uk Ltd", "The object of this project is to update the concept of aero-engine dressing to the most advanced concepts already used in commercial aircrafts.\nThe existing design concepts and components utilised within the engine dressings have remained largely static for a long period of time; there is little difference in the components and materials used in the engine dressings on the latest Trent engines to the early RB211\u2019s.\nIn today\u2019s competitive aero-engine market, the primary product discriminators are cost-driven. Typical cost savings of 20-30% delivered by PMCs in replacing incumbent metal parts; therefore, provide added incentive for wider application of these materials. With these impressive advantages on offer, it may seem difficult to understand why composite materials do not dominate the latest civil and military engines.\nCOMPipe will allow to design and manufacture an agreed set of non-metallic pipes and support systems to replace traditional metallic variants in engine dressings. It will also identify the manufacturing processes that could be used to scale up the production requirements to meet future delivery needs.\nThe scientific and technical objectives to reach along the project will be\ni.\tTo design and develop a new concept of non-metallic pipes and fittings suited for aero-engines, specifically drains, scavenge, sensor and vent lines\nii.\tTo select materials meeting the required environmental constrains, both in the range of temperatures and in the chemical resistance to different products present in the aero-engine, such as Skydrol hydraulic fluid, oil and aviation fuel.\niii.\tTo develop one or more manufacturing practices and to improve existing methodologies driving to\na.\tTo a product standard with a near to zero wall\u00b4s porosity\nb.\tTo produce 3D geometries of according to the already existing metallic technology.\nc.\tTo assess the future full automation of the process.\nd.\tTo ensure that Nadcap qualification will be reached in a short time", 472904.0, 1480394.0, 1, 2, "COMPIPE", "http://www.compipe.eu/", "http://www.sigmacomponents.com", null, "fp7_105682_953050415"]]}}, "3DA": {"nhs": {"data": [["RT5", "Hinckley & Bosworth Community Hospital", "nhs_RY8DJ"]]}}}}
