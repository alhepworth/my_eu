Over the medium and long-term, we expect to generate in the cycle a stimulated dynamic of the entrepreneurial  spirit and the mobility in the students, consolidating better academics outcomes and reducing the number o early school leavers.The impact on the Centers will mean an improvement of the educational quality, in a effort of adapting to the new technologies, contributing to create a new European culture with the consequent social impact that involve foreign mobilities, to the improvement of the curriculum project of the training cycles and creation of networks.At local level, this Consortium will be involve a first step to the involvement of local official institutions by improving the quality in Education and Training of our futures human resources, to favor the spreading to others centers of the city, thus expecting that this experience  achieves a projection  that reverts in the development of a participatory politics and inserted in the Training and Educations necessities, the enterprise and thus the creation of  synergies with other local, national or European partners organization.", "http://www.thebis.com/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024071_4"], [2018, "D.O.C.E.T. - Didactic Objectives and Cultural Empowerment for Teachers", "The British International School", 52711.0, 4, 4, "In a territorial context that lives situations of social-economic disadvantage, The State Lyceum \u201cLucrezia Della Valle\u201d is a reference point for the area of Cosenza, with its centuries-old presence that has been working for years on the spot in order to guarantee a training supply of excellence.  To this end, the project \"D.O.C.E.T. - Didactic Objectives and Cultural Empowerment for Teachers\u201d aims to configure itself as an opportunity both growth and development of the school and its main actors, in order   to affect the entire community too.

Considering these aspects, it is necessary to think of an improvement of the skills of teachers both from the point of view of information technology and teaching methodologies and both  can   avail themselves of the role play, case studies and group work,  in order  to increase the interest of students and contribute to both a reduction of early school leavers and to an improvement of the results of learning of students. It is essential too to think of a system for evaluating the teachers with particular attention to their ability to refresh and remain in line with the times.\r\nThe project \"A.TE.A.M. FOR INCLUSION - AlTErnative TEACHING METHODS FOR INCLUSION\" arises from these considerations and provides a  mobility to 10 teachers in Ireland and 10 teachers in the United Kingdom, in order to realize the experiences of job shadowing for favoring a better social inclusion of students with learning difficulties, i.e. from disadvantaged backgrounds, immigrants or with disabilities, as well as from the need to improve the service of orientation of the students in the labor market.\r\nThe objectives of the project are the following ones:\r\n\uf0fc To guarantee for the teachers more digital skills in order to use the ITC efficiently and effectively in the didactics, helping to mitigate the gap between \"native\" and \"Digital immigrants\";\r\n\uf0fc To Promote, consolidate and reinforce teaching methodologies less traditional such as   CLIL practices, the use of the role play, the study of cases and the work in the group thanks to the experience of the job shadowing; \r\n\uf0fc To Share with foreign  schools the effort in combating early school leavers;\r\n\uf0fc To Create a network of useful partnership for programming new mobilities ; \r\nTo Deepen the  knowledge of the different education systems in particular in the construction of paths of young apprenticeship programmes;\r\n\uf0fc To Accelerate the path that was already undertaken in the construction of a system of excellence for the evaluation of teachers because of helping raising   the quality of education.\r\nIt is intended to promote cooperation between the IISS \"D.Romanazzi\" and its  planning partners  for the realization of the project\u2019s goals, respectively the British International School (BIS) and Swan  Training Institute, that will be  the stages of preparation of teachers before their mobility , the organization of the logistics  organizational aspects, for the monitoring of the results and their dissemination.\r\nThe teachers before departure will receive a linguistic-cultural preparation and they will attend a course based on techniques of according to CLIL methodology (Content and Language Integrated Learning), in order to maximize the effects of mobility.

From the point of view of results, the project \"A.TE.A.M.
