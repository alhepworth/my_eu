The project\u2019s response to these challenges will begin in UK with the development of an innovative integration of two technologies working in tandem (digital table and large scale 360 degree projected displays) to act as a medium through which pupils can experience high quality dual language learning. Accompanying software will incorporate sound files in pupils\u2019 home languages alongside English, and pupils will be encouraged to communicate in whichever language supports their activity, i.e. their home language or the language of the school or a mixture of both. The activities operating through this technology will be enquiries (problems or puzzles) coherent with schools\u2019 curriculum subject knowledge requirements, and which will therefore demand purposeful language use.  The objective is to improve the Eastern European pupils\u2019 motivation and engagement towards institutionalised school activity, at the same time as improving their proficiency in using cognitive academic language for learning in both their home language and English. Collaboration with parents, and the transformation of teachers\u2019 attitudes towards Traveller communities is an integral part of the project so that children\u2019s cultural and linguistic backgrounds are made available to schools by parents who trust this information is respected, valorised and used by teachers to improve the educational and social inclusion of their children. At the same time families become more knowledgeable about institutionalised education.  \r\n\r\nThe results of developments in UK and the lessons learned will act as a springboard for work in phase two to promote a dual language pedagogic approach in France, Finland and Romania, appropriate to the needs of their children and context. The project is therefore iterative in its responsiveness to lessons learned from one context applied sensitively to another. \r\nTo achieve this, partners from 4 European countries will work together. The coordinator of the project (at Newcastle University, UK) is an expert in the field of teacher education in equality and diversity who has close collaborative links with local schools including WestgateHill Primary School where over 90% of pupils speak English as an additional language, and where the dual language immersive space will be created by the technology for the benefit of local Eastern European Traveller pupils, including Roma in the first instance. The project also benefits from two other Newcastle University participants who provide expertise in enquiry-based learning, and in interaction design. The co-coordinator of the project (at Middlesex University, UK) is another expert in teacher education and collaboration with multilingual communities. The UK participants are joined by a professor of multiculturalism (at Helsinki University) an expert on funded European projects that focus on equality who coordinates a team of two other Helsinki University participants whose expertise includes the development and promotion of bilingual pedagogies in Finnish schools and video and linguistic analyses. A professor of education (at Institut Catholique de Paris) in France where a large number of Romanian migrants have settled in recent years is the French partner. The Finnish and French participants will identify collaborative school partners where similar technologies will be used during the project. Finally, the project has a Romanian partner who is president of the people-to-people foundation, who built and runs a thriving school for Roma children in Oradea, Romania. \r\n\r\nThrough wide-scale dissemination of all outputs from the project, the long term aim is to effect practice changes in the inclusion and education of Eastern European Traveller including Roma pupils across Europe in order to positively impact on increased school attendance and improved educational achievement. We expect the project to lead to greater teacher understanding and responsiveness to cultural and linguistic diversity, with improved competency specifically in teaching pupils from Eastern European Traveller including Roma groups. For parents we aim for the project to contribute towards an improved understanding of the cultural values and practices of institutionalised education in the partner countries. Taken together, the intended impacts on pupils, their parents and schools, could have substantial  longer term impacts on the inclusion of and more active participation of Eastern European Traveller communities in society in each partner country, contributing towards greater social cohesion.", "http://www.arthurshill.newcastle.sch.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000022_4"]]}}, "6US": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "YW-Filling the gaps", "the4Cs - Climate Change Community Champions", 32799.0, 9, 9, "We have identified that we have gaps in our knowledge (dont know how to fund-raise enough money to make our organizations sustainable on long term, we dont have enough trainers in our organization, we dont have enough project management skills as youth workers)\r\n\r\nThis projects goals are to identify the gaps in knowledge of the youth working and to create solutions(activities and projects) in order to fill those gaps. \"Filling the gaps\" is a training and networking project from Erasmus + program, and will be with 10 different partner organizations from 10 different countries(Norway, Germany, Spain, UK, Macedonia, Turkey, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Jordan). \r\n\r\nWe are going to be in total 42 people(participants, trainers, organizers) and we are going to stay in the region of Alta fjord in Finmark.

The Youth Exchange deals with negative developments in the globalized chain of food producers, food processing enterprises and the final consumers.  The exchange aims to to raise awareness among youth to improve their consciousness for good food, its origins and a responsible ecological behavior of all of us, that will lead to a healthier lifestyle.Nowadays the largest share of world\u2019s population participates in a global cycle of production, trade, processing and consumption of food. This food is not any more consumed, where it has been produced nor does it reach the end consumer in a raw form. In our global world imported food replaces local food, convenience food and eating out replaces home-cooked food, fast food replaces slow food. Even worse, large quantities of food produced actually never reaches the consumer. Due to distorted consumer demands - especially in our Western World - it is sorted out and thrown away. Food decays during transport and storage or it is taken out of stores due to overregulated shelf-life prescriptions. Interests of international food conglomerates to sell cheaper products with higher profits lead to the gradual degradation of food. The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healty races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Monocultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Articifical spices, colours,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. But there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. We design this Youth Exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves. They will learn from each other about developments in their countries. They will study the importance of transport, storage, sorting, packaging and positioning to influence their consumer behaviours. The will be visiting farmers, wholesale markets, supermarkets to inquire and discover themselves the mechanism of price and production. They will train themselves to read, study, understand and analyze the prescriptions of food. They will attempt to design an own youth-friendly diet by buying, tasting and by cooking food together. We will experience in person the difference between industrial farming and ecological farming. They will be helped by activists, researchers and inspection services.

The GLR is responsible for the organizing of this part of the final exams. The GLR can guarantee the quality.\r\no Specialist teachers are available by email so any questions can always be answered.\r\n- Preparation, selection and supervision:\r\no All students are qualified for an internship abroad.

This is a project that appears as a result of a diagnosis of the problems listed in the Educational Project of the Felgueiras high  school  and in studies on the socio-cultural context in which it operates and intends, through the mobility of teachers and students, to fight against  these difficulties and promote the virtues already evidenced in other mobility projects, previously carried out.\r\n\r\nThe situations of deprivation and social exclusion, together with ways of life marked by pluriactivity, where there are plenty of  employment opportunities based on low wages, discourages the discipline and school success and are an invitation to not go into further studies. These situations require from  the School staff an intense and constant motivation of students to work, adequacy of methods of teaching and adaptation of teachers to  the increasingly difficult operating environments.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulties referred to, this school is committed to maintaining its professional courses with high success rates, to form young people for the labour market where they are inserted and that they won\u2019t abandon the professional course chosen.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this project functions as a motivational catapult for our  teachers and trainees and thus reduce the school drop-out, testing new solutions like the European mobility, making the sharing of experiences an  added value in terms of personal fulfillment and professional for the  trainees; to strengthen the commitment to making qualifying offers within  the needs of the productive fabric; to improve the adequacy of the courses, trying to match the specificity of each course with the students expectations; to improve the quality of learning, betting on the professional development with diverse experiences; to enhance the trainees ' skills and thus increase their self-esteem and confidence in their abilities; to meet new realities in terms of territory and labour market.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to arrange Jobshadowing programmes for 24 teachers of the professional courses, giving priority to the course directors and also teachers of the courses with higher rate of failure and early school dropout. The possibility of observing distinct realities from ours with recognized results and of being able to discuss with colleagues from other nationalities the different solutions to the problems that concern our school may be an excellent  contribution to the resolution of the problems that affect our classes and our students.\r\n\r\nThis formative experience will be done in three partner schools of Gelsenkirchen, Germany, Vitr\u00e9, France and Newcastle, United Kingdom, schools with which we have already had previous collaborations in exchange and mobility projects. These schools present educational projects that have proved successful at the level of results schools, the rate of completion of the courses and the employability of students and those are the problems that affect our classes and our students. Therefore, they will be spaces of potential learning of new methodologies to address the problems that affect our school.\r\nPRO-MOV is also a project that aims to put in mobility 24 students in the initial vocational training, for a period of 30 days in companies that cooperate with the partner schools.

Working in and across higher education, public school and third sectors, we offer a response which engages with the very heart of the learning process as experienced by young people across local, national and European levels. Young people\u2019s engagement with what they are learning is a  central aspect of how they are learning. The quality and relevance of skills and competences of young people who leave school is another urgent matter being addressed at European and national levels. This challenge has been met with an opportunity to \u2018rethink education\u2019 with a focus on \u2018stimulating open and flexible learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nWe propose that a lack of active involvement in one's own learning is a key component in the high percentage of young people who do not go beyond lower secondary education in Europe. Our solution is long-term investment in the principles of self-organised learning (SOL). SOL is a learner-centred approach in which the role of teacher is as facilitator rather than as transmitter of knowledge and learning content. SOL supports a learner-driven identification and reflection on what is, could and should be learned and how. Learning to learn through SOL is an essential component in how it can specifically promote learner autonomy, engagement and a disposition towards lifelong and lifewide learning. We therefore propose that a change in balance of control between teachers and students can promote engagement and reduce disengagement as a preventative measure towards tackling ESL, with a particular focus on basic and transversal skills.\r\n\r\nOur main project aim is to improve school education (students aged 13-18) in tackling ESL through the development of innovative forms of SOL as preventative and intervention measures. We join experience and capabilities to the delivery of the shared objectives of the project work at local, national and European levels. In doing so, we will straddle the spectrum of formal, in- and non-formal learning situations in a number of basic (maths, reading, science) and transversal skill areas (foreign language skills, digital skills, entrepreneurship, social and civic skills).\r\n\r\nThe project is built around the shared objective to develop, test and implement four sustainable and alternative SOL spaces across Europe. The idea of a space originates from the notion that one cannot design for self-organised learning itself but create an environment for the learning to take place.  In creating these spaces, we also intend to produce a number of transferable outputs which can be used by those working in school education, including young people. These interactive materials include:  a sustainable digital platform for the authoring of learning content in the area of basic and transversal skills; a handbook for facilitators of the SOL spaces in different languages; a guide on methods for student self-reflection and evaluation; links to accreditation for stakeholders creating the SOL spaces; and a guide on learning for change which others can use to implement change in their own settings. We also intend to underpin our activities with a strong research base, providing practice-based evidence about how the different SOL spaces foster engagement 'in action' and impact on engagement. Together, these results are designed to increase pupil engagement in learning basic and transversal skills and capacity for incorporation of new and alternative forms of learning like SOL into the school education context to tackle ESL.\r\n\r\nThe existing adoption of SOL principles across our different sectors coupled with its potential for adaptation provides fertile ground for knowledge exchange relevant at local, national, regional and European levels. Our project involves partners from three universities Newcastle University (coordinator, UK), Lahti University of Applied Sciences who will work with the Rudolf Steiner School Lahti (Finland), two NGO's - Toekomstonderwijs learning centre (Belgium) and Success4All cic (UK), Trinity College Dublin who will work with Irish schools (Ireland) and a public school- George Stephenson High School (UK). We will work together using a networked approach to design, trial and evaluate the SOL spaces as well as participate in transnational meetings and teaching and learning activities to share experience and expertise to benefit the holistic needs of the school education field. We will each play a part in developing a particular cluster based around key themes we think are relevant to knowledge building around tackling ESL. \r\n\r\nBy spreading our results and supporting the school education sector to enhance and transform the learning of basic and transversal skills through SOL, we intend to have an impact on national and European policy.", "http://www.s4a.org.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013439_5"]]}}}}
