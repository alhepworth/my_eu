It aims to contribute to the development of a positive attitude of participants towards themselves, their community, the ''other\u201d and the environment. Receiving also the call made by Pope Francis.  As this project is based on the assumption that young people are the \"seed\" of the future. Of their future, but also that of their town, of their Country and, finally, of a diverse but united Europe.Therefore, the aim of this project is to introduce participants their rights but also their duties, responsibilities and opportunities inherent in being citizens and acting as citizens. The main topics are European awareness, active European citizenship, social responsibility, creativity and entrepreneurship, protection of the environment but also the health and well-being.The objectives and the impact of the project will affect primarily the participants but then, consequently, their own families, communities and their towns. And the partner organizations. In the wake of that active European citizenship that here we want to contribute to nurture and build and make the protagonist both at local and EU level.  Hence, the project's impact on young participants and their local communities will be realised when these objectives will be achieved and maintained not only in the immediate, but in the medium and long term as well. First of all, the impact on participants is measured in the contribution the project will make to the development of their knowledge, skills, competencies and attitudes, at the individual, social and cultural level. In addition, the project's impact on participants will be reflected on their own communities, which will begin to be affected by a small, new change of behavior and responsibility by some of its youngest citizens. Therefore, it is It hopes that towns and communities will be a little more affected by a new enthusiasm and will-to-do. At the level of partner organizations, in addition, the impact of this project could lead to new solutions and projects that can \"capitalize\" the assets acquired and promote other forms of interaction among partners around themes, objectives and common sensibility.The method used will be based on non-formal and experiencial learning, on intercultural dialogue, tolerance, solidarity and social inclusion. As well as on the full interaction, active participation, responsibility and entrepreneurship of the participants.Consequently, the implemented activities will bes: energizers and warm-ups, icebreakings, brainstorming, thematic forums, team building activities, team-games and role-playing games, educational workshops and interactive activities of storytelling, photography and video-making, problem-solving exercises, sports and outdoors, musical performances and intercultural moments.", "http://www.bigboxcreativity.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-IT03-KA105-008571_2"], [2015, "Your Voice Matters !", "Big Box Create LTD", 14576.0, 10, 10, "Mobility of youth workers - Partner Countries \r\n\r\nProject by the name : Your Voice Matters ! \r\n\r\nInvolves 26 participants from 10 countries: Czech Republik, Italy, Greece, Albania, Armenia, Serbia, Azerbaijan,Spain, FYROM, United Kingdom. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe mobility was focused on youth with disability, their coverage in media and use of it and ICT to foster their inclusion into society also during taking part in European project.

This project will see the fusion of two innovative pedagogies to help secure equality of access and provision for young people from refugee and/or migrant backgrounds or those for whom the language of instruction is not their first language.  A key aim is to equip these young people with the skills and competences to increase employment opportunities, enabling them to contribute positively to economic growth and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within each partner country. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe dual focused approach of CLIL, where an additional language is used for the teaching and learning of both content and language simultaneously, promotes higher order thinking skills such as problem solving and reasoning and creative thinking.  Adopting a CLIL pedagogy affords teachers opportunities to exploit the synergies between mathematics and language learning to help combat the language gap. Common to both disciplines and a factor that can have a significant impact on teachers is their own emotional responses to them.  Mathematics can provoke anxiety and negative attitudes in the same way as learning a second language. Teachers can lack confidence in their own ability and lack experience of teaching in increasingly diverse school contexts.  A recent EU Commission in 2017 found that whilst there are a growing number of learners from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, teachers in most European countries remain largely homogenous.  \r\nWhen playing computer-based games, learners are practising and applying a set of 21st century skills that can be applied in the real world. (Prensky, 2006).  Learning does not just involve acquiring knowledge and content, game-based resources can offer a different way to engage and interact with this content and promotes different ways of thinking, as well as inspiring creativity, interest and social interaction. (Squire, 2011).  The problem solving elements embedded within the games along with a narrative thread, require the learners to engage with a series of challenges or quests where they assess situations, analyse information, make decisions and decide on a course of action and respond to the consequences of their actions in order to progress through the different stages of the game, all of which are key to cognitive development.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s focus on GBL will help to ensure greater equity for all learners, enabling access and opportunities to develop their digital literacy skills, contributing to a \u2018narrowing of the gap.\u2019 These digital literacy skills are essential for a 21st century workforce and will enable all learners to contribute positively to social cohesion, economic growth and sustainability.  \r\n\r\nImpact/results\r\nCombining Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and game-based learning (GBL) within a mathematics context, will result in significant linguistic gains with students/learners having opportunities to engage with and exposure to the language of instruction within a meaningful and purposeful context.  The GBL resources require students and learners to engage with and access the language to process and assimilate the mathematical concepts, leading to a more secure and deeper understanding.  Through engagement with the GBL resources, students/learners will have opportunities to develop their digital and linguistic competences, which in turn will begin to address the current digital and language gap that exists within students/learners from a refugee and/or migrant background. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, schools and teachers lack the resources and expertise to fully meet the diverse needs of students/learners from migrant backgrounds or students that do not have the language of instruction as their first language.  This often results in student/learner disengagement, leading to poor or low attainment when compared to their peers. The innovative practices encouraged through this project and development of the GBL resources, will contribute to a narrowing of the attainment gap and promote inclusive practice. Student/learner participants engagement with these innovative and GBL resources will secure gains in their key digital and language skills and competences.  Increased competence in numeracy, digital literacies and communication will facilitate more positive contributions to future economic growth and prosperity and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within the participating EU countries.\r\n\r\n A longer-term objective of the project is to provide a blueprint to enable schools and teachers to capitalise on and maximise the potential of innovative pedagogical tools to increase student/learner engagement, to enhance digital and language learning and to narrow the attainment gap, promoting inclusive practice, social justice and equal opportunities for all.", "http://www.cyber-smart.co.uk", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048071_1"]]}}, "2JT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Enhancing Language Teaching and Learning at Castle Hill", "Castle Hill CP School", 1741.0, 1, 1, "Our project aims are as follows;\u2022 To further better the language skills of the participant\u2022 To better Spanish planning and teaching\u2022 Increase Spanish resources within school\u2022 Establish links with partner schools in Spain to create an authentic resource for the children and to create some tangible link to Spain for them\u2022 To deepen the children\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the language, culture and everyday life, in order for them to have a well rounded outlook on Spain and the language\u2022 Instil a love of languages in children from an early age by being a resource that is capable and competent in the target language\u2022 Introduce Spanish into other year groups \u2022 To develop a wide range of resources aimed at every level of learner\u2022 Encourage staff to build on their language knowledge and to use it outside of designated lesson time.The outcome being  to further develop my language, teaching skills and methods, and to most importantly bring it back to the children.

After all, the more the children can relate to a subject, the better immersed they become in that subject, the better their learning journey will be.The only way to sustain the children\u2019s engagement in the language is if they have access to these invaluable authentic experiences. The fact that some of these children know you\u2019ve been to the actual country they are learning the language of is amazing, because they can instantly access facts, ask questions and have them confidently answered, again anchoring their learning to something tangible.There are many positive reasons to be given the opportunity to go to Spain, but the fundamental reason for why we would be willing to undertake this CPD is the invaluable effect and long term impact it will have on the children\u2019s learning of the language. In a time when fewer students are choosing to study languages at GCSE, A Level and degree level, it is imperative to capture their eagerness for learning, now. The benefits for learning any language, not least the second most spoken language in the world, are endless.As part of our recent OFSTED inspection the school had to complete an HMCI Commentary regarding foreign language provision in the school. During feedback they suggested ways we could further develop our language provision by; - introducing it into Key Stage 1 and EYFS, - building a bank of resources aimed at their level to build their knowledge and confidence within this. - making links with partner secondary schools that our children will attend, to further develop our own language provision and - creating links with other primary schools.
