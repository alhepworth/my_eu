The long-term voluntary work will focus on helping exotic wildlife which ended up as victims of illegal or inconsiderate human actions.  The work will be executed in two rescue and rehabilitations centers, being AAP in Almere, the Netherlands and its Spanish branch Primadomus in Villena, Spain. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the voluntary work is executed at two locations, it includes similar activities. Receiving international volunteers with AAP, Almere, the Netherlands is in fact prolongation of earlier successful EVS-projects. The selected volunteers are animal, nature and/or environment motivated young people, by coincidence both coming from Denmark. They will spent their EVS-time within teams of great diversity: paid staff next to many interns and volunteers, colleagues of all levels of education and about 10-15 European nationalities. Through meeting their peers from other countries and of different background they can explore and create an understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and values. Mutually, this will lead to a greater solidarity and tolerance. \r\nThe second location of the project is Primadomus in Spain, participating in EVS since 2014. To safeguard a solid rollout of the project, we have chosen for support and coordination from AAP's headquarters in the Netherlands, accepting the temporal consequence that only Dutch volunteers can take part.\r\n\r\nIn this project we aim on young people from all over Europe. With their involvement in the daily caretaking process, both NGO's will gain important basic support in their labor intensive daily work. The volunteers will increase their awareness and insight in issues of animal welfare. In a charity setting and together with many other European volunteers, they will help animals in need but also get better understanding of underlying problems. The volunteers will learn  skills, attitude and knowledge necessary for animal caretaking, but also gain general life, social and intercultural experience. As most of them have background or career plans involving animals, it's likely that their EVS-experience at AAP or Primadomus improves their chances on the labor market. On long term, as they regularly remain involved with NGO's in their home countries, they also help spreading attention to animal welfare issues internationally.\r\nAlso internally, the receiving organisations will 'profit' from the project. Through intensive contact and long-term involvement of the volunteers, the staff comes into contact with diversity of ideas and habits from different European nations and cultures. This will contribute to better understanding of cultural differences and widen their social horizon as well.\r\n\r\nDuring their EVS year, at both AAP Almere and Primadomus the volunteers will actively take part in the caretaking process of different exotic species in the rescue center. They will work in a team of experienced animal caretakers and will be trained to carry out activities independently. They will change departments/positions in order to maximize their experience.  After initial phase of the project, the volunteers will be also offered opportunity to acquire some experience within other parts of AAP/Primadomus (Animal transport, Fundraising, Prevention, Education etc.); the specific possibilities are dependent on the volunteer\u2019s abilities, interests and attitudes but also on practical possibilities and needs of the organisation. Next to their work directly linked to animal care, the volunteers will be also offered language support and they will be involved in daily running of the volunteers' accommodation, which will help them to improve their managerial skills as well.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001565_3"], [2017, "Wildlife Rescue", "Wild Futures", 22970.0, 5, 5, "Context/background of the project\r\nCultural diversity: The \"Wildlife Rescue\" has been developed as a project that will enable interaction, activism, education and creativity, whilst allowing the volunteer's personal growth and increase her career opportunities in the future. A wildlife hospital is an unusual place with special needs and atmosphere run by mostly volunteers. We want to give not only local but also international volunteers with interests in wildlife rescue the possibility to get unique experiences. An international volunteer can have a different point of view in these matters, which can be refreshing for the local volunteers. Many of our staff and volunteers had in the past good contacts with international organizations and people abroad. This was one of the extra motivations to start with the project. Thus, wildlife hospital will be this project's working location in order to stimulate the resource to a working environment that not only contributes from the volunteer's own interests and knowledge but also allows her personal growth and realization as an active participant. We work with all kinds of different volunteers: students, older people, people with disabilities, EVS-volunteers from different countries, staffmembers, and even people with an alternative punishment. So they get to know all the different layers of people in our population, and so they will understand that our world is a place with a huge cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nGlobal environmental challenges: Due to the growing human population, the pressure on the environment is getting bigger and bigger. That means  that in our centre, the number of animals in need is getting higher and higher. By working in our centre, the EVS-volunteers will learn that the global impact of our population is too big, and that changes our needed. Our centre tries to help those animals that have become a victim of human expansion.\r\nDue to climate changes, we see a difference in the animals we get. Another problem is also the way people treat animals. We have a lot of problems with Seagulls in the centre of the city. Due to loss of their natural breeding territory, the gulls have moved to the city, and breed there. People don\u2019t like it, and try to take the eggs and young gulls away. This is a big problem, where our Rescue Centre is trying to find a solution for. With several campaigns, flyers and activities, we try to tell people why the gulls have moved, and what to do to avoid an overpopulation and problems in the city. Also EVS will deal with this problems, and can help to avoid problems.We try to learn our EVS about the environmental problems in Ostend and the complete country. So they do not only start knowing our culture, but also our vision on the environment and nature. \r\n\r\nInclusion of young people with fewer opportunities: One of the objectives of this project is to promote Inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities. In this project we will give the opportunity to 2 volunteers with fewer opportunities to volunteer in the Wildlife Rescue Centre.  Because of European Voluntary Service the 2 volunteers can do this volunteer project; without EVS there is no possibility of getting in contact with our culture and our centre.  Travelling is too expensive for the volunteers.  They come from a geographical disadvantaged area with a high unemployment rate where they don\u2019t get a lot of opportunities.\r\n\r\nSummary of the project: 3 long-term and 2 short-term volunteers in the EVS project \"Wildlife Rescue\" has resulted from the collaboration between the 4 different sending organizations and the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend (\"Opvangcentrum voor Vogels en Wilde Dieren Oostende\"). \r\nThe \"Wildlife Rescue\" has been developed as a project that will enable interaction, activism, education and creativity, whilst allowing the volunteer's personal growth and increase her career opportunities in the future.

At the same time they will fill out and complete their Youthpass, self-evaluating its parameters which will help them as a certificate of the non-formal training. We hope they will see this time as a rewarding experience apart of the benefits and advantages provided from Erasmus + Program.

People learn to know themselves and to recognize their differences.

For this project we have chosen to:\r\n\r\nActivity 1- SALLY LAMPRELL, a 24-year-old English woman.\r\n\r\nThe first direct impact that we hope is that it can meet its objectives and improve its skills at the linguistic level as well as at the level of non-regulated learning. At the same time, you can have completed your Youthpass tool and self-evaluated its parameters through the tutor's help with tutorials, interviews and meetings, to serve as a non-regulated learning certificate and can present at the end of the experience. In addition, Sally gains a rewarding experience of having been at MONA, and that together they have taken advantage of and valued the benefits of the Erasmus + Program. Multicultural experience, plus non-formal learning and goal setting should make the participants better people and can remember as gratifying the volunteer experience they can talk to and share with friends, family and perhaps potential volunteers.\r\nWe hope to produce an impact and dissemination of the Project and the Erasmus + Program to all the public that visit us weekly and to all the supporters of MONA who support us, showing the results and achievements. The means for the impact, diffusion and use of the Project will be through social networks, bulletins, magazines, radio, television, courses, talks and interviews.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES02-KA105-009543_1"], [2017, "Primate Volunteer", "Wild Futures", 6871.0, 4, 4, "Wild Futures project aims to encourage young people and people who possibly have economical barriers restricting their ability to participate in volunteer projects abroad, and empower them with professional skills in the animal welfare sector.\r\nTo do this we will employ seven main objectives; \r\n\r\n-To understand and know the current issues surrounding primates today, with special focus of the pet trade.\r\n- Help educate others on these issues ( general public, other volunteers etc)\r\n-Assist in the rehabilitation and daily care of these rescued monkeys in a captive environment\r\n-To give volunteers a choice to focus in specific area of the charity.\r\n- Learn to work with, and live alongside others, understanding and accepting different views, and beliefs\r\n- Integrate and socialise with people within the organisation and local community with an emphasis on personal development. \r\n- Refining and acquiring lifelong skills both professional and personal.\r\n\r\nParticipants selected must be physically fit and able due to the nature of the work and the environment it is conducted in.  A very good level of English is also required due to health and safety reason working with dangerous animals, but also required when educating the public. \r\n\r\n All EVS volunteers will prepare food for the monkeys, clean enclosure, conduct public education, generally help on site, work in the cafe and children's workshops. Additional activities are specific to their project area and included but not restricted to:\r\n     \r\nLong term placement in PR and Fundraising;\r\n                                                           \r\n-Assist with media coverage,\r\n-Compile adoption packs \r\n-Plan and create social media activities\r\n-Answer phone calls and admittance of visitors on the desk\r\n\r\nLong term placement as a General Volunteer: \r\n\r\n- Assist keepers with work in monkey enclosures\r\n-Aid administrative staff when office tasks need completing\r\n-Assist in the education and campaigns department when needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking methods will include outdoor and indoor activities, shadowing their supervisor is one learning technique which will be used in addition to demonstrations, presentation, self learning, group and independent work. We expect that all volunteers having left the project to have gained various skills which can be used in the animal welfare sector, when applying for more volunteering opportunities, internships, formal education or employment. Not only this, volunteers will have acquired or improved social skills adding diversity to their abilities. We foresee volunteers performing their civic duty by dispersing, teaching and education these new skills in their local communities. Ultimately our long term goal is to see a more positive change in attitudes towards nature and the natural environment with a particular focus on primates, through the voices and actions of young people.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", "Wild Futures", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036219_coordinator"]]}}}}
