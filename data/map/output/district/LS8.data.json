An inclusive and active school fills a need of a real integration, and gives the opportunity to meet current learners necessity .The only possibility to create a mixture of the future European citizens has to be pursued from early childhood in a shared and experiential way. Doing together!Our aim is to exchange and experience active and inclusive methods to understand and promote Life Skills in an inclusive context. The partnership involves 6 Countries (Iceland Italy Norway Poland Romania UK) sharing different experiences and skills with a common new school concept: experiential, dynamic and inclusive; 6 for a wider perspective to integrate the various school systems on a common rich multifaceted path. 5 Partners already have European experience, 1 is at its first. The choice of partners was guided, besides the obvious European vocation, by the desire to exchange, the tendency to innovation and the particular experience and excellence in, at least, one innovative and active method. Each country has a background and a specific expertise that lacks to the others in at least one important learning area. In so doing, every partner influences positively the group contributing to its general growth.We can observe, after a conscientious analysis of all strengths and weaknesses that the group has the potential to undertake a structured pathway aimed to:1)      Meet the need for professional growth, by making partner schools learn innovative methods to initiate pupils from 4 to 13, to the acquisition of all 8 Key Competences and Life skills, integrating them permanently in the school curricula effectively and functionally2)      Increase, among teachers, the habit of using informal methods aimed to facilitate the best level of inclusion for pupils in difficulty or disadvantage in order to affect the school welfare and on the sense of belonging positively, reducing at the same time early school leaving3)      Synthesize and promote new and past knowledge/experiences/skills/best methods...in a WEB PLATFORM\u201dTRACES OF EUROPE: ACTIVE METHODS FOR LEARNING\u201d that will enable other European teachers to understand why, with which methods, tools and activities bring their schools to active learning.

Once that connection is established, we are able to help the youth prepare for a sea of confronting situations and challenges they will encounter during their lives.\r\nYouth workers use a variety of different techniques in order to form connections with youth. Through games, youth workers are able to lay strong foundations of trust and openness with the youth with whom they work. We believe games not only provide a safe social environment for personal development, but also improve competencies  and fundamentals youth need to establish themselves well within a community. We believe that certain types of physical games have an educational value that is yet to be fully explored in our education systems. When it comes to the personal development of youth, games are more than a way of having fun, they are important to our organisations and are an extremely powerful learning tool especially when used in a social context.\r\n\r\nThe games exchange will provide a sharing platform for physical games and how they are used in youth work amongst circus schools and other organisations who promote non-formal learning and art education. \r\nIt will take place from 03/05/2015 - 07/05/2015 and will be hosted by Cirkus In Beweging in Leuven, Belgium.\r\nOriginally stemming from a spontaneous games exchange workshop during the NICE (Network for International Circus Exchange) meeting in Denmark in 2013, the International Circus Games Exchange had instant partners and support through youth circus schools and other organisations across Europe.\r\nIn this project we will bring together a strong knowledge base from different countries, cultures and organisations.\r\nThe project will be focussed on the exchange of this knowledge between partner organisations and the individuals representing them. \r\nWe will investigate the different kinds of games used by our organisations and for what purposes.  Time will be spent on different categories of games such as Ice-Breakers, physical warm-up games, group connection games, energising and de-energising games, team building games, cooperation games, character based games, building games, creative thinking games, social inclusion games, improvisation games and others.\r\nThere will be a specific focus on learning new games from other organisations and cultures as well as offering variations on games that are already known. With the expertise of the partners and the participants representing them, time will also be spent on improving and customising games to cater for specific purposes.\r\nCirkus In Beweging will be partnered by Youth Circus Schools and other organisations throughout Europe who promote non-formal learning. Each organisation will send two or three \"Games Experts\" who have a strong knowledge of games used in their organisations. This expertise will be shared with and transferred to the other participants through explanation and physical demonstration in an open sharing space setting, this means that everyone will be free to give feedback, to propose variations and also have the opportunity to help customise the games to suit other purposes.\r\n\r\nEach participant will return to their organisation with a larger and stronger knowledge and database of games. They will have a greater knowledge and awareness of different types of games and also variations on games they already know.  Participants will have been exposed to the purposes for which other organisations and participants use games. The individuals will have had the experience of being a key role in developing and customising games to suit a specific purpose/need and will now be more adept in doing so in the future. The participants will return with a better awareness of games played in other countries and in other cultures.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the project is to share knowledge on a European, international and intercultural level. \r\nThe project will help strengthen bonds between partnering organisations and countries and help to form long lasting partnerships between partner organisations.

Implementation of the latest EU legislation, namely Article 12 \u201cEqual recognition before the law\u201d of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has been slow and patchy. This project contributes to enhancing the implementation of Article 12 which requires a coordinated and transnational intervention. It uses an innovative form of adult education as a tool of change.Awareness-raising strategies about the right to full legal capacity must be improved:- Strategies should include crucial target groups able to contribute to shifting the paradigm: professionals from support services, public administrators, educators and people with disabilities and their families.- Strategies should be consulted with advocacy organizations of persons with learning disabilities and mental health problems. It is important to actively involve people with personal experience of using supported decision-making.- Training materials, statements and other documents should be shin \u201ceasy read\u201d format to allow people with learning difficulties to access information.- Examples of good practice on supported decision-making should be published on the EU level and with consultation with advocacy organizations of persons with disabilities.Mentioned problems relates to poor awareness-raising and access of people with disabilities to capacity-building and training. This project aims to improve awareness-raising and capacity-building and education by:1) Preparing a written material on the right to full legal capacity and the right to support (assistance) in decision-making for people with learning disabilities and mental health problems which will improve awareness about Article 122) Preparing a written material on how to support a person in decision making which will improve awareness about good practice on supported decision-making3) Preparing an inclusive training on supported decision-making for professionals, public administrators, people with learning disabilities and mental health problems.The project \u201cIDEA 12\u201d is innovative in two ways: It aims to improve inclusiveness of education through involving trainers with first-hand experience of using decision-making support in co-working model with other one experienced lecturer. The target audience of the training will also be composed of participants with different needs and abilities (people with disabilities, support services, university students and lecturers). Secondly, the project aims to create the first basic training to be standardized and accessible across the EU.The project aims to achieve the following results:1) Position paper will include the most important statements regarding inclusive training and raising awareness about Article 12 CRPD and about supported decision-making. It will serve as a reference document for preparing inclusive training and for the final multiplier event.2) Best practice in supported decision-making will summarize examples of best practice in supported decision-making. It will serve as a resource for lecturers delivering national inclusive trainings.3) Handbook on delivering inclusive training on supported decision-making will support trainers in preparing and delivering inclusive trainings on Article 12 CRPD and on supported decision-making. 4) An international group of 30 lecturers who will be able to prepare and deliver inclusive trainings on supported decision making on the national level. Trainers will be people with and without disabilities who will deliver training in co-working model.5) A set of national inclusive dissemination events for people with disabilities, their families and professional supporters, university students in social work, education and law, public administrators, policy makers and general public.6) EU Multiplier Event in Madrid.7) Project website: All project outputs will be published on the project website.The main impact of the project is in encouraging people to think and work differently and more inclusively.
