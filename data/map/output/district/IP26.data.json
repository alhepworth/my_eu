Redox active natural products, enzymes and their mimics may therefore be considered as regulators of various cellular processes which may, for instance, control inflammatory processes, cancer formation and proliferation, but also bacterial, fungal and microbial growth. It is now apparent that redox control exerted by such natural and synthetic products may be used for prevention and therapy in Medicine and for the development of \u2018green\u2019 pesticides in Agriculture.  This training network will study chemical, biochemical and biological aspects of the modulation of cellular redox balances by selected natural agents and their mimics. It relies on expertise of 10 full and 7 associated partners (1 SME) in a range of scientific disciplines, including synthetic, analytical, biological and pharmaceutical chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, cancer research and agricultural research. The network will address 4 36-month work packages (WP): A WP on natural antioxidants, inflammation and cancer; a WP studying intracellular redox control and signalling events triggered by external redox agents; a WP on green antibiotics and pesticides from plants and fungi; a WP on redox catalysts as agents selective against cancer and inflammatory cells.  The network will provide interdisciplinary training for 4 experienced and 10 early stage researchers, all of which will acquire expertise in 3 or more of scientific disciplines. Each researcher will develop a training portfolio when joining the network. All early stage researchers are expected to obtain international recognised PhD degrees. In addition to intensive scientific training at various host institutes, there will be a framework programme offering training in science related matters and soft skills, such as logical and ethical aspects of research, IP, patenting and commercialisation, communication skills and cultural and gender issues.", 308792.0, 2398043.0, 5, 10, "RED CAT", null, "http://www.ecospray.com", null, "fp7_88951_998940533"]]}}, "5JQ": {"life": {"data": [[1992, "The management and protection of the Breckland", "Norfolk Naturalists Trust", 608919.0, 243568.0, "Consisting of 7 000 ha of poor, acidic sandy soil on top of chalk, the Breckland of East Anglia, has long been recognised as an area of high nature conservation value. It contains a priority habitat type (pseudo-steppe grass heath) under the Habitats Directive, only occurring in three other areas in the EU.  Its significance lies in the close association of wetlands, heather and grass heaths which flourish in semi-continental conditions unique to Britain. There is a mixture of rare steppe, Mediterranean and coastal species (including nine species listed in the annexes of the Birds Directive). Although traditionally these habitats formed part of an integrated system of land use, these practices have since given way to more permanent intensive agricultural practices. This, together with the more recent threats from conifer plantations, reduction in river flows and aquifer levels resulting from boreholes, as well as urban spread and uncontrolled tourism, has led to loss of habitats and to their fragmentation.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=202", null, "life_322"]]}}}}
