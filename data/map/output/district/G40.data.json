This Erasmus+ project will focus on providing European mobility experiences for our young apprentices in the Under-20 squad of players who will travel to Austria in July 2014 and our Under-18 squad who will travel to Spain in January 2015. Both groups of mobility participants are at a pivotal stage in their career pathways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the Austrian and Spanish host partners are regional training and coaching complexes used, respectively, by top Austrian professional clubs (FC Red Bull Salzburg, SK Rapid Wien, FK Austria Wien and SK Sturm Graz) and Spanish clubs (Levante FC, Valencia FC).  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the differing restrictions imposed by the varying scholastic commitments of the players as they progress through their Modern Apprenticeship programme, plus their commitment to competitive match fixtures it was agreed by all of the partners that that a two week mobility period would provide maximum benefit from a European experience, while imposing minimum disruption to academic and vocational training courses. Mobility will be preceded by a structured preparatory phase and a two week duration will facilitate optimal absorption of the vocational training and skills development at the host institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Austrian host partners are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the first team ranks are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers for those not fortunate enough to make the grade. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Spanish and Austrian partners are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. Celtic FC have recently completed successful mobility trips to Portugal and Turkey and these experiences have formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people in Glasgow are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people in the region where many have poor records of academic achievement and are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 0.75% of persons under the age of 21 in Glasgow will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this regional shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCeltic FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators  and vacationing Celtic supporters will be actively encouraged.", "http://www.celticfc.net", "Celtic Plc", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000458_coordinator"]]}}, "4AR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Raising attainment using SOLE in mathematics for 11-12 year old learners", "Sacred Heart Primary", 139730.0, 3, 19, "This project addresses the development of key competences in pupils and teachers in the teaching and learning of mathematics for pupils aged 11-12 years in Glasgow, Warsaw and Valencia in order primarily to raise attainment. This approach of innovative learning of mathematics is a development of the ideas and beliefs of Professor Sugata Mitra of Newcastle University. Sugata Mitra showed by experiment in India that if motivated and suitably led pupils will in effect teach themselves. His 2013 TED talk showed his success and won first prize. During the 2015 British Council eTwinning Conference Sugata Mitra explained his ideas and beliefs by Video Conference and this Project results for that Video Conference. \r\n\r\nSixteen schools will take part in the Project, five in Glasgow, six in Valencia and five in Warsaw. Over the three years of the Project 486 Activities will take place in all 30 classrooms directly effecting over 3000 pupils. Glasgow will lead the Project.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Activities of the Project is to work in groups to answer a \"big question\" derived from the maths curriculum being taught. The teacher does not teach but helps the pupils with their SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment)    \r\nThe key competencies addressed by this Project include: teamwork, responsibility, commitment, motivation, decision making, communication, leadership, digital skills. \r\nThey will have to communicate and present their findings using digital technology to pupils in other countries.\r\nThe Project is entrepreneurial and develops self confidence and belief. \r\nThe acquisition of the above skills will make the participating pupils more employable, increasing their ability to make a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nThe \"big questions\" used in the activities of the Project will address  the mathematics curriculum requirements and specific Learning Outcomes. In this way the teacher will be able to measure the true impact and effectiveness of the Activities on  attainment during the evaluation process.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that the teaching of mathematics is still very traditional in the three cities of this Project.  The common practice is for teachers to stand at the front of the class and teach, then for the pupils to work. The pupils are fed knowledge and understanding and are then asked to use it. This project involves the pupils finding it out by and for themselves by employing critical thinking and using social skills. This innovative method of teaching mathematics can be considered open and in this digital age is dependent for its success on pupils fully using the internet to acquire knowledge and understanding and using social media to communicate and disseminate findings and conclusions.", "http://www.sacredheart-pri.glasgow.sch.uk", "Glasgow City Council Education Services", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036777_8"]]}}, "4DD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Young People Taking the Lead", "Possibilities for Each and Every Kid", 12035.0, 3, 3, "The youth exchange 'Young People Taking the Lead' is a project with young people aged 15-18 from three different countries; the UK, Belgium and Finland.

'Young People Taking the Lead' is the second stage of the journey, where young people will use their experiences of being a volunteer to explore how they learn, how they take the lead and how they implement their own activities in the future. Since the first exchange looked at why young people volunteer and the skills needed to volunteer, this follow up youth exchange will look at developing leadership skills and initiative, so that young people can begin to \r\ndevelop their own volunteering initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will take place from Monday 3rd August to Tuesday the 11th and will involve some days staying in Glasgow, where young people will volunteer with children and young people, supporting PEEK's summer play and youth programmes. This will also coincide with National Play Day, which volunteers will support. During this, young people will facilitate and deliver games at a specialised 'International Corner.' Other sessions include a session around international volunteering and the possibilities of IVS and EVS. This will be interspersed days with inter-cultural activities like a trip to Scotland's capital city Edinburgh as well as a subway dash around Glasgow. The group work sessions will focus around the theme of 'Young People Taking the Lead' and these will take place in a rural setting, where it is hoped that young people will stay for a few days.  This will give young people an opportunity to explore and learn about both urban and rural landscapes in Scotland.

All three organisations work with young volunteers under the age of 18 and it therefore seemed natural to plan a youth exchange where young people could use their experiences of volunteering to explore intercultural learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNine participants from each country (27 in total) will take part in the exchange that will take place in Belgium in August 2014. The exchange will be made up of peer-led facilitation, volunteering in the field and intercultural activities (chosen by the young people). A great deal of preparatory work will be done by the young people prior to the exchange in Belgium. Each group will plan two sessions that they will deliver during the exchange. One around the theme of volunteering and another around the theme of intercultural learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exchange will be an opportunity for young people to skill-share, to improve their communication and team working skills, to develop their facilitation skills, to broaden their horizon and to promote both local and international volunteerism.
