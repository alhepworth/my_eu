In this way, new innovations will be developed and it will accelerate the time to market.\nIn a competitive global water market, pre-commercial testing is difficult and costly at operational scale and investors are reluctant to invest in unproven technology. This way it can take 15-20 years to bring new technology to the market. To increase market opportunities in this fast growing sector, WTN will help SMEs from across NWE to test their innovative water technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5-8. This will be achieved by creating a transnational network of operational scale demonstrator sites in UK, FR, DE, NL and BE, which will offer a range of water types,\u00a0clean and waste water, in rural and urban settings, for specialist applications such as pharma or agricultural.\u00a0By working closely with SMEs, offering them an integrated package of support and linking them to the best possible site for their needs, validation and commercialisation of near to market water solutions will be accelerated, providing an investor ready pipeline of new products and processes.\nThe change the project will deliver is to accelerate the time to market, increase the proportion of products reaching the market, and supporting innovative technologies through the complex processes of verification and validation, which create particular pressures in the water sector. At least 120 SMEs will be supported by testing 90 new technologies, of which 30 will be brought to the market by the SMEs. In the long term, the network will remain in place after the project lifetime. A business model will be developed to continue collaboration between partners and provide access to the network of test facilities for SMEs on a paid-for basis after the project.", 1514764800000, 1640908800000, 443286.0, "nweurope_32_2"]]}}, "3BF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Etre europ\u00e9en, la solution de demain", "euroscot", 32838.0, 4, 4, "Our many years of work experiences abroad with Erasmus+ has reinforced the importance of developing a European dimension to our projects, to improve the quality of our educational offerings towards unmotivated, struggling, and sometimes dropout students. These projects contribute to a collective reflection within our disciplinary teams, reflection which is based on the spreading of knowledge, the European and citizen dimension, and equal opportunity for men and women. These different themes will be developed in the new school project, which is currently being drafted.\r\n\r\nThese work experiences abroad are sources of personal enrichment, which contribute to an openness towards others and a renewed motivation for the various participants. Our analysis allowed us to conclude that it was necessary to arouse the desire to study abroad early on for our students to succeed. By offering this European dimension to our students in secondary school, we offer them a solution for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe 25 participants in the project are committed to a short-term professional track. All of them are currently preparing a BTEC National in Sales, Commerce, and Fashion, they will soon be on the job market, both in France and in the European Union. Testimonies from former participants to the future candidates of the work experience abroad program give undeniable insights into our projects. The hiring of some candidates in their previous places of internship is proof of its efficacy.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation of this project, we work together as a team throughout the school year. \r\nThe different steps leading to the realization of the project are planned from September to June:\r\n- meetings of the teaching and management teams to validate the project selection criteria.\r\n- meetings with the various actors (parents, students, teaching and management teams) to present the terms and conditions of the stay.\r\n- preparatory work done by students under the teachers'guidance.\r\n- first contacts with our partner organizations are established, to ensure the places of work are in line with the training objectives of the participants.\r\n- the logistics are verified, to ensure a trip in the best possible conditions.\r\n- the presence of teachers on-site and numerous established contacts with partner organizations guarantee a close management to meet the needs of the participants.\r\n\r\nTo meet the objectives of specific and measurable training, we work on several axes:\r\n - Learning Axis: this period of training in an E.U. company will allow them to obtain a \"European section\" distinction/honor, in accordance with the objectives set by the diploma.\r\n- Professional Axis: this European distinction/honor facilitates professional integration. In fact, companies are increasingly demanding personnel with experience abroad and who are capable of responding to occupational mobility.\r\n- Cultural and Human Axis: the simple fact of accepting to leave and to integrate (both professionally and relationally,) is proof of an openness necessary for young people destined to live and work in Europe.

As a result, primary schools in Scotland need to start building capacity for the teaching of two languages in addition to English. Our Local Education Authority (Angus Council) is currently developing a roll out strategy for the introduction of French in Primary 1 and funding the training of staff in teaching Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are to: build on existing materials and ideas suitable for teaching French language at primary level; begin to gather materials and ideas suitable for teaching Spanish; improve methodological expertise in the teaching of French/Spanish to young learners; develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Europe; raise pupil, parental and staff awareness of French/Spanish culture; keep French/Spanish teaching and learning at Grange Primary School current and fresh.\r\n\r\nTwo staff members from our school have been selected for the project as they  have existing modern languages competency and teaching experience. By taking part in this project, one staff member will gain greater confidence and practice speaking French, refresh and build on her current teaching skills and methodologies and will therefore be able to implement French from the beginning of Primary School onwards. The other member of staff  will improve confidence and competency in speaking Spanish, identify and develop resources and strategies for teaching Spanish and build contacts through which to increase cultural awareness and learning for pupils. She will therefor be able to plan, organise and implement the teaching of Spanish across our two Primary 6 and two Primary 7 classes.\r\n\r\nThe project will begin with the immersion course and on returning, the members of staff will work with the school management team and the Local Authority to identify the priorities for rolling out the project and to write an action plan. Likely key points on this plan will be : presentations to staff/ parents; identification and organisation of resources; writing a whole school modern language policy and programme; identification of any further staff development or resource needs. On return, staff will use the knowledge and skills gained to immediately set up a French and a Spanish club which pupils can attend during discretionary time. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this project, we hope to see the following results:\r\n\u2022 enhanced confidence and ability to teach French/Spanish\r\n\u2022 up to date cultural awareness in pupils\r\n\u2022 improved teaching methodology and resources for languages \r\n\u2022 French and Spanish delivered widely across the whole school\r\n\u2022 French /Spanish integrated into the daily life of classes and the school environment\r\n\u2022 French and Spanish club where pupils can extend their cultural awareness and language skills of each country\r\n\u2022 sharing of  learning with fellow teachers within the school, cluster and local authority\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we aim to create a school where pupils have confidence in their ability to communicate in other languages, are aware of different cultures within Europe and are supported in building connections with their European peers.", "http://www.angus.gov.uk", "Grange Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002189_coordinator"]]}}}}
