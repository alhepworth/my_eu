We have 334 pupils on role, aged between 3 and 11.\r\n\r\nFollowing a significant change of staff, the new foreign languages subject coordinator conducted a staff and pupil audit to assess the status of French; she found that:\r\n\r\n- school leaders and teachers value the importance of language learning\r\n- pupils enjoy their French lessons\r\n- pupils have made good progress in the 2 years since the introduction of the new curriculum\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n- all staff feel they need to increase their personal French skills to ensure pupils continue to progress\r\n- the newer members of staff in particular lack confidence in their ability to teach French \r\n- French sometimes slips from the timetable in the term when the consultant is not in support\r\n- most staff lack first-hand experience of French culture \r\n- pupils want to learn about and communicate with children in France\r\n\r\nTo address these issues we are launching a 2 year Erasmus+ staff mobility project to give 6 teachers and teaching assistants the opportunity to take part in a programme of immersion courses. We expect this to:\r\n\r\n-  develop teachers personal knowledge and proficiency of French language, cultures, traditions and heritage \r\n-  train teachers relatively new to teaching to become more proficient in the teaching of French \r\n-  broaden experiences of cultures and beliefs of the children \r\n-  offer opportunities to the disadvantaged children to increase their life experiences \r\n-  ensure that the children become proficient in the French language including reading, writing, speaking and listening \r\n-  establish an effective relationship with a partner French primary school \r\n\r\nThe impact we expect is:\r\n- Participants will have higher levels of competence and confidence and greater cultural understanding \r\n- Participants will have enhanced their professional profile\r\n- The subject coordinator will have developed project management skills and extended her subject leadership skills\r\n- This will provide better learning experiences for the pupils \r\n- Pupils will be corresponding with French children\r\n- The school will have an enhanced European dimension \r\n- there will be a bank of authentic cross-curricular resources\r\n\r\nOur project results will be disseminated within our school community and beyond to other local schools and shared at national conferences.", "http://www.stthomasmorerc.co.uk", "St Thomas More Roman Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036342_coordinator"], [2014, "French Language and Methodology at St. Thomas More School", "St Thomas More Roman Catholic Primary School", 1861.0, 1, 1, "Our school is currently preparing for the integration of Modern Foreign languages as a compulsory curriculum subject at Key Stage 2 from September 2014. In light of this, we aim to develop the languages skills of our staff, consider ways of improving language teaching to increase enjoyment and progress, and to raise the profile of languages across the school as a whole. \r\n\r\nOur school has set up a project committee in order to select a participant to go to France, and to oversee the project from the initial application stages, to implementing new skills and methods, to evaluating the impact of the project on our school. We have  selected one participant to take part in a one year project including a course in France, with the view to develop language skills and to provide some follow up methodology training. The participant will also reconnect with a teacher from a link school in France to establish a Pen Pals project which will involve children from our Key Stage Two department.\r\n\r\nWe are liaising closely with a course provider, who is overseeing many practical arrangements such as flights, accommodation, and the course itself. A representative from the provider will act as a mentor throughout the course in France, and will provide a support network to ensure the project's success on return. \r\n\r\nWhile in France the participant will take part in a language and methodology course aimed at improving French language skills, and equipping our participant with a variety of teaching methods and strategies to implement on return to school. The participant is currently in the process of arranging a time to meet up with the link teacher from a primary school in Toulouse so that part of the project will involve re-establishing a Pen Pals project.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate this project will have an impact upon the enthusiasm of our staff with regard to teaching French and incorporating it into school routines. We also expect to see the quality of French teaching improve, and therefore to see a rise in the progress that our children make. We aim to use the project as a way of up-skilling the language skills of our staff. \r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefits of the project are that we maintain a link with a French primary school for many years to come, and this could eventually lead into school trips and visits to meet the children and find out about the place they live in. \r\n\r\nWe feel that engaging children in language learning can bring about positive effects in other curriculum areas such as literacy, therefore we could expect to see an eventual impact on the school's literacy results.", "http://www.stthomasmorerc.co.uk", "St Thomas More Roman Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000144_coordinator"]]}}, "1XX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1204329600000, 1330473600000, "20-20 3D Media: Spatial Sound and  Vision", "Digital Projection Limited", "Film or cinema has been the driving force for the entertainment industry, setting the standards of quality, providing the most compelling experience, and feeding the distribution chains of other media (broadcast TV, cable and satellite channels, DVD, video, games et cetera).

The context of this project relates to our school, Cardinal Langley RC High School, being in a relatively deprived area of North Manchester with a large proportion of disadvantaged students with low aspirations. The study of languages in UK schools is becoming more and more important in our global economy and in order to offer our students the best possible opportunities for a future in the global market, it is vital that we have staff with expertise and competences in a European context. We wish for all of our languages teaching staff to feel confident in delivering all language options at all levels, so that the provision of languages within our curriculum is enhanced. Our objective is to provide one new member of staff with the skills and knowledge to teach Spanish beyond KS3. This member of staff currently teaches French up to KS5 and has demonstrated a commitment and enthusiasm to developing language competencies and sharing best practice. The activities which will take place during the project are part of a full-week immersion course. The course encourages the use of a creative teaching approach and includes specific sessions on integrating ICT in language teaching. It also includes sessions to develop partnership work with teachers from within Europe, as well as other activities available under the Erasmus+ Programme. During the week attendees will be encouraged to reflect on and develop their planning skills and will be tasked with working together to develop their own teaching resources. These will be shared within the group and uploaded to a public website so that teachers within the wider educational community can use them. This work forms an integral part of the dissemination activities attendees will undertake on their return home. Throughout the week and consistent with a full immersion\r\napproach, a variety of teaching and learning sessions will be delivered with specific teaching and learning aims. These include language and methodology-specific classes, cultural sessions and cultural visits with examples of activities to use with pupils, a visit to a school for observation of practice and an opportunity to make links for future partnership work. The project will support the professional development of our member of staff, and impact on their confidence and knowledge of current and up-to-date language, culture, and teaching methods. These new skills will have an impact on our learners and our school. For example the visits to educational establishments abroad will provide opportunities for networking and establishing links, which may give us the opportunity to set up future exchanges and projects helping to develop a more European dimension to our school. There will also be an expected impact on curriculum content, particularly in the languages department. We will have a more engaged member of staff who will share the experience with a maximum number of staff and students. The longer term benefits will be that our students will broaden their horizons and develop a global awareness and an ability to participate in a European market.", "http://www.clrchs.co.uk", "Cardinal Langley RC High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036424_coordinator"]]}}}}
