First and foremost we intend to have a comparison with German institutions and structures to find out what can be done to improve the \u201cenhanced sense of belonging\u201d and how to include all people with disabilities. The trainees will learn about dignity, they will be taking part in the social  and self-determined  life of the people with disabilities at WOSP (UK), Losserhof (NL), Caritas Vorarlberg (Austria) and Elisabeth-St. Joseph (Luxembourg). They will extend their range of competences, which are necessary for their future job.

Most schools and colleges have access to web 2.0 learning platforms, but only a minority of teachers use anywhere near  their full potential for  interactive, student-centred teaching and learning  across the curriculum. This project aims to enhance the capacity of non-specialist ICT teachers to do this by identifying and providing the training and support they need to engage and develop students\u2019 pre-existing digital skills in support of their personal and social growth, their vocational education, and their lifelong employability. \r\n\r\nThe project is focused upon a collaborative program of action research undertaken by five providers of 14-19 vocational education in five European countries. It is directed towards a better understanding of what works, where, and why in providing the training and support needed by teachers, school leaders and other educational professionals to meet the aims outlined above.

This not only encourages the personal development of the learners, but also improves their employment opportunities on the (European) labor market, which counteracts the unemployment of many young people. This allows the Elisabeth-Selbert School to support the professional development of young people and to promote the quality of teaching, training and learning.\r\nIn the framework of this project the participants will recognize and evaluate the differences in vocational education and training systems, provide practical skills and supplement them, and initiate sensitization to other cultures, flexibility and self-employment. The work in other training enterprises or social institutions creates the possibility for participants to get to know new and / or other working methods, which they can apply and pass on afterwards. This underpins the workspace of the participants, makes the participants safer and more open to new trends and methods. In particular, catering professionals require local flexibility so that the first steps in the project are crucial for their future professional career.\r\nThe self-understanding of dealing with foreign people, with foreign cultures, which is expected in the services of gastronomy and personal care, can only be promoted by an internship abroad. In the TN of the Healing Disability / Personal Assistance and Care Assistance, an important role is played by the fact that elderly disabled people hardly exist and thus new experiences with these target groups can be mediated.\r\nCompleting or practicing an internship strengthens self-esteem and gives the participants their own personality. In the home country itself, the knowledge and experience gained and the critical examination of different training procedures are passed on. The intercultural aspect will be the focus of the pupils of the Fachschule Sozialp\u00e4dagogik, which is very personal. The language of the host country does not understand and does not speak makes sensitive to the emotional condition of people with similar background. With regard to the parents' work in children's day-care centers with families with an immigration background and the educational work with the children, this understanding creates a cultural openness which can only be positively expressed in the corresponding implementation of pedagogical measures, A contact with children with gestures and facial expressions, with pantomimic signs, creates a sensitivity for observations of behaviors of other people, which can only be experienced in such situations and often can not be mediated in this intensity. This experience creates a great empathy for the participants in the field of social pedagogy in professional fields, where people are very linguistically limited and other ways of communication have to be found.\r\nIn some areas of this project the foreign language skills of the participants can be improved.\r\nThe criteria of the quality assurance of learning abroad abroad will in future be the orientation to learning outcomes and the understanding of the partner institutions (Memorandum of Understanding). This enables us to ensure the recognition of the acquired learning outcomes and competences. This requires that all stakeholders - including the learners - have a concrete idea of \u200b\u200bwhat is learned and how this is to be recorded. Documented in Europass mobility, these learning results can then be validated and calculated in the home country.\r\nThe use of the standardized ECVET instruments (Memorandum of Understandanding / Learning Standards / Europass) facilitates the implementation of quality-assured mobility.\r\nThe desire to expand the circle of participants by already educated educators of the district of Hameln-Pyrmont on the Erasmus exchange to Trontheim, Norway, organized by the ESS for years, lies in the widening of the viewpoints by other concepts of the PISA winners with regard to early childhood education and support systems.", "http://www.kendal.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003853_12"], [2015, "Auslandspraktikum f\u00fcr Sch\u00fclerinnen und Sch\u00fcler der Berufsbildenden Schulen", "Kendal college", 58334.0, 12, 13, "The primary aim of the placements abroad is to give 62 participants the possibility of acquiring different competences concerning knowledge, skills and attitudes. In this way, not only the personal development of the learners is promoted but also the possibility of getting a job on the (European) labour market. Additionally, it counteracts prospective youth unemployment. Therefore, the Elisabeth-Selbert-Schule can support the professional development of  the students and promote the quality of the apprenticeship and the further education. \r\nWithin the scope of this project the participants should be able to recognize the differences of the vocational systems and evaluate them. Moreover, practical skills are provided, a sensitisation for other cultures is initiated and flexibility and independent working are ensured. \r\nThrough the work in other vocational- or social facilities the participants are able to learn new methods and gain experience, which can be applied in their own working environment and it can be passed on to other learners. In this way the learners\u2019 competences are promoted and the curiosity towards new trends is aroused. Especially jobs in the catering trade require local flexibility. Therefore, the first steps within the programme are decisive for the further process.   \r\nFurthermore, a placement abroad supports the natural handling with other people and foreign cultures. These are factors that play a great role in the service sector and also in jobs that deal with people, who have special needs. This target group is particular important because they are a minority of whom the learners can profit a lot. After successfully completing the stay abroad the sense of self-esteem and the personality of the learners are strengthened.   \r\nBack in their home country the learners pass on their newly learned knowledge and experience along with a detailed evaluation of the vocational system. \r\nThe intercultural aspects play a substantial role for the nursery nurse trainees, because they are visiting countries without speaking the native language. Therefore, the students have to be more sensitive towards requirements and the behaviour of people of the target culture. Cultural openness and curiosity are essential, especially regarding the work with parents of children who have a migratory background. But also getting into contact with children by using the body language enables the learners to lay special focus on gestures, mimic and the overall behaviour. This is usually not possible in the dense school curriculum of the learners. Everyone included in the exchange can only profit from such cultural diversity. The acquired experience of the nursery nurse trainees can be applied to different working fields during the training course. E.g. the learners are able to find different ways of communicating. This can be helpful if the communication of a child is restricted in some way. \r\nForeign language learning should be an additional goal in the different branches of the work experience. Standardized learning results and the specific understanding between the partner institutions are the criteria for a quality-assured assessment. This makes the acknowledgement of the acquired knowledge and competences possible. \r\nFor this it is necessary that every person involved, including the participating learners, have to have a clear understanding of what has to be learned and how this is documented within the scope of the Europass.
