In 2009, I applied for the first time to the European Agency for funding which was accepted. With this support, the European section of my school went to England in March 2010. This is now our sixth grant application which enables our school to organise students' mobility to Chesterfield (GB) and (for the first time) to Salamanca (Spain). The students involved are preparing a BTEC in trade science and administrative management.\r\nTo carry out the task and my European project, I\u2019ve set up since September 2009 a working group in our vocational school consisting of English teachers and more recently of Spanish teachers, interested in taking part in our European section. We have renewed this year the organisation of a 12 months programme in order that our 10 students of English European section can go to England and 8 of our Spanish section can go to Spain in March/April 2015. They will undertake a 4 week internship in the workplace.\r\nOur 18 students will participate in English and Spanish online training organised by The European agency. They will also attend\r\na few hours of language training on site financed with own funds in order to enjoy sharing in sports and cultural activities with other young people . Teachers will be there every step of the way to help and guide them if needed and they will look after them on-site on a rotating schedule for the whole month. I will be helping French students with the Spanish intermediary partner in Spain, Mr. Gonzalo Hierro in Spain at the beginning of the stay and at the end for the final evaluation in workplaces.\r\n \r\nOn our last visit to Great Britain, we have set objectives and  negotiated  training targets with our partners in England and with our intermediary partner in Spain \u201cTellus Group\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe project has 3 facets :\r\n\r\n - a pedagogical facet at the beginning during preparation of work placement and during language training online and on site in order to help students in their future internship and then, at the end to help them in writing what they\u2019ve done and learned.\r\n\r\n- a Professional facet  when young people are on work placements in England and Spain. A part of the professional skills has been negotiated with tutors in 2013 in Great Britain and in March 2014 during the preliminary visit in Spain. The skills will be subject to revision with partners at the beginning of the training period in line with students\u2019 language level if necessary. In that way, students should have a better and more meaningfull experience.\r\n\r\n- a cultural and transversal facet which is part of a promising project ERASMUS PLUS. This facet is necessary because it\u2019s directly linked to our school\u2019s activities in the European section when our students perform well in international tests as BTEC with European option and EUROPRO and EUROPASS; It\u2019s a perfect match with the economic sector needs in our region around our town Oyonnax which looks for autonomous and professional  young people who speak foreign languages in order to compete internationally .", "http://www.valleycids.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000796_4"]]}}, "2DT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1383264000000, 1493510400000, "High value-added chemicals and BIoreSIns from alGae biorefineries produced from CO2 provided by industrial emissions", "Sun Chemical Limited", "BISIGODOS aims to address the production of valuable algae derived chemicals, amino acids and high added-value bio-resins for coatings, printing, food and hair care and adhesives applications, starting from algae biomass fed directly with CO2 from industrial emissions (cement, steel factory, thermal power plants, etc.) as a raw material that is cost-effective and renewable. The process is assisted by solar radiation, nutrients and sea water microalgae. This approach is based on the technology developed by the Partner Biofuel Systems (BFS) to produce bio-oil. In order to develop such technology, several innovative approaches are proposed:\n- New algae strains production optimization and CO2 energetic balance improvement.\n-Optimization of photo-bioreactors\n- Study and adaptation of separation of algae components based on hybrid technologies.\n- Production of algae derived chemicals for surfactants applications and amino acids for food applications\n- Production of bio-based resins from algae based fatty acids and bio-oil aromatic moieties.\nSimilar studies have been carried out at laboratory level to obtain a broad range of algae derived chemicals, however BISIGODOS\u2019 project aims to work at semi-industrial scale using the BFS industrial photo-bioreactors facilities.

The import of large volumes of low cost jewellery puts the margins under pressure.

This attitude hinders changes and innovation, though current production methods have rejection rates up to 20 or even 30% and up to 25% of job places could be lost in the sector over the next five years. Aim of this project is to introduce a new approach into jewellery design and production, through the development of a simulation tool on broad basis, the exploitation of the full potential of existing Rapid-Prototyping Technology and the use of Design of Experiment.

With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements.

Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.
