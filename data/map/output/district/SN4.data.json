The ethos of the school is \"we all grow from here\" and we believe that in the modern world it is important that we are preparing our children to be able to communicate to others from different countries.  Recently we achieved the International Schools Award,  a testament to our hard work, however we have recognised that the capacity to teach a modern foreign language in our school is currently on a precarious model. We would therefore like to address this issue and have identified an intensive language / immersion course as the solution - empowering our staff to deliver quality first French lessons at Wanborough Primary School across all classes.Over the next two years we would like our staff to complete a language immersion course to enable French to flourish across the curriculum.  We intend to raise standards of teaching and learning through improving teachers' knowledge, confidence and resources.  Secondly, we want to increase the opportunities to make French come alive in other curriculum areas - our school works to a creative curriculum and the scope for embedding French is huge, allowing the school timetable to be more flexible, which in turn will help the school financially as well as pupils and staff benefiting socially, spiritually and academically.We currently have two fantastic links with schools in France.  Children and staff from each school communicate regularly and our children stayed in France last year and are doing so again in 2016.  Whilst on these visits the staff and children work, communicate and socialise together, however again we are solely reliant on one member of staff being able to communicate in French.  With all staff confident to communicate, we believe the opportunities for collaboration and for schools to work together at a more strategic level are increased.  Consequently eight places for tuition are requested, as it is imperative that a member of the SLT improves their ability to speak and understand French.The activity we have chosen is a popular language immersion course from a reputable company  LFEE ( found through the EU Gateway).  The week long intensive tuition will provide a unique opportunity for staff to acquire and apply language, which on their return will be able to disseminate to a number of audiences including other staff, children, parents and governors.  By investing in our staff through providing highly effective CPD combined with a super cultural experience we anticipate that the impact will not only be high back in the classroom but also for individual staff morale and personal self -esteem.To ensure impact we have incorporated this project into our School Improvement Plan which directly links in with individual teachers' performance management.  Also, our European Development Plan, led by our International Co-ordinator has this target of (cultural development) as a key priority to achieve.  Finally, the MFL leader action planning has identified language acquisition as a key lever in improving outcomes.   We are therefore as an organisation committed to deliver on this project, with clear targets and accountability for staff at all levels.  We envisage that our children will be taught more effectively, with achievement measured through our internal assessment procedures; that teachers will deliver lessons and activities of improved quality; that pedagogy will be reviewed and disseminated to all staff and that we can embed our chosen language across the curriculum for all our learners.  Staff will return enthused, appreciative of such a fantastic opportunity for professional development and this can only add value to our school, and their well being.In the longer term we are equipping our children and staff with a life-skill we believe will help equip them for living and working in an ever smaller world.  By continually being proactive and seeking new opportunities for our staff and children we are embracing the  European Commission's aims and values.  Our Key Action 1 application seeks to broaden the opportunities academically, socially and culturally for all the stakeholders of our school, which in return may inspire and influence others in our local and wider communities.", "http://www.wanboroughprimary.org", "Wanborough Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023321_coordinator"]]}}, "8EF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1283299200000, 1388448000000, "Secure Web OS Application Delivery Environment", "Impleo Professional Services Limited", "The webinos project will define and deliver an Open Source Platform and specific components for the Future Internet, which will enable web applications and services to be used and shared consistently and securely over a broad spectrum of converged and connected devices, including mobile, PC, home media (TV) and in-car units.

By applying for the Erasmus + program, we want to explore new opportunities for international cooperation and implement effectively;   improve the quality of internationalization in our school and improve staff professionalism by international contacts.\r\n\r\nSince 2015 every school in Flanders is legally  requestedto implement the M-decree in order to realize inclusive education. This decree is originated in an international context since Belgium adopted the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Schools in other European countries that have ratified the Convention have the same obligation. There are obvious mutual similarities between internationalization and the implementation of inclusive education. This is exactly the reason why we have chosen to help achieve both of these challenges for our school with a KA-1 application for financial assistance for an international course for three people as well as for job shadowing and peer review in other European schools for nine people.\r\n\r\nFor inclusive education the participants in the project  are: directors who are responsible for care, the care coordinators and care teachers. They made a list of questions regarding inclusive teaching and identified the target groups. They also have  prepared some cases. They want to reflect and discuss with foreign colleagues about the way they already deal with these problems  through job shadowing and peer review.  So we can benefit from their expertise. The job shadowing takes place in Dutch, German and British schools. These schools are also working on the realization of inclusive education. We can learn from them how to get there. The result of this process, which runs over two years,  is the development of a comprehensive care culture in our school, based on a long-term vision.\r\n\r\nConcerning internationalization we want the coordinator internationalization, a director and a young colleague to enroll for an international course organized by Euneos, \"How to make your school more international?\" The process of improving the quality of internationalization and eventually the realization of international internships for students in vocational and technical education will be supported by a larger group of colleagues. The various meetings and training courses that are required for this will be self-financed by our school.  This will result in a new policy plan in our school for the next ten years, a strengthened international team and the option to organize international internships. This way we want to make internationalization sustainable in our school and we guarantee that the EU-investments pay off in the long term.", "http://www.ridgewayschool.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA101-034607_1"], [2016, "Comparison of the way of dealing with Special Educational Needs", "The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College", 5163.0, 4, 4, "We want to compare the way that Special Educational Needs are dealt with in the participating schools in order to find out (a) in how far the theory (the policy in place) matches practice (the way it is experienced by outsiders) and (b) in how far we can learn from each other about how we deal with SEN.We do this by (1)devising instruments to (a)compare the systems/policies in theory and (b)observe how these policies are executed/experienced by outsiders.
