Our students often lack motivation as far as learning for school subjects is concerned, and they use to show lack of initiative and willingness to participate in school activities, unless they deal with aspects concerning their own interest. They miss the reference to real life. This leads to demotivated attitude toward learning and frustration, because they fail to see the purpose why they should learn subjects that seem to have no relevance to real life. This also leads to underachievement and often to dropping out of school. This situation happens during one of the most difficult period of life, adolescence. Our project wants the students learn to apply their theoretical school knowledge to practical work, and to find out its importance for their future lives.This project aims to involve teacher and students of four European schools, in a common project to address the specific necessities our schools have in order to enhance creativity, innovation, competences achievement, high performance and low performance students\u00b4 motivation, commitment to reduce early school leaving and strategies to tackle disadvantages. Our schools have a double challenge in order to get all students\u2019 academic and personal success: to improve the underachievement in getting basic competences and skills in low performance students, and on the other hand to facilitate the achievement of high-level competences in high performance students.In addition to this, to counteract real situations of social disadvantage that some of our students have is our strong preoccupation. Developing this project, the schools involved in it will create an atmosphere of equity, and will provide activities for everybody to take part in order to compensate the social disadvantages and opportunities.The participating schools from England, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain making up the partnership are four schools with different backgrounds that differ in their profiles, but facing similar educational problems. The Italian, the Dutch and the British schools are big Secondary Education Schools (around 1500 pupils) compared to the Spanish (100 pupils), this will offer our students and teachers a different view of organization at school. The Italian school is scientific and grammar including Electronics, Telecommunications and Business courses, the Dutch school has a bilingual stream in English and expertise in ICT teaching, the English school combining innovative and traditional methods in the classroom, is a record reference of excellent examination results, and the Spanish school brings experience in inclusive education and collaborative work. Project implementation will be carried out by a wide range of activities, but they will be mainly collaborative team work lessons and creative workshops.Projects contents are divided into four blocks; each of them is actually a mini project and will implement the objectives of the project as a whole: Science and Technology, Art and Music, ICT and Social and Environmental Sustainability In each mini project the following cross-curricular competencies will be promoted: Critical Thinking Competency, Personal and Social Competency and Communication Competency.Each mini project will be implemented during a semester, and the last activity will be a transnational meeting. The activities within the project are based on the didactic methods 'Design Thinking' (Case method) and \u2018Collaborative Learning\u2019 (Inclusive school method).  As the project focuses on pupils\u2019 involvement to improve their transversal competences and skills, the guiding principle that we intend to apply will be the integration of the project into the school curriculum. Along with the integration of the project in the teaching/learning activities, getting the support of the staff and the school management team is a guarantee of success. At the completion of the project, as a consequence of the adoption of collaborative methodologies in school organization, teachers and students will be aware of the importance of working together to reach the same goals, and to improve relationships in school life. In addition to this, teachers will have gained knowledge on transversal competences and skills, will have applied their transversal competences and skills knowledge in their lessons and will have learned and practiced collaborative and team work techniques to promote an inclusive education. On the other hand, students will have researched and worked in a cross-cultural setting, will have an opinion on what makes the different subjects profitable and the added value of cultural formation in society, will have a knowledge of career possibilities in the different subjects sector, and will have identified several possibilities to use their knowledge to improve their possibilities of employability.", "http://www.theweald.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA219-024953_2"]]}}, "9SH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1609372800000, "Plasmon Enhanced Terahertz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance", "Thomas Keating Limited", "We propose to establish Plasmon-enhanced Terahertz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy and scanning microscopy as a unique Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) platform for high-sensitivity local analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic species and materials. Here, we will deliver novel hardware and infrastructure providing ground-breaking innovation in the magnetic sensing and imaging. The platform is conceptually based on incorporating THz plasmonic antennas onto surfaces (spectroscopy) and scanning probe tips (microscopy), resulting in a strong, local enhancement (about two orders of magnitude) of the magnetic sensing field. \nExtending to the THz region enables effective utilization of plasmonic structures resulting in a radical improvement of EPR sensitivity (about four orders of magnitude) and spatial resolution going beyond the diffraction limit, and thus introduce a scanning probe microscopic regime into this field. This will make it possible to map the sample over its area and so to localize its properties with unprecedented resolution (below 1 micrometre). Such a significant enhancement of the EPR performance will open new ways in magnetic sensing technologies enabling for instance to study in situ functional centres in a wide variety of materials, and, generally, set a new direction in the development of the EPR-employing industry. \nEPR finds its applications in many scientific areas covering chemistry, biology, medicine, materials science, physics, etc. Hence, introducing this new method would have a profound impact on scientific, technological and societal stakeholders in many research and industrial communities.", 687144.0, 2528630.0, 4, 4, "PETER", null, null, null, "h2020_211923_952016395"], [1356998400000, 1459382400000, "Kinetic Inductance Detectors \u2013 a New Imaging Technology for Observations In and From Space", "Qmc Instruments Limited", "We propose to develop advanced imaging arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for space-based observations at mm-far-infrared (mm-FIR) wavelengths. This development addresses the FP7 topic SPA.2012.2.2-01: Key technologies enabling observations in and from space.\nFuture space science and earth observation missions are limited by the availability of imaging detector array technology for the mm-FIR wavelength range (3 mm to 30 \u03bcm). For the wavelength range 28-45 \u03bcm there is currently no high performance technology with space heritage. For longer wavelengths, 45-2000 \u03bcm there is European expertise in a range of detector technologies, including photoconductors, bolometers, and transition edge superconducting (TES) detectors. However these technologies present significant fabrication difficulties, and lead to a high degree of complexity of system integration and readout electronics for the large format arrays demanded by the next generation of astronomical and Earth observing missions such as FIRI, SPICA, CoRE and Millimetron.\nThe KID is a relatively new and potentially game-changing superconducting detector technology which can provide photon noise limited sensitivity over the entire mm-FIR wavelength range. KIDs are extremely simple both to fabricate and to integrate. Crucially, they can be read out with a high multiplexing ratio which dramatically reduces the complexity of cryogenic interconnections, cabling and electronics enabling larger format arrays than ever before. The reduction in complexity at the cryogenic level in contrast with other ultra-sensitive cryogenic detectors is extremely attractive and enables a dramatic increase in mapping speed for broad band imaging as well as novel applications in spectropolarimetry and hyperspectral imaging.\nThis proposal draws together some of the leading European institutes with experience and expertise in FIR detector technology and includes key members who have made the most significant recent advances in the field", 98822.0, 2090118.0, 4, 7, "SPACEKIDS", null, "http://www.terahertz.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/148225.jpg", "fp7_106575_972420054"], [1317427200000, 1435622400000, "Terahertz Photonic Imager on Chip", "Qmc Instruments Limited", "The impressive developments in the field of electronic imaging based on CMOS Imagers have generated worldwide enormous business opportunities, with revenues of more than $4B in 2009 at the component level alone. Today such Imagers almost solely address the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Many applications would profit from affordable and reliable Imagers for the terahertz band, notably in surveillance and security.The goal of TeraTOP is to develop a new high performance, low cost, THz Imager for passive imaging systems (0.5-1.5THz) based on CMOS batch manufacturing processes: A unique combination of several leading technologies will enable a real quantum leap in THz Imaging in terms of performance, size and costs. THz photonics components (THz lens, optical window and filters), THz antennas, CMOS-SOI (Silicon on Insulator) and NEMS are the key enabling building blocks that will be developed and combined to achieve such a breakthrough in functionality (passive, room temperature operation), performance (NETD of 0.5K), component size (THz imager on a chip) and significant cost reduction (< 7000 \u20ac).The objective is to bring the disruptive technology from the research lab closer to applications, by developing a passive THz Imager for Concealed Weapons Detection. The cost efficient approach will enable a massive deployment of the TeraTOP Imagers, including crowded places, providing therefore a highly efficient response to terrorists' threats.The consortium includes a mix of scientific and technological excellence (University of Wuppertal, the IIT, CEA-L\u00e9ti), as well as leading industrial research groups (IBM, CSEM) and companies (EADS, QMC).
