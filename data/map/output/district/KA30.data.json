The project consists of a youth exchange and an advance planning visit. The project aims at making a contribution to the personal development of PWS through an intercultural learning experience focussed on increasing competencies of the performing arts. PWS, due to their speech disabilities are often at risk of social exclusion and our project aims to increase their social inclusion into European society. \r\nThrough the means of expressing oneself, rather than just mere speech, participants will increase their self-esteem, self-acceptance, acquire new skills of expression and become inspiring examples to their national/local peers facing similar challenges. Consequently this will increase their chances on the labour market and promotes their active participation in society.\r\n\r\nThe seven day youth exchange for PWS is the third in line and follows the successful editions of 2016 & 2017.  In this current YE,  32 participants and 8 group leaders coming from Italy, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Scotland (UK), Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands will gather in a nature rich environment in Sale San Giovanni (Italy) from 01.07.2018 to 07.07.2018. We will use different methods of non-formal education to strengthen and develop capacities crucial for personal and professional development and we use artistic and theatrical methods as the main source of empowerment. Participants will learn together and from each other about their cultures, their speech disability and will collectively find new ways of going beyond speech disabilities. \r\n \r\nThe OBJECTIVES of this youth exchange are: \r\n-to enhance participants' competences in performing arts as a means to connect and communicate with peers and their local society as a source of empowerment, a stimulus to enhance participants' self-esteem, self-acceptance, to increase participants\u2019 sense of initiative, foster social inclusion in their local communities and society at large and become inspiring examples to their national/local peers facing similar challenges;\r\n-to provide participants an intercultural learning opportunity to improve their competences in intercultural dialogue, to deepen their understanding and knowledge of the situation their European peers encounter and to establish an informal European peer support network.\r\n-To improve participant\u2019s foreign language skills, enhance participants\u2019 knowledge of cultural diversity and European citizenship. \r\n-To establish sustainable partnerships among project partners organisations in order to increase the internationalization of their youth work. \r\n-To enhance participants\u2019 knowledge of Erasmus+ Program, its Key Actions and encourage development of new projects and initiatives under Erasmus+ Program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants will be actively engaged in the youth exchange to make sure the exchange is fully build upon the needs and capacities of the participants. Through the use of non-formal methodologies such as meditation, outdoor activities, brainstorms, groups work and creative sessions, participants will be learning about their cultures, learn new competences about their speech disability and about their relationship with society. There is a specific attention for follow-up to the programme, because the partnering organizations have stated that they would like to make a change regarding the awareness of stammering. The follow-up consists of designing new projects, both on a national level as well as on an international level. For the participants there will be a buddy programme that will allow the peer learning process to continue after the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will give the participants a boost in their personal development, such as development of their social skills, intercultural knowledge and attitudes related to their stutter. We envisage that the participants of the project will be the future actors and ambassadors of bringing acceptance to stuttering and become examples of active citizens living life according to their values.", "http://www.stammeringscotland.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL02-KA105-001970_1"]]}}}}
