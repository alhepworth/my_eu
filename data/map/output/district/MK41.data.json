Toxic particles such as asbestos and silica are responsible for the majority of particle related illnesses. The overall impacts of the NanoAir project are to reduce number of deaths and illnesses caused by workplace related exposure to particles. The air pollution detection market is growing fast, as new concerns are identified especially for indoor air pollution. The market is under pressure from USA from many new high-tech solutions, and progression regarding air pollution legislation and NP industries. Thus the concept of the project is to develop a new method to analyse airborne particles, onsite, real-time and with a high quality readout. The method can identify the particle types together with the size distribution. In the project we have a new idea for the development of an improved particle sampling system, which will allow collecting particles with a high efficiency and a wide range of particle sizes, including the nano-size regime. This will allow much improved analysis results and sensitivity for a wide range of particle types and sizes. This sampling system together with a mobile X-ray diffraction analysis technique opens up for new possibilities within air quality detection, especially within the capability to analyse nanoparticles. Detection and analysis of nanoparticles may be a very crucial field in the future air quality analysis, due to a rapidly increase in use of nanomaterials and nanoparticles in building materials, paintings, cleaning products, cosmetics, etc. At the same time, new research have indicated very large potential risks for man-made nanoparticles, due to a very deep deposition in the lungs and high chemical reactivity.", 190070.0, 1238765.0, 9, 13, "NANOAIR", "http://www.fp7nanoair.com", "http://www.britonems.co.uk", null, "fp7_92172_998400631"], [1317427200000, 1380499200000, "Demonstration of an on-site Automated Environmental Monitoring Instrument for real-time detection of hazardous air born particles and Activation of alarms", "Briton Ems Limited", "This project will demonstrate a novel air quality monitoring systems, which has been developed in a previously EC funded FP7 project Nanoair.

The trainees in the Ortenaukreis, as well as the training companies, the zweiteSchule gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft (a non-profit organization), and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr work closely together for the mobility project. Local companies have been sending their trainees to European subsidiaries and other cooperating companies for several years as a mobility activity. It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance. The \"European thought\" can be considered as a long-term benefit. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. The mobility project is going to take place from July until beginning of October 2016.  Thirteen of 20 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Austria and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad. An important part of the mobility measure is the realization of a project which usually deals with current European topics. It is supposed to improve first and foremost the trainees\u2019 linguistic and social skills. Work on the topic \u201cEffects of the demographic changes on the social security in European countries\" poses the question, which results are to be expected.

How can we improve our use of all three by studying and working with other countries and viewing how they develop their pupils in these areas. The idea is for two countries to simultaneously visit the third, spend time in schools and educational settings, compare, contrast, consider and feedback to the host about their practice, excellence and the differences seen. Objectives:   To help shape change in three countries that are all going through reform. To share best practice, establish long term educational links and to use each other\u2019s expertise to not only improve what each partner does, but for it to branch out and be shared with more schools and stakeholders locally, nationally and internationally.Number and profile of participants:   11 stakeholders, 4 in the UK, 3 in Denmark and 3 in Finland. All outlined in the bid, from a variety of backgrounds, some secondary, some primary, some through schools, a University and a Company that delivers innovative teaching to pupils in Denmark are included. Description of activities:   Activities include visits by all 3 countries to each other (2 countries visit simultaneously and one hosts), conferences before and after, the setting up of a hub to share practice online via E-twinning training, the sharing of best practice via working committees afterwards, the delivery of a thesis at the conclusion.Methodology:  Observation, discussion, interviews, questionnaires, and the writing of a thesis.Description of results, impact and long term benefits:  To an extent we don\u2019t want to second guess this as we don\u2019t want conclusions before we find them. We want to impact all three countries by changing practice at local level via what is learned in the research. We would like that to then impact further to the national and international level via the thesis, presentation to the British Council conference and beyond. We would hope the long term benefits would be both improved practice and strong international ties that act as critical friends to improve the educational experience for pupils and staff.", "http://www.newnham-middle.org.uk", "Westfield School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024583_9"], [2017, "Teaching and learning of languages in the European Union", "Castle Newnham School", 4851.0, 1, 1, "Castle Newnham School is situated at the heart of Bedford, one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse towns in the United Kingdom in proportion to its size  The school serves communities that are made up of many different nationalities, encompassing both pockets of affluence and deprivation.  The percentage of pupils from minority ethnic groups is 41%  and the percentage of pupils whose first language is believed not to be English stands at 19% : this puts the school between the 60th and the 80th percentile for both indicators.   Until recently a middle school and a lower school (within Bedfordshire's three-tier education system), Castle Newnham School is now at the heart of the new Castle Newnham Federation (established in January 2016).   Our vision is to provide all-through education from 4-16 years for children in the local community.  At present our pupils range from Nursery to Year 8 and all students in Key Stages 2 and 3 study French ; however, the Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) team is committed to extending the range of foreign languages on offer to all students up to GCSE level and is currently developing a Year 9 scheme of work, for first teaching in September.   The purpose of this application is to give two members of the MFL team an opportunity to hone their skills at a training establishment in Austria. As the social and cultural diversity of the school develops, the range of language competences of its students evolves.   These areas are particularly relevant given the UK Central Government plan for imminent changes to the GCSE language qualifications and its expectations for the 2018 GCSE student cohort regarding EBac subjects. The primary objective of the project is to extend language learning opportunities to include German and to raise cultural awareness. The school has identified a need to enhance existing language skills within the MFL teaching team. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is that two participants undertake a German language immersion course in Vienna, Austria (July/August 2017).  These activities will provide opportunities for participants to improve their knowledge of the German language, extend their repertoire of teaching strategies and deepen their cultural awareness of the countries and communities where German is spoken. Participants will be expected to share all relevant good practice with colleagues, both at a departmental and whole school level via formal feedback and as part of the school's Professional Development Programme for staff.  The school will embrace these learning experiences and integrate relevant best practices within its Development Plan.\r\n\r\nRuth Wilkes and Rachael Hambley are both currently teachers of French who have taught German in the past, although in recent years have had less opportunity to practice their German language skills. The Department has assessed both teachers\u2019 competences and believes that in order for the team to provide a high standard of teaching in German that will both engage and inspire students, and also meet the requirements of the new GCSE qualification, the opportunity to extend their language skills would be invaluable.\r\n\r\nStudents at Castle Newnham School will have the opportunity to study a wider range of European languages through the introduction of German to the curriculum.  Furthermore, the implementation of newly acquired teaching strategies and approaches will enhance learning experiences and improve performance.  Pupils will be given opportunities to deepen their understanding of cultural diversity and to consider future opportunities for education and employment as members of the European Union (EU).  As a direct consequence of the project we would anticipate that a significant number of students would opt to study German to GCSE level, and that some would study both French and German.  It is hoped that this in turn will foster an interest in foreign languages, and spark at least some students to consider future opportunities for employment within, and as part of, the EU. The MFL department has strong links with the Association for Language Learning (a group of teaching professionals that meet regularly to share new ideas on teaching languages in both primary and secondary schools).  A formal presentation will be made about this project to the local group, and in doing so extend its reach. Participants will also supply a written report to the Headteacher and relevant stakeholders, detailing how activities have impacted on teaching practice, curriculum planning and confidence when using the target language within a classroom context.   Impact will be assessed through ongoing school lesson observation programmes and the Quality of Teaching/ Learning Monitoring Cycle.  New ideas will be cascaded down to colleagues as part of the school's Professional Development Programme, both at a departmental and whole school level. The MFL department will monitor trends in numbers of students opting to study German and/or French in KS4.", "http://www.newnham-middle.org.uk", "Castle Newnham School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035766_coordinator"]]}}}}
