The FUTE project aims to deliver that in the form of a new DIDACTIC PLATFORM. The platform consists of theory, tools and a training course for teachers and student teachers including training manual. The theoretical framework is Design School Kolding's '6C-model' which incorporates design thinking and methodology. The tools are method cards - physical teaching tools developed via an original approach: user-involving, dialogue-based design methodology. The cards are an adaptation of the 6C-model. Simply put, they are a way to present abstract concepts like the design process and the composition of organizations in easily understood terms and visual models. Finally, the training course provides a solid introduction and instruction in how to incorporate the didactic platform into one's daily teaching. \r\nSeven partners from five countries, which together possess experience in dozens of European projects and capabilities in education, design, development, research and teacher training, will develop, test and implement Method Cards in a variety of school cultures and contexts in Europe. The Method Cards aim to empower teachers to take greater control over their jobs, increase their confidence in and strategic overview of their teaching plan and inject innovation, dynamism and creativity into their classes. The cards will enable and encourage teachers and students to co-create subject content. This will help motivate and interest students and increase job satisfaction for teachers, which will contribute towards retaining talented teachers in their jobs. \r\n\r\nProject activities and our methodological approach is based on design thinking, specifically user-centred design. This approach places the end user and their needs squarely at the centre of proceedings. After an initial needs analysis, completed in close dialogue with 10 pilot teachers, development work begins. Having identified very specifically which areas of teachers' competences that are best served by the Method Cards, the project partners work with the pilot teachers in an iterative loop process of:\r\n\r\nDevelopment -> Teacher Feedback -> Product Fine-Tuning -> Testing -> Evaluation and Triangulation -> loop restarting with Development. So on and so forth until the prototype or final product is ready.\r\n\r\nThis iterative loop is an illustration of the design process. The process is how FUTE will reach a viable teaching tool product that caters to teachers' very specifically identified needs and wishes for the ideal tool to assist them in their day-to-day teaching. There is a strong element of quality assurance and control in this process, which is why it is ideal for development projects. \r\n\r\nDesign School Kolding is keen to bring our expertise in this process to the FUTE project. The school has worked with method compilations as a tool to streamline organizations and workflows for over a decade. Our experience with design minded teacher training has shown us the potential of this method. Working with partner organizations that are expert teacher trainers, we aim to demonstrate the 6C-model's usefulness in the modern teaching environment.\r\n\r\nWe expect FUTE's didactic platform to integrate design methodology in the participating schools, streamline the organizational and planning elements of the teacher's job and increase job satisfaction. The Method Cards should make teaching less stressful and more fun, which is what attracted most teachers to the job in the first place. Students will also be impacted through teachers spending more time teaching and less time administrating, which will increase motivation and  attention.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of introducing design methodology to European classrooms include increased teacher retention in the profession, increased academic performance for students and a decrease in early school leaving.", "http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA201-034271_1"], [2017, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "CARDIFF METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", 317960.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

This can only happen if HE teacher\u2019s skills are improved to enhance pedagogies. Recent evidence suggest that this cannot happen in isolation, either within a university or an individual country, and needs to be developed through transnational cooperation between HEIs to ensure best practice and innovation is shared. This is particularly important with the development of open educational practices as the digital era becomes more pervasive and sophisticated. This does present challenges, but we also believe it presents timely opportunities for the \u2018SHaring Open educational practices Using Technology For Higher Education\u2019 (SHOUT4HE) project.\r\n\r\nThe project has four main objectives. First, the development of a Recognition framework for effective use of technology in Higher Education (HE) teaching, to allow HE teachers to assess their current position, but also to see how to enhance their teaching in line with individual needs and expectations. Second, the design and development of an e-Platform for sharing open education practices (n=40) and resources. Thirdly, to develop a Community of Practice for HE teachers to bring together  participating HE teachers from the different partner countries and beyond. Finally, to develop a set of e-Resources to be shared through the e-Platform and other networks.\r\n\r\nThere are five university partners across four countries, all of whom are HE teachers. Each of these will be working closely with a minimum of five HE teachers. Each offer a wide variety of subject and disciplines knowledge and experience.  The project will involve integrated transnational meetings, multiplier events and a final conference, as well as data collection from the CoP and other HE teachers collaboratively recognize practices from other HE teachers.

It takes a collaborative action research approach with researchers, teachers and learners of all ages to create open educational resources to support language teachers in integrating a variety of new technologies into effective communicative and task-based language teaching.  It aims to: a) involve project teachers in in-depth and ongoing collaboration and reflection on how language teaching can promote language acquisition; and b) create e-resources including technical manuals and examples of technology-mediated teaching practice, developing an online community of practice to explore and record innovative practice in language teaching using technology. \r\n\r\nThis project builds on the highly successful 28-month project iTILT (interactive Technologies In Language Teaching) funded by the European Lifelong Learning Programme (KA2 Languages), focusing on the interactive whiteboard (IWB) for teaching foreign languages. The consortium of 7 educational institutions and companies produced teacher education resources (training manual and pedagogical materials), trained teachers of 6 languages in four educational sectors (primary, secondary, higher and vocational), filmed classes of 44 teachers using the IWB, and developed an open educational resource which includes over 250 video clips of IWB-mediated language teaching in 7 countries (http://itilt.eu).  The iTILT project scored 9/10 in EU evaluations covering deliverables and project management.\r\n\r\nWith this background, the new project builds on: a) a well-designed open educational resource whose platform meets stringent technical standards and is immediately available for extension; b) solid research results which derive from classroom contexts closely related to the classes in the new project, and c) an experienced team with complementary skills and a successful 4-year collaboration in hand.  It is our belief that a project which develops and extends our existing work can further support language learners and teachers in making the most of the acquisitional opportunities offered by educational technologies.\r\n\r\nThe new three year project will move beyond the IWB to focus on developing effective teaching and learning of second languages with a much wider range of new and emerging interactive technologies (such as iPads, tablet PCs, learner response systems, and videoconferencing software) both independently and in combination.  The data collection/professional development cycle will include extensive teacher development involving researcher input and peer collaboration using face-to-face and online spaces, followed by two iterations of classroom filming and participant interviews.  The data collected will be integrated into an extended version of the existing iTILT website, and involve new professional development e-resources for pre-service and in-service language teachers and teacher educators.\r\n\r\nThe project team will use the approach developed and refined during the first project based on collaborative action research involving video stimulated reflective dialogue (VSRD) to include teacher and learner perspectives and ensure that the project is grounded in current classroom practice but also reflects the research team\u2019s expertise in effective language teaching with technology. \r\n\r\nThe data collection carried out by the partners covers three sub-programmes:  tertiary education (TK, FR, DE), primary (UK, FR, DE) and secondary (BE, FR) schools.

The project will establish innovative training practices in sustainable tourism, defining, accrediting and certifying sustainable tourism  modules alongside PM4SD and other existing training tools to be included within the European VET system, providing a standard benchmark for sustainable tourism management. The certified trainings and tools developed through the project will be based on: PM4SD (Project Management for Sustainable Development) certification; The Sustainable Tourism for Development Guidebook (edited by UNWTO); the World Heritage Sustainable Tourism Toolkit, and the European Indicators System (ETIS). Results will be accessible through an open source platform and for 40 participants, 2 training classes will be delivered, 15 trainers will be certified by the end of the project.

The key challenges are that they do not always have the option to take part in organisations of youth without disabilities,  because of accessibility and/or psychological barriers, and are generally organised in disability networks and disability-specific organisations, which makes participation in decision-making processes more difficult, have difficulties in the access to education and face cumulative discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe and our partners believe that disability issues should be cross-cutting especially in youth policy and believe that this training course will provide further insight on disability issues, foment research on non-formal tools and methods to integrate youth with disabilities and to commit youth workers to include youth with disabilities in the life of their organisation.

Though it is long procedure and short period of time is not always enough, germinating would be the perfect solution in this case. We also see this project as to be continuous.

Participants will be able to understand the differences of various eating habits and to consciously choose which one is the best for them. As most of the organisations have different experience, we are sure that participants will be able to gain very important knowledge about foods and will be motivated to interest even at home about this kind of topic.3. Youngsters will understand what is the consumerism culture and how it damages our world and will be able to make conscious decisions towards buying.

Our staff will be able to impart knowledge to pupils and cascade information via formal INSET'S to own staff and on a wider basis through our cluster, family of schools and our Global Learning Network.ActivitiesStaff would initially be given a tour of the school to see how it operates and understand management structures: meet with all staff to discuss all aspects of school life, staff training and enrichment opportunities, to enhance pupils IT and employability skills.  We would also use time to meet with our dedicated Lego representative to discuss our potential Erasmus + project. Staff would acquire specific coding knowledge by being trained by other teachers in the partner school, and observing pupils putting these skills into action.  We would also be talking and listening to learners and will also carry out the project via e-twinning links. MethodologyWhen back home skills will be implemented and similar to a co-coaching model will afford other teachers the opportunities to acquire these skills.Description of ResultsThe two members of staff will become lead practitioners in the school and within our Local Education Authority. Our pupil baseline of understanding of coding is zero, therefore this project will equip our pupils to have the knowledge to access and use new ICT technologies to enhance their learning experiences.Impact EnvisagedPupil and staff ICT skills will be enhanced. The trained staff will make a difference through their new knowledge gained through Job Shadowing and be able to disseminate effectively across the school. These staff will work with senior management in order to raise the profile of Coding. This will then impact on Teaching and Learning in IT, with a view to raising the ambition and achievement of all pupils. Long Term BenefitsThe children and staff will acquire life long learning skills in ICT, which they can apply to constantly evolving world technology. The curriculum would then be modified as appropriate in order to embed best practice that had been observed from the visit abroad, at the partner school.", "http://stnicholascwprimary.co.uk", "ST NICHOLAS CHURCH IN WALES PRIMARY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023207_coordinator"]]}}}}
