With half of the world\u2019s population currently living in urban centres, and with this figure set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, the issue of security and citizen safety is of paramount importance and a growing concern. In view of the growing number of threats from global terrorism, natural disasters or crime, urban planning practice must incorporate appropriate security measures for vulnerability identification and resilience enhancements.\nUrban planning is a process involving numerous stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams. Although the use of software tools plays a significant role in this complex process, yet, none exist that take into consideration the security (and connected safety) aspects of urban planning as a whole.\nUrban planning teams need tools that fully encompass the pre-application process with developers/designers, and facilitate flexible solutions, not imposed measures. The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners\n\u2022 to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level),\n\u2022 to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and\n\u2022 to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level).\nAll levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering.

At present the recording and analysis of such traces can only be mitigated (if at all) through time consuming procedures. In the last years the FP7 project 3D-Forensics (www.3D-Forensics.eu) developed and evaluated a promising approach to fill gaps in the performance of actual tools. Footwear and tyre traces are captured using modern optical 3D-scanning technology and investigated using a 3D analysis software focussed on forensic end users.

Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project \u2018Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions\u2019 (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios.
