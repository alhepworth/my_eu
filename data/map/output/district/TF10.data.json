Europe has a major agricultural waste problem, generating some 700 million tonnes of waste annually. There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. \n\nAgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry. The AgroCycle consortium is a large (25) multi-national group (including China) comprising the necessary and relevant multi-actors (i.e. researchers; companies in the technical, manufacturing, advisory, retail sectors (Large and SMEs); lead users; end users; and trade/producer associations) for achieving the project\u2019s ambitions goals.

A major component of MyToolBox, which also distinguishes this proposal from previous efforts in the area mycotoxin reduction, is to provide the recommended measures to the end users along the food and feed chain in a web-based Toolbox. Cutting edge research will result in new interventions, which will be integrated together with existing measures in the Toolbox that will guide the end user as to the most effective measure(s) to be taken to reduce crop losses. We will focus on small grain cereals, maize, peanuts and dried figs, applicable to agricultural conditions in EU and China. Crop losses using existing practices will be compared with crop losses after novel pre-harvest interventions including investigation of genetic resistance to fungal infection, cultural control, the use of novel biopesticides (organic-farming compliant), competitive biocontrol treatment and development of forecasting models to predict mycotoxin contamination. Research into post-harvest measures including real-time monitoring during storage, innovative sorting of crops using vision-technology and novel milling technology will enable cereals with higher mycotoxin levels to be processed without breaching regulatory limits in finished products.

Support however is more often focused in traditional rural business then new businesses, meaning many entrepreneurs in these areas face an obstacle to accessing training which can help them set up new companies. Women in rural areas require extra support, since they are underrepresented in business; often face extra obstacles such as a lack of self-confidence or dealing with caring responsibilities and are often working in isolated areas with a need to build up their support networks. Women are also moving away from rural areas to more populated ones, in search of better opportunities, which is leading to \u2018brain drain\u2019 in some areas.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of this project are to assist women from rural areas in the 5 partner countries (Iceland, UK, Lithuania, Croatia and Bulgaria) to become successful entrepreneurs with a focus on small business development.\r\n \r\nThe partners involved are experienced in working with women entrepreneurs in rural areas, with qualified staff and extensive networks for dissemination. Based on their knowledge and expertise of the needs of women in their countries, partners will work with groups from already defined rural areas close to them. The project will have several outputs starting with an extensive research across all partner countries, including focus groups, desk research and online surveys. There will be an online training programme for the women, focusing on hard skills which will be supported by the development of Enterprise Circles\u2122 which will be developed based on an existing methodology from Inova in the UK. A Facilitators Guide will be produced, providing guidelines for the trainers and how they can deliver the methodology in the best way. Also, a Guide for Policy Makers will be produced, where recommendations regarding support for women in rural areas will be outlined. Dissemination activity will be extensive, using social media and a dedicated project website along with more traditional material such as bookmarks and postcards. Multiplier Events will be included, such as Spread the Word Dissemination groups and a Final Conference. \r\n \r\nThe methodology that will be used to support women will be threefold:\r\n \r\n1/ Rural Business Women's networks will be developed based on the idea of Community Driven Learning and Development, giving groups of women in the same areas opportunities to meet and provide peer support and mentoring. One leader in each pilot region will be appointed, who will have training in the methodology by attending seminars with participants from other partner countries. \r\nEnterprise Circles\u2122 will be delivered face to face and online, to women in rural areas. The method which uses a blend of Action Learning, Mentoring and Coaching has been developed and used in the UK with good results in face to face seminars with other target groups.

We currently offer French language teaching within our curriculum but we would like to extend and improve our provision. One of the main obstacles to high quality, consistent language teaching within our school is the lack of  confidence and language expertise amongst our teaching staff and support staff. We would therefore like to improve the confidence levels and develop the expertise in French language and French language teaching. This would in turn, raise the expectation and attainment of our pupils in French. We have a significantly high proportion of boys on role compared to girls and engaging boys in early language learning is crucial to maintaining life long language learning. In order to facilitate the skill improvement, CPD programme, curriculum and policy development we also need to develop the leadership and management skills of curriculum and subject leaders.\r\nOur objectives are:\r\nTo significantly increase confidence, skills and expertise in French language including grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.\r\nTo significantly increase confidence, skills and expertise in French language teaching.\r\nTo develop teacher understanding of the pedagogies specific to language learning and teaching.\r\nTo establish a purposeful link with a French primary school.\r\nTo develop our use of ICT technologies in language learning and communication.\r\nTo broaden our pupils' understanding of the European Union and our part in it.\r\nTo enable our pupils to experience up to date European culture.\r\nTo develop a high profile, whole school approach to creative French language learning and teaching.\r\nTo develop the leadership and management skills of our curriculum leaders.\r\nTo develop the strategic planning and decision making skills of our curriculum leaders.\r\nWe only have two members of staff who consider themselves proficient in French language teaching. The majority of staff members do not have much experience of French and as result, the quality of French teaching is very variable across school. They also lack confidence in French speaking and pronunciation. These five members of staff require increased knowledge and understanding in the French language, grammar and pronunciation. \r\nFor the Leadership in Primary management course we have identified members of staff who are subject leaders within Primary Languages and International links. Their role is leading and managing the curriculum and diversifying the teaching styles within language teaching. Their identified area of need is leadership and management skills to enable them to successfully lead the CPD programme and undertake successful monitoring and evaluation of our Primary Languages curriculum. They would benefit greatly from experiencing alternative and effective management strategies in practice and gain a greater understanding of policy making and strategic decision making.\r\nThe training activities we are interested in undertaking are:\r\nTraining Course in Teaching and Learning of French Language and Culture for Primary Education (Lille, France)\r\nThis course will develop participant's knowledge and understanding of French language and increase competence and confidence in using French within the classroom.\r\nLeadership in Primary Education (Finland)\r\nThis course will develop participant's knowledge and understanding of the Finnish education system in order to broaden and deepen their understanding of primary practice and policy; improve management skills in order to operate within an international setting; develop curriculum leadership and management skills.\r\nExpected outcome and impact:\r\nImproved confidence in French language teaching; teachers will be inspired to teach French in a creative and engaging way. Developed and deepened understanding of French vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation; developed pedagogies specific to French language teaching; enhanced classroom practice; good practice shared with other participants; purposeful and collaborative link forged with a French primary school.\r\nIn the long term we hope to fully engage all learners in learning French and then hopefully additional languages. We hope to have a staff that are all confident with French teaching and to be providing high quality learning for all pupils across the school. We would also like to establish links with other European primary partners that will be as successful as our partnership with Makunga Primary, Kenya.", "http://www.tibbertonschool.org.uk", "Tibberton CE (Controlled) Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001951_coordinator"]]}}}}
