At the core of our ethos is a recognition of people's existing expertise and the different ways people want to and do engage in science and technology. The project is aimed at elevating public engagement with science across Europe from passive engagement with the process of developing science to an active one.

Besides the strong use of ICT and automation, manual processes such as welding, still play a large role in the manufacturing industry. Welders represent a traditional branch with almost no ICT training being implemented. The common approach is classroom face-to-face theoretical training and applied shopfloor welding. Such opposition towards modernisation and new technologies requires a clearly stated concept that builds upon real challenges and working processes. To strive in today's digital world, meeting handling the changes in the workspace, trained welders  must increase their IT knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main project innovation is the inclusion of digital technologies in the existing professional welding profile in the manufacturing industry, working in the context of Industry 4.0, that will address an actual market need in terms of qualified personnel. This is a key market need to address the skills shortage and gap that affect the manufacturing sector. \r\n\r\nThe WELD4.0 project, submitted in 2017 to the UK Erasmus+ National Agency, has six main objectives:\r\n1) To re-define the European Welder profile in the context of Industry 4.0, based on new and future job requirements, analysing needed digital welding skills and competences;\r\n2) Improve the quality of qualification programmes related to welding in terms of transparency and recognition between the European countries (using common EU tools);\r\n3) Promote language learning and linguistic diversity through the provision of multinational pilot training, especially in English,  German and Portuguese (languages of the consortium members);\r\n4) Increase transparency of competences and qualifications in the welding sector;\r\n5) Foster the promotion of new learning opportunities, in an easily accessible and career oriented welding profile;\r\n6) Implement ICT new learning opportunities, via the development of an innovative ICT training solution which may include e.g. Welding Simulators, Game Based Learning, and Serious Gaming.\r\n\r\nThe WELD4.0 consortium composed by 4 partners with complementary backgrounds and expertise: \r\n1. one company with expertise in ICT training methods (HighSkillz)\r\n2. one research organization with expertise in manufacturing and digitisation (BIBA)\r\n3. one welding institute with both sectorial and national expertise in VET and welding (ISQ)\r\n3. a European umbrella association (EWF) with members, which are VET providers, in 31 European countries. \r\n\r\nWELD4.0 is going to innovate the Welding VET by updating the European Welder profile, to harmonise and standardise requirements and training standards across Europe. The enhanced profile is also addressing new technologies in the context of Industry 4.0. Based on that profile, innovative tools are developed, including new approaches of teaching and learning using methods for skill and competence development such as Game Based Learning, Simulators and Serious Gaming. The new approach is piloted through hands-on approach seminars in three different industrial countries in Europe: Germany, Portugal and the UK.\r\n\r\nFurtheron, WELD4.0 is providing national and international events (i.e. the Partnership Capacity Building Events and the International Project Conference) to disseminate the new approach to the VET and welding industry. WELD4.0 is defining a marketing and exploitation plan to ensure sustainability after project lifetime.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the WELD4.0 project is organized in seven main Activities (A):\r\nA1 - European Welder, an overview of the curriculum and its shortages\r\nA2 - Partnership Capacity Building Event & Hands-on Approach Seminars\r\nA3 - European Welder profile updating with novel ICT-based learning methods, including EQF and ECVET\r\nA4 - Quality Assurance and Evaluation\r\nA5 - Marketing & Dissemination\r\nA6 - Exploitation and Valorisation \r\nA7 - Project Management\r\n\r\nThe expected outputs of WELD4.0 include an initial report, the European welder curriculum re-design, a set of WELD4.0 learning and training tools, a report on evaluation studies and recommendations for best practices, and Guide for implementation of WELD4.0 methodology to other industrial sectors.\r\n\r\nFinally, WELD4.0 will have a significant impact across Europe, during and after the project duration, because it will add innovation to an existing professional profile and a real market need in line with the digitisation needs and the standards of Industry 4.0.", "http://www.highskilllz.com", "HIGHSKILLZ LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036775_coordinator"], [2015, "Health and Safety in Electromagnetic Fields in Welding", "HIGHSKILLZ LIMITED", 185398.0, 5, 5, "REASON FOR THE PROJECT: The risk of failing to implement the requirements of the new Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Directive will\r\nhave a negative impact in companies accross europe. This is foresseen to lead to an increase of costs for SMEs and consequently to\r\nan increasing number of internal difficulties in order to conform with the Directive. It will be applied to all sectors without exception,\r\nhowever our focus will be on the welding sector, and will stipulate mandatory exposure limit values established on the basis of the\r\nrecommendations issued by the International Community on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection. The Directive itself underwent\r\nrevisions in 2008 and 2011 and is set to be transposed into national legislation until July 1st 2016 (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:179:0001:0021:EN:PDF). So the need for qualified personnel in this area will\r\nincrease considerably in the following years.\r\n\r\nAIMS & OBJECTIVES: The project aims at avoiding unfulfillment of the stipulated mandatory limit values of the Directive by European\r\ncompanies. This will be done by developing an harmonized training course of personnel involved in the risk assessment of EMF in\r\nindustry, focusing not only in large enterprises but also in SMEs in different European countries, and to create the profile of a\r\nElectromagnetic Fields Health and Safety Officer in Welding (EF-HSOW).\r\nThis objective will be achieved through the definition of educational materials for the training of personnel involved in EMF risk\r\nassessements based on the the upcoming Directive and on the creation of a Professional profile for EF-HSOW.\r\n\r\nCONSORTIUM: The consortium is constituted by five partners. SZA will act as Project Coordinator, in direct contact with the National Agency from Austria. EWF is the European Federation for Welding, Joining and Cutting, with a Training and Qualification network covering 31 member countries that will be essential in the implementation and dissemination of HS-EMFW results. EWF is an official campaign partner of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA). Two of the partners are the welding institutes of Portugal (ISQ) and Italy (IIS), which have strong knowledge and expertise in training and qualification at a sector-based level. HighSkillz is an innovative company focused on user transformation using ICT technology, namely serious games, gamification and social media. All partners also have plenty of experience in the implementation and training of European Directives.\r\n\r\nOUTCOMES: The objectives will be achieved through the definition of a harmonized curriculum for the training of personnel\r\ninvolved in the risk assessment of EMF in industry. For this purpose, at the start of the project, a study will be carried out in order to\r\nunderstand the specific requirements in terms of EMF Risk Assessement in different countries and in different industries, where\r\nwelding plays an important role. This will allow the development of an harmonized European training curriculum.\r\n\r\nIMPACT: The EMF Directive will supress mandatory demands for all companies involved in welding. This will have impact in the\r\nEuropean metal working sector which accounts for over 87\u20ac billion of value added to the European economy, as well as over 2\r\nmillion jobs.", "http://www.highskilllz.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA202-004982_3"]]}}}}
