In Every pupil and every teacher got an iPad as a didactic tool to enable interactive learning. The school has a unique position in Flanders as to mobile learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore starting the iPadproject some  teachers went abroad to see how tabletlearning worked in Europe. They visited Hondsrugcollege in the Netherlands and attended Apple summits in London. \r\n\r\nBack home, a team of teachers and IT-specialists gave internal training to the teachers. Next to this, Kurt Kleyen, an ADE, gave some external training and other European ADE's as Oscar Stringer and Marc Pentleton came and gave lectures on an open course day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe staff achieved a moment of technical control and got knowledge of the survey of the basic educational apps. To grow further they wanted to enlarge their skills for deeper mobile learning by observation in classrooms, reflection on class management and discussion with partners from other schools abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSint-Pieterscollege first hosted 2 teachers of Casimirianum College of Coburg (Germany) for jobshadowing on mobile learning. With the results of these reflectiondays, a Belgian team of 3 teachers and their headmaster organized a first flow of jobshadowing in  Longfield Academy in Kent. Four days of cooperation resulted in:\r\n\r\n- insight in new didactics, apps and teaching methods\r\n\r\n- insight in motivating learners;\r\n\r\n- a view on processes of change;\r\n\r\n- the ability to create an atmoshere of cooperative learning;\r\n\r\n- the knowledge how connect underlying frameworks and human values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jobshadowing leads to immediate internal dissemination of knowledge and skills in staff meetings and in personal evaluation talks. A second flow of jobshadowing is provided for heads of departments.\r\n\r\nExternal dissemination will be realized by report to schoolgroups visiting Sint-Pieterscollege, to aspirant teachers and researchers on e-learning of the university of Gent.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Erasmus+ the school gets an opportunity to explore and extand their understanding of new teaching and learning methods to obtain a higher educational quality.", "http://www.longfieldaacdemy.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BE02-KA101-000116_1"]]}}, "8PE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "European Experience", "Thistle Hotels", 63613.0, 5, 11, "The project \"European Experience\" enables 35 students at the Austrian Secondary College for Occupations in the Service Industries and Tourism Marienberg in Austria to do their 12-week compulsory placement abroad. The students can do their compulsory placement in 4- or 5-star hotels in one of the European Unions's member states. The placement in the hotels can be done in the kitchen, the restaurant, at the reception or in housekeeping. \r\n\r\nBesides getting some practical training as a chef or a waitress the compulsory placement is also an important tool for the students to acquire social and personal skills (soft skills) which can be only taught to a limited extent at school. To become part of this project the students need to show a great level of ambition and self-dependence. Furthermore, the placement abroad raises awareness for the importance of getting international work experience. This project also improves the quality of the curriculum offered at this school and it increases the employability of those students taking part in the project.\r\n\r\nThe placement abroad stiffles European identity among the participants and it tries to raise further interest in gaining international work experience or in studying abroad in the future.", "http://www.thistle.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000373_10"]]}}}}
