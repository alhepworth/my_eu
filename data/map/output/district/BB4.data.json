In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than \u20ac60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow \u2013 such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 days\u2019 downtime per fault over current methods", 1212614.0, 1732307.0, 1, 1, "SENTRY", null, null, null, "h2020_211147_926065985"], [1470009600000, 1477872000000, "Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings", "Electricity Distribution Services Limited", "The Cable Sentry project will provide sensitive, real-time subsea high voltage (HV) cable monitoring to the offshore wind farm industry. By coupling the fibre optic cable to the HV cable faults can be easily identified and pre-located from acoustic signals. With 90 wind farms in development across Europe with 20000 km of subsea cabling by 2020, a daily offline cost to the energy companies of \u20ac300,000 and an increasing fault occurrence rate of up to 5-8 faults per 1000 km per year in early wind farm lifetime Cable Sentry has great potential. Our prototype has been proven to provide a 50-60% time and cost saving on fault ID and location when trialled. In addition, our system does not require seabed installation and can cover cables up to 120 km in length meeting the trend for the increasing distance to shore. Cable Sentry provides value added functionality as it is able to locate and measure free-span, indicate burial depth and wave height useful for cable surveying and condition monitoring. We are seeking funding for formation of a detailed business plan to demonstrate our comprehensive strategy to move our product from TRL6 to TRL8 within a Phase 2 project. We will develop a strong sales and marketing plan that will allow us to meet the growth increase anticipated due to our holding sole European distribution rights for Cable Sentry. Phase 2 work will include large-scale pilot trials for data collection and analysis to tune our algorithms to cover all potential fault types and cable positioning possibilities. Cable Sentry will enable Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) to achieve our vision to become the leading HV asset management company for offshore wind farms in Europe.

Europe's cultural heritage is at the heart of the collective memory and identity of Europeans. This year the aim is to raise awareness of European history and to strengthen the sense of a European identity. \r\nThe European Office Bocholt \u2013 located in the Department of Culture and Education of the city of Bocholt \u2013 would therefore like to take the \"European Year of cultural heritage\" at this year's youth camp as an opportunity for the participants to make their way through a journey through the The music, the dance, the acrobatics in European history make.\r\nDance and music/rhythm are among the oldest forms of expression of the people. Dancing is originally a community action with many functions, e.g. to take courage before the hunt, together with joy, etc. An important function is also the telling with expression of body and movement. \r\nIn the current project Europe Rocks Bocholt \u2013 \"Multikulti \u2013 our voices, our strengths, our talents!\" is about dance, music and acrobatics. The young people from more than six nations are encouraged by working together on a musical, dance and acrobatic project in their personal, social, linguistic, creative, physical and creative fields and supported.\r\nThe current project is intended to help to strengthen its own competencies through the medium of music and dance and to work together interculturally with young people from different countries. In this project, the use of the language plays only a subordinate role, it is more important to get involved, to adapt, to work on common goals. \r\nThe young people are assisted by trained trainers who guide not only professional, but also intercultural competencies to strengthen the self-confidence of each individual. With this project, they are to be given the opportunity to portray and convey things that cannot be expressed verbally through music, dance and acrobatics. It is not about the promotion of talented individuals, but about the common interaction of all. \r\nThis project is designed to give young people the chance to express their strength, voice and talent. Another aspect of the project is the learning of other cultures and nations. This is why the meeting takes place in mixed nations, where the participants have to deal with the different cultures, customs and information from the respective countries. Another overall goal is to awaken the sense of belonging to society and to strengthen the personal development of young people in a protected and supervised framework.\r\nThe European office Bocholt deliberately relies on the interaction and networking among the cultural organizations and institutions in the participating cities. From there come the young people, who can take their experiences home as \"ambassadors of their country/institution\" and later also for other cultural (music, dance, etc.) can use projects with single or multiple partners.\r\nAn important aspect is the addition of this project to the NRW culture backpack. For this purpose, the Department of Culture and Education of the city of Bocholt usually organises an action week at the end of each summer holiday. In 2018 it will be combined with the European Youth camp on the occasion of the European Year of cultural heritage. \r\nParticipants at the NRW culture jerk in the week are children aged 6 \u2013 10 years. They, who can normally only gain experience abroad through holidays, have the opportunity here for the first time to Bocholt with European youths in a joint overall performance on the title Europe \u2013 \"Our voices, our strengths, our talents!\" Work. In this way, they are introduced to Europe with all its diverse characteristics at an early stage through active participation and acquisition of experience. All those involved want to lay the foundation for the fact that the children will be introduced to the European Community, to the European language acquisition, to European culture, etc., through school, leisure, non-formal learning, etc.\r\nThe overall project aims to teach young people (and children) that they are understood as part of society. The enormous variety in the field of music, dance and acrobatics as well as percussion offers the opportunity to deal with the different cultures, habits and information on a kind of time track from the respective countries \u2013 including those where the refugees come from- To deal with.

Many people advise him on the one, and many to the other.\r\nEven today, young people face similar tipping points with the prospect of being able to take advantage of their opportunities not only in their own country but also across Europe. Many parallels between then and now are experienced through the project and openly discussed with young people from other European countries in their transformation processes.\r\nOn the basis of predefined characters (and corresponding \"roller maps\"), the participating young people develop a play on Charlie 's decision under expert guidance and largely independently. This will be listed at the end of Camp 2017.\r\nThe theater play - the rehearsals as well as the performance - demands and promotes the participants in their personality and as a group member. They are strengthened in their creativity and ideas, their (nonverbal) communication and interaction is enhanced. They gain self-confidence and acquire artistic, personal and social skills. They may also know how their future professional career might look.\r\nDuring a project week, a concrete project description is also being developed, which allows the young people to take \"Charlie's Choice\" with them into their home environment and to use the program there.
