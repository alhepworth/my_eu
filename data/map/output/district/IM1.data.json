FLOSS provides numerous benefits for developing countries, such as low cost, adaptability, and a free-of-charge high quality training environment, as shown by the FP6 FLOSSWORLD study.<br/>The FLOSSInclude project aims to strengthen Europe participation in international research in FLOSS and open standards, by studying what is needed to increase the deployment, development and societal impact of FLOSS in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The project will result in a sound understanding of the FLOSS-related needs of the target regions.<br/>It will federate local and regional development initiatives with the support of cooperation with current EU research. It will also provide a roadmap for future EU research cooperation in this area.<br/>To achieve these objectives, the FLOSSInclude project will perform five core tasks:<br/>1. analysis of available data to identify key problem areas and areas of blocked potential for FLOSS in the target regions<br/>2. dissemination and networking, to identify and federate local and regional initiatives<br/>3. requirements analysis, to show with concrete cases the specific technical, business and socio-political needs for the growth of FLOSS use, deployment and development in target regions<br/>4. validation and pilots, to ensure that FLOSS solutions, tools and services can be cost-effective and practical<br/>5. prepare a cooperation roadmap, supported by regional initiatives, concrete cases for clearly identified requirements, with solution areas proposed that have been validated through pilots.<br/>Validated pilots and a coordinated roadmap for future EU development research cooperation will ensure that the impact of FLOSSInclude will be sustained far beyond the duration of the project.", 23559.0, 857006.0, 9, 11, "Flossinclude", null, null, null, "fp7_85548_999711780"], [1349049600000, 1443571200000, "CloudSpaces: Open Service Platform for the Next Generation of Personal Clouds", "Canonical Limited", "In the following years, users will access their data from a variety of devices, operating systems and applications. The CloudSpaces project advocates for a paradigm shift from application-centric to person-centric models where users will retake the control of their information. CloudSpaces aims to create the next generation of open Personal Clouds using three main building blocks: CloudSpaces Share, CloudSpaces Storage and CloudSpaces Services.<br/>CloudSpaces Share will deal with Interoperability and privacy issues. The infrastructure must ensure privacy-aware data sharing from other Personal Clouds. It must overcome existing vendor lock-in risks thanks to open APIs, metadata standards, personal data ontologies, and portability guarantees.<br/>CloudSpaces Storage takes care of scalable data management of heterogeneous storage resources. In particular, users retaking control of their information means that users can decide where their data is stored and how applications and users can access their information. This new scenario clearly requires novel adaptive replication and synchronization schemes  dealing with  aspects like load,  failures, network heterogeneity and desired consistency levels.<br/>Finally, CloudSpaces Services provides a high level service infrastructure for third-party applications that can benefit from the Personal Cloud model. Our novel application model will offer data management (3S: Store, Sync, Share), data-application interfaces, and a persistence service to heterogeneous applications with different degrees of consistency and synchronization.<br/>The project results will be validated thanks to contributions to three mainopen source projects: Ubuntu One Personal Cloud, OpenStack Swift Cloud storagesolution, and eyeOS Personal Web Desktop. We will leverage the massivecommunities of these projects to disseminate CloudSpaces achievements.", null, 3209916.0, 4, 8, "cloudspaces", null, null, null, "fp7_105603_999711780"]]}}}}
