The Scottish Government's vision of the 1+2 policy is to ensure that every child in Scotland is equipped with the language skills and competencies they need in our increasing globalised world. By 2020 every child is entitled to learn a first additional language from primary one and a second additional language by primary five. \r\n\r\nAlthough some of our teachers have been trained in French, many teachers find it difficult to fully embed the 1+2 approach in their daily practice. Many teachers would greatly benefit from further training to up-skill their own competence in language learning and teaching. An immersion trip, like the one being offered by Erasmus+ will bring a vital authentic cultural dimension to my teaching of languages, which is not possible to achieve from the UK alone. I will lead teacher training and share my learning and experiences with my colleagues, thus motivating and benefitting everyone. \r\n\r\nI am the only teacher in my school applying to take part in the LFEE Immersion trip to France in October 2018. I am keen to develop language learning and I believe that this immersion trip will equip me with the skills and experience necessary to bring language learning to life in my classrooms and inspire my colleagues to do the same. The Immersion course will improve my methodological expertise in the teaching of French to children. I will gain a broader and deeper understanding of how language is taught and developed in European countries, as well as improving my own confidence and performance in the French language. As a result, I will be able to help support my colleagues to fully embed languages into their classroom.\r\n\r\nI will share my experiences from the Immersion trip at authority, cluster and school level. Furthermore, I will make use of GLOW (The Scottish Schools Intranet) to share my learning and experiences with colleagues across Scotland. I will also establish links with a school in France where children in our school will be able to share their learning and send emails to the children in France. This will be an exciting real life learning opportunity for the children to understand the culture and utilise their own French skills. Children will be able to see the value of learning languages and will appreciate and develop an enjoyment in learning languages.", null, "Wester Overton Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047423_coordinator"]]}}}}
