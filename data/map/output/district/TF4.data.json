The school views itself as agent for change and responsible for broadening the attitudes of both its staff and pupils in a global context.  All staff at the school view any learning experience as a shared and reciprocal one, purposefully benefiting all concerned. School leaders are keen to substantiate and further their knowledge of successful and recognised systems. Strategically our school culture embraces sharing of good practice and synthesises the vision of the Erasmus + programme in order to enhance the principles of unity  and dialogue across the education community.
