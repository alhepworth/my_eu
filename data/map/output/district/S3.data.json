The charity concludes that austerity measures taken during Europe\u2019s economic downturn have further contributed to snowballing poverty and unemployment. Five major trends characterizing the impact of the economic crisis across Europe are identified in the 68 pages \r\ndocument: the poor getting poorer; the \u2018new poor\u2019 spiraling into poverty; weakening health; a toughening stance on increasing migration; and a steep rise in unemployment. Young people are definitely the age group most affected by the present employment crisis:. In the 90's in UK, researchers mapped a new generational phenomenon, young people stuck at home with any involvement in education, employment and training the so-called NEET.  EUROSTAT's report  in 2016  sets Greece dramatically in the first place for NEET's, following by Italy, Bulgaria, Spain, Croatia, Romania. Young people aged (24 -29) who are into NEET status are at risk of becoming socially excluded, with income below the poverty-line and without the skills to improve their economic situation. The economic cost of not integrating NEETs is estimated at over \u20ac150 billion for the society. This phenomenon is tightly linked on early school leaving of the young people, the luck of their inclusion in the society, the poverty provoked by the economical crisis and the advent of migration .  Migrants reach 70% on  NEET's  status according to the  statistics of EUROFOUND. Although each country has its own economic and social conditions, but the access to education is first of all a matter of disparity. The EU commission recognizes NEET phenomenon and  Early School Leaving as priorities and issues  to solve in their strategy 2014-2020. \r\nOur partners as their countries are particularly hitted from this phenomenon decided to cooperate with us in order to find  together creative solutions for decrease these sad pole positions. \r\nThe  project ENJOY aims  to provide space and opportunity for 36 youth workers from 9 EU countries Greece, Italy,  Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Estonia, Croatia, Spain, UK and in a seven days training course  from 04-to 10 October 2017 to get to know more about methods, tools and techniques  to decrease this situation by empowering, inspiring and strengthening youth workers, young people that they will take part.\r\n In Tripoli,  Arcadia in a context of non formal education, we will create and invent new creative and participatory methods and training capabilities  by the help of experienced trainers and facilitators in order to support self \u2013 directed learning of participants, teaching them the main concepts and methods and will enable them to recruit young people to find job opportunities in these fields. Moreover, our project aims at strengthening  in this context and offers an exciting possibility to experience  as well a space to share, to experiment, to discuss and further develop such tools used within different activities  in the youth field (Forum Theater, living library, role play, etc).We believe that young people, after gaining necessary skills on entrepreneurship, learning how to design and set up Erasmus+ projects, being involved in a network not only they  would find descent jobs, but also they will be able to set up their own businesses in that fields. This requires to teach them what entrepreneurship is and how can they improve their abilities to work together in an intercultural environment . It seems that their disadvantaged position itself might be an excellent starting point to think of what this innovative product might be.

The 6 participants involved in the trainings are staff members and volunteers of ASPEA, working with different target groups from children to adults and in the different programs we run in our national branches - Lisbon, Aveiro, Porto, Viseu, Bragan\u00e7a and The Azores.\r\nThe coordinators of the programs will attend the 2 training workshops and the other 4 participants will attend just one of the trainings.

Mobility within these areas is complex as it involves multiple modalities of transport, multiple managing authorities, as well as several millions of citizens. The cost of inefficiency in transport and mobility are enormous. For example, inefficiency costs the UK economy \u20ac5.8 billion each year. \u20ac583 million is wasted on fuel (e.g. traffic congestion) alone each year, which attributes to increased urban pollution and CO2. Hold-ups to business or freight vehicles amounts to \u20ac1.5bn annually.\nMobility generates huge amounts of data thought thousands of sensors, city cameras, and connected cars, as well as millions of citizens connected through their mobile devices. If properly managed, this data can be used to understand, optimise and manage mobility and make it more efficient, sustainable and resilient. \nSETA will address this challenge, creating a technology and methodology able to use this wealth of data to change the way mobility is organised, monitored and planned in large metropolitan areas. The solution will be able to collect, process, link and fuse high-volume, high-velocity, multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, cross-media, cross-sectorial data and to use it to model mobility with a precision, granularity and dynamicity that is impossible with today\u2019s technologies.

With more than a billion of people organizing their lives electronically and sharing information via social platforms on the Internet and with the number of devices connected to the Internet already exceeding the number of people on earth and still growing to an estimated 50 billion devices by 2020, handling these massive amounts of data becomes a huge challenge.
