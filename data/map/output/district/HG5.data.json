The continuing education of these same people.\r\n\r\n- The ability to work in a team with the elected officials of our surroundings.\r\n\r\n- The desire to succeed and to be able to help the youth who participate in the mobility actions to use these experiences to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present document is the result of the long pratical working experience between 19 MFR and a partnership with another organization.

It will be of great value to the manufacturing, construction, waste disposal sectors, and emergency services. It will allow application of relatively inexpensive resources in a rapid manner, but with proper risk management. The automation and simplicity foreseen will allow an ease of use and therefore an uptake in use which will not only lead to wider control, but will also allow moderate production costs for the equipment - which uses many elements now emerging from other industries such as low cost lasers.
