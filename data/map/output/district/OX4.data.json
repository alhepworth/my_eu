This theme will be taken into Mesh and reflected in all aspects of the programme from the types of interactive workshops on offer, to food, through to the social programmes that run alongside the creative ones.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to give young people from different countries the opportunity to collaborate and share their work with young people from across Europe improving understanding and acceptance of different cultures and a step towards building community cohesion, through creativity, performance, debate and discussion and social activities. This will enable young people to respect and value democratic processes in relation to diversity by considering how young people feel about this in their own countries and in relation to Europe and the different cultural influences within it, reflecting on how a society and a culture see, create and record their experiences of the world.\r\n\r\n Together the young people will explore and develop a positive pragmatic European response to this principle transcending barriers and perceptions and opening doors to new understandings especially thinking about how the human rights principles of freedom, respect, equality and dignity are manifested or not. 40 young people many from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and some  from single parent and low income  families in the UK, Netherlands and France,  will take part in an 8 day and 6 day residential exchange which will include workshops, discussion groups, a structured social programme and practical hands-on tasks related to the daily management of the exchange.  Another component of the Exchange is the creative exploration of the theme through a variety of artistic expressions such as street theatre and parades, individual and collaborative performances and skills based workshops. Local community volunteers will contribute to daily practical support in areas such as catering and interpreting.\r\n\r\nIntegral to the exchange will be the nurturing and honing of the young people's creativity and ensemble working which requires the young people to be personally open yet also sensitive to the needs of the whole group in its cultural diversity, ensuring democratic processes are engaged in to make decisions and to give an equal voice to all. The young people will be supported to be creative and artistic risk takers encouraged to see these skills as transferable in all walks of life but especially in relation to creativity and \r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Exchange a full report will be written in collaboration with all the partners detailing the key outcomes  of the arts workshops, performances, discussion groups, debates, and any other relevant sessions.

It will be reflected in all aspects of the programmed activities. The 8-day exchange comprises daily creative International workshops in drama, dance, singing, costume design and making and fire juggling where the young people will create an epic street parade and outdoor performance. Presentation of performances in a range of languages, by the two exchange countries and other International groups, which the young people will reflect on, discuss and debate, focusing on cultural and social themes expressed in their mother tongue.  The young people will socialise, eat and live together for the duration of the exchange and practice speaking in a foreign language. Throughout the 8-days they will spend time in their own country groups reflecting on their learning, considering changes and developments they want to make during the exchange and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to give young people the opportunity to collaborate and share their work with others from across Europe, improving understanding and acceptance of diverse cultures and building community cohesion. This will enable young people to respect and value democratic processes in relation to diversity by considering how they feel about this in their own countries and in relation to their role in Europe, reflecting on how a society and a culture see, create and record their experiences of the world.\r\n\r\n Together the young people will explore and develop a positive pragmatic European response to this principle, transcending barriers and perceptions and opening doors to new understandings, especially thinking about how principles of freedom, respect, equality and dignity are manifested or not. 20 young people, many from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and some from single parent and low-income families in the UK and France, will take part in the exchange.  Local community volunteers will contribute to daily support. These are young adults from Grenoble and across Europe, who are keen to support the practical management of the exchange, using their foreign language skills as interpreters. Helping to ensure the participants are well hosted, meeting them and taking them to the various locations, giving administrative support to the Crearc group and helping with the smooth running of the Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes are:\r\n\u2022\tThe young people are more confident in communicating ideas in their mother tongue. \r\n\u2022\tThe young people have a greater ability to communicate in a foreign language.\r\n\u2022\tThe young people have an increased ability to motivate themselves and self-confidence in their ability to learn, develop and reflect.\r\n\u2022\tThe young people have more understanding, experience and empathy in relating to people who come from different social and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to look at the world in new ways.\r\n\u2022\tThe young people have increased confidence in expressing themselves creatively and sharing their own cultures through performance.\r\n\u2022\tThe MAC 2018 project will help the young people develop skills needed to increase their employment status and likelihood of going into further education and overall their lifestyle choices.\r\n\r\nA visual presentation of the MAC 2018 project will be made, with images, film, quotes and feedback and the young people will present this to invited youth organisations, International and twinning links and organisations and to the City leaders in Oxford and Grenoble.

Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

The consortium will develop Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentivirus (LV)- based tools for targeted and regulated gene transfer into different populations of CNS cells. The consortium will provide a selection of vectors that are optimized for different therapeutic approaches, e.g. regulated expression of neurotrophic factors or manipulation of neurotransmitter synthesis in specific neurons. NEUGENE has three major goals:1) targeting gene transfer vectors to specific populations of neurons and glia, by transcriptional regulation and miRNA-mediated de-targeting and by exploiting the cell-specific tropism of novel types of viral vectors, 2) tight control over expression levels of therapeutic genes by using regulated systems based on different principles, and 3) establishing the safety of the novel vector tools.
