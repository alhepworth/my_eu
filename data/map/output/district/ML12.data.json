As the participant has previously completed a Continuing Certificate of Education in Spanish, but has, so far had limited opportunity to teach it within her school, the course will enable the staff member to refresh and update her own linguistic skills and competence in Spanish as well as her abilities in the methodology of teaching and learning of a foreign language.  These skills can then be shared with the rest of the Modern Languages department, at whole school level and the associated Primary schools.  As part of the school\u2019s wider and long-term strategy of development, the school now wish to initially develop the Language for Life and Work they have implemented this year for senior pupils and also to introduce a taster course in Spanish for junior classes.  It is hoped that in time, Spanish can be established as a realistic option for pupils where they can gain Certification in the language, the same as French and German.  The course will complement the school\u2019s strategy for the 1+2 in accordance with the Scottish Government\u2019s policy and will also help to develop a sense of International Global Citizenship within our Learning Community.  The school will be able to raise the profile of languages and increase the intercultural awareness by strengthening links with fellow European colleagues and initiating international activities with partner schools.  As a direct result of the course the pupils will have increased choice in the languages being offered at Biggar High School and will also benefit from new teaching methods and resources, which will be incorporated into teaching and learning within the classroom.  It is hoped that over time, the staff and pupils of Biggar High School will forge positive and long-lasting relationships with other schools in both the UK and Europe, using ICT as a main method of communication.  Overall, the impact of this training will be hugely significant, both to the participant and the entire Biggar Learning Community.", "http://www.biggar.s-lanark.sch.uk", "Biggar High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012610_coordinator"]]}}, "6LT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "Tinto Primary School", 1573.0, 1, 1, "Background\r\nIn anticipation of reaching the Scottish Government's policy of 1+2 embedded modern languages in primary school by 2020, 2 teachers have already participated in long-term professional learning provided by LFEE. One of these teachers has committed to further develop their modern languages methodology to enhance their skills and provide our school with a lead member of staff as we progress to 2020.  \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nBy attending the immersion training in Lyon in October 2015 Annabel expects to gain a rigorous and engaging pedagogy for daily classroom use of French, enhanced understanding of French culture and life, the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue with colleagues and tutors,  access to high-quality modern resources for languages, and to make links with european and national partners. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants \r\nOne class teacher - Annabel Rodger - is applying to attend the immersion training.  Annabel has been teaching in primary for four years and has a previous higher qualification in French and a keen interest in modern languages. \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nAttendance on a week-long intensive immersion training in Lyon, France from 10-17 October 2015 to be run by LFEE. Instruction to include teaching methodology, professional perspectives on contemporary primary language learning, a trip to a local primary school, sharing practice and resources and French culture and contemporary life.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nIntensive language instruction to be delivered in French.\r\nWe see e-twinning as an important part of our approach to the new whole-school language learning and hope to provide children with real-life contexts for language learning to engage and motive all our learners. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nOur school is committed to a successful introduction of 1+2 and has already adopted this into our whole school planning to 2018. By attending this training Annabel will be up-skilled to become an in-house mentor, support, source of professional advice and a confident and highly-trained teacher in modern languages. Access to this training and resources will give all our staff and pupils the best educational experience possible in  French language and this will have a fantastic positive impact on our introduction of 1+2 languages within our school.\r\n\r\nPotential Longer term benefits\r\nWe see 1+2 as one of the most meaningful impacts on the Scottish primary curriculum and we are keen to see this flourish within our school. By engaging with the immersion training in 2015 we are clearly setting out on a well supported, resourced and trained path for our teaching staff to deliver the best modern languages education to our pupils.", "http://www.tinto-pri.s-lanark.sch.uk", "Tinto Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013217_coordinator"]]}}}}
