The participating school students and teachers from each country are already making preparations for the project meetings. Each school has chosen its own focus, individual to each country, and is organising collective learning activities for all participants.\r\nThe principle of the project meetings is that the school students from a variety of cultural and social environments get to know each other and learn from each other. By collaborative activities in European teams the school students learn to overcome language and cultural hurdles, to develop greater tolerance and to experience the joy of working together in heterogeneous teams. One significant aim of the project, linking many subjects, is that school students can become engaged in various interests that are linked by a common theme so that a real collective team spirit can develop. The overall aim, which will be realised at the conclusion of the project, will be an exhibition called \u201cPictures in motion\u201d.\r\nThe theme of air was chosen as it is extremely relevant for the environment yet is seen as a lesser priority in terms of environmental resources (eg Water). There are, however, many investigation opportunities in the stated subject areas and thereby many school students with a variety of interests and competences can become involved.\r\nOne of the aims is that this project will stimulate the personal development of the participating school students, that they will improve their professional and employment potential and that their life horizons will be broadened. Through intensive collective group work on the various aspects of the theme of Air the school students improve their subject knowledge and understanding, they broaden their linguistic abilities (English, French, German and Spanish) and they develop their creative talents. For the project ideas the school students will each, according to their preferences, present their project findings via their chosen medium (Video, sound, pictures, creation of web-pages and computer applications).\r\nA further aim is the enrichment of professional competences of the teaching staff involved through new challenges and activities, increased motivation and self confidence. During the project the ideas and results of the activities will be made available for colleagues in all schools so that these may be used as educational building blocks in schools. (see under results). Thereby the project will stimulate an improvement in teaching abilities in the schools.\r\nEach school will act as host school on one occasion and will organise learning activities for the participating school students that are specific to the theme of that school. Thus each school has its own individual focus for the successful completion of the project.  The project meetings involving the responsible coordinating teacher in each school will be held in one of the participating schools at the start, at the mid-point of the project and at the end of the project. Communication between the teachers from the participating schools will be guaranteed via the medium of the Moodle platform and via email contact. Contact between the participating school students will be via email contact as well and via social media networks.\r\nResults: display \u201cPictures in Motion\u201c, Applications for smartphones, production of an ongoing homepage, project booklets, artefacts involving Art, Music and Flight. The title \u201cPictures in Motion\u201d includes creative and informative realisation of the whole project in all participating countries in a digital framework. Long term uses: sustainable information via picture screens with overall information about the project and educational building blocks on the homepage and in the project booklets.\r\nThe participating schools and their planned activities:\r\nGoldberg High School Sindelfingen, General secondary school: Subject profile Art/Science, Technology and Languages, Experiments on the theme of pneumatics, cooperation with Bitzer Company, Art creations of air using various materials, display \u201cPictures in Motion\u201d; \r\nThe German school in Barcelona: General secondary school (High school and general secondary school), Musical aspects (Wind instruments); biodiversity  \r\nDronfield Henry Fanshawe School : General secondary school with Technology specialism.

What will your country look like in 20 years? What do you hope for? What are you afraid of?\u201d 42 young people aged 15-18 years from seven EU-countries to Sindelfingen. The young people come from Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. They are mostly from rural, structurally weak areas or from volatile schools located at the outskirts of their cities. The German group consists of youths whose families have taken asylum in Germany. In this intercultural youth exchange, the young people create a joint performance which they will perform twice publicly in a youth centre (\u201cJugendhaus. Treffpunkt f\u00fcr Jugendkultur\u201d) in Sindelfingen. \r\n\r\nContent of the young people`s joint action is to confront their own living conditions to the ones of youths of other European countries to create future prospects for a coexistence in solidarity within the European Community. For this, the young people will take the actual crisis within the European Community as a starting point. At the moment, national egoisms, supposed domestic needs and fears of financial losses gain influence all over the European communities. At the same time, common European aims and values are challenged. Our youth exchange wants to oppose this development. The aim is to strengthen the social cohesion and the European citizenship of the youth. Furthermore, we want to improve mutual understanding, solidarity and tolerance between them.\r\n\r\nFor this artistic interpretation, we choose a creative approach with elements of performing arts, metaphorical presentation and music. Thus, the young people get to know each other on a level of non-formal education: They perceive themselves sensitively, overcome their prejudices and learn to respect each other and to interact in a mutually respectful manner - regardless of race, nation, language, culture and social class.\r\nBy our creative approach we avoid discussions which often only reinforce existing prejudices and widen the social and cultural divisions. On the contrary, it allows young people to deal with the different lifestyles of all participants. Their social competence will increase as well as the ability to communicate with other people in an appropriate manner, especially with persons of different backgrounds. Furthermore the youths will build up knowledge on how to solve conflicts constructively.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of our project we ask all participants to create a drawing, painting or collage about the topic \u201cZur\u00fcck in die Zukunft \u2013 Back to the Future? What will your country look like in 20 years? What do you hope for? What are you afraid of?\u201d and send them to the drama teachers. We will provide those creative works to all young people in our intercultural exchange in November. On this basis, we will create improvisations and stories which will lead into a final joint performance.\r\nBased on this holistic creative process, young people will strengthen their cultural expression. They will become adept in showing each other the national, cultural, social and creative characteristics of their country\u2019s people and therefore strengthen the awareness of the European citizenship. As a result we expect that for the solution of the European crisis they will overcome national egoisms and be able to seriously develop creative future scenarios for a solidary European Community and to spread it into their home countries.\r\n\r\nAs we know from experience, during the constant feedback process within the exchange, the youths recognize that these shared learning processes are possible only within a Europe of Solidarity. Especially in times of a growing number of Eurosceptics, we believe that it is important especially for young people, to let them experience that a model of a united Europe is possible and to reassure this believe to the general public.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015369_2"], [2016, "GRENZERFAHRUNGEN - BORDERLINE EXPERIENCES.

The citizens suffered heavily from the devastating consequences of the terrible years of war. In many parts of Europe, civilization and society were collapsed. Nothing was the way it was before and because of the great numbers of refugees, many communities hat to change or the groups of refugees had to settle down in new areas. \r\n\r\nNevertheless \u2013 or perhaps even because of this situation \u2013 the idea of a joint and peacful Europe rose again. This time, the pioneers of the European idea had the hope that international cooperation could reduce or even prevent wars and the escalation of violence in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cThe big BLACKOUT. What, if everything changes? Social blueprints of our living together within the European community from the perspective of young people\u201d wants to take up this thought. The participating youth - all in all 36 persons from Germany, Great Britain, France, Latvia, Poland and Hungary - get the exercise to imagine a situation where their social fabric changes, a situation where neither social networks as Facebook, nor television or telephones work any more. The young people should imagine to live in a completely changed situation.\r\n\r\nIn working on a joint performance, the participants will get to know the dependences of civilization and become aware of the fact that their possessions and circumstances of life can not be taken for granted. They will deal with the different moral concepts of their countries and with the difficulty of social processes. They will experience the core values of the European society and become aware of the privileges of the European Union and the great value of long-lasting peace. \r\n\r\nThe German group consits of young refugees \u2013 inter alia from Syria or Kosovo \u2013, some of them had to experience the consequences of war and destruction by themselves. The other participants, who know war just from their history lessons or from the media, will get a very intensive insight into the suffering of people of their same age. At the same time, the young refugees will be integrated into a social network of European youth and get the chance to increase their self-confidence by working together on the performance. Hopefully they will also get new perspectives for their future. This shall be achieved both by the joint working on the performance and by so called \"Eat-culture-evenings\".\r\n\r\nThis project within the ERASMUS+ programme \u201cYouth mobility\u201d aims to show the youth the intrinsic values of their European citizenry so that they both develop an understanding for their own role in history and become active European Union\u2019s citizens.\r\nIt contributes to the development of solidarity and in promoting tolerance of young people and therefore strengthens the social cohesion between people of different cultures within the European Union. With its topic and methodology the project promotes the European core values of freedom, democracy, human rights and peace.\r\nThrough our holistic methodology the youth will develop and present to one another different social models within the creative process of working ton the performance. Within the joint work for the performance to the topic \u201cThe big BLACKOUT\u201d, there will happen a very concrete and intensive experience regarding the above-mentioned priorities.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012695_3"], [2014, "\"An einem Samstag im April: Jugendkulturen in Europa\"", "Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School", 14234.0, 6, 7, "Idea of the project: With this project we  focus on young people and their so called \"youth culture\". The joint work shall aim at a better understanding between and knowledge of the youths and their respective culture, to set reflection process in motion and to offer the young people new options.\r\n\r\nPreparation of the project: All young people who take part in this project write some kind of diary at the weekend of 26th and 27th April (short texts: at the morning, noon, evening and night) and make a comic, foto-story or collage. The texts should be sent in one of the following languages: German, English or French.\r\n\r\nCarrying out of the project: We will send the documents of the youths to the responsible persons in the different twin cities until 15th May - as basis for the performance that will be worked out by the youths together with two professional theatre pedagogues in July. At the last day of the action this performance will be presented to the public.\r\n\r\nThe main effects we hope to achieve with our international EU project \"An einem Samstag im April: Jugendkulturen in Europa\" are understanding, respect and friendship of the young people of six nations of which more than the half come from sections of society with low levels of academic achievement and often socially disadvantaged backgrounds. We want to show that differences in language and culture don't mean differentiation but an incentive to talk to each other, get to know the different cultures and ways of life and to compare them in the different forms and contents of the youth cultures in Europe. It will be an extraordinary experience for the youths to understand each other without interpreters and to create a performance together. We are convinced that this project will improve their self-esteem and make them curious to encounters with youths from other countries.", "http://www.dronfield.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE04-KA105-000375_4"]]}}}}
