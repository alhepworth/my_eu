However, to date very little is known of how this link varies with advancing age, and no model exists to explain the relationship.

Contrary to traditional studies of social communication, I will employ an interdisciplinary approach that links theory and practice from cognitive, social, developmental, and clinical (neuro)psychology to study the relationship between ToM and EF across a broad and dynamic age range (10 to 80\\ yrs old).

A major trend in medical imaging is to improve the contrast and access to structural information. Polarisation is a key parameter in this respect. Molecular orientation and microstructural shape are often connected to the degree of the disease. Although polarisation can provide a wealth of relevant information, very few techniques have made it from the lab to the market.\nThe present fellowship is directed to the most exhaustive polarimetric technique, the complete Mueller polarimetry. This technique can analyse the polarization state of backscattered or transmitted light as a function of illuminating light polarization. The object-to-be-investigated microstructure can alter the polarization state in three possible ways: diattenuation, retardance and depolarization. Since 2007 the fellow has been developing a unique Snapshot Mueller polarimeter (SMP) which opens novel avenues in interrogating the polarisation properties. The fellowship aims at advancing the provision of complete Mueller matrix information in at least two technological directions: (i) building a Swept-Source SMP (3SMP) to increase the acquisition speed of the SMP by using recent advances in the field of optical coherence tomography, (ii) devising hand held 3SMP configurations by applying principles of coherence gating.

The proposed Research Master aims to fill this gap and aims to offer a broad range of expertise and research specialisms which are essential for a genuinely international programme.The partners involved in developing  the Research Master in European and International Criminology all have an ample, albeit different research and teaching expertise in the field of border-crossing, security and social justice. The main aim of the Strategic Partnership is bringing this expertise together and developing a balanced and innovative curriculum with a number of common activities and courses (mainly in the field of global criminology, research methods and transferable skills)and optional courses in order to provide the possibility to follow different tracks. In addition, ReMEIC will include innovative, interactive teaching methods, in which the strengths of both face-to-face student-lecturer contact, informal learning and social media are optimised. The ReMEIC project will result in the following Intellectual Outputs:IO1. Courses of the Research Masters programmeIO2. Stakeholder based Guidebook for Research CooperationIO3. Guidelines for organisation of the 1-day workshop (prior to Common Session), including innovative educational methodsIO4. HEI Quality Plan In addition, two Multiplier Events will be organised.The programme is embedded in a wider network of collaborating organisations, ensuring the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders from the sector (e.g. potential employers, field organisations, policy makers). The programme will contribute to improving the quality of higher education in the field of criminology, and will educate a new group of experts capable to address the current issues faced by Europe. The new Research Master will provide them with unique career prospectives, enabling them to work in an international environment and in different sectors.", "http://www.kent.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA203-022922_1"], [2016, "Inclusion of refugees through sport", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT", 168643.0, 5, 7, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUNDThe last year has seen a huge and unprecedented influx of refugees and migrants into Europe. In the face of this crisis, governments have largely not succeeded in finding pan-European solutions, relying instead on national approaches. This project will take a different approach by aiming to strengthen European cooperation in the field of adult learning to enhance inclusion of refugees at the level of civil society organisations. Successful inclusion of the high number of refugees into the European societies is an ongoing agenda that will demand commitment and solutions in the longer term. It is the premise of this project that sport and physical activity organisations in particular, as the biggest civil society sector in the world, can play an important role in providing learning opportunities and taking a holistic approach to successful inclusion of refugees into the European societies. When engaging in sport and physical activities, participants for instance acquire positive life skills, attitudes and values. Moreover, non-formal educational and training activities carried out by sports organisations further enhance leadership and organisational skills and can make important contributions to the learning, self-esteem and, ultimately, employability of the individual participants involved. OBJECTIVES AND OUTPUTSThe Inclusion of Refugees through Sport project has as its overall aim to strengthen the societal inclusion of refugees via the informal and non-formal learning opportunities sport and physical activities provide. The specific objectives areObjective 1: To build the knowledge base for informal and non-formal learning opportunities for societal inclusion of refugees via physical activities and sport Objective 2: To build capacities in participating organisations and develop tools to deliver informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the target groupObjective 3: To establish and run a broad thematic network of organisations working in the fieldObjective 4: To disseminate results and widen the impact of the projectObjective 5 (management objective): To ensure quality in the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the projectThe proposed project will deliver five specialised Intellectual Outputs: A Good Practices Collection with examples from the field (including key principles that are characteristics of a successful practice); A Grundtvig Video for refugees to learn lifelong principles of active participation in civic society activities; An online learning resource for staff and volunteers in grassroots sport organisations to learn about ways of integrating refugees through their activities; A supporting Toolkit; and A Networking Platform for these organisations to meet and collaborate. After the project has ended, the partner organisations will be able to use the results to train staff and volunteers in their own organisations and thus enhance their own capacities further.PARTICIPANTS AND TARGET GROUPThe International Sport and Culture Association (ISCA) will lead the coordination of the project, and the cross-sector partnership consortium includes the University of Kent and StreetGames (UK), SISU Idrottsutbildarna (Sweden), UISP (Italy), Ollerup Academy of Physical Education (Denmark) and Deutsche Turnerjugend (Germany). The direct target group of the project is the organisations and entities (and the individuals in them) that provide opportunities for engaging in grassroots sport and physical activity. At least 22 organisations will form a network by the end of the project and test the project\u2019s resources before they are disseminated.The ultimate target group of the project is refugees that have arrived in Europe. Since the handling and status of refugees, including their availability to engage in various civic actions differ a lot between the different European member states, the project will from the outset take an inclusive approach to defining the target group. As the project progresses, learnings are expected to emanate as to how various subsets of the ultimate target group can engage in the learning opportunities provided in the grassroots sport setting. It is expected that approximately 4900 refugees will be directly involved in the project\u2019s activities.IMPACTThe project aims to maximise the impact on the target group by increasing the capacity of the grassroots sport organisations that can reach out and provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities, with a starting point in the project consortium. By creating a platform for continued and expanded organisational collaboration on this emerging issue, the project will also impact further organisations and thus potentially impact the systemic level by showcasing and enabling the grassroots sport sector to deliver relevant, informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the inclusion of refugees to achieve wider societal benefits.", "http://www.kent.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA204-022362_3"], [2018, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT", 107507.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

But that requires getting to know and to learn about cultural and geographical facts in advance. That is what we are planning to do in our transnational teaching and learning activities.\r\n\r\nThe following transnational meetings are planned:\r\n   o  three meetings of all teachers to get to know and fix the project; to create a brochure; to evaluate and discuss a new common project\r\n\r\n   o four Project meetings with students and teachers (working on the project )\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents, also those who are not taking part, will get an impression of the foreign country by giving them audio-visual information about the given tasks.\r\n\r\nThe teachers will help the students in finding local firms that offer factory tours to learn about the different jobs. They keep records of the results via photographs and written reports.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they learn about nature and culture of the country by visiting families and going on sightseeing tours.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impacts:\r\n\r\n- Geographical, cultural, economic knowledge about the partner countries\r\n- Awareness of  Lifelong Learning is essential especially nowadays \r\n- contact to peer groups in Europe on digital Media e. g. Facebook, Skype, whatsapp, ...) brings a rapid exchange of new developments and living situations \r\n- Developing an awareness and willingness for the mobility in an integrating Europe in education, training and vocation\r\n- Improvement of personal skills (e. g. initiative, purposefulness and flexibility.)\r\n- Cross-cultural openness that also preserves their own cultural identity\r\n- Better chances in future professional life\r\n- Contribution to a peaceful coexistence\r\n- Awareness of a multicultural citizen\r\n- Lifelong Learning\r\n- improvement of  language skills (employee, staff)\r\n- Increased employees' self-initiative as a key competence\r\n- Establishment of European contacts beyond the school project \r\n- maybe European cooperation of firms\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sustainability of results:\r\n- other schools in the field of the project partners can benefit from the experience by seeking similar projects or use the results in their teaching\r\n- local firms benefit from the higher qualification which is possible as a result of the international commitment of the school.\r\n- using the example of the project, local public will be informed about interesting progresses at an European level (leaflet)\r\n- students with good school-leaving qualifications will become well qualified employees\r\n- Weak students are motivated to leave school with a good qualification\r\n- local firms become more competitive and strengthen their respective regions\r\n- Presence of the participating schools by publications and project pr\u00e4sentations\r\n\r\nThe project is an example for succsessful cooperation in Europe.

It has been recognised nationally for it's sport and vocational learning.\r\n\r\nThe Canterbury Academy is one of a select number of providers of the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) identified and selected by the National Governing Body - Basketball England. AASE is a vocational sports performance programme. It provides a structured training and development route across a number of sports for talented young athletes (aged 16-19), who have a real chance of excelling in their sport; either by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract.  The basketball academy is a partnership between The Canterbury Academy and Kent Crusaders Basketball Club.\r\n\r\nThe project is intended to enhance the quality of vocation learning, training and development for 16-19 year old apprentices on the AASE programme. The objectives, are to increase the opportunities for the apprentices to learn and develop with both their sporting potential and their vocational qualification while opening up potential employment and further education pathways for them.\r\n\r\nThe 3 strategic objectives for this trip are\r\n\r\n1. Educating the apprentices on the wide variety of opportunities available through this field while simultaneously exposing them to the level of competition they will face for these positions - both as professional players and for wider careers within basketball.\r\n\r\n2.
