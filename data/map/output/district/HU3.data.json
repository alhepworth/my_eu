Particular anxieties exist about the social disengagement of those with differing cultural, social and religious backgrounds and the difficulties in addressing this through education by traditional means. These concerns have been heightened by international terrorism and high-profile extremist events.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background young people from communities with different  religious or cultural identities can find it difficult to identify, engage with or be welcomed into an inclusive sense of citizenship in their host society and may not acquire a sense of inclusive citizenship which embraces Europe comfortably. The need for a contemporary and more inclusive conception of European citizenship and a wider participatory democracy has been increasingly noted both in EU policy and more widely.\r\n\r\nHowever the desire to develop a stronger, more cohesive sense of European and national citizenship by implementing Citizenship Education in schools has met with limited success. The intentions for citizenship education are sometimes contested and misunderstood, its delivery may make little reference to significant local and national issues and how politicians, the media and the wider society deal with these and in many schools, colleges and universities the general provision for citizenship education is inadequate. Teachers often find the topic problematic to teach, due to poor knowledge, inadequate training or resources and pedagogy that do not strongly engage young people. \r\n\r\nThere is growing recognition that European citizenship education needs to be more about engaging and empowering individuals and less about the study of academic content, citizenship duties, the institutions of government, or citizenship as social compliance and contribution. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to develop educational practices and innovative digital resources to allow young people in secondary, further and higher education to explore, develop and practice citizenship in a safe environment representing real-world contexts that deal with issues of direct relevance to them, their lives and their growth as European citizens in a pluralistic democracy. It will achieve this by using new and emerging digital technologies (including virtual reality) that are popular with and attractive to young people and motivate them to participate and therefore sustain their involvement. Research has shown that the imaginative use of ICT can, if used  appropriately, change long-held and culturally deep-rooted views and that the use of immersive virtual environments is effective in developing self-perception and a renewed sense of identity.\r\n\r\nExperts in citizenship, digital technology and educational pedagogy from nine educational institutions including primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities and organisations involved in training and teacher education from across Europe work together in this project, together with their students, to create a toolkit of innovative digital resources and a library of guidelines, manuals and training packages for educators. These will provide teachers, lecturers and trainers with the skills and resources to better engage their students to develop a stronger sense of European citizenship and understand and embrace the shared values underpinning modern democratic societies.\r\n\r\nThe resources will also include scenarios, responses and reflections on these by young people and because of their authenticity these will enhance their impact on citizenship education and create high credibility for the project outcomes. The resources will be extensively tested and widely distributed and enable educators to acquire the necessary skills to develop further resources using the training and guidelines the project will provide.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be to enhance the skills, knowledge and resources of educators to help them teach European citizenship in a more effective and engaging way that will motivate and inspire them and their students to create a deeper sense of European citizenship that identifies and embraces common democratic values to promote social inclusion and harmony. The project will also increase the acquisition of the digital skills, literacies and competencies of educators and students that are essential for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of the project will be to: identify what motivates young people and individuals with differing cultural, religious, political and social backgrounds and heritages to engage with citizenship education; promote greater engagement with public and political life; encourage informed debate to facilitate a deeper understanding of the concerns and values of other social, cultural and ethic groups; promote greater social inclusion, harmony and individual well being; and enhance the digital skills and competencies of citizens.", "http://www.hymerscollege.co.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036710_5"]]}}, "2BN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1346457600000, 1488240000000, "Smart wearable and autonomous negative pressure device for wound monitoring and therapy", "Smith & Nephew Medical Limited", "SWAN-iCARE is an ambitious project aiming at developing an integrated autonomous device for the monitoring and the personalized management of chronic wounds, mainly diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers.

For that reason EGFR mutations analysis should be perform to support the treatment decision for a patient with NSCLC. Despite all the foreseen benefits of EGFR genotyping, the current PCR-based methods used have been shown some associated bottlenecks: i) use of complex samples (tumour biopsy embedded in Formalin Fixed Paraffin, FFPE), ii) require a better understanding from the clinical geneticist to accurately interpret the information provided and to setup the best line of therapy and treatment and iii) the assays are quite expensive and time-consuming. New age diagnostic tools, such as microfluidic platforms and nanodiagnostics are emerging technologies for DNA analysis requiring lower sample volumes and providing comparable sensitivity and specificity at lower costs.

This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 36 Hull Tigers apprentices (aged from 16 to19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Austria. The Austrian host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Austrian and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur host partner, Obertraun, was chosen on the basis of them being an acknowledged European Centres of Excellence and can demonstrate clear evidence of a mobility support structure for prospective participants.

This project seeks to achieve the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Exchange player development expertise ranging from youth to professional levels.\r\n\u2022 Assist technology transfer and exchange of culture, life experiences and work practices between English and Portuguese players.\r\n\u2022 Identify new trends in team preparation and team tactical play which could be of value to Hull Tigers apprentices in terms of enhancing personal development and skills acquisition among participants. \r\n\u2022 Allow apprentice mobility participants to study at club level how Portuguese players are developed in their technical skills and how Portuguese coaching innovations could be adopted and introduced player education pathways at Hull Tigers to further improve the technical and tactical abilities of the participants.\r\n\r\nAs part of the youth players development plan Hull City FC aim to give younger players more exposure to competing internationally within Europe. Hull City FC see Erasmus+ as a key element in the new Mobility Strategy which will increase in the next three years the number of staff and players engaging in and benefiting from some sort of mobility experience.  By observing and interacting with players from a variety of top tier Portuguese Football Clubs our players will see first-hand the advanced skills and techniques, both on and off the pitch, that the clubs have which allow them to excel at the game and compete on an international level. Our players will be encouraged to adopt as many of these strong practices as they can, relative to their own skillset, and to share their findings with fellow players at the club, from grassroots level to the first team.\r\n\r\nHull Tigers is dependent for long term survival on youth development to provide first team players. A major impact of KA1 learner mobility will be an increase in employability for participants in the professional football and football-related fields and we aspire to attain levels of employability for our apprentices that are approaching those found in other European countries.\r\n\r\nBetter skills levels and improved vocational qualifications will also facilitate improved prospects for secondary careers if participants are not offered a professional contract. As a direct consequence of mobility, Hull Tigers apprentices will gain a significant advantage in the job market, while also adding language and cultural skills to their vocational repertoire.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway.", "http://www.hullcitytigers.com", "Hull City Tigers Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047261_coordinator"]]}}}}
