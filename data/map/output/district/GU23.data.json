It boasts an infinite number of floors, an infinite number of rooms, and the ability to cater to the comfort of any creature who walks through its doors. In fact, it\u2019s the only inter-dimensional holiday destination with an infinite-star rating on TripAdvisor.  You are the Infinite Hotel\u2019s trainee elevator operator. Your job consists mainly of ferrying visitors and deliveries from floor to floor and fulfilling the occasional favour or customer request. Easy peasy.But all is not easy nor peasy in this idyllic resort... in a hotel where nothing ever goes wrong, things begin to go wrong in Titanic proportions. There\u2019s an \u201cinfestation\u201d - a toxic black goo that appears to be consuming large parts of the hotel, but nobody seems to want to talk about it, or even acknowledge it, least of all your boss. But when the goo becomes too much for the hotel to ignore any longer, it's time to take action and get to the bottom of it - figuratively and literally.The Infinite Hotel will be an unpredictable, character-driven, vertical VR adventure taking place almost entirely inside an elevator.Why an elevator? One of VR\u2019s biggest hurdles is creating the believable illusion of size and distance that a true exploratory adventure deserves. By confining the player (horizontally) to the elevator and the small patch of space just outside the doors, the \"infinite\" vertical movement, the multitude of baffling characters and their interweaving stories will make it feel as though the adventure is coming to the player in a natural way.The Infinite Hotel combines the addictive task fulfilment mechanics of games like Job Simulator, the inadvertent (and persistent) character repercussions of Papers Please, the narrative hallmarks of a compelling dark comedy, and a sense of boundless scale... all from inside a 5-foot square.", "http://www.italicpig.com", "ITALIC PIG LIMITED", "creative_589476-CREA-1-2017-1-UK-MED-DEVVG_coordinator"], [1395705600000, 1506211200000, "Mona Lisa", "ITALIC PIG LIMITED", 97632.0, 1, 1, "Leonardo Da Vinci was a painter, sculptor, architect, mathematician, anatomist, engineer and inventor \u2013 perhaps the most talented man who ever lived. All these talents culminated in his greatest work: the Mona Lisa. Not the painting, though\u2026 the girl.Mona Lisa is a Renaissance robot.Her inner-workings are an intricate collection of ropes, pulleys and springs, housed inside a marble exoskeleton, lovingly painted with an enigmatic smile. Far from a stiff, jerky bundle of crude gears and flywheels, she\u2019s a work of engineering perfection: smooth, graceful and incredibly sneaky.Sneaky is important in her line of work: she\u2019s an art thief.Part Lara Croft, part Inspector Gadget, Mona is spring-loaded with inventive surprises and witty bravado. As James Bond needs Q, Mona Lisa uses the contraptions of Leonardo Da Vinci to vault impenetrable defenses, avoid detection, forge 60-second masterpieces and concoct death-defying getaways. When the spoils of a seemingly harmless Vatican heist rattle Leonardo to his core, Mona goes off-mission and embarks on a self-motivated journey of curiosity that takes her all over the 15th century globe: Genoa, Castile, Ottoman Empire, Royal Prussia, and as far as Columbus's new India. During her travels, she needs to hijack secrets from the likes of  Michelangelo, Raphael, Vesalius & Copernicus, outwit Pope Innocent the VIII, stay one step ahead of Nostradamus, and save the entire planet as the Scientific Revolution ushers in a literal New World Order.As well, she soon discovers she\u2019s not the only robot out there\u2026 she is pursued relentlessly across the globe by a tall, pale stranger \u2013 the animatronic Statue of David - and eventually finds herself in a climactic showdown against the Vitruvian Man \u2013 a freakish, eight-limbed superhuman come to life.Mona Lisa is a narrative-driven stealth adventure through the European Renaissance, with unique paint-based puzzle solving, all wrapped in a classical art style.", "http://www.italicpig.com", "ITALIC PIG LIMITED", "creative_565174-CREA-1-2015-1-UK-MED-DEVVG_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "ITALIC PIG LIMITED", 109032.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_46746"]]}}}}
