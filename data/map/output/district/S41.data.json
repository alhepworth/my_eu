Eurofound\u2019s report on youth entrepreneurship in Europe indicates that 48 % of European youth are interested in becoming entrepreneurs, and 41 % believe this is also possible. Still, in 2013, only 6,5 % of young Europeans were self-employed (Eurofound, 2015). This indicates that within Europe\u2019s youth there is an entrepreneurial spirit, but many young Europeans lack knowledge, skills and empowerment to pursue their ideas.\r\n\r\nInterCollege and its partners recognise that these features are vital, however, they are also intangible. The partners notice a stigma attached to failing as an entrepreneur, making youth less inclined to take the necessary risks. Also, young potential entrepreneurs often lack experience, and they can benefit from the know-how of experienced entrepreneurs. Thus, the partners strongly believe that under the right conditions, youth who are motivated to realise their innovative ideas can develop the necessary competences and be empowered to pursue self-employment.\r\n\r\nAs such, it is the responsibility of non-formal trainers to promote entrepreneurship among youth. To do that they will need a proper and informed skill-set. Therefore, the partners want to arrange a YE where youth with an entrepreneurial spirit, mentored by experienced entrepreneurs, can get a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship and a CME where the partners will help each other explore tangible ideas and create concrete projects to promote youth entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to utilise the already existing entrepreneurial spirit among youth by creating an environment where young entrepreneurs can flourish and grow.\r\n\r\nThe aim will be reached through the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an expectation-free environment where young people can be supported to develop and test their entrepreneurial ideas;\r\n2. Create concrete project proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit amongst youth through utilising best practices of the partners and results of the YE;\r\n3. Offer reflections upon own and partners' potential to create visibility, dissemination, exploitation and local impact of projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of the following activities:\r\n\r\nActivity A1 is a YE based upon the concept of an entrepreneurship incubator, gathering 24 young people who are highly motivated about entrepreneurship and has expressed a desire to participate actively in the exchange, as well as 6 youth leaders with at least one year's experience. The activity uses different non-formal methods to develop the skills, attitudes and knowledge of young people to develop and implement own business ideas. During the YE the participants will be mentored by experts within the field of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nActivity A2 is a CME gathering 43 participants who are non-formal educators/youth leaders working at the partner organisations. Following visits to a local enterprises and non-formal sessions and discussions on the importance and relevance of non-formal education and the results from the YE, the participants will cooperate to create concrete proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit among youth through international projects designed within the framework of the E+ Programme. Participants should further represent their organisations through presentations, organisational speed-dating and through own activities.\r\n\r\nThe partners expect that as a result of this project, the young people participating on the YE become motivated to take the necessary risks and become socially responsible entrepreneurs. Moreover, the youth leaders will gain tools and methods to motivate youth in their communities and promote an entrepreneurial spirit, and the participants on the CME will produce at least 6 concrete project proposals promoting entrepreneurship among youth that will be implemented by the participating organisations to the benefit of local youth.\r\n\r\nAlso, the CME will establish lasting partnerships between the participating organisations. The participants and the organisations they represent will be inspired by each other and introduced to new perspectives on entrepreneurship, youth, non-formal educationwhich will strengthen their capacity to promote youth entrepreneurship and reach out to young people in their local communities.\r\n\r\nThus, on the long term, this project will potentially benefit local societies in the 15 countries that the partners are located in, as they will gain more young entrepreneurs who, as active citizens will fight youth unemployment and foster development.

A particular category of population who have suffered from the financial crisis in Europe are a great number of adults who lost their jobs and could not afterwards meet the needs of the labour market. \r\n\r\nInterCollege Norge sees it as its role to build capacity of young adults to increase their own employability locally, nationally and on European level by offering adults intercultural learning in order to enhance their adaptability in an international environment and  by strengthening their capacity of mobility. \r\n\r\nIt is the belief of InterCollege Norge that  the benefits of developing the intercultural competences of individuals through adult education are twofold. Firstly, it is an essential element in safeguarding an inclusive, tolerant local society and an international society based on solidarity and cooperation. Secondly, it is a much needed component in ensuring the employability of people in an increasingly global environment.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to strengthen the capacity of InterCollege Norge to provide adult educational activities.\r\n\r\nThe aim will be achieved through the following objectives:\r\n- to offer best practices and methods for providing training courses among adult learners;\r\n- to provide best practices in project management;\r\n- to gain practices, inspirations and tools to provide intercultural learning among adult learners;\r\n- to gain practices, inspirations and tools to promote active participation and citizenship among adult learners.\r\n\r\nFor the job shadowing, the selected participant will be a key staff member of InterCollege Norge, notably a member of the management team. The participant will have already gained experience within project management, and adult educational activities and have a good understanding of the context in which the applicant organisation works. They will have a clear expectation upon their expected learning outcomes and be motivated to exploit the potential of the activity with regards to gaining competences and experiences required for forefronting the organisation's development plan.\r\n\r\nWith reagards to the short term staff training courses a total of 6 staff will be selected to participate. They will have some experience and knowledge within the field of adult education and/or intercultural learning. They will be motivated to further strengthen their competences and gain new experiences and disseminate these within the applicant organisation.\r\n\r\nActivity A2 involves 6 short term mobilities whereby the participants will each attend a 10-day structured training course provided by InterCollege ApS and InterCollege (UK). Three courses have been identified as being highly relevant to the development needs of the applicant.\r\n\r\nThrough participating in the mobility activities outlined in this project proposal, the participants will gain invaluable competences in order to implement innovative and effective adult education activities in their local community. They will gain new inspirations and motivation to promote change through learning. Due to the intercultural nature of the activities they will develop a stronger intercultural understanding and awareness, a wider sense of community and a sense of European identity.\r\n\r\nSince the participants of this activity are directly involved in the applicant organization, their newly gained and developed skills, knowledge, and attitudes will be great assets to the organization.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.casahotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_8"], [2016, "Vocational training abroad \u2013 Learning for the future", "Casa Hotels", 193211.0, 8, 11, "Internationalization is very important for the municipality of Eskilstuna, Sweden, and its schools.   For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

Participating in the project is also a group of students with special needs.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are many objectives of a project like this, and for the students it involves both professonal ones and personal ones.  The 72 students that we'd like to send abroad will get training in their respective field, training that corresponds to the objectives in the our national curriculum.  \r\n\r\nOur goal is also that the students develop on a personal level, as a result of intercultural learning.  Since our students change country for a while, meet and cooperate with people who speak a different language and who have different backgrounds but work in the same field. they get a larger intercultural understanding.   This kind of project gives the students an increased knowledge of foreign languages, and it promotes the study of languages. \r\n\r\nWe want the students to spread information about their experiences doing vocational training abroad, to inspire other students to do the same.  All kinds of international cooperation is beneficial on different levels.

The more positive contact we have with people from other cultures and countries and the more international projects we run the better.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen earlier that the students get increased selfconfidence when they do vocational training abroad, which is very important for their future,  It helps them to complete their studies and possibly start new ones.  Drop-outs is an increasing problem both in Sweden and the rest of Europe and this kind of project can increase the students' motivation to get an education.  The project can also have a positive impact on their belief in themselves to apply for jobs and possibly make them more inclined to look for work somewhere else.  They see that they can handle working far away from home, or they get curious about doing something like this from listening to their friends sharing their experiences.  This is important since unemployment is an increasing problem and it would be positive if young people would be willing to move to other cities or sometimes other countries to find work.

The development of lignin-based CF is still in laboratory scale and material properties meeting high-quality product demands is the main challenge. Now a new technology in commercial operation makes it possible to produce lignin with new properties, higher purity and with less impact on the pulp mill operation. The idea is to tailor kraft lignin properties already in the lignin separation/upgrading and optimise the lignin for target automotive applications. The consortium has unique competence through the complete value chain to realise this new concept.", 150607.0, 2179638.0, 4, 10, "GreenLight", null, "http://www.netcomposites.com", null, "h2020_197310_998510823"], [1420070400000, 1530316800000, "\u201cNanocomposite for building constructions and civil infraestructures: European network pilot production line to promote industrial application cases.\u201d", "Netcomposites Limited", "NANOLEAP project aims at the development of a coordinated network of specialized pilot lines for the production of nanocomposite based products for different civil infrastructure and building applications.\nThe goal of this infrastructure is to support the research activities of European SMEs in the Construction sector in nanocomposite products enabling the progress of the product to next steps of technology deployment such as installation of industrial pilot lines and enter in the commercialization stage.\nFor the creation of the NANOLEAP project pilot line network, the most promising applications of polymeric nanocomposites in the construction and engineering sector have been selected.

Despite the current relatively high cost of nano-enabled products, their use in construction materials is likely to increase because of highly valuable properties imparted at relatively low additive ratios, rapid development of new applications and decreasing cost of base MNMs as they are produced in larger quantities.\nThus the use of nano-products in the construction industry is a reality and can be expected to grow in the near future. Consequently, there is a general uncertainty with respect to health and safety risks and how to properly manage them to protect workers and be in compliance with OHS legislation.\nSCAFFOLD is an industrial oriented idea specifically addressed to provide practical, robust, easy-to-use and cost effective solutions for the European construction industry, regarding current uncertainties about occupational exposure to MNMs.  This will be achieved by introducing a new paradigm to improve workers protection against NMs in construction, based on a novel holistic Risk Management approach (RMM).\nThe aim of the SCAFFOLD project is to develop, test, validate and disseminate a new holistic, consistent and cost effective Risk Management Model (RMM) to manage occupational exposure to MNMs in the construction sector.
