This number will increase 4-fold in people > 70 years in 2050. Diabetes results in a high personal and social health burden, and a significant public health burden in terms of rising healthcare costs. Diabetes is associated with increased functional decline in older people and may explain up to 20% of their excess risk of disability. Our project focuses on the use of interventions to improve functional status and enhance quality of life. This is justified because there has been a lack of intervention studies in this population and improvements in function and well-being may be of more clinical benefit in older patients than attention to metabolic control alone.\nThe MID-FRAIL STUDY is a Phase IIb open randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-modal intervention (optimizing medical management, resistance-based exercise program and educational/nutritional intervention) in 1,704 frail or pre-frail subjects \u2265 70 years with T2D to prevent functional decline and maintain or improve quality of life and its associated costs.\nThis approach is original (both the intervention and outcomes are unique for studies in diabetes), relevant (it concerns 25% of people with diabetes), pertinent and feasible.\nThe project is highly aligned with objectives pursued by two topics of this call: investigator-driven clinical trials in elderly populations (HEALTH 2011 2.2.2-1) and in diabetes complications (HEALTH.2011.2.4.3-1).\nThe study aims to demonstrate a reduction of 20% in that risk, which will mean an annual prevention of around 700,000 incident cases of some disability in old people, with a major impact on global quality of life and financial costs.

Disability is usually preceded by a condition named frailty that encompasses changes associated with ageing, life styles and chronic diseases. To detect and intervene on it is of outstanding importance to prevent disability, as recovery from disability is unlikely. Recent documents stress the necessity of testing the clinical utility (in terms of risk prediction, diagnosis validity and prognostic significance) of the existing definition of frailty by using combinations of clinical criteria (current definition) and lab Biomarkers (BMs).\nWe will measure the levels of blood and urine omic-based BMs in old people selected from eight cohorts, which include up to 75,000 participants, using standardized and innovative technology (WP1). This figure will allow us to test the research questions with a high power and validity. Combining these lab BMs with clinical BMs, we will develop predictive, diagnostic and prognostic models (WP2), with its modulation by nutrition and physical activity, in general old population and in old people showing some characteristics that confer a high risk for developing frailty (selected cardiovascular risk factors and diseases) (WP4). After that, a selected set of BMs will be validated prospectively (WP3) and assessed to find the best-fitted models (WP4). These models will guide the development of the ready-to-use kits to be implemented in the clinical settings.

They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition.

The production in centered around questions of identity and the shaping of ones identity, as Alice encounters various creatures and events that form her notion of her Self. We long to question what influences our formation of identity through a playful use of autobiographical events, scenes from the author's - Dodgeson\u2019s - own life. \r\n\r\nOur script of new writing and editing of Carroll's work will require a thorough research into the renowned UK author, which we intend to communicate through our performance. The performance will modernise the work and interpret it for the modern audiences by highlighting the key themes and recontextualising the characters that Alice encounters. The notion of identity and confrontation is of an increasing importance in our ever-more isolating society, and with the changes in rules and regulations following the economic crisis there have been drastic changes to acceptable behaviour around the world.

The end products are a teachers manual for this new approach - including an analysis of students\u2019 needs and the monitoring of individual language acquisition processes - and learners\u2019 tutorials, in which learners link their error patterns (the \u201cguerilla\u201d) to the correct ways of language use. Based on connectivist pedagogical approaches, this remedial work is linked to both formal and informal learning environments (from libraries to community schools to digital spaces) and to multilingual acquisition.\r\n\r\nBasic literacy levels are problematic throughout Europe in the twenty-first century, resulting in an ever increasing group of citizens that drop out of school prematurely and risk becoming marginalised, unemployed and impoverished. However, it is our working hypothesis that these drop-outs can teach us new ways of acquiring literacy. \r\n\r\nThis new approach is based on a pilot project at the Catholic University College Limburg (CLUC) that explored how students can become proficient writers through creating video clips in which they show which guerilla tactics they use (make mistakes) and how they remediate them. In these tutorials, students discussed the guerilla patterns which emerged through thinking aloud exercises. At CLUC, we have termed this process guerrilla literacy, since the students guessed, mixed rules unorthodoxically, applied rules in the wrong contexts, and applied mathematical logics to solve linguistic challenges. We observed that once students could link their errors to a guerrilla pattern, it was easier for them to correct the mistake.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed project, we will develop a guerrilla methodology through: testing, mind-mapping, digital thinking aloud exercises, describing emerging guerrilla patterns, creating knowledge clips and sharing them in a MOOC. Next, we ask students to link their error patterns to structures in other languages. The rationale behind this is that most people do not speak standard languages. They speak regional alternatives or another (European) language or an idiolectal L2. Again it is our working hypothesis that if we allow learners to compare two or more linguistic systems and focus on the differences, their basic literacies will improve.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in our CLUC pilot project we realized we had to \u201cunlock\u201d learners with literacy difficulties through narratives. In these narratives they could make sense of and find recognition for the feelings of shame about their inability to learn their mother-tongue and for the pain they have suffered due to a chain of negative feedback over the years.

Focus is increasingly shifting away from how to best capture and allow access to knowledge, into how to enable knowledge-generating interactions between individuals in the most effective way. In parallel, cloud computing presents new opportunities for developing and provisioning organizational support systems which are always available and facilitate economies of scale.\n\nIn line with these developments, KnowHow aims to demonstrate a novel Knowledge Management Platform as a Service (KM-PaaS) environment for social business applications, and to prepare the ground for its commercial exploitation.\n\nThe four main objectives of the KnowHow project are:\n1. To analyze the social business market environment and to assess the commercialization opportunities for a novel KM-PaaS offering.\n2. To carry out scale-up activities critical to achieve industrial-grade strength for the KnowHow KM-PaaS, and to implement four new technological solutions based on the platform.\n3. To validate the KnowHow KM-PaaS through trials in the domains of collaborative innovation, social enterprise, supply chain networking, and social media marketing.\n4. To develop business plans and marketing strategies supporting the participating SMEs in commercializing the KnowHow KM-PaaS and the results of the trials.\n\nThe KnowHow consortium consists of 5 partners from 4 EU member states: Germany, Greece, United Kingdom, and Italy.", 267060.0, 2068602.0, 4, 5, "KNOWHOW", "http://www.knowhow-project.eu/", "http://www.ltcinnovates.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/150121.jpg", "fp7_109576_999459483"], [1320105600000, 1393545600000, "Guiding Language Technology Paths from Research to Markets", "Language Technology Centre Limited", "COMPASS is a Support Action for the Language Technology European research community and industry, that aims to:1.Promote faster, wider and smoother market take-up of Language Technology (LT) research results by facilitating closer collaboration between research and industry players, and by generating better knowledge and understanding of demand/user needs and expectations2.Foster the process of consolidation of LT stakeholders as a self-sustainable and innovative global industry, strategically co-ordinated under a common vision and approach to consumers' needs, and acting upon a shared innovation agenda for the continuous improvement of their technological base.To achieve these objectives, the COMPASS consortium will implement a Support Mechanism structured by two pillars: an LT Innovation Forum to mobilise and coordinate LT stakeholders, and an LT Market Observatory to provide information and insights for better innovation decision-making. These core actions will be complemented by a comprehensive programme of Dissemination and Exploitation of project outputs.Impacts derived from a successful completion of LT COMPASS will be measurable in a number of ways, e.g.: partnerships between research centres and commercial developers/vendors, deployment of LT-enabled products and services, wider awareness and recognition of the current and future potential of LT.", 232672.0, 2729302.0, 3, 5, "LT COMPASS", null, "http://www.ltcinnovates.com", null, "fp7_100698_999459483"], [1220227200000, 1283212800000, "OrganiK - An organic knowledge management approach for small european knowledge-intensive companies", "Language Technology Centre Limited", "Small European companies compete on their know-how and hence have to use knowledge to their advantage. They are constrained by the scarcity of their resources such as land, labor, and capital, thus they must do more with less. As a result, knowledge housed in European SMEs, must be leveraged so that goals can be achieved in an effective and efficient manner. However, knowledge management programs used by larger organisations tend to be expensive, relatively inflexible and are not suitable for European knowledge-intensive SMEs. Traditional knowledge management focuses on top-down, detailed and tightly controlled knowledge repositories, whereas small knowledge intensive European companies practice ad hoc, people-centred work processes and heavily rely on the social structures of the company (i.e. the individual knowledge workers and spaghetti-like team formations). Therefore, the increasing need of European knowledge-intensive SMEs for loose-coupled collaboration, ad hoc knowledge sharing and utilisation and open innovation structures adoption practices has led to the strong requirement of a next generation knowledge management system that manages and promotes social structures.
