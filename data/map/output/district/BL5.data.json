They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Malta, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Poland and Turkey. An internship of eleven weeks including the corresponding exam held and certified by a German-French board of examiners will be offered by the grammar schools Lyc\u00e9e St. Louis in St. Etienne and Lyc\u00e9e Ren\u00e9-Cassin in Strasbourg.\r\nWith that the students are given the opportunity to get their practical skills certified and, thus, obtain a more favourable starting position on the labour market. For already two years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.\r\nAll details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries.\r\nThe participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000471_23"]]}}, "3AZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1346457600000, 1409443200000, "The Development of a Next Generation Robotic Milking Parlour", "Bolton Electronics Ltd", "The Rotabot project will deliver an intelligent next generation robotic milking system incorporating automated teat cleaning, cluster attachment and post milking disinfection on a scalable rotary milking installation.

It accounts for 40% of deaths in the EU and costs the EU economy almost \u20ac196bn each year. 2D ultrasound scans are currently the primary choice for vascular diagnostics. Due to low sensitivity, a limited field of action and the lack of volume information, patients are often referred for CTa, MRa and catheter angiography for the detailed imaging required for diagnosis and treatment planning. Referrals delay treatment, exposes the patient to risks associated with radiation and contrast mediums and increases costs. This presents a need to improve the speed and safety of the diagnosis of vascular conditions for rapid treatment, as well as to improve workflow efficiency and reduce costs. The project consortium will further develop the piur tUS system, a 3D freehand tomographic US system capable of rapid, safe and accurate reconstructive 3D quantifiable vascular imaging. It will provide a low cost and reproducible imaging solution that will reduce the need for referrals and be an effective preventative screening tool for CVD. We aim to complete and publish the results from 4 CVD clinical studies to generate the clinical evidence required for CE marking and clinical validation for market uptake.

We strive to develop a love of learning through high standards of education. Additionally, we seek to provide forward-looking and exciting opportunities to nurture our children become independent, able and curious young learners.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, we were awarded an Erasmus + grant which enabled us to send 4 members of staff on a cultural and linguistic programme to Spain. \r\n\r\nGiven the success of the this project in supporting our key aims to develop our Spanish offering across the School, we are confident that we can use this expertise to enhance our cultural and linguistic dimension.\r\n\r\nAs a one-form entry school, we believe it is important to involve as a many staff as we can, in a new project to build and develop a strong international presence across the whole school.\r\n\r\nThe MFL lead and Spanish teacher will be closely involved in managing the project, and will build on previous experience gained during our previous project. \r\n\r\nFour new members of the teaching team have joined since the previous project was launched, and we would like to give them the opportunity to develop their skills. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have 1 teaching assistant per year group, and will make strident efforts to encourage their involvement.\r\n\r\nWe need to continue to develop and maintain Spanish Language teaching and further develop intercultural understanding in order to build upon the MFL presence across our school. We are proud of the developments that the previous project has enabled us to achieve, and would like to use a second project to continue to build upon these successes.\r\n\r\nStaff confidence in teaching languages is developing and, through the support of the more confident teachers, we are in the process of encouraging all staff members to be involved in language teaching. We feel that there is more scope to develop linguistic and intercultural skills to an even higher level, particularly upon evaluation of the success of the previous project, and from the positive involvement from staff members.\r\n\r\nAs a school, we feel it is very important to capitalise on the success of the previous project so that the school continues to benefit from the impact. To do this, it is important for the staff to either return or make a first visit to Santander to develop their language skills, network with other participants and develop more ideas to take back to St Bartholomew\u2019s. Our SLT will also benefit as the coordinators will share outcomes with the management team, and feed these into the School Development Plan.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals set out above, staff will take part in immersion courses Spain. We are proposing a two-year project, with 6 planned mobilities:\r\n\r\nMFL Coordinator and Headteacher will continue to lead the project, with an additional four members of staff from KS1 and KS2 to attend one of the courses. We hope to be able to form one single group and go on the course at the same time as this will enable us to forge stronger links to the project, and give us additional time to develop our ideas. For example, we can use any planning time to develop ideas about creating links with Spanish schools via etwinning, which will help us realise our vision of setting up a partner school in Spain.\r\n\r\nAt St Bartholomew\u2019s we believe that foreign language learning provides key educational, social and cultural experience for our young learners.

These mobilities will involve structured training courses focused on intensive language learning, cultural immersion, primary teaching methodology and the opportunity to make a link with a school in Spain allowing our children to have regular contact with native speakers of their own age.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will be taken by the Languages Subject Leader, the Head Teacher, and two other members of staff.
