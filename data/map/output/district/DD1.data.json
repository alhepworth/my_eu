Commonfare is a new collaborative form of welfare provision based on equitable governance and grassroots democracy. It entails the involvement of diverse stakeholders to facilitate the bottom-up arousal of collective practices tackling the needs of the new poor (precarious workers, working poor, NEETs, people left behind by safety nets). The consortium will achieve this goal through a Collective Awareness Platform (CAPS) which (a) informs people about existing welfare state provisions, (b) provides them with the means to share good practices on how to handle poverty-related issues, and (c) supports their abilities to network and to sustain real-life value. \nThe project pioneers commonfare as a new social innovation goal by raising collective awareness on the threats connected to Poverty, lack of Income, and unEmployment (\u2018PIE conditions\u2019), thus empowering the new poor and enabling the relevant stakeholders, e.g. polivcy makers, to tackle such threats more effectively. Three pilot actions (in Croatia, Italy, and the Netherlands) will drive the design and implementation of the PIE News project, triggering a public engagement process. PIE NEWS capitalizes on the collective power and skills of the \u2018new poor\u2019 promoting commonfare through actions that increase collective awareness on PIE Conditions.

Berufskolleg Bachstra\u00dfe is responsible for the academic part of training of all the trainees involved in the project. With the help of this project it would like to improve young people\u00b4s job opportunities and perspective in life. It would also like to contribute to a peaceful co-existence in Europe. \r\nObtaining intercultural competences and knowledge of foreign languages shall open up various career opportunities in Europe and internationally. \r\nWith the project application at hand, we intend to send at least two trainees, who are training to become Specialists in Media and Information Services, numerous other trainees (part-time) courses and pupils, who attend a full-time course to become foreign language correspondents. \r\nThe two trainees, who are training to become Specialists in Media and Information Services work in different libraries and are going to do their internships in Austria and Scotland. \r\nOne trainee, who is in her third year of training, is going to do her internship at Bernhard King Library of Abertay University, which is in Dundee. She will get to know an excellent institution, which is renowned and cooperating all over Europe. The second trainee, who is in her first year of training, is going to do her internship in the Austrian National Library. During this traineeship, the focus is on the recognition of cultural differences between two German-speaking countries as well as on working in a national library, which cultivates international contacts due to its assignment. The necessity for Specialists in Media and Information Services to have a command of specialist vocabulary is ever increasing due to the expansion of the use of electronic sources of information. Specifically in scientific and technical fields, these are often, and sometimes exclusively, in English.\r\nIn recent years, pupils often did an internship abroad after their completion of training to become foreign language correspondents. For promotion, they turned to pool-projects because it was difficult to consider May (the usual time) in our projects. \r\nFor this and other reasons we have decided to apply for a 24-month-project this year. \r\nWe have some more trainees, who are interested in an internship abroad, but who are still waiting for the confirmation of their partners. As it is very likely that these confirmations will be given, we have considered some more mobilities next to the firmly agreed ones. \r\nIn the coming two years, we will presumably send two trainees to the British Library and there is reason to hope that the National Library of Scotland, after its renovation, will be able to supervise interns again.  Another will go to the \u00d6NB in 2016.\r\nFor all of the trainees, their stay abroad will be an opportunity, not only to learn to adapt to new social structures and ways of life, but also to get to know new work surroundings with their own specific demands.\r\nThe trainees will all take part in a preparatory seminar before they leave. This will take place in a youth hostel in the vicinity and will include an overnight stay. The seminar will focus on intercultural and linguistic preparation and will clarify technical formalities. It will be extremely helpful and interesting for the participants to meet others in a similar situation.\r\nDuring the entire project the EU representative of Berufskolleg Bachstra\u00dfe and the school\u2019s present coordinator will be in contact with the participants via Mail, telephone and, should it become necessary, in person.\r\nWhen everybody has returned, there will be another meeting to which the trainers are also invited. Thus, the project can be evaluated and experiences exchanged. \r\nWe hope to organize Europe Day in May 2016 and 2018 again.

To maintain genetic integrity, eukaryotic cells must duplicate their chromosomes and subsequently segregate them to opposite poles of the cell, prior to cell division. Cohesion is established between sister chromatids during S phase and marks sister pairs to ensure proper chromosome segregation in the next mitosis. However, the cohesion must be eventually removed to allow sister chromatids to separate and segregate to opposite poles. Although recent studies have revealed how the removal of cohesion is initiated, it is still elusive how this removal is completed.

Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries.

Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens.

T cell activation and differentiation are tightly controlled processes and deregulation can result in lymphomas, autoimmunity and inflammation. Hence, the biochemical events regulating lymphocyte biology have long been a topic of intense research, which has been focussed predominantly on protein phosphorylation. I hypothesize that there are crucial roles undiscovered in T cells for other posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins (UBLs). The importance of ubiquitylation in adaptive immunity is implied by the severe immunological disorders observed when components of the Ub system are disrupted in lymphocytes. Genetic approaches in mice give a limited understanding about the roles of these modifiers and do not reveal the full extent to which Ub and UBLs regulate lymphocyte biology. Deterred by the complexity of the Ub system, the field has not yet tackled the daunting challenge of systematically investigating these modifiers in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to define how T cell function and immune responses are regulated by Ub and UBL signalling networks. To pioneer substantial progress in this area, we will develop new methods to identify and characterize currently unknown recognition modules for the different modifications. We will elucidate the Ub and UBL modified proteome in lymphocytes and characterize dynamic changes of these PTMs during T cell activation. By focussing on enzymes that remove the modifications we will discover how these PTMs are regulated and define Ub and UBL-dependent signalling nodes.

Although much effort has been devoted to targeting protein-protein interactions using small molecules, these have focused to date on individual gene products or truncated domains, which however do not reflect the physiological organization and activity of many functional proteins. Few successes have been achieved, yet many of the key physical determinants of druggability of surfaces within native protein complexes have remained elusive. The aim of this project is to shed light upon this problem by chemically interrogating biological systems that rely on several subunits working in concert rather than on single proteins working alone. As model system we will investigate the Cullin RING Ligases (CRLs), the largest superfamily of multisubunit E3 ligases in humans. These enzymatic machines are responsible for the recognition, poly-ubiquitination and targeting of substrate proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Many members of this family have crucial roles in cellular physiology and homeostatis, are implicated in a wide range of diseases and are attractive targets for drug discovery. Two interdependent lines of enquiry will be followed. First, we will screen for and elucidate the binding of small molecular fragments and short peptides to identify new druggable surfaces and interfaces on CRLs and their components. Second, we will exploit the nature of the interactions to develop novel chemical probes of CRLs.

Multiple rounds of ubiquitination lead to the formation of ubiquitin chains, which are recognized by the 26S-proteasome, a protease that degrades the substrates. Targeted protein degradation by CRLs is an important part of many essential cellular processes. Progression of the cell cycle, for example, requires CRL-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). Clearly, substrate ubiquitination needs to occur at the right time and place, and it is thus essential that CRL activity is tightly regulated. In fact, the malfunction of CRLs has been associated with many human diseases, including cancer. One mode of CRL regulation is the activation of the ligase by the small ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8 (neddylation). Neddylation of the cullin triggers the formation of an active ligase complex and induces structural changes that allow efficient substrate ubiquitination.

Current practise relies on the conversion of acoustic energy to thermal, for localised and minimally-invasive ablation with non-ionising radiation. Cavitation (the formation, and subsequent pressure driven dynamics, of bubbles) is a common occurrence at the high intensities typically employed for FUS. The extremely rapid, often violent evolution of cavitation in tissue exposed to focused ultrasound, poses a high risk of collateral damage to healthy tissue proximal to the site of pathology. TheraCav will demonstrate cavitation can be controlled and harnessed, to redefine the remit of FUS to include targeted drug delivery and rapid ablation formation via enhanced heating. Conceptually, cavitation could act to significantly permeabilise targeted tissue, rendering specific volumes highly susceptible to drug delivery through extravasation from the vasculature. Moreover, cavitation may actively pump and promote drug transport directly to the diseased tissue.

The project SMART \"Skill Matching Assistance and Reporting Tool\" is a way to focus this and create skill awareness.The SMART consortium intends to create a tool that matches skills of youths with skill requirements for jobs. Unlike other matching tools it takes into account informal skills and doesn't focus onl qualifications. It doesn't ask youths to rate their own skills (which is difficult with limited experience and leads to bad results) but takes them through skill tests instead. Groups that benefit from the tool are youths, especially those who don't do well in the educational systems and who have a chance of proving their skills in the skill tests, as well as employers who will be able to find employees who have just the right skills for the job. Career counsellors also benefit from using the system because it can provide them with a detailed skills profile of job seekers that will be highly useful when analysing their personal development and their options.SMART focuses on the career orientation processes of young people that are disadvantaged or have to face any obstacles, and aims to bring them into employment. Therefore, the consortium partners will conduct research and cooperate with practicioners to create a generic job skill model and a matching concept that matches the skill and interest profiles of young people with occupational profiles or even reported job offers. In contrast to recent approaches, SMART focuses on generic skills that are required for various jobs and on young people's interests as well without relying on their qualifications. The partners will develop a web-based tool based on the conducted research and the developed models and concepts. Within this tool, young people will run skill tests to create a profile that will then be matched with occupational profiles. Both the personal profiles and the occupational profiles are based on the same aspects and dimensions. The tool will be made user friendly and easy to use, and it can be used by young people, youth workers or career counsellors. Thus, SMART is scientifically sound and practical orientated.In SMART collaborate experienced partners. Universities, youth organisations and a technical partner will bring in the expertise to run a project that considers many perspectives and needs. The chair of Business, Human Resource Education and Evaluation Research of the University of Paderborn is highly experienced in the field of career orientation, the development of competency models and evaluation in general. Professor Jindal-Snape from the University of Dundee is an expert when it comes to disadvantaged learners and the design of transitional systems. She is internationally recognized. Both Universities will be responsible for safeguarding high scientific standards. Ingenious Knowledge is an expert when it comes to innovative IT solutions. They are experienced in designing tools like SMART (see BEDARF) and in developing Serious Games, too. YEU Cyprus and Pro Educatione have contact to our target group. They are working with young people or youth organisations and they have big networks. They will review the theoretical concepts based on their practical expertise, and thus, they ensure the practical orientation within the project. By conducting qualitative research with employers and bringing the findings together with a literature review, a generic job skill model will be created. This generic job skill model will be the basis for the matching concept which aims to provide tasks for the skill assessment of the learners. Both of them will then be embedded into a web-tool that matches the youth profiles with occupational profiles. In order to use the tool adequately and to improve its quality, a handbook will be designed and test-implementations and evaluations will be conducted. Once, the tool is developed, young people, employers and youth workers will benefit from the consortium's work. They will have a tool that gives them detailed and diversified orientation in an easy way.Due to the advanced technological architecture SMART will be a highly modern tool that will also be highly efficient due to the  scientifically sound concepts at its core. The consortium firmly believes that it can support informal education in the youth sector better than any other tool by making the acquired skills visible in profiles. With a good integration in career counseling processes and a good dissemination in youth work the tool can be established, especially if employers understand its advantages and actively use it. If the developed tool only sees minimal use at the end of the project as a way of creating skill profiles for youths it will still be extremely useful. However, if the consortium manages to establish it as a job matching tool it will most likely be only the first step towards a new way of looking at job skills that can have a huge impact.", "http://www.dundee.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-RO01-KA205-022891_1"], [2014, "Jean Monnet Centre for Excellence - European Institute for Security and Justice", "UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE", 80733.0, 1, 1, "Popular discourse in Britain often depicts the European Union (EU) as an \u2018undemocratic and bureaucratic monster\u2019 imposing its will upon the unwilling and \u2018sovereignty-less\u2019 member states.

The detail organisation (like arrival) must be planned by the students. Since health care and nursing students only receive a small pocket money in Austria, an internship is only possible because of financial support of Erasmus+. As a result, this internship abroad is a fully chargeable, judged internship for the education. In addition, students gain valuable experiences because they have to be incorporated in a foreign country very quickly and they must find their own way in a foreign city, as well. The benefit is particularly in the personal development of each individual, their expertise expands, but also social and communication skills are going to be challenged and encouraged. After their return the students do report about their internship abroad experiences in practical-reflection lessons in class and they give their feedback to the teachers as well. For the institution, there reveals a benefit of internationalism which is a required quality criterion for colleges.

health & social services is increasing as European society grows older and unemployment and relocation across Europe increases. This growing demand for services, a public sector provision in many Member States, is creating unprecedented pressures on health & social care systems. Despite differences in political approaches and institutional frameworks, health and social services in all Member States face similar challenges in adjusting to demographic ageing, societal change, rising expectations and consumerism, changing employment and family patterns, evolving technological opportunities and funding issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA key part of the sector deals with vulnerable people. A recent report by the Social Protection Committee stated that greater emphasis must be spent on generating an effective and innovative way of developing the human capital of those responsible for making a significant professional impact and successful intervention in improving the quality of life for vulnerable people throughout Europe. Education and training plays a pivotal role in developing those who work with vulnerable people. In many parts of Europe, the sector has a strong emphasis on learning and assessing skills for job roles in real practice environments (\u201cpractice learning\u201d), which in some qualificationscan be almost 40% of the total learning time. There are also on-going demands for practice learning with new qualified professionals and as part of \u201cin-service\u201d/CPD training. There are clear logistical challenges in arranging practice opportunities where trainees are able to learn the core skills of the job and receive high quality support, supervision and assessment of their practice from suitably qualified mentors/practice assessors. Further, finding sufficient numbers of such placements has been a challenge for the last 30 years. However, there are also other challenges; eg. risks associated with work-based learning and the safety and well-being of service users in giving trainees access to their lives. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting the needs\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, this project will develop an immersive 3D virtual environment, built on gaming architecture and driven by emotional AI, to provide a safe and readily accessible environment where Higher Education and VET students and professional social workers who deal with vulnerable people can learn by interacting with NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in a simulation of a real world service. Trainees will engage with simulations and be required to navigate their way through choices to arrive at the best resolution. Each simulation can be replayed and evaluated by the trainer/mentor and the trainee can use the same simulation as many times as required. We see this as offering a measurable, controlled environment where learners can gain a command of the basics of the job role they are training for with minimal resource requirements and zero risk to the public, thus providing a sound basis from which to progress to real work practice placement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the project are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- a pedagogy and curriculum that can be used by educators to train HE/VET students and professionals who work with vulnerable people in a simulated practice learning environment. The curriculum will be aligned with ECTS/ECVET.\r\n\r\n- a 3D game platform for supporting practice learning, developed to be multi-lingual to support teaching in different European languages.\r\n\r\n- training materials for the teachers, mentors and assessors who will use the game. \r\n\r\n- training for 200 teachers/teacher trainers using the materials and the simulated practice environment.\r\n\r\n- large-scale piloting of the simulated practice environment across Europe with HE/VET students and professionals who deal with vulnerable people.\r\n\r\n- in-depth analysis of the training and piloting.\r\n\r\n- development of policy and practice guidance for policymakers/decision makers on the benefits of the simulated practice environment.\r\n\r\n- establishment of an online Community of Practice to continue the use of the platform after the project has completed. \r\n\r\n- widespread dissemination of the results of the project.\r\n\r\n- assessment of the commercial value of such a game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n\r\n\u2022 500 HE/VET students and social services professionals trained using the game;\r\n\r\n\u2022 200 teachers/teacher trainers trained;\r\n\r\n\u2022 Community of Practice with at least 500 members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPartners\r\n\r\nAs well as partners covering HE/VET providers, HE/VET policy makers and the labour market, the project also required technology partners to develop the educational game.

JIVE 2 involves regions with experience of the technology scaling up fuel cell bus fleets (e.g. Cologne), and those seeking to build their knowledge and experience by demonstrating FC buses in small fleets for the first time (e.g. Auxerre, G\u00e4vleborg). All deployment locations in JIVE 2 share an ambition to increase the size of their FC bus fleets following successful initial demonstrations, hence the participating cities/regions will be natural locations for larger scale roll-out of the technology in the 2020s.\n\nA comprehensive data monitoring and assessment exercise will capture the relevant evidence to inform next steps for the sector, and the project\u2019s impacts will be maximised by a high-impact dissemination campaign. This will involve reaching wide audiences via various channels, including a series of international Zero Emission Bus Conferences.\n\nThe JIVE and JIVE 2 projects together will see the deployment and operation of nearly 300 FC buses in 22 European cities/regions, thus providing a sound basis for further development of this sector.", 1623782.0, 92350676.0, 10, 21, "JIVE 2", null, null, null, "h2020_213068_922165518"], [1483228800000, 1672444800000, "Joint Initiative for hydrogen Vehicles across Europe", "Dundee City Council", "The hydrogen fuel cell (FC) bus is one of very few options for the elimination of harmful local emissions and the decarbonisation of public transport. Its performance has been validated in Europe in recent years through various demonstration projects, however, a number of actions are required to allow the commercialisation of FC buses. These include addressing the high ownership costs relative to conventional buses, ensuring the FC buses can meet the high availability levels demanded by public transport, developing the refuelling infrastructure to provide reliable, low-cost hydrogen and improving the understanding of the potential of FC buses for zero emission public transport. \nJIVE will pave the way to commercialisation by addressing these issues through the deployment of 142 fuel cell buses across 9 locations, more than doubling the number of FC buses operating in Europe. JIVE will use coordinated procurement activities to unlock the economies of scale which are required to reduce the cost of the buses. They will operate in large fleets of 10-30 buses, reducing the overhead costs per bus, as well as allowing more efficient supply chains and maintenance operations compared to previous deployments. By working at this scale and with bus OEMs with proven vehicles, JIVE will ensure reliability at the level required for commercialisation.  \nJIVE will also test new hydrogen refuelling stations with the required capacity to serve fleets in excess of 20 buses. This will not only reduce the costs of hydrogen and increase the availability of equipment but will also test the ability to offer >99% reliability, which is required for the commercialisation of FC buses. \nA dissemination campaign will use the project results to demonstrate the technical readiness of FC buses to bus operators and the economic viability of hydrogen as a zero emission bus fuel to policy makers will help to catalyse the future development and expansion of the hydrogen bus sector.", null, 92403549.0, 7, 22, "JIVE", null, null, null, "h2020_208049_922165518"]]}}}}
