Following a Comenius project that stimulated reflection at the level of our school district, the teaching team at La Gazelle set up a charter of values called \u201cSTAR\u201d. This was to answer a problematic issue: how to help the pupil to build himself as a European eco-citizen.\r\nThe arrival of our director made us want to deepen the reflection, to think about new tools and to identify new lines of action which aim at the well-being of the student in the school and his commitment in Eco-citizen actions. The desire to renew the experience of exchanging and pooling good practices and professional gestures with European colleagues around the values related to the attitudes and behaviors of students has naturally emerged.\r\nIn order to respond to our problems and to extend our Charter with new tools, it is now necessary to go to other European institutions to see what is being done there and to follow at the same time training courses at a European level to learn and exchange among teachers from different countries; to build the future European citizen, the one who will thus be more able to become a citizen of the world, this can not be done while remaining in the angle of view of our hexagon.\r\nWe therefore need to go on site, in small but sufficient teams (4 people) to observe other educational systems, other tools to work this school climate, and to welcome to share our own experience. At the same time, because they will be fully associated with the project and the mobilities, our students will open up to other European cultures.\r\nAt the same time, training in the English language is essential in order to communicate in a better way and thus better use these moments of observation, training and exchanges between European partners; the improvement of our language skills directly influences the learning of English among our students.\r\nFor the training in English, 7 candidates were chosen by the team and more specifically:\r\n- the director for her position of representation at the European meetings.\r\n  - two teacher coordinators of the project within the institution to enable them to acquire more fluidity in speaking during the management of preparatory meetings and in exchanges of mail.\r\nFor the observation workshops: all the teaching staff of the school will move, as well as the manager of the extracurricular times of our partner town hall depending on her availabilities.\r\n\r\nAs a summery:\r\n16 mobilities in progress structured from 1 to 2 weeks for language training in ENGLISH\r\n23 mobilities in a 5-day observation course to 4 European partner institutions\r\nReception at the La Gazelle school for a 5-day observation course for European partner institutions\r\n\r\nThe planned project management methodology is:\r\n- direct testimony.\r\n- putting on line the ENT (our digital work environment) of the resources collected during the training courses and the new pedagogical tools linked to our charter of values.\r\n- publishing on \u201cmagistere\u201d to open our resources to schools of our district\r\n- on-line on \u201cmoodle\u201d (ENT Faculty of Education of Montpellier) for the on-line resources available for the trainee teachers\r\n- on- line on etwinning, EPALE,...\r\n\r\nIndicators for project evaluation:\r\n- at the teacher level:\r\nEvolution of approaches and teaching methods, continuation of projects requiring the collaboration of all on a European scale, significant extension of skills in the linguistic field, motivation for professional evolutions\r\n- at the student level:\r\nEvolution of behavior, fulfillment and commitment to collective actions, taking initiatives, improving school success and building a European citizenship and a common culture\r\n- at the level of the public in initial or in-service training:\r\nBy the successful example of a commitment to a demanding and ambitious continuing education process, make it possible and enviable to activate skill 14 of the teachers\u2019 skill framework.\r\n- at the level of the educational community:\r\nExample of a successful partnership (school, parents, town hall, national education Ministry) in the service of the European democratic ideal.\r\n- at the establishment level:\r\nBetter expertise in the conduct of European projects facilitating openness to Europe for our school, better communication and opening of the school, privileged partnerships then persisting and giving rise to the establishment in schools of other European projects.", "http://www.longton-st-oswalds.lancs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036747_6"], [2017, "POR UNA ESCUELA : UN ESPACIO PARA LA COMUNICACI\u00d3N Y EL BIENESTAR DEL ALUMNADO", "St Oswalds Catholic Primary School", 22795.0, 5, 5, "During the last few years we have seeing in our students an increase in difficulty to concentrate on the sessions, a worse predisposition towards learning, higher levels of nervousness and problems in managing their emotions when they relate to their classmates.\r\nThe project \"The school as a space for communication and student well-being\" aims to improve the coexistence among students, reducing stress levels in the school environment and building an adequate, positive and realistic self-assessment of themselves. From here we can begin to build the basis for a genuine attitude of acceptance of intellectual, social and cultural diversity. As a school we find a growing presence of students with a different cultural, ethnic and linguistic background and we want this situation to be experienced by the entire educational community as an opportunity.\r\nWe believe that a significant improvement in relationship skills with others and with oneself will revert to a more effective learning environment and to the training of citizens capable of facing the moral european challenges.\r\nTo achieve this, and as we believe that the Erasmus + program can be fundamental in achieving these objectives, we have put forward a series of training courses and Job shadowings in the following countries, with which we have already agreed on the objectives and content Of these visits: Poland, France, United Kingdom and Portugal. A commission consisting of a member of the management team, the person in charge of the Erasmus + program and the coordinator of Plurilingualism, will carry out a selection process of these visits taking into account the charge of responsability in the centre (the leadership, multilingual coordinator, special languages tearchers and Primary bilingual teachers\u2026.) the working specific situation( definitive position in the school , provisional position or interim teacher),  the cycle to which they belong, the specific training and  previous experience in European Projects. Related to training refresher courses, it will also be recommended that there is at least one representative of each cycle in the different courses. \r\nOn return of each mobility, this commission, with the professors who have made the mobility and the training, will have the function of collecting the material, collected resources and accumulated information that will be part of an ERASMUS+ 2017-2019 PROJECT BANK, which will have digital and paper support. This will facilitate the exhibition of the work done and accumulated information for the formation of the rest of the staff. \r\nOur methodological tools will be based on the personal experience of the teachers, acquired in the courses and in the direct observation of the work that they are already carrying out in the schools with which we associate precisely for this reason. What will be learned will be transmitted to the whole school, as well as moments of more specific work by cycles with some representative of the Commission of Erasmus +.\r\nThe impact we want with our project \"The school as a space for communication and student well-being\" is linked to the improvement of the classroom learning environment and a greater motivation towards it, as a result of a greater concentration and management of impulsiveness, as well as the control of their emotions. We also believe that courses and stays will not only have repercussions at the center but also at the local level.\r\nAmong the benefits we hope to achieve with the project, in addition to those already discussed, is the consolidation of the multilingual character of our center, opening us to cooperation and innovation processes together with other European countries through the knowledge of good practices.", "http://www.longton-st-oswalds.lancs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036196_3"], [2015, "Every Teacher a Language Teacher; Every Child a Language Learner", "St Oswalds Catholic Primary School", 6701.0, 1, 1, "St Oswalds's Catholic Primary School, Longton, Preston  is an average-sized primary school (ages 4-11) with 233 pupils on roll.

The best way to do this is to allow staff to attend a study visit to France. This will improve their French and provide a variety of lively and engaging teaching ideas which they can use to inspire their pupils. The courses will need to include intensive language tuition, teaching methodology and cultural awareness sessions. These areas will all contribute to the increase in staff confidence and enthusiasm to deliver active and stimulating French lessons.  All staff will be invited to express their interest in taking part and will be selected on the basis of their ability to influence the children's progress and cascade their new skills.
