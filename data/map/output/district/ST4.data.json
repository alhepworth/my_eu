The project will IMPLEMENT and TEST a method to support these learners in such a way that the drop out is reduced, and successful completion has a positive impact on employment skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rationale of this project is to RESEARCH  skills needs, then DEVELOP targeted MOOC tools, then IMPLEMENT, TEST AND REFINE a method for HEIs to PROMOTE and SUPPORT the use of MOOCs to address local labour market SKILLS SHORTAGES, and in so doing to support regional ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT while improving the EMPLOYABILITY of local youth and adult learners. \r\n\r\nIt will do this through the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Research into the availability and access of MOOCs by EU region and by curriculum sector, including factors such as language, cost, level, accreditation and content, including transversal skills\r\n\r\n2. Research into local labour market skills needs and the skills offered by work-seekers, using partner organisations with direct access to employers, work seekers and labour market intelligence\r\n\r\n3.  Match MOOC offerings to labour market needs and produce 'pathways' using MOOC learnings\r\n\r\n4. Produce and implement training for Stakeholders (Academics, learning support staff, careers staff, recruitment staff, employers and HR professionals on the value of MOOC learning, (including their use as entry to other more formal education programmes using a 'recognition of prior learning' process)\r\n\r\n5. Develop models for  HEI initiatives to host a 'MOOC Cafe/Study Club'  (MSC), including hardware, software, staffing etc.\r\n\r\n6.

PSM does not have any harmonized PSM higher education curriculum yet. Companies often have to hire university graduates with other specializations and spend years bringing them up to an appropriate skilllevel. For students, a significant challenge lies in finding university courses to match their course portfolio during international exchanges. lf a harmonized PSM curriculum in higher education was implemented, the currently unused human potential could be made available to European companies and student mobility in international programs could be increased significantly.\r\n\r\nThis project's main target is the development of a pan-European, empirically validated harmonized European Curriculum for PSM education. The international studying program is supposed to be implemented by the participating universities, but simultaneously it can be disseminated through the relevant associations and be thereby available to any higher education institution in Europe. Therefore, the project improves the quality and relevance of higher education, contributes to the development of a European Area of Skills and Qualifications considering the increasing labour market relevance of PSM.\r\n\r\nThe PERFECT project includes the following main activities and outputs:\r\n1.\tPSM Skill Concept (IO1/Al)\r\n2.\tBenchmarking study (IO2/A2)\r\n3.\tCompany survey (IO3/A3)\r\n4.\tHarmonized European purchasing curriculum (IO4/A4)\r\n5.\tPSM skills self-assessment tool (IO5/AS)\r\n6.\tMassive Open Online Course (MOOC) (IO6/AG)\r\n\r\nln order to achieve the objectives and milestones, a consortium is formed which brings tagether\r\nleading universities, European project management competence and practical exposure with a very strong background and international network in PSM.

Despite its long history, diversity has not become a strictly defined concept, but tends to change its scope and priorities according to the different settings, societies and needs.  In this context, diversity, especially in education, is not a static phenomenon, but needs to be developed through different ways to address any issue that may lead to discriminatory behaviour and needs to continuously developed, in order to address the needs of each society or setting. Diversity refers to a broad range of characteristics including: gender, age, race, disability, cultural background, sexual orientation, education, religious belief, class, tenure and family responsibilities. Managing Diversity is an initiative which recognises the links between effective people management and increased organisational efficiency and productivity, even when the setting envisaged is a school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt EU level, there has been many papers and initiatives which aim at promoting diversity in education. In particular, COE\u2019s White Paper on Intercultural Dialogue, Living Together as Equals in Dignity (COE, 2008a), shows the focus on intercultural education within the European framework, and brings together competencies for life within a democratic society. However, albeit CE and diversity education are strongly interrelated, cultural diversity in EU programmes is implicitly applied first to the European citizens\u2019 mobility, and not to the migration processes from non-EU countries. Therefore, despite the fact that inclusion has been in the spotlight of the EU priorities, diversity acceptance and inclusive education have not yet been successfully interrelated, as a means to achieve a more democratic society. In the White Paper \"Living Together as Equals\" the role of primary and secondary education is highlighted, inter alia, as a the cornerstone towards the creation and adoption of shared principles of ethics and democratic citizenship. \"In a multicultural Europe, education is not only preparing for the labour market, supporting personal development and providing a broad knowledge base; schools are also important fora for the preparation of young people for life as active citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has therefore been established that the project aims to create a \"bridge\" between the need for the appropriate culture the teachers should have and the means they have at their disposal to contribute to the creation of active citizens. In specific, the objective of the project is to create a training course for teachers which will enable them to understand the importance of accepting diversity within their classrooms, help them manage a classroom with diverse people/ personalities/ backgrounds/ etc, while at the same time provide the tools to achieve that more effectively. Diversity management is often a term encountered within the business environment; nevertheless, it is believed that in order to achieve the optimal educational results in the classroom, a teacher should be equipped and trained to manage diversity in the school environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the successful implementation of the project the 7 partners (three universities, an adult education provider and a governorship in charge of the education provided in the region) will work together to develop the framework and the content of the course to be delivered as a face to face teacher training workshop. The course will address the origins of conflicts and dynamics and it will focus on strategies to prevent discrimination and different kinds of abuse. The activities foreseen, include the preparatory phase, during which the partners will undertake a detailed analysis of the specific factors which determine how diversity is perceived in the participating countries; based on the findings of this analysis, the course will be structured and the specific topics to be addressed will be identified. Following the content development, the partners will also produce a guideline document for the teachers, to assist them in effectively managing diversity within their classroom, as well as a set of tools targeted for the students/ pupils, through which they will be in a better position to understand why diversity exists and how to accept it. The course will also be available as an eLearning self study course, with the intention of increasing the impact of the project. To finalise the results, the partners will undertake a validation phase in their country and a short Intensive Programme will also be delivered; the analysis of the validation phase will guide the partners through the fine-tuning and elaboration of their originally developed material.

And crime is increasingly transnational: human and drugs trafficking, cybercrime, terrorism, it does not stop at national borders. This results in the need for a pan-European approach to forensic practice, from initial education up to workplace of forensic institutions and companies. Not surprisingly, the European Union currently puts great effort into creating a \u2018European Forensic Science Area\u2019, in which all can rely on shared forensic methods and swift international cooperation in the fight against crime.  But, these recent efforts focus mainly on policy matters and scientific, innovative methods, rather than initial education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, universities in different countries still teach their students the national \u2013 and often very different \u2013 methods of forensics, with little or no regard for the strong international aspect of their profession. Not only has this situation implications for the results of future cross-border investigations, it hampers the job perspectives of students, since the sector increasingly demands professionals with knowledge of the international aspects of forensics. The Strategic Partnership project \u2018European Forensic Educational Network\u2019 (EFEN) aims to alter this situation. It will deliver the first substantial, European forensic study program, that meets the sector needs for professionals with knowledge of cross-border forensics, and put in place the foundations of the necessary European network of stakeholders, supporting the goal of creating a European forensic educational area, to accompany its scientific counterpart the EU currently promotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study program will contain a minor on International Forensics, an introduction course on International Forensics, a manual for international assignments and a European internship database. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, the educational material of the program will be translated into a full, interactive online version for students of the participating universities, and an open source version, available for all who are interested in the subject. A professional project website and official cooperation agreements will support and stimulate the growing network of universities, committing themselves to the goal of creating a European forensic educational area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full realization of this area, will not be reached overnight, considering the current national differences, lack of international cooperation and need to commit the vast majority of European universities to EFEN. Therefore the European forensic study program EFEN develops will first focus on European best practices in forensic methods, and the dynamics and complexity of cross-border cases, making it future professionals better equipped to work in a profession that becomes more internationally oriented. However, the long term goal, to reach in the years after EFEN ended, is to gradually transform the EFEN study program into a full 4-year study program, along with the creation of the European forensic educational area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFEN will start out with 4 universities and 2 forensic companies.

Together Old and Young Project or TOY (www.toyproject.net) (2012-2014) was unique amongst European IGL projects with its focus on including children in the early childhood years (0-10 years) in IGL activities with older adults (65 +).  TOY research and pilot actions demonstrated that intergenerational facilitators are crucial to the success of intergenerational projects and initiatives.  However, to date IGL involving the youngest and oldest members of our society is not a strategy or approach or formally recognized and validated in adult education, nor in pre-service and continuing professional development (CPD) of professionals working with these age groups.  Neither is this kind of IGL recognized in the field of Lifelong Learning. The objectives of the TOY-PLUS project are to develop, test and disseminate an innovative online curriculum and methodology in IG work for practitioners in early childhood education and care (ECEC), social care and community work.  Specific modules in the curriculum will focus on including newly arrived and resident migrants and Roma in IG practice, as a means of fostering intercultural dialogue, participation and social inclusion.

All concerns will be dealt with in situ.\u2022  As a mentor \u2013 students traveling for first time to work in Europe will more than likely hope they have someone they can speak with in relation to the role they are expected to perform. \u2022 As a support person \u2013 the students may look to someone to ask for help when it comes to accommodation or travel issues to and from the workplace. While a certain degree of maturity and workability is expected from all learners there should be a support person there in order to listen to the student when required.\u2022 As a negotiator \u2013 an accompanying person may often be the liaison person required if a situation arises that can only be dealt with by a person they are familiar with. For example, if the group dynamics in the apartment are proving to be a challenge, the accompanying person may be able to assist with a supportive voice and presence.\u2022 As a personal and social contact \u2013 this can prove very useful for the shy student for whom traveling away from home may be a daunting and new experience and it is often where younger participants may need a lot of support.Evidence of the success and necessity of  accompanying persons in Finland and Turkey (from previous projects):Finland: Students on the art course have traveled to Finland for the last three years. Up to 12 students are involved and they are not all placed in the same centre, many of the centres are at least an hour train journey up to a maximum of a six hour train journey. It is not always possible to plan in advance for every contingency. The issues have dealt with in the last number of years range from lost baggage needing to be forwarded to a variety of destinations, delays in students being met at arrival, difficulties purchasing tickets for onward journeys due to changes in transport systems and  problems with the accommodation. These issues are all solvable without much difficulty if there is someone there with some local knowledge and experience. In the last number of years we have had applications from students with Asperger's, who are deaf or have had other disabilities. These students need varying degrees of assistance and may need specialised professional assistance. The range of ages of students is quite wide, ranging from 18 years old up to 50- 60 years old.

One of the youngest and most dynamic universities in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContext/ background: Partners\u2019 territories in this project and other rural areas in Europe face the same problem: population is decreasing, low educational level and a need for new market opportunities. Partners in this project think they could attract more people by creating jobs and working on a better image. Tourism offers a mixture of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project: Participating municipalities and local SMEs in the tourism sector will work together with vocational schools, the University and the company expert in branding Exesios, to develop vocational skills by exploring already existing branding methods, and identify the most effective methods on a municipal level to strengthen the link between SMEs and the municipality with a special emphasis on SMEs with focus on tourism. This is to create employment and a more attractive local area where residents and tourists want to come and stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities and methodology: \r\n\r\nWe will have four different workshops on different topics hosted by different partners. During and between the workshops all partners and participants will work on different tasks:\r\n\r\n1. Global/ European/ national/ local scanning\r\n\r\n2. How do we see ourselves? How do others look at us?\r\n\r\n3. Traditional/ non traditional branding methods/ tools\r\n\r\n4. Local action plans on branding\r\n\r\nAll workshops will be aimed at learning the learners, being the first target group the staff members like municipal development professionals and teachers. During each meeting, a lecture on each topic will be made by Exesios, to which vocational student and SMEs on tourism will attend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs some of the partners can bring very good examples of tourism projects, the University of Almer\u00eda, together with Ceut\u00ed Town Council and the collaboration of the rest of partners, will develop an intellectual output: a Study and Analysis of Tourist Resources to provide advices to foster process innovation and entrepreneurial activities in rural areas. It will include a toolkit and recommendations for local and regional authorities on branding and local action plans, innovative ideas for SMEs, contents for vocational schools curriculum and a guide to create apps for smart phones with the aim of promoting tourist resources and local SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and impact:\r\n\r\nThe partnership is built up on common needs and all partners have been/will in near future work with branding and tourist planning together with local SMEs in the tourism sector. All partners have different experiences and different knowledge about branding and will bring new methods and ways of seeing things to the partnership. Expected results are new networks, new knowledge and skills on branding, cooperation with SMEs, development of methods, SWOT's, do's and dont's, new learning process, a movie, the intellectual output, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLongs-term benefits are: more attractive partners' territories, creation of employment in the tourist sector, better skilled staff, students, workers in SMEs.", "http://www.exesios.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA202-004521_6"]]}}}}
