AROSU will implement a novel production concept able to extend industrial robot usage as an active assistant during the complex and demanding artistic work of hard natural stone carving. This will be achieved through the implementation of a novel robot cell able to produce artistic looking surfaces by implementing the following core components. 1) new robot mounted pneumatic chisel tool; 2)automated path generation from geometry data provided by a design interface for architects and artists. With AROSU it will be possible to improve the competitiveness of the stone processing industry, by drastically increasing the production efficiency through a novel co-operative workspace, in which sculptors and the robotic work-cell can jointly work on the natural product, with a vast range of different products with different sizes.", 205408.0, 1193212.0, 5, 8, "AROSU", "http://www.arosu.eu/", "http://www.shop.g-gibson.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159154.jpg", "fp7_111176_951893981"]]}}, "5PN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Bookworms In Europe: Improving Reading Skills And The Motivation To Read Books", "Monk Fryston Voluntary Controlled Church of England Primary School", 63710.0, 6, 6, "Raising achievement in reading is a concern for all European countries. There is a strong body of evidence to suggest that increasing motivation for reading impacts positively upon reading achievement. The DFE publication: \"Research evidence on reading for pleasure\" (May 2012) succinctly articulates this importance. Our project is informed by this research and aims to increase the skill level of teachers involved so that they become more proficient in the teaching of reading and enable all children to improve their achievement.The project will bring together professionals to focus upon and share the strategies that they employ successfully to teach reading. These will, through shared observation and peer review, be the focus of case studies that will be collated to form a professional pedagogical handbook on the teaching of reading. Alongside this we will investigate ways to enthuse and motivate children to read more widely, but holding special book events, publicising reading activities, and engaging in creative and fun opportunities to increase motivation. Children will correspond with their European partners and share work on reading, providing a context in which they can develop wider interest in reading activities. They will create and share work on an agreed theme that provides purpose to their reading, thus encouraging participation. They will produce a book for partner children that will be published ans shared, demonstrating the value in books and reading. They will extend their understanding of European partners and consequently develop more tolerance and understanding. It will provide an authentic context in which to apply their foreign language skills, helping to demonstrate purpose.The outcomes of the project will influence the staff in each school, but will also be used to inform academic journals, teacher training opportunities, and initial teacher training. This will provide impact and sustainability beyond the life of the project.", "http://www.monkfryston.n-yorks.sch.uk", "Monk Fryston Voluntary Controlled Church of England Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024475_coordinator"], [2015, "Sukces dziecka w naszych r\u0119kach", "Monk Fryston Voluntary Controlled Church of England Primary School", 47876.0, 3, 4, "Modern eduction for every student, disabled too, has been our kidergarten's aim for many years. We believe that strong basis which they get in kindergarten will help them to achieve good results at school and to live in a present world. They will become confident and aware of their self - esteem and it will prevent from exclusion from our educational system. It concerns also disabled children, we treat them in the same way as every child. Our educational offer includes a participation of them, too. Such intentions are possible thanks to open staff of our institition: teaching and admistrative - service. That is why our staff is willing to upskill within Action 1 in Erasmus+ program. We wish to realize eTwinning projects and Action 2 in Erasmus+ program.\r\nThe main goal of the project is improving the quality of education in our kindergarten by creating conditions for acquiring professional and linguistic competencies connected with specificity of the institution. It contributes to achiving the best results of work with a child, including disabled children and their families.\r\nDetailed objectives include participants' needs which were indicated in carried out diagnosis and analysis of needs. Implementation of a project will completely fulfil these needs, which concern mainly:\r\n- improving and enhancement of pedagogical - psychological qualifications related with work with a child, including disabled children and their families\r\n- using innovative methods of teching English language during work with a child\r\n- enhancement of using communicative English language in order to make it easier to implement bilingualism and innovation based on immersion method (2 teachers working with children: in mother tongue and English language) \r\n- getting ability of practical using ICT technolgy during work with a child\r\n- getting experience within institution's organization of work\r\nThe aim of our activity is implementing innovative, methodological - curricular and organizational, solutions at pre - school level. We believe that teaching certain competencies will benefit at further levels of education. \r\nAchieving these objectives will be realized by following activities within 67 mobilities for 31 person:\r\n1. Attending Intensive English courses by the headteacher of our institution which will correspond to her individul needs: director as a businessman, entrepreneur, leader.\r\n2. Attending English courses by teaching and administrative - service staff in order to gain the skill to communicate in English language.\r\n3. Attending methodological courses within teaching children English language in order to use creative methods of work and multimedia technologies\r\n4. Attending methodological courses for specialists within using various methods of work with children with disfunctions, especially for autistic children.\r\n5. Taking part in job shadowing by representatives of particular communities of kindergarten (headteacher, administration, teachers). Institutions invited for partnership completely belong to implementation of objectives and assumptions related to described needs. Both of them, Turkish - Erzurum and English, teach English. Getting experience in different areas is particularly valuable: English - speaking institution where mother tongue is English and institution which teaches Englsih using immersion (2 teachers working with children: English - speaking and Polish - speaking).\r\nMoreover, institution from Antalya, Turkey will increase our experience and skills in the range of work with a disabled child.\r\nAccording to objectives, participation in a project will contribute to better affecting on child and families. All the skills and experience acquired by teachers will basic abilities, new linguistic competencies and high quality of education. Implementation of a project will indicate to municipality particularly the importance of acquired experience in order to enhance workers' professional competencies and high standards of education. Moreover, it will indicate the importance of lifelong education. It will encourage parents to use new possibilities and methods of work with a child in order to achieve good effects and prepare them to live in constantly modifying reality. Participation in a project will encourage teaching staff from other institutions to acquire professional competencies and experience from different educational systems as a way to success during work with children and their families. It will enhance the quality of education.", "http://www.monkfryston.n-yorks.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA101-015505_2"]]}}}}
