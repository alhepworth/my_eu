The aim will be to develop a new and scalable cockpit application which can extend operations of aircraft in degraded conditions \u2013 \u201cAll Conditions Operations\u201d. A key objective will be to deliver an extensible application that can be applied to many aircraft types.  This will necessarily entail a new cockpit infrastructure capable of delivering enhanced situation awareness to the crew whilst simultaneously reducing crew workload and improving overall aircraft safety.   All Conditions Operations, other challenging applications and the desire for reduced crew will mean that the crew station interface will be challenged beyond the reach of the current state-of-the-art. Accordingly, a radical rethink is required to manage the escalating complexity whilst simultaneously enhancing safety and controlling through life cost.  Thus, the next significant step in cockpit design will require a holistic integration of technologies allowing the crew to process and act on information concurrently and intuitively, using an optimum combination of their visual, tactile and audio senses.  In the concept envisaged, use will be made of precision navigation, synthetic vision, high integrity data bases, sensor and sensor data and image fusion, obstacle warning systems, taxi autopilots, touch screens, large area displays, voice/audio and multimodal input/output devices to deliver an All Conditions Operations application integrated within an enhanced crew interface. A major objective will be to deliver a common, and open standard interface which can manage existing core applications across all aircraft types whilst simultaneously supporting the needs of challenging new applications.

Evaluation comments have been fully addressed; WP structure completely revised and the consortium strengthened, particularly by addition of Airbus as Technical Lead.  Aircraft data networks have increased dramatically in complexity throughout the history of powered flight. Modern networks must support many nodes with a wide range of span lengths, bandwidths and protocols. Existing systems, chiefly based on copper conductors, have evolved to support these ever-increasing demands. These networks have consequently become larger, heavier and more expensive, and this trend is set to continue. A coordinated step change to fibre optics would reduce network size, weight and cost and improve the modularity, flexibility and scalability. Moreover, fibre brings many other advantages including EMC immunity and improved security. By defining networks according to a DAL-based hierarchy, the flexibility of photonics can be harnessed within the constraints of safety certification restrictions.  Terrestrial telecoms provides a rich source of technology. However, R&D is required to adapt terrestrial photonics for aircraft networks. Cabin systems have been identified as the most immediate application area: here the need for high flexibility (driven by customisation), high bandwidth (driven by information-to-the-seat) and large node count mean that the technology and business cases for photonics are compelling.  The primary objective of DAPHNE is to enable the full exploitation of terrestrial optical networking technology in future European aircraft and systems. The project will adopt key component and network technology from commercial markets and develop and validate future aircraft networks to take European aircraft systems capability well beyond current state-of-the-art and be suitable as a platform for future development", 200507.0, 5691697.0, 7, 17, "DAPHNE", null, "http://www.whl.co.uk", null, "fp7_92056_999729337"], [1441065600000, 1567209600000, "EXTREME Dynamic Loading - Pushing the Boundaries of Aerospace Composite Material Structures", "Agustawestland Limited", "The European industry is currently a world leader in aviation and to maintain its leading position and competitiveness in the dynamic global market, Europe\u2019s industry must develop quickly and efficiently high quality products by meeting time-critical market demands and customers\u2019 needs.

The market demands shorter cycles of new technology integration and, on the other hand, competitors enter the market with aggressive prices. \nIt is forecasted that in 2050, innovative products and services demanded by the market will be based on state of the art design, manufacturing and certification processes with a significant reduction of the environmental impact. Recent studies have shown   that the development and deployment of new structural technologies will have the greatest impact in the reduction of weight and operational costs compared to other technologies. Against this background, composite materials technology is of fundamental importance to current and future aircraft structures where high specific properties and integration of multiple functionalities are essential to improve weight, fuel efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions, and certification costs. The vulnerability of composite structures to localised, dynamic, sudden, and unexpected loads, may result in unpredictable complex localized damage and a loss of post-impact residual strength. \nThe aim of the EXTREME project is to develop novel material characterisation methods and in-situ measurement techniques, material models and simulation methods for the design and manufacture aerospace composite structures under EXTREME dynamic loadings leading to a significant reduction of weight, design and certification cost.", 188438.0, 4461290.0, 7, 14, "EXTREME", null, "http://www.whl.co.uk", null, "h2020_193408_999729337"], [1178236800000, 1209772800000, "Clean Sky Support Action", "Agustawestland Limited", "'The 'Clean Sky ' Joint Technology Initiative aims at realising a quantum leap in the technological capability of Europe to produce aircraft that satisfy environmental needs and are economically viable.
