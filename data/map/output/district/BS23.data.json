The results will be cascaded down to all teaching staff through action-research laboratories and job-shadowing experiences, in order to get to as many students as possible.\r\nTo make the process easier, we have created a Mobility Group Work which will organize the material produced and gathered during/after mobility and make it available, through a digital archive.\r\nAs to students, we expert:\r\n-          An improvement in students\u2019 motivation and study method\r\n-          An  increase in students with special educational needs success \r\n-          An increase in excellence results at Esame di Stato (school leaving exam)\r\n-          A decrease in dropout rate\r\nOn a larger scale, on the territory, we will provide exchange and spread of material and methodologies with other schools (secondary schools but also lower secondary and primary); this will be possible thanks to a network activity which has already been implemented.\r\nMoreover, updates to students\u2019 families on the project-related activities  - on open-school days, at yearly programme presentations, on the school website, on eTwinning, on the school  newspaper - will improve the visibility and the efficiency of the work done.\r\nThe increasing number of teachers trained to teach CLIL will make it possible to apply this methodology to all the three-year period classes.\r\nThank s to training in new technologies, we expect many more teachers involved in PNSD; this will turn into a more effective and conscious use of LIMs, labs and integration of new technologies in the teaching process.\r\nIn the long run, through the contacts with colleagues and other European schools, meaningful relationships will be created, that will be also useful to build the foundations for new transnational projects.", "http://www.weston.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047898_1"], [2014, "\u00d6ffnung der Schule gegen\u00fcber dem europ\u00e4ischen Ausland und der internationalen Wirtschaft", "Weston College", 23768.0, 7, 7, "Our project is entitled \u201cOpening up towards our European neighbours and international economy\u201d (We commonly voted and agreed on this as one of three new school guidelines which we regularly have to communicate to our school authority.)\r\nBy launching it, we intend to progress our lessons as well as the vocational qualification provided at our college.
