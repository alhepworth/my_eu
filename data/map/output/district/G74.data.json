However throughout the different project periods the number of participants belonging to this target group has only slightly increased and with new formats changing eligibility conditions which implemented the intermediate evaluation of Erasmus+ Youth in Action to show that the target group is still underrepresented especially in the field of EVS.\r\nThe Strategic partnership wants to make a contribution towards a more inclusive EVS program strand. The Strategic Partnership is a cooperation project with organisations from Scotland (A&M Scotland), Italy (Porta Nuova Europa Pavia), Bulgaria (Associaction \u201cInspiration\u201d Ruse) and Germany (Jugendakademie Walberberg). During this project organisations who are active in the sector of European and national voluntary services and who work with young people with fewer opportunities  want to explore the conditions under which an EVS for this target group can be implemented.\r\nNeeds addressed by this project: By way of taking their long-year experience in the field of EVS for young people with fewer opportunities into consideration the consortium assumes if young people with fewer opportunities should sustainably integrated into the EVS and gain from the projects a regional approach is crucial. Regional organisations (youth welfare organisations, vocational schools, schools for children with learning difficulties, vocational training centres, centres for extracurricular education etc.) who work with the target group should be won in order to implement EVS-activities in their organisations. In addition, they should form networks for further cooperation and for utilizing synergies.\r\nThe project reaches out for the following objectives:\r\n1. Exploring the conditions for tailor-made EVS-Projects for a regionally/nationally diverse target group on the basis of 15 EVS-projects (short term and long term EVS and two short term group EVS projects\r\n2. Offering training measures for the regional networking organisations in the field of peer education, project monitoring in EVS-projects for young people with fewer opportunities, independent application for European youth mobility projects after the Strategic partnership\r\n3. Participation of the regional politicians working in the field of youth policy in the regions which take part in the project. The cooperations aim to improve the regional conditions for international mobility measures (visibility, ressources etc.)\r\n4.

They will conduct scientific research of the project and evaluate it. At the end of the project they will present the results on a national and European level and, therefore, ensure the dialogue between research and practical application of the results.\r\nThe following activities will take place in order to achieve the objectives:\r\n1.) Setup of regional networks who take part in the regional training activites in order to implement EVS activities by themselves and to offer peer education/blended learning activities in their organization. \r\n2.) Realization of 15 EVS projects within the regional networks for young people with fewer opportunities in two phases. An interim evaluation after phase one/one year might lead to an adjustment of the formats/blended learning activites/different appoaches. \r\n3.) Meetings of the consortium, the regional networks, young people with fewer opportunities and regional politicians who are responsible for youth policy in order to initiate structural changes in regional youth policy\r\n4.) Dissemination of the project results on a multipliers event/on several national meetings in the field of international voluntary services and presentation on regional events (for example charity events, cultural events, talk rounds etc.)\r\nThe concept of the project is based on mixing both formal and non-formal learning approaches encouraging the active involvement of participants, giving them space to take an active role, express themselves and share their own experience. The following methods will be used: project management methods, presentations, field visits, team building methods, methods from the field of diversity management, systemic consulting and conflict resolution and creative methods.

They plan to go together to Salignac. This immersion course will support Rosemary and Anabel in extending their skills and expertise in teaching French to children in Sanderson High School, a special needs school in South Lanarkshire. This is an application for two applicants who are very enthusiastic and have already some knowledge of the French language. Rosemary did the 12 week course on primary language learning delivered by LFEE and Anabel is studying French in the Open University. The LFEE immersion course will provide tuition, cultural activities, resources and copious opportunities to develop partnerships and professional connections.\r\n\r\nSanderson High School has embraced the 1+2 Language learning in the school. This strategy is being implemented across the authority and involves pupils being introduced to a second language from nursery until primary 7 and beyond. Pupils are also taught a third language in the early stages of their education. Our headteacher, Aisling Boyle, is committed to improving attainment across the curriculum and this includes the learning and teaching of modern languages. Anabel Prieto is a native of Spain, she is currently teaching Spanish to several classes in the school and plans to teach French to pupils from S1 to S6 in the near future. Rosemary Cuthbert has been teaching French for the last two and a half years to primary pupils with additional support needs. She attended the Languages For Education in Europe French teaching course and was an active member of the French steering group in her previous school. She wishes to continue teaching French as part of her professional development and is very interested in giving the experience of French teaching to pupils with complex learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nBy participating the LFEE immersion course, we hope that Rosemary and Anabel can return to school with more knowledge, skills and ideas to lead future whole school developments in French which build upon these projects and help us to achieve our improvement priority, and to embed languages across the school. Currently, our school has no links with European Projects or partnerships with French schools and so it is hoped that by taking part in this project; these important links can be made and the skills needed to maintain them will be created.  \r\n\r\nIn line with \"Teaching Scotland's Future\" (Donaldson Review) the immersion course will help Rosemary and Anabel to extend their understanding of modern languages through building links with teachers across Europe which they are looking forward to sharing with their colleagues. As a result there will be a stronger understanding of relevant pedagogy leading to improved learning and teaching.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosemary and Anabel return from this course, it is hoped that they will have much greater confidence and be up skilled in teaching French and, in the future, other modern languages. They will have gained an in-depth understanding of French culture and will become  more aware of cultural norms in contemporary France which will then be transfered to our staff, pupils and wider community. Anabel and Rosemary's newly gained knowledge, skills and expertise will ultimately improve teaching methodology for languages within our school and help us to reach our improvement priorities as well as meeting local authority and national policies and targets for primary language learning. Rosemary and Anabel's experience on this course will help us to embed French across our school and help us to move away from teaching French discreetly as a once a week lesson to a holistic model.  As part of the steering group they plan to label the school using dual language labels to begin with and move towards extending this to include our school's chosen third language. She will encourage all children across the school to refer to these labels on a daily basis.

This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee. The budget is established taking into account Erasmus funding, the contribution of partner companies, the Lyc\u00e9e, family and a financial grant from the Region Ile de France. The activities and results of the project are widely disseminated in newspapers, and websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2: Consists of a 5 month European mobility which is suitable for students who have just passed a diploma in the Cookery and Catering sector and having now a CAP, a Vocational B TECH or a Technology BTECH. They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation.
