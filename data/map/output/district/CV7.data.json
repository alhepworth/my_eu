The aim of CloudFlow is to enable engineers to access services on the Cloud spanning domains such as CAD, CAM, CAE (CFD), Systems and PLM, and combining them to integrated workflows leveraging HPC resources. Workflows are of key importance in today's product/production development processes were products show ever increasing complexity integrating geometry, mechanics, electronics and software aspects. Such complex products require multi-domain simulation, simulation-in-the-loop and synchronized workflows based on interoperability of data, services and workflows.CloudFlow is an SME-driven IP incorporating seven SMEs: Missler (CAD/CAM), JOTNE (PLM), Numeca (CAE/CFD), ITI (Systems), Arctur (HPC), Stellba Hydro (hydraulic machines/hydro turbines) and CARSA (business models and security).

Starting from the analysis of needs in manufacturing SMEs from diverse sectors in Europe (aerospace, automotive, medicine, ...) on the one hand, and the IoT technology offer on the other hand, the project will put in place favourable framework conditions to enable matchmaking and encourage the creation of smarter manufacturing tools and their integration in manufacturing SMEs. A hundred of support cases involving SMEs corresponding to different development stages (feasibility, prototyping, demonstration) will be selected through a call for proposals to receive funding and support, in view of further developing this new industrial value chain in European SMEs and improve their competitiveness on the global stage.", 118185.0, 4324364.0, 5, 8, "IoT4Industry", null, "http://www.the-mtc.org", null, "h2020_214774_959490342"], [1388534400000, 1514678400000, "European Robotics Challenges", "The Manufacturing Technology Centre Limited Lbg", "The European manufacturing industry needs competitive solutions to keep global leadership in products and services. Exploiting synergies across application experts, technology suppliers, system integrators and service providers will speed up the process of bringing innovative technologies from research labs to industrial end-users. As an enabler in this context, the EuRoC initiative proposes to launch three industry-relevant challenges: 1) Reconfigurable Interactive Manufacturing Cell, 2) Shop Floor Logistics and Manipulation, 3) Plant Servicing and Inspection. It aims at sharpening the focus of European manufacturing through a number of application experiments, while adopting an innovative approach which ensures comparative performance evaluation. Each challenge is launched via an open call and is structured in 3 stages. 45 Contestants are selected using a challenge in a simulation environment: the low barrier of entry allows new players to compete with established robotics teams. Matching up the best Contestants with industrial end users, 15 Challenger teams are admitted to the second stage, where the typical team is formed by research experts, technology suppliers, system integrators, plus end users. Teams are required to benchmark use cases on standard robotic platforms empowered by this consortium. After a mid-term evaluation with public competition, the teams advance to showcasing the use case in a realistic environment. After an open judging process, 6 Challenge Finalists are admitted to run pilot experiments in a real environment at end-user sites to determine the final EuRoC Winner. A number of challenge advisors and independent experts decide about access to the subsequent stages. A challenge-based approach with multiple stages of increasing complexity and financial support for competing teams will level the playing field for new contestants, attract new developers and new end users toward customisable robot applications, and provide sustainable solutions to carry out future challenges.", 85535.0, 18282836.0, 10, 55, "EuRoC", null, "http://www.the-mtc.org", null, "fp7_110374_959490342"], [1472688000000, 1567209600000, "Industrial scenarios for connected factories", "The Manufacturing Technology Centre Limited Lbg", "There is a consensus among industry and policymakers that Europe is currently in the middle of an industrial revolution initiated by the digitisation of industrial processes.

The ConnectedFactories project will build upon these activities and consolidate their expert networks, aiming at industrial consensus building across Europe. The ConnectedFactories project will establish and maintain a structured overview of available and upcoming technological approaches and best practices that are needed for mastering this paradigm shift.

The objectives are to develop the manufacturing processes identified in the call: (i) Additive manufacturing (AM); (ii) Near Net Shape Hot Isostatic Pressing (NNSHIPping) and (iii) Investment Casting of Ti alloys. The end-users specify the properties and provide computer-aided design, (CAD) files of components and these components will be manufactured using one or more of the three technologies. During the research programme, experiments will be carried out aimed at optimising the process routes and these technologies will be optimised using process modelling. Components manufactured during process development will be assessed and their dimensional accuracies and properties compared with specifications and any need for further process development identified. The specific areas that will be focussed on include: (a) the slow build rate and the build up of stresses during AM; (b) the reproducibility of products, the characteristics of the powder and the development of reusable and/or low cost tooling for NNSHIP; (c) the scatter in properties caused by inconsistent microstructures; (d) improving the strength of wax patterns and optimising welding of investment cast products. The process development will be finalised in month 30 so that state-of-the-art demonstrators can be manufactured and assessed by partners and end-users, during the final 6 months. The cost of the process route for components will be provided to the end-users and this, together with their assessment of the quality of these products, will allow the end-users to decide whether to transfer the technologies to their supply chain.
