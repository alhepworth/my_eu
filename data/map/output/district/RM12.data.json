Increasing the uptake of RES is crucial if Europe is to achieve ambitious energy and emission reduction targets. However, despite steep increases in energy prices the uptake of domestic RES is still very limited. The initial investment required means that the payback period frequently exceeds 20 years, which is a clear disincentive to homeowners. This is mainly due to the cost associated with integration of RES within domestic heating and hot water systems, and is especially relevant if a combination of RES are deployed. The efficiency of these technologies is also often limited due to the inherent mismatch between energy supply and consumption. This can be overcome by deploying a suitably sized thermal store. However, this is often difficult due to space constraints in existing homes. Furthermore, effective combination and use of multiple RES is complicated by the lack of standardised intelligent controls and the sheer number and types of systems available. These factors limit the appeal of RES and virtually prevent customers from adding capacity over time. The main objective of SmartHeat is to develop a platform technology for domestic heating and hot water that enables easy and cost effective integration and use of multiple RES. The key enabling technologies include: i) a common, intelligent control system capable of effectively utilising a combination of RES and thermal stores; ii) a modular phase change material store that enables increased thermal storage within existing buildings. We will be able to a) demonstrate up to 50% reduction in installation costs for a combination of RES; b) a 20% performance improvement for an air source heat pump and up to 25% for a solar thermal system. As a result we will be able to reduce payback by up to 50% for a wide range of RES, heating and hot water system combinations", 655240.0, 2271765.0, 7, 14, "SMARTHEAT", null, "http://www.ciphe.org.uk", null, "fp7_97982_993564017"], [1322697600000, 1417305600000, "\"Development and demonstration of a dynamic, web-based, renewable energy rating platform\"", "The Chartered Institute of Plumbing & Heating Engineering", "'In order for the EC to achieve ambitious renewable energy targets there is a strong need to accelerate market penetration of Renewable Energy Systems (RES) in both industrial and domestic sectors. The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology. This will enable consumers to make better informed decisions and will allow our membership to provide better service. This will help to significantly increase market penetration and revenues for our pan-European membership involved in the design, manufacture and installation of domestic renewable energy technologies.'", 551378.0, 2572890.0, 7, 14, "EAGLE", "http://www.eagle-fp7.eu", "http://www.ciphe.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153217.jpg", "fp7_101434_993564017"], [1280707200000, 1375315200000, "Portable Real Time Detection of Airborne Asbestos Fibres for Tradespersons", "The Chartered Institute of Plumbing & Heating Engineering", "Asbestos-related diseases are the leading cause of occupational death in Europe. 500,000 European workers, mostly within the construction, demolition and remediation industries, are expected to die by 2030. Despite a ban on asbestos use, our members\u2019 workers are continually exposed to this potent, invisible carcinogen from legacy products such as insulation, water tanks, ceiling panels, floor tiles and textured wall coverings. We feel that this level of risk is completely unacceptable for our members and must be addressed. Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique. This work stalled due to technical and cost barriers; barriers we now believe we can overcome. We have assembled a world-leading consortium to extend this early research and develop a low-cost portable detector that can be worn by the worker to continuously monitor their work environment. By developing the ALERT system, we will provide 30 million European workers with a means of detecting asbestos the moment it is disturbed, allowing them to protect themselves and avoid becoming one of the 100,000 people worldwide killed each year by exposure to asbestos.", 305486.0, 1891061.0, 5, 12, "ALERT", null, "http://www.ciphe.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/149412.jpg", "fp7_107810_993564017"], [1288569600000, 1383177600000, "An Universal Flexible Low-cost Plumbing and Heating pipe system fully Environment-compatible by using innovative Nanoparticle technology", "The Chartered Institute of Plumbing & Heating Engineering", "The building and construction community in Europe includes about 150000 plumbing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning contractor SMEs with 1.2 million employees generating a total turnover of \u20ac130Bn.

Under floor heating, radiator heating and plumbing systems accounting in total 1.7 million kilometres of new piping in Europe, of which 56%, namely 0.96 million km are plastic pipes. 46% of these plastic pipes are made of PEX, which due to its cross-linked nature is not recyclable. Recycling of multilayer pipes with encapsulated aluminium results in highly toxic by-products. About 3500 tonnes of scrap plastic pipes is disposed of in land fill due to the use of non-recyclable plastics.\n\nOur idea is the development of a universal flexible plastic pipe system suitable for under floor heating, radiator heating and drinking water distribution. We propose to develop a pipe without PEX, and without an integral aluminium layer to allow 100% of the pipe scrap to be recycled. We will achieve this by replacing aluminium or expensive EVOH oxygen barrier materials with innovative nanocomposites in combination with a redefined wrapping technology.\n\nThe plumbing and heating contractors will benefit from selling a new innovative fully environment-compatible universal pipe system providing: savings in costs for storage, transportation, and logistics; improved work facilities (easy to install and bend); waste cost savings and CO2 emission savings.
