However, their active participation in society is not reflected sufficiently in policy and decision-making, especially in relation to digital issues. Because of this, they are not well represented and unheard, and this makes it hard for research and policy to identify and understand their needs. These issues are further complicated by the fact that the group is a swiftly moving target, it is as heterogeneous as the wider society, and young people can be unwilling to be subjects of research.\n\nThe WYRED project (netWorked Youth Research for Empowerment in the Digital society) aims to provide a framework for research in which children and young people can express and explore their perspectives and interests in relation to digital society, but also a platform from which they can communicate their perspectives to other stakeholders effectively through innovative engagement processes. It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centred around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people\u2019s needs in relation to digital society.\n\nThe project is informed by the recognition that young people of all ages have the right to participation and engagement. It has a strong focus on inclusion, diversity and the empowerment of the marginalised. The aim is to replace the disempowering scrutiny of conventional research processes with the empowerment of self-scrutiny and self-organisation through the social dialogue and participatory research.", 123440.0, 867604.0, 7, 9, "WYRED", null, null, null, "h2020_205667_928136547"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing among Young People through Yoga", "Teen Yoga Foundation", 168264.0, 5, 6, "One of the key challenges in effective work with young people is their frequent lack of engagement, a characteristic that many of those who spend time with adolescents (youth workers, parents, teachers) can attest to. Proposed solutions frequently fail to address core issues relating to the intrinsic motivation of the individual, which is directly related to well-being. Many young people suffer from chronic stress and other issues that inhibit the functioning (and indeed the development) of the prefrontal cortex, and this also affects their intrinsic motivation to engage in any activity. In short, unless their well-being is addressed, they cannot engage effectively. \r\nThe HIPPOCAMPUS project aims to address these issues by promoting the well-being of young people through the practice of a range of techniques derived from yoga. This ancient practice, which has been extensively misunderstood in the West, can be described as a \u201ctechnology of wellbeing\u201d. Derived from a confluence of traditions, it provides a series of techniques for enhancing well-being and promoting a healthy body and mind. It does this through a bottom-up approach, working through the body and mind to create wellness. To be specific, what yoga techniques do is shift the body and mind from the \u201cfight or flight\u201d state of stress, to the \u201crest and digest\u201d state of calm, with attendant decreases in cortisol levels and heartbeat. Neuroimaging research shows that these practices (also found to some degree in mindfulness) lead to changes in the areas of the brain responsible for emotional regulation and perspective taking.\r\nMoreover, the physical postures, breath regulation and relaxation techniques practised in yoga are especially relevant and effective in young people. Studies have shown regular sessions of yoga help young people to increase body confidence and health and provide an effective and safe method of dealing with stress, which increases their emotional well-being, with attendant benefits in variety of aspects of their lives, including social interaction and participation and learning. Yoga has been indicated to be particularly effective for disadvantaged young people, who frequently exhibit higher than average levels of stress and ill health.\r\nThough the benefits of yoga have been researched extensively, and in some places these practices are used with young people, they are not always accessible to all sectors of society. Disadvantaged young people particularly are less able to participate, for a variety of financial and other reasons. The Hippocampus programme, though it is available to all, focuses especially on the needs and requirements of these groups. \r\nThe project aims to reach around 650 people in diverse youth organisations in five countries (ES, IT, BE NO, UK) during the finance period, and many more after. The activities involved are organised into various phases. The initial phase involves the design and development of the programme and the supporting app. The programme will include descriptions and sequences of yoga-based activities, advice and guidelines, especially for staff who will incorporate yoga-based practices into their work, and advice and resources such as infographics for implementing the programme in different youth contexts. The development phase is then followed by an implementation phase which occupies the larger part of the three years because the implementation is in \u201ccascade\u201d to ensure reach to all the organisation and benefits for all the disadvantaged young participants. Initial roll out is to staff who first learn the practices and then later how to integrate them into their own activities. Then the practices are introduced in dedicated sessions with one group of young people, before being integrated into all their activities by the staff. At the end of the process the staff and young people will be self-sufficient with regard to these practices. In a final extension phase the process is repeated for the rest of the organisation, who by then will have witnessed the benefits and are expected to be receptive to it. Throughout the implementation there will be impact monitoring and evaluation of the results. In the final year through dissemination and exploitation activities we will raise awareness of the activities and roll the programme out to other youth organisations. \r\nThe consortium has extensive expertise and experience in working with disadvantaged young people, yoga-based practices, social media design and development and projects of this kind. They have access to diverse contexts for implementation including youth organisations, cultural centres for migrants, municipal organisations, and schools contexts.

Until recently we thought we knew: intergenic sequence must be largely \u201cjunk\u201d and mutations that, for example, affect genes but not the protein (synonymous mutations) must be effectively neutral. This degenerate genome view accords with the nearly-neutral theory\u2019s prediction that selection will be weaker when populations are small. But is this all there is to it? I shall investigate two new interrelated perspectives on genome evolution. First, I suggest that to mitigate errors, owing to our high error rates, our genome can be under stronger, not weaker, selection. Second, that errors might be a source of evolutionary novelty. Error mitigation, my team has shown, often involves selection on seemingly innocuous mutations such as synonymous changes. Remarkably, we discovered that selection to ensure error-proof splicing is possibly more prevalent on synonymous mutations when populations are small, making seemingly innocuous mutations stronger candidates for human diseases. I shall provide the first test of the new error-proofing perspective through comparative genomic analysis on synonymous site evolution. To investigate error as a source of novelty I shall consider whether expression piggy-backing (expression of a gene affecting its neighbors) forces rewiring of gene networks. Importantly, I shall translate our new understanding to enable better diagnostics and improved therapeutics. I shall develop a much-needed computer package to identify candidate disease-causing synonymous changes. In addition, knowing how synonymous sites modulate splicing will allow me to design better intronless transgenes. Transgenes must also be inserted in genomic regions immune to piggy-backing.

This conceptually simple but methodologically sophisticated epidemiological approach could become an early warning system for outbreaks of disease and a unique tool for the identification of hot-spots for pandemics. This will be achieved through bringing together leaders in the field across Europe in academia, research institutes and the private sector and utilising their expertise and commitment in training a highly employable cohort of researchers who will acquire advanced knowledge in the field through an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral training programme delivered by world class research-led organisations and industrial partners.", 580210.0, 3319673.0, 9, 11, "SEWPROF", null, "http://www.bath.ac.uk/", null, "fp7_105058_999842924"], [1235865600000, 1346371200000, "Genomic approaches to metabolite exploitation from Xenorhabdus, Photorhabdus", "University of Bath", "The majority of compounds used to treat diseases come from a single group of organisms, the actinomycetes.

Many diseases are caused by proteins aberrations, and proteins are frequent targets of intervention. Mapping all proteins and their functions are expected to yield pervasive medical and biotechnological benefits. However, even the most comprehensive and high-throughput proteins discovery technologies are seriously challenged by the extreme diversity and low abundance of many proteome components; a problem, compounded by the lack of affinity reagents and validated probes for sample preparation and identification. Our concept is that shorter protein fragments, or peptides, may offer solutions to many of these problems as peptides may represent or mimic proteins. Using in situ solid-phase peptide synthesis, computerized photolithography and novel photochemistry, we have recently generated peptide microarrays of up to 2 million addressable peptides. This unprecedented high-density and high-content peptide microarray technology could make inroads into the kind of high-throughput analysis needed to address the entire human proteome. Here, we aim to exploit this potential by using and improving three different, yet complementary, label-free detection technologies allowing sensitive, high-resolution determinations of the identity, quality and/or modification of individual members of a peptide microarray, and real-time monitoring of any interacting molecular receptor.

Autism can have profound impact upon learning and it is estimated that 54% of individuals with autism also have intellectual disability/learning disability (CDC, 2010).Whilst inclusion policies have encouraged children with ASD to be placed within mainstream classrooms, this has been argued to put unfair pressure on teachers, and for the child with ASD to experience \u2018integration without social inclusion\u2019 (Barnard, 2002: 25).

Intercultural and democratic competences are crucial for the future of Europe, its countries and its citizens.  Education can play a central role in developing the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes among young people. Universities have a double role in this: they have to educate academics who can and want to contribute to such an inclusive and democratic society; and university-educated teachers, educational researchers and curriculum developers  who will work in schools and other educational institutions on empowering young people for active citizenship participation.The pedagogical role of teachers in contributing to a more inclusive and democratic society is very important in this period of European history in which growing globalisation challenges traditional values. Strengthening the international cooperation in all parts of Europe is very relevant to broaden the horizon of students, teachers, and academic researchers. A more inclusive and democratic society is as relevant for the future of Europe as economic growth. Education, and in particular teachers, can contribute to this moral enterprise. As research shows, attention towards democratic and intercultural issues are at the moment not very strongly embedded in the curricula of teacher education and educational science. This proposed strategic partnership aims to support democratic intercultural citizenship education in different ways, such as by developing a joint curriculum, and through the professional development of academic staff.

Much remains to be done on the basic biology of stem cells to provide new tools for cell therapy trials.

In general, cell therapy necessitates a continuous cross-talk among biologists and clinicians as well as crossing boundaries among different tissues/diseases. Despite many structural and functional differences, epithelia and skeletal muscle share some key features such as spatially ordered cell architecture, centered on a supporting basal lamina to which stem cells are anchored. Indeed mutations in structural proteins linking the cell membrane to the basal lamina are responsible for similarly devastating diseases such as muscular dystrophies and epidermolysis bullosa. A multi-tissue approach allows jointly addressing and solving not only scientific and clinical problems but also regulatory and ethical issues related to these novel procedures.

Physiological angiogenesis is controlled by a complex interplay between cells and their environment: the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides signaling via numerous ECM adhesion molecules and growth factors bound to ECM polysaccharide components; and cells locally degrade and remodel the ECM to create pores into which angiogenic endothelial cells migrate. This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration. In some of our scaffold materials, porosity is inherent by virtue of fabrication, and in others porosity is created by cell-associated proteolysis as it is in physiological angiogenesis. All materials will be designed so as to be injectable or implantable into the human body. In some work, the final injectable/implantable material will comprise only materials and bioactive biomolecular signals, and in other cases it will also comprise cells.

Importantly, we have already initiated a monocentric clinical trial that focuses on the efficacy of NO-donors plus NSAIDs in muscle pathologies. Our efforts will be complemented by novel biodelivery systems for effective targeting. Our efforts will be complemented by novel biodelivery systems for effective targeting. The most promising drugs, used alone or in combination, will be first validated in small and large animal models. Our project brings together leading investigators to examine how vascular and muscle progenitors participate in postnatal growth and muscle tissue repair. A key issue that this project addresses is the tissue environment in which endogenous stem cells are activated. We propose that muscle degeneration and fibrosis provokes altered vascularization and immune responses, which eventually affect negatively stem cell functions. Molecules that can be used to therapeutically target these key cells, and their communication with neighboring vascular, inflammatory and fibrotic cell types, will lead to more effective approaches to muscle regenerative medicine and to novel cures for degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis, vascular damage in diabetes and in peripheral ischemic vascular disease.", 251563.0, 13724057.0, 6, 22, "ENDOSTEM", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015/155747.jpg", "fp7_94224_999677345"], [1228089600000, 1354233600000, "Promotion of plasticity as a treatment for neurodegenerative conditions", "Dando Weiss & Colucci Limited", "Neurodegenerative diseases all cause damage to the circuitry of the nervous system, with loss of connections, axons and neurons. The loss can be gradual, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rapid as in stroke, or intermediate as in the delayed neuronal loss after stroke. Following damage, the nervous system is able partially to compensate through the formation of alternative connections and pathways, a process known as plasticity. Adults are therefore able to regain considerable function after stroke, and to compensate for the synapse and cell loss of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until it reaches a critical level. Children undergo a period of enhanced plasticity in most parts of the CNS at the end of development, known as critical periods. During these periods their ability to compensate for damage to the CNS is in many cases much greater than in adults. The overall concept behind this application is that restoration of the function in neurodegeneration can be achieved through plasticity (the formation of new functional connections, withdrawal of inappropriate connections, modulation of synaptic strength). Promoting increased plasticity in selected parts of the adult nervous system back to the level seen in children is a powerful method of enhancing recovery of function in animal models. Plasticity-promoting treatments could therefore be beneficial in a wide range of conditions that damage the CNS.  The PLASTICISE project integrates scientists from four scientific areas 1) Development of methods to promote plasticity 2) Development of models of neurodegenerative disease 3) Imaging of plasticity at the macro and micro level 4) Study of recovery of function through plasticity in human patients with brain disorders. The concept that unites the partners is the belief that treatments that enhance plasticity will become one of key medications that will improve neurological function in the damaged human nervous system.

The locomotor activity pattern is the result of the circuit design and the interplay between the firing properties of the CPG constituent neurons and their synaptic interactions. Spinal cord injury impairs the function of the locomotor circuitry and results in paralysis. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the assembly of the spinal locomotor circuitry, the function of its key excitatory components and the intrinsic plasticity in the healthy and injured spinal cord is a prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic methods to restore locomotor function after spinal cord lesion.   The work-packages have been designed to elucidate the key molecular pathways responsible for the development and assembly of the spinal circuitry for locomotion. The intrinsic function and modulation the spinal circuitry will be examined in the healthy spinal cord by combining sophisticated molecular, anatomical, pharmacological and electrophysiological tools. The mechanisms of plasticity and reorganization of the circuitry will be examined in the injured spinal cord as will the mechanism to promote regeneration of the lesioned axons.

Over the age of 80, 50% of the population is suffering from hearing loss. A large portion of this population is affected by sensoryneural hearing loss (SNHL), a consequence of a progressive degeneration of the primary auditory neurons (ANs), the afferent neurons of the cochlea. These ANs are the target cells of the neurotrophic cochlear implant \u2013 a neural prosthesis that will be designed by the partners of NeuEar to provide both electric auditory cues and regenerative neurotrophic factor(s) to severe-profoundly deaf patients. The ongoing degeneration of ANs that occurs over time is a limiting factor in current cochlear implant efficacy. The exogenous application of neurotrophic factors can prevent these degenerative changes. This project aims to develop an encapsulated cell (EC) therapy device capable of long-term intracochlear neurotrophin production in combination with a cochlear electrode implant. The aim is also to develop a versatile encapsulated cell implant that could be used to deliver regenerative factors to the cochlea even without the electrode part in future applications. The project brings together an SME capable of making clinically and regulatory compliant EC therapy devices with an industrial partner already on the market with a successful cochlear implant. These companies will work closely with two academic partners with expertise and resources to select, evaluate, and validate the neurotrophic cochlear implant. It is the intention of this consortium to make a clinically relevant implant with an associated preclinical package for regulatory submission over the next three years.
