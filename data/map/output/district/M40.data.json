Often in international projects or the ones including intercultural dialogue, learning or diversity sessions will include one sessions of 1.5 or 3 hours where a simulation or a games will be implemented, with fast debriefing (if at all), which will introduce very fast concept of stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination and taken for granted and not pushed outside of the comfort zone. Of course this is not a constant in the field but rather an observation after years of working in international field. \r\n     The main need that this project wants to answer to is the lack of advanced intercultural working competencies and sensitivity in youth work field and especially of the ones active and working in international, multicultural or global settings.  \r\n     This project will empower and enable youth workers with intercultural competencies and sensitivity which will be transferable towards very clear excluded or discriminated groups, as well for changing the believes of young people having discriminatory thoughts and also in more sensitive and not easily detectable settings. Some of the partners are already working with people with fewer opportunities, often target by intolerant attitudes and they will very fast transfer in their work.\r\nThe main goal of this project is to increase the level of intercultural competent, sensitive and quality youth work field for youth organizations from Norway, Romania, Italy, Greece, Portugal, UK, Poland, Latvia, and Hungary\r\nThe structure of the project combines international mobility and local activities. \r\n-\tLocal research and selection of multipliers.\r\n-\tFirst training for developing intercultural competencies in Balestrand (27 participants, beginners in the field), between 7-16th May 2018 (see attached the proposed timetable and methods).\r\n-\tLocal Practice Phase (delivering intercultural learning workshops/sessions for at least 30 people in each country \u2013 total 270 young people.\r\n-\tSecond training for advance competencies and development of new tools in ICL - in Balestrand (27 participants experienced youth workers in the field) between 6-15th May 2019, (see attached the proposed timetable and methods).\r\n-\tLocal Practice Phase \u2013 apply the new tools developed in another series of intercultural learning workshops (at least 270 in total/ 30 in each country).\r\n-\tFinal evaluation (online)\r\n-\tLocal dissemination and follow-up activities", "http://www.afristarsfoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-NO02-KA105-001115_4"], [2017, "GEN\u00c7 DO\u011eA KA\u015e\u0130FLER\u0130", "Afristar Foundation", 21111.0, 7, 7, "Its content / background:\r\nThe city life wrong urbanization policies and envronment without green areas doesnt allow most of us to be in relation with the nature properly. Buildings, cars, offices and shopping centers started to take up a large space in our lives but humans have decreased interaction with the nature. Although we are close to green, we can\u2019t find time to go into nature or we prefer to spend time at home. We can\u2019t manage to keep away from the noise and traffic, we get stuck among the buildings, we sometimes don\u2019t prefer.\r\n\tNatural environment allows people to enjoy the environment they live in, the environment has nostalgic value fort hem and becomes an importan soruce for urban wild life so it emphasizes the value of presence\u2019 so it is known that benefitting from natural environment passively contributes greatly to the personal welfare of the people and affects their physical health positively.\r\n\tThe objectives of our Project:\r\n\tThe main objective of the Project is : to encourage the young people for natural life, nature awareness and to use natural products.\r\nThe specific objectives:\r\n1-\tTo increase the love of nature in the young\r\n2-\tTo raise awareness in the young people about the importance of natural life.\r\n3-\tTo give information to the particpants about the health problems that the artificial food causes.\r\n4-\tTo develop the willingness to lead a life in natural environment and to protect natural life.\r\n5-\tTo teach the participants how natural food is produced.\r\n6-\tTo raise awareness in the local people about protecting natural habitat.\r\n7-\tTo encourage natural food production.\r\nThe number and the profile of the participants:\r\nThere will be 44 participants from 7 countries in our Project. There will be 5 young people and 1 leader from each partner, 2 leaders and 6 youngs from our group. The age limit in our Project for the participants is 18-30, for the leaders it is at least 25 but there is no upper limit. In our Project there will be ones socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can\u2019t participate in the Project because of economic reasons. The countries from which the participants will be selected are Bulgaria, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom. \r\nThe methodolgy to be used:\r\nGame, ice-breaker, Ice breakers, energizer, practice, question-answer, interactive presentations, discussion in groups, games in teams, field work, collecting the herbs and fruit growing on their own in the nature, collecting natural products, visits to Ortanca and Dadal\u0131 and talks, making jam and canned foods, making bird nests in groups, planting trees, interview with those who have a picnic, preparing signboard in workshop, planning the future and individual work for dissemination and group work, oral evaluation, implementing survey. \r\nThe description of the activities:\r\nMeeting integration, training of setting up a tent and making shelter, we discover the envirnment by orienteering, we are integrating, Time for Erasmus + and youthpass, how much do we love nature?, what do we do for nature?, The end of day evaluation, hunt for trasure, district cleaning, trekking, get health in nature, the end of day ebaluation, collecting herbs, making natural foods, visit to Ortanca Village, Dadal\u0131 Village, making canned foods, corn party, the end of day evaluation, making bird nest, memorial forest, we are meeting picnickers, the end of dsy evaluation, time for advertisement, we are preparing a signboard, my mission in the future, preparing bulletin, disssemination plans, Overall evaluation and survey, presenting youthpasses,.\r\nEpected results and impacts:\r\n It will increase the young people\u2019s love of nature. It will raise awareness in the young about the importance of natural life. The participants will be informed about the health problems the artificial products cause. The young will be more willing to protect natural life and lead a life in naural environment. The participants will learn how natural foods will be made. Awareness will be raised about protecting naturl habitats in local people. They will become more conscious about encouraging natural food production. They will learn about different cultures with cultural actvities, they will respect differences, they will develop new friendships. \r\nLong term benefits:\r\n The participants will raise awareness natural life and life in nature, clean environment and environment awareness through the activities of the Project, it will contrbiute to writing new proects.
