They do not corrode; have a longer predicted service life, leading to less frequent replacement; they are less expensive to install due to their light weight and flexibility; and have significantly lower leakage rates due to having an all-welded system. However, their more widespread use is being restricted by the lack of a reliable non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method for the welded joints. Pipeline leakage does not only cause high repair costs but can also result in disastrous environmental consequences and even in loss of life. This project will develop phased array ultrasonic NDE procedures for butt fusion and electrofusion joints in PE pipes of diameters up to 1m and also for pipes in other plastics materials, including PVC, ABS, PP and PVDF. In addition, the project will also develop an automated inspection system that will be able to inspect pipe-to-pipe and pipe-to-fitting (elbows, bends, reducers, tees, etc) butt and socket joints in various plastic pipe materials and diameters between 90 and 1000mm. The development will be made by manufacturing welded joints containing known flaws. The NDE data will be analysed to determine the limits of flaw detection for each technique. In parallel, the significance of flaw size and quantity will be established in relation to service requirements. This will be achieved by long-term mechanical testing of joints containing known flaws, and comparison with results for welds containing no flaws. The prototype equipment, designed and built as part of this project will be assessed under both laboratory and field conditions.", 27073.0, 2841324.0, 7, 15, "TESTPEP", null, "http://www.fullflow.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/146612.jpg", "fp7_94545_991819860"], [1464739200000, 1559260800000, "Ultrasonic Phased Array Non-Destructive Testing and In-Service Inspection System for high integrity Polyethylene Pipe Welds with automated analysis software.", "Plasflow Limited", "\u2022 The need arises from the greater use of PE pipes with a lower capital, installation, operation & maintenance cost and corrosion free during service but is limited through not having a suitable NDT technique to check the integrity of the welded joints between pipes\n\u2022 The objective is to take recently developed FP7 inspection/NDT technology for polyethylene (PE) pipe welds, from TRL6 to a TRL9 commercial product that will be exploited globally by the consortium partner providers to the consortium end user, Tier1/2 suppliers and other customers in the EU and globally by product sales and services. \n\u2022 Funds are requested from consortium members TWI, M2M, Plasflow, Tecnitest\n\u2022 \u20ac1.9m of funds is requested\n\u2022 The money will be used for the enhancement, meeting of specific application site testing requirements and the commercialisation of Ultrasonic Testing technology, software, technique validation, standards and technician training/certification.\n\u2022 Funds will enable the application specific product enhancements to be made and to support product/service/support commercialisation\n\u2022 Ultrasonic equipment, transducers, software suppliers and service inspection/NDT companies as well as end-user nuclear plant, gas/water utilities, mines will all benefit\n\u2022 Target market covers nuclear NPP, gas & water utilities, mining & process plant with a total size of 11.5billion welds.
