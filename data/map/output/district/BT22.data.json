A resilient organization effectively aligns its strategy, operations, management systems, governance structure, and decision-support capabilities so that it can uncover and adjust to continually changing risks, endure disruptions to its primary earnings drivers, and create advantages over less adaptive competitors. From an organisational point of view the concept 'resilience\u201d has two fundamental acceptations: operational resilience, and strategic resilience. Nowadays, few organizations question the flexibility-agility operational resilience approach, but if renewal is to become continuous and opportunity-driven, rather than episodic and crisis-driven, then companies immersed in an accelerating pace of change also need to embrace an accelerating pace of strategic evolution. REMPLANET research will consider and balance both key subjects in the context of machinery and equipment global manufacturing networks; operational flexibility-agility, and strategic innovation-renewal. REMPLANET model and tools will focus on the integration of the customer driven innovation influence in the products and manufacturing processes design, and the responsiveness to customised market demands of the related non-hierarchical global manufacturing networks processes under a real-time non-centralised decision making context. Theoretical research and related tools will be contrasted, validated, and enhanced through empirical cases (pilots) from different machinery and equipment enterprise networks which have multi-site and multi-nation manufacturing plants,  as well as customers distributed around the globe.'", 152855.0, 3442178.0, 5, 14, "REMPLANET", "http://www.remplanet.eu", null, null, "fp7_91288_985895973"]]}}}}
