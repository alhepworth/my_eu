Despite increased security, most security measures remain fragmented and static i.e. inappropriate for confronting sophisticated and asymmetric attacks. FINSEC is a joint effort of prominent stakeholders in the financial sector and global leaders in physical & IT security, towards introducing a novel standards-based reference architecture (RA) for integrated (cyber & physical) security. The RA will enable timely preparation against attacks, while at the same time facilitating stakeholders\u2019 collaboration for risk assessment/mitigation in the financial supply chain, as a means of confronting complex threats and their cascading effects. \nFINSEC will provide a mature implementation of the RA, based on the enhancement and integration of novel solutions of the partners (eg., Anomaly Detection, AI CCTV Analytics, Risk Assessment Engines, Collaborative Risk Analysis & Management, Compliance), which will be bundled in a toolbox. The RA implementation and the toolbox will be validated through realistic pilots involving stakeholders in the identification, assessment and mitigation of threats. The five pilots involve high-impact scenarios including SWIFT network protection, buildings and ATM networks security, peer-to-peer payments network protection, risk assessment for insurance purposes and securing financial SMEs. \nThe pilots will engage >=500 security & finance experts, while providing a representative coverage of the financial services industry (ie. banking, capital management, insurance, card & P2P payments), which is a sound basis for FINSEC\u2019s broader impact. Towards maximum impact, FINSEC will establish an ecosystem of security solutions for the financial sector, which will be supported by the partners\u2019 dense network of sales, marketing, standardization and regulation channels worldwide.", 243901.0, 8880106.0, 10, 22, "FINSEC", null, null, null, "h2020_214346_988050052"], [1351728000000, 1446249600000, "Technology Enhanced Learning Livinglab for Manufacturing Environments", "Clear Communication Associates Limited - Cca", "The TELL-ME project (Technology Enhanced Learning Livinglab for Manufacturing Environments) aims to develop and trial in authentic contexts (SME-driven human-centric and service-oriented manufacturing workplaces) an innovative cross-enterprise methodology and IT platforms for continuous education and training in heterogeneous business ecosystems, blending Precision Teaching (PT) lifelong learning and Living Lab (LL) participative co-creation aspects in ways that can address more business needs than traditional training.This responds to several EU 2020 Strategy indicated in several Flagship Initiatives like 'An Agenda for new skills and jobs', 'An industrial policy for the globalisation era', 'Innovation Union' and 'Digital Agenda for Europe' and summarised in the two questions below:- How can SMEs blue collar workers in less advanced industrial sectors keep the pace of innovation of technologically advanced ones?- How can TEL-based training be positioned and improved, in order to have more impact on industrial sectors' innovation and resilience?Five main challenges have been identified as fingerprints of the TELL-ME proposal:- Human-centred manufacturing and the increasing need to consider human factors and workers wellbeing in the production processes;- Service oriented Manufacturing and its increasing need to open, breed and govern globalised business ecosystems;- Learning Ecosystems are the new frontier of collaborative value networks on a global and cross-sector market;- Living Labs of SMEs and their need to constantly develop business-technical-social-market innovation via co-creation and inspirational environments;- Learning at the Workplace and its need for fast, punctual and personalized life-long learning that takes account of fluency-driven approaches to training, and trends in using TEL and OER for self-regulated learning.", 217220.0, 6643693.0, 8, 17, "TELL ME", null, null, null, "fp7_106474_988050052"], [1435708800000, 1561852800000, "TCBL \u2013 Textile and Clothing Business LabsTransformative Business Models for the Textile Clothing Sector", "Clear Communication Associates Limited - Cca", "TCBL uses Europe\u2019s Textiles & Clothing (T&C) industry as test beds for evolutionary-driven co-design, dynamic optimisation and deployment of business models. It aims to increase the performance of a sector that, over the past two decades, upheld three main strategies to handle global competitive pressure: cost-oriented, product/service-oriented and productivity-oriented. TCBL provides a business experimentation framework for exploring variations on such strategies. The framework will be supported by Knowledge Spaces as a generative force and Business Services as an enabling force. A network of Business Labs will be set up, based on three key variations: Design Labs (e.g. creating emotionally-oriented immaterial value), Making Labs (e.g. converting skilled labour into material value), and Place Labs (e.g. generating spatial community- and socially- oriented value). Each of these Labs will explore the issues of cost, product/service and productivity enhancement in a transversal manner and from cross-disciplinary perspectives - including economic, anthropological, and engineering approaches as well as new business values such as environmental and social responsibility, sharing economy, social enterprising, customer-driven small series production (the focus of this call) and emergent or disruptive technologies. With these tools, and supported by an open Associates Programme, TCBL will carry out real-life experimentation and market deployment of a number of Supply Chain, Localisation, Business, Skill Management and Policy innovations involving no fewer than 160 workshops, laboratories and manufacturing plants at EU level with at least 15,000 T&C workers involved. In addition, 10 new innovative companies will be generated within the supply chain of T&C, enabling the diffusion and scaling up of results.

Augment training in situ with live expert guidance, a tacit learning experience and a re-enactment of the expert, in knowledge-intensive environments where effective decision making, often in new situations, has high impact on effectiveness in production. Bring learning content and technical documentation to life via task-sensitive Augmented Reality (AR). Make final products flexible for workplace integration via industry-standard repositories and toolkits. \nHOW: Wearable TEL platform enhances human abilities to acquire procedural knowledge by providing a smart system that directs attention to where it is most needed. An extensive audit of industry procedures, policies and participatory design methods will define the main facets of the platform. User test cycles will refine prototypes and deliverables. Existing wearable smart devices and sensors will be tailored to provide an innovative solution for content delivery and measurement of user performance. Comparative tests, stakeholders\u2019 review and leading the IEEE AR group will secure high-standard academic and industrial outputs. \nRELEVANCE to work programme: WEKIT is strongly aligned with EU job/training policies (e.g., Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs). It enhances the industrial value chain, reduces fragmentation/cost and improves efficiencies with impact regarding speed and scale in production. Looking ahead: roadmap shows safe skill pathways for use of TEL in changing industrial landscapes (e.g. smart machine-to-machine (M2M) knowledge-sharing).
