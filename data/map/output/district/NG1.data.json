To measure effectiveness of the serious game we will study the rate of recidivism in the first 48 hours to two months after prisoners leave detention.\r\n\r\nThis way we are able to measure the impact of the game almost immediately and improve the game. The game will focus on new learning possibilities to be applied in prisons: digital tools, games that educate, train and inform, can provide an alternative sustainable learning tool for disadvantaged groups. Many among the end-users have learning disabilities and reject more traditional teaching approaches. \r\n\r\nAt the moment many prisoners and others at the edge of society have big problems finding their way to the labor market. Many inmates have no diplomas and no or little access to digital media. Excluding this disadvantaged group from 21st century developments will only widen the gap between them and the labor market. The SEPE certificate (Supporting Employability and Personal Effectiveness) that we will work with is a flexible approach in which a portfolio is used as a tool to assess the outcomes of non-formal learning.

Researchers have noted a worrying decline in public interest in and understanding of plants, at the same time as others are calling for greater public awareness of biodiversity, conservation and the value of plants. Botanic gardens, as institutions that hold documented collections for the purposes of education, scientific research, conservation and recreation (Wyse Jackson, 1999), have the potential to be places wherein our disconnection with nature is re-established. Dodd & Jones (2010) point out that if botanic gardens are to stay relevant to the 21st century world they need to examine their role within a framework of social and environmental responsibility. Common to most botanic gardens is the desire to broaden their audiences, and to undermine the perception that they are just for a particular elite of white, middle-class, older people. But as Dodd & Jones (2010) point out this also requires skills that many botanic gardens professionals may lack. The LearnToEngage Partners will design and pilot a modular blended-learning course. The units of the course will be Working with Diverse Audiences, Interpretation, Science Communication, Research and Evaluation. This will offer botanic garden professionals a flexible Professional Development opportunity that will promote equity and inclusion in botanic garden education and encourage the delivery of high quality, well researched, innovative public engagement. The project has the following objectives:-Enhance inclusive education in botanic gardens through practitioner training-Develop innovative blended learning models for training botanic gardens on public engagement (what we want to do)-Enhance botanic garden professionals\u2019 access to C-VET through embedding training in the digital era (why we want to do it)-Improve services through training on new areas of work for botanic gardens-To support the development of transnational standards for evaluating informal education -Increase botanic gardens\u2019 capacity for showcasing the value of plants and plant science to society. The overall project methodology will include four overlapping phases. Each phase will correspond to the development and piloting of a unit and will include the following major elements: -Designing the course structure and content. This will be included in two intellectual outputs (Trainer Handbook and Participant Handbook) and online resources-Piloting the unit and collecting evaluation data-Reflecting on the delivery of the course and analysing the evaluation data-Finalising intellectual outputs including course structure and contentEach unit will be led by a different botanic garden who has expertise in the area of focus. RBGE will lead the Working with diverse audiences unit, ULisboa will lead the Research and Evaluation Unit, in collaboration with NTU and MUSE will lead the Interpretation unit and the Science Communication unit, in collaboration with BGCI.  The courses will be delivered onsite at the leading Partners garden and online through RBGE\u2019s Virtual Learning Environment (Propagate Learning).      The project will deliver training to 80 botanic gardens professionals from approximately 44 gardens in the UK, Italy and Portugal. Special attention will be paid to ensuring that priority is given to gardens with small funding, those who have not previously attended comparable training and for other reasons do not have access to professional Development training. Considering the respective audiences of the potential participant and the Partner gardens, the public engagement produced or influenced as a result of the project has the potential to reach up to two million visitors. The units delivered as part of LearnToEngage will be seen as a pilot. It is hoped that the project Partners and other gardens around Europe and the world, will use the Participant and Trainer Handbooks, developed through the project, to deliver further LearnToEngage courses. Considering the fact that botanic gardens see over 500 million visitors each year (Sharrock, 2015), the potential in-direct audience of the project is very large and therefore the project has the potential to be effective in reconnecting the public with nature and engaging them with plants. Through delivery of the project it is expected that participants in the units will further develop their ability to produce effective public engagement and engage new audience groups effectively, as well as sharing their learning with their colleagues, in this way the project will improve the public engagement offered by botanic gardens in UK, Portugal and Italy.

Increasing educational chance of children with speech and language impairments/problems by creating pre-assessment mechanism to use by teachers at kindergarten and primary schools.\r\n2. Intervening at the earliest stages of speech and language development (from the age 4 to 10) by appropriate language support and therapy.\r\n3. Helping children to fully benefit from the education with speech and language pathology online tool that will include mobile assesment, practical exercises and gamification aspects. \r\n\r\nSpeech and language therapy online tool will be design by the project consortium with different tests with fun activities for kids such as games, flashcards and worksheets to make pre-assessment both for speech disorders and language disorders. Teachers (at kindergarten and primary schools) will use the tests to write what (s)he hear from the kid and at the end there will be a final score. This score will calculate according to the well known and accepted scientific/pedagogic tests about speech and language pathology. If the score is not enough to pass the tests, teachers will inform the psychological consultant of the school to talk with parents for extra-curricular speech lessons and activities.\r\n\r\nThis tool will be avaliable on internet and freely downloadable from Google Play and  App Store so teachers from kindergarten and primary school, children\u2019s parents and caretakers will easily access and use them.

You can imagine a whole spectrum of preventive measures how to fight with plagiarism and other bad habits not only in academic world effectively. Most of the project partners are already in very close cooperation in the field of academic integrity. There have been efforts to communicate on a common platform before, but this initiative creates the opportunity to formalise and expand this kind of cooperation. The \u201cumbrella\u201d ENAI platform will be a trans-national portal for disseminating and sharing high quality resources for promoting academic integrity to a wide range of stakeholders. But this project is not just about a platform. There is a main goal to prepare a \u201ccontent\u201d of this platform, to teach people how they should behave in education, academic research and also in their career. The content includes methodological materials for teachers, self-evaluation and self-assessment tools, interactive courses as well as distance learning (blended learning) and many other supporting tools. All these outcomes represent very innovative tool kit because there are no other similar common materials for academic integrity on EU level like this. An important aim will be to raise awareness in the matters of plagiarism, academic ethics and academic integrity. ENAI will be focused not only on HEI students and their teachers (our main target group), but on whole academia (professors, post-docs, PhD, administration staff and management, including academic ethics committees, etc.) and future HEI students (high school students) and their teachers. It means that ENAI will address such misbehavior in academia as cheating, plagiarism, scientific misconduct, mobbing (bullying), and so on. One unifying and international body representing interests of many institutions all over the Europe could be also a great advantage in potential negotiations on higher levels. For now there are 12 core partners across Europe (project consortium) of which 11 represent universities. But many others claimed their readiness for future cooperation under ENAI platform. The phenomenon of academic integrity is obviously interdisciplinary topic as you can see in the case of project consortium. There are many different faculties and departments (economic, medical, ICT..) and even Slovak information center for science, technology, innovations and education as a representative of business point of view participate in project activities. Moreover many other institutions from EU and beyond are willing to participate in future ENAI platform. Nine of them are supporting us directly by official Letter of Support. There are 3 expected outputs as main project results. First of all we will work on educational materials for HEI teachers and students. It means design of course for teachers and modules for students including videos, FAQ about plagiarism, didactical notes or typology of intertextual mistakes. Second output consists of tools for cross-sectoral cooperation as a manual, real-life examples or even workshop for high school students and teachers. Last but not least we will prepare a handbook (tool-kit) including general guidelines, four kinds of self-evaluation tools, academic integrity self-improvement in a nutshell or glossary of terms. The project activities to reach these outputs are based on qualitative research in particular countries when researchers investigate country specifics and examples of best practice. Then they are working together at joint training events. Moreover there will be held an international conference every year where other stakeholders can discuss the project outcomes and give us such necessary feedback.European Network for Academic Integrity (referred as ENAI platform) will be a consortium of HEIs and other relevant stakeholders which will share their experience and best practices in the field of academic integrity. The platform will continually work on project activities after the project is finished - develop materials, organize events (namely annual conferences), circulate information amongst partner universities.

Studies show that individuals' soft skills have a fundamental importance in their subsequent employability. As a part of the soft skills include entrepreneurship competence, considered as a key competence for growth, employment and personal fulfillment. Entrepreneurship and enterprising behaviour are important objectives for education and lifelong learning policies in the EU.  Taking into account this importance, the final report of the expert group from the EC (2009), entrepreneurship is included in the national curricula for vocational education in a majority of European countries. However programmes and activities included by these figures differ greatly in intensity and effectiveness. The VET sectors in Lithuania, Portugal, Latvia, Turkey have no national  curricula  for Entrepreneurship Competence development and greatly need this.  The proposal for EC Council recommendations on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning(COM(2018)24 final)  defines that in support of competence-oriented education, training and learning, there are three challenges  identified: the use of a variety of learning approaches and contexts; support for teachers and other educational staff;  and assessment and validation of competence development.  The  VESVET project combines a transnational consortium of organizations with highly professional expertise in areas related to these challenges. \r\n\r\nThe main AIM of the project is to promote the development and validation of entrepreneurial competences among  VET learners in practical situations, and foster entrepreneurship training competences in VET teachers/trainers/practice supervisors. \r\nPROJECT OBJECTIVES:\r\n- to prepare a methodology for the evaluation of Entrepreneurship Competence development for VET learners based on the LEVEL 5 approach which will also be accessible online.\r\n- to create an innovative game based  training course to support VET trainers in the design of their own curricula with integrated entrepreneurship modules;\r\n- to create an interactive video scripts based Trainer/Supervisor Handbook that explains the rationale behind the training course targeted at entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nDirectly, the project addresses 160 VET students and 60 VET teachers and trainers  who will participate in learning activities.

It is also known as desktop fabrication. It is a prototyping process whereby a real object is created from a 3D design. The digital 3D-model is saved in STL format and then sent to a 3D printer. The 3D printer then prints the design layer by layer and forms a real object.Nowadays almost everything from aerospace components to toys are getting built with the help of 3D printers. 3D printing is going to impact so many industries, such as automotive, medical, business & industrial equipment, education, architecture, and consumer-product industries.3D printing technology allows users to turn any digital file into a three dimensional physical product. One of the good things about this printing technology is that it changes the dynamic of consumer culture. In other words, it turns users from being passive consumers to active creators.Schools are still in the early stage of adoption of 3D innovative technology. 3D printing provides several features that can revolutionize education. Those are: 1) It provides teachers with 3 dimensional visual aids that they can use in classroom particularly in illustrating a hard to grasp concept.2) 3D printers make it easy for teachers to seize the interest of students compared to just showing the pictorial representations of objects.3) It enhances hands-on learning and learning by doing. Using this prototyping technology, students will be able to produce realistic mini models. 4) It provides more interactive class activities. In biology, for instance, teachers can create a 3D model of the human heart, head, skeleton etc. to teach students about the human body.Given all these attributes, 3D printing seems to hold some promising and ground breaking innovation that will definitely assist in the fulfilment of a productive educational experience.Main aim of the \"3D modelling curriculum and applications for 3D printers and tabs for VET schools\" (3D for VET Schools) project is to create a comprehensive 3D modelling curriculum and training module for VET schools that will include five key design principles (alignment, strategy, learning outcomes, assessment, validation).

A reluctance that seems to be accentuated by more difficult economic conditions and lower education levels.  Furthermore, because we find more of these young people in the more disadvantaged segments of society (eg. amongst NEETS) indirectly they will be more likely to disengage, to stay out.  Our exploratory interviews showed, that for many this \u2018staying out\u2019 is a consequence of a perception of being discriminated, of being neglected by those in power.At the same time our exploratory interviews showed that young people (whether or not living in difficult situations) are usually quite ready to identify issues they are concerned about, however they do not always seek a deeper understanding of the issues and can remain with fairly superficial explanations.  A sense of disappointment often prevents further discussion and tackling of these problems. We offer to develop a set of methodologies based on peer learning, new technologies and artivist practices.Target groups addressed:- young people between 18-30, living in multicultural areas of our cities, reflecting the local cultural / social diversity-  youth workers, educators, social workers, interested in learning new methodologies. - artists and activists, interested in social problems affecting the young people,  wishing to engage with young people's non formal education.- decision makers at local, regional levels, associations and institutions involved in youth empowerment, youth representation ObjectivesThe artivism project wishes to contribute to young people\u2019s empowerment, stronger social participation and active citizenship, implying a deeper understanding of key issues and better skills to discuss and present their opinions and to engage in dialogue.We also wish to contribute to high quality youth work, equipping youth workers with skills and techniques to use the arts as a means for expression of political and social opinions, and ultimately as a vehicle of social transformation. To achieve these objectives Artivism will develop and test a set of pedagogical methods:1. Peer learning workshops to identify key social and political problems relevant for them, invite experts to elaborate and discuss these issues and construct together an \u201cIdeas Bank for Social transformation\u201d for sharing their ideas. The application of Ideas bank is a very flexible online media with easy access, allowing collaboration across boarders.  It is an attractive contemporary tool that can used in parallel to the peer learning workshops and discussions with the experts as ideas get more and more defined.2. Construction of an \u201cartivism archive\u201d to record and collect experiences of artists that have used the arts to raise awareness and trigger engagement about social and political problems (up to the present there is no such publicly available compilation)3.  \u201cInitiation to artivism\u201d workshops involving young people and artists to learn about artivist approaches, make interviews with artivists and try out different techniques that artivists have used to address key issues4.  Artivism campaigns where youth and artists collaborate together to create artivist campaigns about the issues they have identified for local communities, stakeholders and a wider audience first locally then in an international artivism festival.Art is a powerful tool to grab direct attention and point to critical problems affecting our societies.  Artivists traditionally have been able to give voice and visibility to oppressed communities in creative ways, which act both on our understanding and our feelings.  Our interviews tell about a strong sense of disappointment concerning political life, often resulting in resignation.  Our contention is that artivism can offer attractive creative ways of engagement which can help to overcome this sense of resignation5.

Each university has a long and solid research and teaching trajectory with a special interest in matters of migration. The partnership has very clear objectives:\r\n1- To promote tolerance, inclusion and diversity in European societies. It is our belief that exposing university students to hospitable or inhospitable encounters in a corpus of films will promote critical thinking. \r\n2- To bring together scholarly research and innovative teaching. The analysis of films will show how scholarly research and teaching can bear on issues of pressing public concern. It is our belief that films present difference in a direct  way, for they shed light on the physicality of bodies, their transitions and movements though different places, borders and boundaries. \r\n3-To strengthen intercultural competences among students at the university level so they can look beyond the fixity of stereotype and probe into the causes of migration through personal stories. \r\n\r\nParticipants: number and profile: \r\nThe target group is university students at the 7 universities pertaining to the partnership who are  interested in multiculturalism and global studies.

The documentary is understood as a formative activity intended to boost the students' intercultural competence. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, The project will carry out three dissemination activities:\r\n1- Hospitality and Film: Radio Program: (Open University, Madrid). The programs are broadcast by the Spanish Public Radio Network\r\n2- Hospitality and Music: A Concert: (USAL)One of the pillars of the project is that music and art are the perfect media to explore hybridity and collaboration between and among different cultures. \r\n3- Hospitality and Hospitality and Film: A Conference (USAL). The conference will bring together all the research and teaching experiences derived from the project. There will be different panels that will roughly coincide with the theoretical axes the project has established for analysing the films. All the participants involved in the project will participate, apart from other invited speakers\r\n\r\nResults and impact: \r\nThe project will strengthten the partnership by creating a platform that shares information, scholarship, and transfers competences and didactic tools. It will introduce innovative teaching not only in terms of the methods but also in terms of the material discussed and analysed in class. The project will thus exemplify the crucible between teaching and researching and will make sure that inderdisciplinarity stays in the classroom discussions. Finally, the project will promote and reinforce multicultural skills in the students by reinforcing critical thinking.\r\nLong term benefits: The project has a strong impact potential in the current conversation about migration, the arrival of refugees, nationalist and exclusionary narratives and European identity. It will question different policies, value judgements, stereotypes, as well as social, cultural and religious scapegoating, but also the narrative and the language associated to migration. The\r\nproject will introduce positve changes that will start in the classroom and ripple out into society.", "http://www.ntu.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA203-038181_4"], [2017, "MODEration strategies of SCREEN abuse for Generation Y(outh)", "THE NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY", 172460.0, 6, 7, "Context/Background\r\nThe project aims at empowering young people (16-25 years old) to deal effectively with situations concerning excessive preoccupation with Internet or screen abuse.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nDesign, develop, test, implement and disseminate an innovative training framework and eventually a hands-on service  that will enable young individuals with excessive Internet or computer activity to modify computer behaviour for healthy computer use. \r\n\r\nNumber and profiles of participants\r\nThe partnership comprises 7 organisations:\r\n\r\nThe partnership's cross field aspect is demonstrated by a software expert with strong project management skills (P1-CIVIC), a technology institute dealing with ICT related issues of interest to youth (P2-NTL), a University partner specialising in Internet Addiction related problems (P3-NTU), an educational software company with proven expertise in Internet safety (P4-CCS),  2 NGOs, working on the personal development, well-being of young people (P5-CGA, P7-SSD), voluntarism and democratic actions, and on promoting equality, social inclusion and innovations in the society and, finally, a Training Organisation with expertise on skills acquisition and research activities in ICT learning with focus on youth (P6-Emphasis).\r\n\r\nApproach Methodology and Project Activities \r\n-User Models Design, which will comprise both the Situational Layer of personalisation with demographic data and the Behavioural layer with information concerning Internet.\r\n-Definition of Desirable Situations, which refers to a desired situation for the user in terms of Internet use. \r\n-Personalised Withdrawal Plans to achieve the desired situation will be defined, based on the user models and the informal classification of young people and the desirable situations based on classification.\r\n- Internet Addiction Genie Development, which will guide the process of data collection from young people, in order to classify them and elaborate personalised withdrawal plans composed of distinct actions.\r\n- Supporting Content Creation: Under this activity all actions under withdrawal plans will be supported by interactive multimedia content comprising Quizzes, Mini games, Cheat Sheets, animated explanatory videos.\r\n- Learning Motivation Environment Set-Up and Configuration to facilitate the envisaged trainings during the pilot period and later become the final delivery tool as outcome of the project. \r\n- Pilot Tests \u2013 Validation Workshops, which will assess whether project outcomes are able to answer users\u2019 needs with regards to screen abuse moderation and youth educators\u2019 competences on the issue.\u201cf2f\u201d workshops will be organised to test the above mentioned components from the point of view of learners. \r\n-Follow up and Support: Support for young individuals who have reduced screen times following the training.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nThe desirable impact is to enable young people with an excessive Internet use to correct their computer overuse following personalised withdrawal/moderation plans.

Often hardship and isolation from the 'norm' gives young people a story and a need for catharsis: there is no vocabulary for their experiences, so they must develop their own. Thus, the Mouthy Poets in Nottingham and #LoewenMaul in Braunschweig support young people to develop their personal, communication and professional skills and (intercultural) knowledge through the means of creative writing and performance as well as to enable them to produce and organise their own projects. This helps young people to identify who they are, to develop to who they want to be and to become who they never thought they were able to become through the support of both collectives. Creative independence and professional opportunities lead to employable, critical and engaged European citizens. \r\nThe Mouthy Poets, founded and led by their artistic director Deborah Stevenson, is a non-formal collective of 15+ year-olds with diverse backgrounds, differing in ethnicity, vocational status, gender, nationality and ability. In September 2013, Anne Hartmann from the Staatstheater Braunschweig and Deborah Stevenson created #LoewenMaul as a counterpart of the Mouthy Poets. The participants of #LoewenMaul are 15 year-olds and above. They share a similar diversity as the Mouthy Poets. In both groups there are participants with fewer opportunities facing social and economic obstacles as well as disability. \r\nAfter two staff exchanges and one participant exchange since 2013, we want to sustain and intensify this relationship with the Mouthy Poets by enabling both groups to collaborate fully with each other and directly in depth. We see the exchange that took place in April 2015 as a preparatory activity for the future exchanges we would like to carry out. It was also a chance to \u2018test the water\u2019 to see if participants from both sides could and were interested in working together and this is definitely the case. In our project \u00bbYoung Poetry across Borders - a European Encounter\u00ab, our main objectives are to open up possibilities of language and intercultural learning as well as widening the artistic scope and cultural awareness of the participants from both groups. We want to harness the personal and social development that comes via creative writing to empower the young Europeans and the staff to build a broader understanding of the European identity, of solidarity and tolerance, of intercultural dialogue and language awareness.\r\nFrom 24.10.-1.11.15 and in 17.-25.7.16, both groups will accomplish 2 Youth Exchanges between Germany and UK and the other way round. Each of them will last 7 days, excluding travel days. 20 Mouthy Poets will come to Braunschweig and 20 #LoewenMaul Poets will visit the Mouthy Poets in Nottingham. Both groups are invited to participate in and join a programme of different participatory activities, organised and curated by each group and their staff. Both exchanges will happen within a structured framework: at the premises of the Staatstheater Braunschweig and in Nottingham within Mouthy Poets\u2019 Poetry Performance Festival \u00bbSay Sum Thin 11\u00ab at the Nottingham Playhouse. We believe that the skills and experiences gained through creative writing and mutual support will have the most impact when they are performing and speaking out loud together to a public audience. The non-formal and informal learning will happen through facilitating workshops and different exercises for creative writing, editing and feedback, debates, hosting an open-mic as well as producing and presenting a poetry performance showcase together on one stage. Within that, we deliver peer-to-peer-learning-activities which target at language learning through poetry and city-specific exploration tasks where they write new poetry about the cities. These activities will be facilitated both by participants and group leaders of both groups as well as by staff of the Staatstheater Braunschweig. \r\nThe working methods used for both activities are: facilitating workshops, exercises and masterclasses in creative writing and performing; shadowing; formats of discussion (panel discussions, one-to-one-mentoring, peer-to-peer discussions); rehearsing; sharing creative feedback; filming as a means of evaluation; dancing; cooking together, reading local poetry; watching Eurovision Song contests and/or soccer games; intercultural city tours and other non-formal and informal activities. Beyond that, we want to acknowledge and validate the participants\u2019 commitment in the youth exchange and project, among others, in applying the Youthpass certificate.

Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", "http://www.centralnottingham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_7"], [2015, "Europa macht mobil am FJBK II", "Central College Nottingham", 42360.0, 5, 5, "This project will be the next step on our path towards Europe and the global market.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.Due to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.At a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.As this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad.

In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.All details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries.
