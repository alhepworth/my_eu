Growth in electricity from renewable sources is stalling due to intermittency, grid restrictions, curtailment, and high costs. Sustainable energy to supply the transport sector and heating demand are even further underexploited. GENCOMM will address these issues by developing a sustainable, renewable community-scaled, hydrogen (H2)-based, energy model based on the results of 3 pilot plants that will use local renewable sources to supply electricity, heating and transportation fuels.\nThe project will begin by addressing the communities, mainly remote, around the pilot facilities in the Western Isles (Scotland), Saar-Lor-Lux region (Germany, France, and Luxembourg), and County Antrim(, to then continue to expand throughout NWE region.\nGENCOMM aims to reverse the current situation in which communities meet 75-80% of their energy needs from non-renewable sources. The proposed model will allow renewable generated energy to: [1] be dispatchable [2] meet heating demand and [3] supply transportation fuels. Therefore, through the model, communities will be able to develop autonomous, secure and sustainable energy matrixes.\nThe main output of the project is an H2-based energy model. The second output is the adaptation of the model to a Decision Support Tool (DST), allowing communities to project and implement their own H2-based energy matrix.

Hospice Malta constantly strives to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the service delivery in order to fill the possible gaps that may exist. As educational and hands on tools, these job shadowing placements are seen as the necessary step to improve such efficiency and effectiveness. Objectives for these placements were set in a tangible manner to include shadowing of other professionals in their everyday duties targeting holistic palliative care directly with patients and through other indirect patient care, such as report writing, liaison with other staff members and other professionals. The number of participants is 11 and includes members of the professional multi-disiplinary team including nurses, doctor, complementary therapist, social worker, chaplain and physiotherapist. The placement will include job shadowing in the community, within palliative units and at the day care units. Exposure to data inputting, multidisciplinary team meetings, liaison with other professionals will also be part of their activities. Preparatory meetings for these placements to be successful were held with the partner organisations and a program was set up to target the aspects mentioned and to estimate an appropriate time frame. Participants will be chosen through a call for application followed by an interview with predetermined set criteria. Placements will then be organised with the partner organisations split over the 2 year timeframe so that local service provision is not disrupted. Staff will be asked to document the activities carried out and to point out the salient features and tangible points that could be implemented to improve the local scenario. Following the placement, information will be shared with the rest of the staff members via scheduled presentations. All the necessary documentation will be collated and filed to ensure that the project is on track, on time and within budget. It is envisaged that through this project, Hospice Malta will be able to contribute more effectively to the National Cancer Strategy formulation which is at the moment being drafted. Knowledge and skills gained will be shared internally through the annual in-house education program and also at a national level through placements, lectures and job shadowing of professionals and students that have become synonymous  with Hospice Educational Programs, including a biennale conference at a national level.

CLIL classroom practice provides a more holistic, purposeful and authentic way of teaching and learning languages, a view and hypothesis central to this initiative.\r\n\r\nLinguistic and cultural diversity of the European Union is one of its major assets, but also one of its main challenges. Throughout the last decade, European multilingualism policy has been guided by the objective set by the Barcelona Council of March 2002, which called for the improvement of mastery of basic skills, in particular, by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age. I\r\n\r\nThe improvement of quality and efficiency of language learning has become one of the key objectives of the Strategic Framework for Education and Training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019). The framework underlines the necessity to enable citizens to communicate in two languages in addition to their mother tongue, as well as the need to Promote language teaching and provide migrants with opportunities to learn the language of the host country. Language learning has also acquired a prominent place within flagship initiatives integrated in the European Union\u2019s overall strategy \u2013 \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 \u2013 promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In articular, language skills, as a means to encourage the cross-border mobility of EU Citizens, play a crucial role within the Youth on the Move initiative and the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs. Over the past two decades an increasing body of research has demonstrated that CLIL can enhance multilingualism and provide opportunities for deepening learners\u2019 knowledge and skills. CLIL has been seen to be a key lever in realizing some of the eight key competences for lifelong learning as recommended by the european Parliament in 2006. \r\n\r\nWhy does CLIL work? The logic lies in the acronym: in delineating that Learning involves the Integration of both Content and Language, CLIL makes explicit the fact that the learning of any content must involve the learning of the language associated with the content. At the level of schooling, successful education in either a first or additional language requires that learners are equipped with the language for thinking about the content. When learning through CLIL, where an additional language is used, language-supportive resources, methods and activities are actively and coherently used to enable learners to use language purposefully. \r\n\r\nKey findings: \r\n\u2022 In most European countries, CLIL provision is a part of mainstream school education. Pilot projects are operating in around ten countries. \r\n\u2022 In most cases, the target languages are a combination of regional and/or minority languages and foreign languages. \r\n\u2022 CLIL type provision may generally be associated with any subject in the school curriculum, although in some countries it is mainly used to teach science subjects or social sciences in secondary education. \r\n\u2022 The main barrier to CLIL becoming more widespread is the lack of appropriately qualified teachers. \r\nhttp://www.cedefop.europa.eu\r\n\r\nIntegrating STEM content with advanced foreign language instruction provides a unique way for students to gain foreign language capacities directly related to promising career pathways. Content and language integrated learning (CLIL), also referred to as content-based language teaching, simultaneously promotes skills in the target language and advances content knowledge, making this a promising approach for students to gain STEM skills in a foreign language classroom (Brewster, 2004; Mehisto, Marsh, & Frigols, 2008; Smala, 2009). \r\n\r\nProject-based learning (PBL) in a CLIL classroom fosters foreign language learning by engaging students in important, real-world projects and having students utilize their first and second language knowledge, skills, and abilities to complete the work. Project-based learning integrates all four language skills (listening, reading, speaking, and writing), incorporates collaborative team work, lends itself to clear outcomes, and challenges learners to use the foreign language in different capacities inside and outside the classroom (Stoller, 1997, 2010; Thomas, 2000). \r\n\r\nSuccessfully planning a thematic unit of PBL to integrate STEM topics into a foreign language classroom involves collaboration with STEM content teachers, identifying final outcome goals, creating guidelines for students, assisting students in gathering, compiling and reporting information in a second language, and and reporting information in a second language, and creating useful evaluation tools to assess student work.", null, "ST BRIGID'S PS TIRKANE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036550_2"]]}}}}
