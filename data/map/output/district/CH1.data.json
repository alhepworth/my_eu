The consortium is coordinated by IIS J.F. Kennedy.The project will involve 110 students of the penultimate year before the diploma; the mobility will be of 5 weeks, in summer 2017, heading to France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom. Before the departure, the participants will receive accurate preparation activities. The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit. Together with the enhancement of linguistic and professional \u201ctools\u201d, the project highlighted the intercultural consciousness as one of the essential competences to start up a revival processes which might favour the employment linked to the potential touristic attractiveness of the territory.The touristic offer can be innovative if it is gifted also on a human level personalisation, which requires the operators to master some competences to be improved through the transnational mobility. These competences concern some soft skills such as ability to have an open vision towards society, relational skills, self-entrepreneurship, flexibility personal organisation as well as specific technical skills.  The professional profiles involved are related to Tourism and other linked sectors: services (marketing and administration, information technology, restaurants and hotel accommodation), agri-food and environment management.The common goals to the different professional profiles are aimed at the acquisition or enhancement of the following skills:1-To interact by using Foreign languages 2- To positively face new cultural contexts, 3- To adapt to unfamiliar situations, to be flexible, mindful and interested towards new experiences and to live them as a learning opportunity 4-To practise personal autonomy by means of daily training of self-organization and of stress management5- To build-up constructive relationships and to take charge of responsibilities at work  6- To acquire or develop some professional skills The mobility is integrated in the sending school curriculum and it is recognised as equivalent to the school-work Alternance (work based learning); therefore, the application of ECVET procedures in organizing and implementing the work experience abroad will enable the recognition of credits. The participants will also receive the Europass Mobility Document, the Certificate of Competencies, in addition to the other certifications foreseen, which will enrich the personal portfolio for entering the labour market.The continuity with the previous Project editions strengthens the collaboration of the members of the national and international partnership, and it improves the shared practices applied to organize, manage and evaluate the mobility. This continuity is also a condition for the success of the Mobility experience, whose impact will be measured by a follow-up Observatory of the sending schools in the three years after the conclusion of the Project.

The mobility learning outcomes will be tailored to the single participant and specialization sector in order to obtain a final certification of competence in the relevant sector. The potential companies where the workexperience will take place have already been pre-selected, in order to identify quality environments where the learning outcomes can reasonably be met. Along with the professional competencies, the mobilities will also be expected to improve participants\u2019 linguistic and social competencies.  \r\nMobilities will take place in Germany, the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria and Spain, for 8 groups of 10/14 participants, with a duration of 12 weeks. \r\nThe contents and the learning outcomes of the internships will be discussed with the companies and the participants. Participation to the PLUS-MUSE&SMART project will be based on a public open call for selections, with an application to be submitted by interested candidates.\r\nBefore the internship abroad, a preliminary linguistic, cultural and pedagogical preparation stage of 2 weeks will be carried out in Trento, to be financed with regional resources. The learners will also benefit from using the European OLS platform. The experience abroad will also include a 3-day initial induction and preparation to the workplacment. At the end of the experience abroad, 2 days of programme follow up will be organized in Trento. \r\nUpon return to Italy, a second workexperience of 8 weeks in Trentino will be available for the most technologically advanced sectors. This final stage will be entirely financed with regional resources. \r\nThe project identifies specific quality tools which will be applied and combined in the tutoring, monitoring, and certification stage, both by the Sending and by Receiving organizations. \r\nAs regards the 8 staff, a mobility of 4 days will be activated in collaboration with a German Partner Organization having the necessary requested experience. The programme will deepen cutting-edge tools, practices, methodologies and procedures, and will combine a theoretical component with practical observation one. The programme will be aimed at improving the competencies of the staff in managing and coordinating VET mobilities, and in enhancing the value of transnational mobility as a training tool.  \r\nThe whole PLUS-MUSE&SMART project will be accompanied by promotion, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination actions, to take place at the start, during and at the end of the project.", "http://www.conlanschool.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006473_4"], [2016, "S.TR.E.A.M.

Key Enabling Technologies such as advanced materials, nanotechnology, biotechnology are increasingly having a transformative effect on the sector. ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment. The partnership brings together partners from different countries (IT,DE,NL,IE,UK,FI,ES,FR,PT,GR) and is built ad hoc to include the necessary expertise to successfully reach the goals of the project. Skills and competences are multidisciplinary and integrated in a consistent way with the tasks and phases of project development. Many of the partners already collaborated with CPV in other EU-funded projects thus developing a strong mutual trust. S.TR.E.A.M. is designated for 175 17-18 years old learners attending the fourth year at vocational and technical upper secondary institutes and one IVET Centre.The schools involved encompass a range of professional curricula: Administration, Finance and MarketingInternational Relations and TradeMechanics, Mechatronics,ElectronicsIT.The methodological framework adopted in identifying and describing the main occupational profile \u2013 related units of LOs to be acquired/improved by learners built on: careful analysis of current study programmes and existing methods and practices developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF) where CPV and Consortium's members have been involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. Thus, the proposed model provides a \u201ccommon language\u201d for describing competences and their acquisition and offers a way to relate these competences to specific training programmes. The project will last 18 months and will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES (the work placement will last 30 days (travel excluded) and may include 2 days of induction. In the choice of work placement companies, the project partners will be supported by the E.R.M.E.S. database including more than 370 EU companies); Consortium and foreign partners will ensure an efficient mentoring and supervision arrangements of mobile participants through monitoring documents, monitoring visits by tutors; FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities.The project seeks to have significant impacts not just through the mobilities which the project will naturally promote but also by focusing on the sustainability of the multilateral ties that will ensure. By offering work-based vocational education and training in another country, the primary expected impact of the mobility experience on the participants is a direct and measureable improvement in their professional competencies and work-related skills. Other personal and social impact include: development of language, ICT and teamwork skills; increased intercultural awareness; increased level of independence, confidence and open mindedness.As to the participating organisations, the impact include: exposure to WBL practices in other EU countries; development of openness and cooperation with schools from other countries; strengthening of the EU dimension to the Consortium members\u2019 activities; improvements in VET methods, systems and processes, development of interdisciplinary approaches", "http://www.conlanschool.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005082_18"], [2018, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION", "CONLAN SCHOOL LIMITED", 319905.0, 8, 38, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION represents the ideal continuation and expansion of the previous edition of WORKSTAR project.

The Veneto Region since 2006 launched ad hoc initiatives to encourage the spread of this new concept of entrepreneurship. Companies more careful to the challenges of the future have already recognised the validity of the 'triple bottom line'model\u2019 (which notes the impact of corporate behavior on the economic, social and environmental level). The school in its process of opening up to Europe and the world cannot help but  wonder about the relationship between CSR and globalization, making itself interpreter of a sustainable  internationalization.\r\nThe beneficiaries of the  biennial mobility project are: a) 120 VET students of economic, commercial and marketing area; 10 staff members.\r\nThe learners mobility will last five weeks, and wants to develop a moment of pedagogical training which increase personal capacity and skills, such as language civic and social competences, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, digital competence, cultural awareness and expression. IRES will promote the increase of organizational, managerial and operational skills/competences, starting from the assumption that SMEs are placed in an increasingly competitive global scenario.

Discussions among teachers on issues concerning emerging new job profiles, new forms of work organization which affect training and educational needs and provision represent the main rationale of the project proposal. New emerging competencies and learning concepts, also taking into account the needs of microenterprises are required by both sectors: the traditional simple and repetitive tasks are evolved to multidisciplinary tasks in order to deliver more complex products and services.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. It takes independence, initiative and flexibility to work abroad. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad will involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment. The partnership brings together partners from different countries (IT,DE,NL,SLO,IE,UK,GR,ES,FR,DK,LT) and is built ad hoc to include the necessary expertise to successfully reach the goals of the project.

The framework of the context refers to users with low rates of study motivation and high levels of school dropout in an area at high social risk in which the school discomfort can no longer be considered as an emergency, but actually as a structural feature of the training system and this calls for a new revision. A training course led abroad would enable teachers, through their comparison with colleagues from other countries, to acquire new group class management techniques in order to detect and prevent the phenomena of school drop-out, which undoubtedly represents an element to counteract.\r\nThe teachers that will take part in this project are highly motivated to increase their  didactic, methodological, linguistic  competencies as well as ICT abilities, in order to improve the educational offer of that the Institute, promoting this project, is able to deliver.\r\nThe main aims that the project is going to pursue are the following: \r\n- to explore, develop and evaluate the best practices resulting from the cooperation of a large group of teachers and educators;\r\n- to attend English language courses in order to reach level B2 in anticipation of a possible CLIL course;\r\n- to acquire language skills in L2 for professional debates and prepare more interesting teaching materials and tools able to adapt to different learning needs;\r\n-to reduce the level of early school drop-out;\r\nThe number of participants will be of 15 people, and they will be selected among the teaching and management staff of the Institute and the group will live an experience functional to the improvement and strengthening of their competencies within the partner institutes in United Kingdom, which are, more precisely, the Conlan School in St. Asaph and the Tellus Education Group in Plymouth, coordinated by T.E.E.P. \u2013 Training Education and European Project. \r\nThe activities planned and offered by the Institute are the following:\r\n- statistical analysis of cohorts, analysis of the criteria of selection of those students resulting more at risk; \r\n- use of active listening techniques and peer-tutoring so as to identify difficulties and/or criticisms;   \r\n- personalized interventions;\r\n- feedback and evaluation results.\r\nThe need to evaluate students\u2019 performance, along with the implicit/explicit expressions of discomfort is not new, but the methodological tools of research characterizing this project are innovative, based on a \u201cpreventive approach\u201d and connected to aspects of both statistical and psycho-pedagogical nature. \r\nThe project will monitor the impact on the general didactic activity of the institute and will evaluate whether the training activities carried out abroad will have triggered the change and innovation desired.

Its focus is finding ways to support education practitioners from all disciplines, professions and organisations to use the arts to conduct high quality research that is based primarily through practice rather than text. We are proposing developing a module (level 7) designed to encourage a wide range of education practitioners to conduct practice-based research through the arts, enabling them to develop innovative new means to explore and enhance teaching and learning, as well as their professional subject development. Although a significant number of cultural organisations are conducting practice-based research in the arts, it is rare to find this kind of research and reflection in the educational disciplines such as mainstream education, youth, social and health care, business, maths, science and engineering education. Arts practices can have a significant impact on education research; for instance, drama, music, dance and visual arts can be used to: understand how learners internalise mathematical concepts, reflect on how decisions are made in the midst of action in leadership education, or investigate the use of the intuitive alongside the rational and analytical in the educational experience of engineering students. These and many other methods of arts-based research can be used as a lens to provide unique insights into the learning processes that lie beyond the scope of conventional text- or number-based educational research.Non-textual arts-based forms of research can provide valuable insights into pedagogical and professional practices not only within the arts but especially when applied to fields that normally lie outside of the arts. Reflection and reflexivity \u2013 the subjectivity of the research process are brought to the fore, yielding novel but rich insights into formally familiar practice. Making a photographic installation with dementia patients can be an enlightening experience for both teacher and learner when studying educational impairments; staging critical incidents in theatrical form of the everyday routine of leaders can reveal unquestioned assumptions embedded in practice in executive management education.The project aims to bring together arts based researchers and education practitioners from all disciplines and professions to create a course that equips participants in different spheres to develop innovative research-based creative pedagogies in their different spheres of experience and expertise.", "http://www.chester.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF CHESTER", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA203-024258_coordinator"], [2015, "From Strategy to Action: Supporting the professionalisation of sport organisations\r\nthrough the definition of work-based competencies and the development of fit-for-purpose training for Sport Administrators", "UNIVERSITY OF CHESTER", 243076.0, 10, 12, "This European project uses an innovative tool to analyse and address a crucial skills issue in an increasingly important sector.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT MEETS A REAL NEED.\r\nThe S2A (Strategy to Action) Project is focussed on the sport and active leisure sector and in particular on the skill needs of sports administrators \u2013 the people, in paid and voluntary roles in middle management in national and European sport organisations across the EU, who are crucial in fulfilling the sector\u2019s potential as a social, health and economic driver in Europe.\r\nExpectations of national Governments are rising. Sport is increasingly seen as a powerful tool to combat some of the major challenges facing society yet it is still under-developed. It needs to change from a sector that has been fragmented and with systems that vary from country to country depending on the history and culture of those countries. At the heart of this change lie the sport federations, which provide the rules and structure for the governance and development of their sports, the thousands of non-profit sports clubs and the grassroots sport movement.\r\nWithin these sport organisations, the administrators in middle management roles are under particular pressure. They have the responsibility to translate the overall strategy of the organisation into action,  to turn the ambitions of the sport into real programmes that will attract more participants and bring success., to apply vital policies for good governance and to ensure the integrity of sport are in their hands to deliver. But, what skills do they need? Do they have access to appropriate training for these new challenges? The project will tackle these key issues.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT LINKS WITH EU POLICIES AND PRIORITIES\r\nThe project aims to enable the sector to contribute effectively to key priorities in EU policy that are aimed at creating jobs, improving health, promoting social inclusion, re-generating the economy and improving sport itself. In addition, the project uses an approach totally in line with EU education reform enabling the sector to create and deliver training and qualifications that meet an agreed employment and skills need and to link to the EQF and ECVET by delivering a new learning outcome based approach.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT USES AN INNOVATIVE AND PROVEN METHODOLOGY\r\nThe innovative 7 Step Model, developed by EOSE in a previous EU funded project, will be used to analyse the role and functions performed by sports administrators (paid and unpaid) in sports organisations across Europe and to define the knowledge, skills and competencies and the training needed for them to be effective in those roles.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT WILL CREATE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING \u201cCURRICULUM\u201d FOR SPORTS ADMINISTRATORS\r\nUsing the Model, a framework of training will be created based on the real skill needs of Sports Administrators to support their on-going training and development.\r\nNo such analysis has been attempted before at a European level for sports administrators. The outcome will be an agreed definition of the role and competences of the administrators which will act as a specification for the modular training to be developed and piloted as an exemplar during the project.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE REAL IMPACT AND LEGACY\r\nThis framework has huge potential to encourage and support learning and employment mobility for the administrators and to put transparency into qualifications developed in different countries and sports but to the same template (the common agreed standards in the framework) and linked to EQF and ECVET. It is aimed at an occupation at the centre of the future growth and development of sport and can therefore have real impact on the real world of sport\u2026 potentially impacting a growing sector (over 800,000 full time employees and 35 million volunteers in the EU) and in fine the life of the EU citizens.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT IS BUILT ON A STRONG PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe Project Partnership is strong, involving 12 partners from 10 countries: 8 national organisations and 4 pan-European Associations (EFCS, EOSE, ISCA and Tennis Europe). Each partner has strong national links with, and experience of, the sport sector. They include the members from EOSE, who are trained and experienced in the 7 Step Model methodology that will be used in the project.\r\nThe strength of the consultation to be carried out by the Partners will be key to success.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT IS BASED ON SOUND MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL\r\nFinally, the S2A Project is led by EOSE, an experienced project management organisation (Lifelong Learning Programme at European and National level (through its members) and on direct commission from the DGEAC, Sport Unit) and a respected adviser to the European Commission Expert Groups on sport.

Initiatives start and end in the community, and the end is always a new beginning. Learning, capacity-building and empowerment takes place through community, not prior to or isolated from it and is always linked to an authentic situation, an emerging need, not to an abstract dictum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first year the project will work side-by side with the first group of adults, learning to create and practice step by step the community action mentality. This \u2018Breaking Down\u2019 year will take as its starting point the life and work situation of the long-term unemployed adults, and identify opportunities and potential resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn initial group of 10-20 adults will be established by each local partner, who will be supported to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 slowly increase capacity to address the community\r\n\r\n\u2022 build up small eco-systems of networks as a consequence of their efforts\r\n\r\n\u2022 directly benefit from their entrepreneurial actions or take further action for change \r\n\r\n\u2022 mentor other adults and contribute to the Virtual Guidance services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Year 2, second local groups of 10-20 adults are helped, this time mentored by a team of unemployed adults from the first year.

They will build up important community relations and networks in support of their missions, supervise and support adults and mentors and serve as key players in the virtual guidance services. They will themselves be increasingly empowered along the first project year, learning alongside the unemployed adults, participating in their own local groups but with direct opportunities for meeting and working with local groups transnationally as part of four focussed six day workshops held at the same time as partner meetings in four different partner localities.

Teachers struggle with inadequate pedagogical repertoires to work with and put into value diverse pupil populations and wider communities. Neglected groups and individuals too readily drop out from education as a result of an inadequate learning environment.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address the diversity challenge and its negative consequences by improving the provision of intercultural competence and understanding in pre- and in-service teacher education.

Such needs are:- the need to re-engage seniors of all ages and backgrounds in the production of economic and social value- the need to find new solutions to existing and emerging social challenges not addressed by the open market and not sufficiently addressable by public services- the need to engage users, clients and citizens in creating such solutions- the need to create dynamic social change mechanisms to respond flexibly to the fast changing global and local economies, social infrastructures and labour marketsEMERGING CHANGE OPPORTUNITIESThese include such opportunities generated by increasing consensus among policy-makers, researchers and professionals on what kind of innovation is needed, possible and attractive, and what innovation means \u2013 including recent re-thinking of the terms innovation, social innovation and social economy.These opportunities for change recognise :- recognising that social innovation is a driver of and contributor to economic growth- recognising that social entrepreneurship goes far beyond establishing a private company and embraces all sorts of initiative-taking, whether for profit or not- recognising that authentic social innovation cannot happen to but with people, and that social innovation needs top-down as well as bottom-up initiative-taking to be successful- recognising that social innovation includes a wide range of societal challengesPROJECT MISSIONThe project objective is to mobilise teams of seniors in participating project communities and beyond to build capacity among them to serve as SOCIAL CHANGE BROKERS in these communities, spotting social change needs, bringing together relevant stakeholders and citizens and facilitate or drive the social change process, and to exploit the social change processes to sustain their activity through creating appropriate organisational frameworks, be it as volunteers, association members, employees, consultants or social service providers.The project brings together 3 top priorities in Europe 2020 policy:1. The need to retain or re-engage the increasing number of European seniors as active social and economic contributors2. The need to bring about social innovation as an alternative to traditional public services3. The need to promote entrepreneurial mind-sets and initiative-taking in the communitiesThe project brings together those policy needs in a strong, systematic and sustainable, yet practical and realistic way: - it will mobilise groups of seniors in EU communities to build capacity to act as SOCIAL CHANGE BROKERS in the communities, identifying social change needs and facilitating the change process by bringing together relevant stakeholders across relevant sectors, including activating citizens as co-drivers of social change.A senior social entrepreneur can be a CATALYST of social change.PARTNERSHIPThe consortium brings together 8 partners from 6 EU countries: practice partners, knowledge partner and an experienced quality partner.The Municipality of Aarhus, Denmark, coordinates the project.OUTCOMESThe project will along its 24 months duration produce the following key outcomes:SENIOR SOCIAL RESOURCE CENTER SUPPORTI AM A SOCIAL CHANGE BROKER \u2013 WHAT R U?PORTFOLIOS OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGPOLICY PAPER \u2013 LESSONS LEARNED FROM SENIOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGPOLICY PAPER/GUIDANCE \u2013 EUROPEAN FUNDING AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGResulting from the continuous transnational networking of seniors through the project and serving as platform for further European initiatives a network will be established by the seniors engaged in the various phases of the project, including:- senior social change brokers from the first group, serving as mentors for new seniors along the project- second group senior social change brokers mobilised and capacity built through the project- seniors engaged through the collaboration with what is called neighbouring communities and communities in other countriesNew initiatives can build on the lessons learned from the project and similar  and might address a variety of EU funding measures.In particular, the project aims to create a qualified EaSI initiative to be submitted in 2017 or 2018, taking the Senior Social Entrepreneuring and similars.", "http://www.chester.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA204-022286_4"], [2015, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention through teacher capacity building", "UNIVERSITY OF CHESTER", 109745.0, 7, 10, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention\r\n\r\n\u201cTeachers cannot teach how to be entrepreneurial without themselves being entrepreneurial.

The careful management of air flow within a building forms part of this strategy through the control of inlet fresh air and exhaust air, maximising air re-circulation, and minimising the amount of fresh air which is often drawn in through a heat exchanger. However, there is a high risk that the air quality is reduced. Continued exposure to environments with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the pollutants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million premature deaths per year world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to polluted indoor air, and it is suggested that poor indoor air quality may pose a significant health risk to more than half of the world\u2019s population. Perhaps surprisingly, remedial action to improve air quality is often easy to implement. Relatively simple measures such as increased air flow through ventilation systems, or a greater proportion of fresh air to re-circulating air are sufficient to improve air quality.

We expect significant reductions in cost (target $800/T which equates to 50% of current 1st gen solvent production in China) as well as enhanced energy balances and reduced GHG emissions vs 1st gen biofuel production (target a 85% reduction).\nThe project output (a technically and economically-validated process) will provide the EU with a tremendous opportunity to build an advanced biofuel business from sustainable feedstocks. This is strategically important to contribute to the European 10% target for renewable transportation fuels for 2020.\nThe proposed project fits into the topic \u201dDeveloping next generation technologies for biofuels and sustainable alternative fuels\u201d (LCE-11-2014).", 108409.0, 3763137.0, 5, 10, "ButaNexT", null, "http://www.ctechinnovation.com", null, "h2020_193725_999746021"], [1367366400000, 1485820800000, "Development of advanced catalysts for PEMFC automotive applications", "C-Tech Innovation Limited", "Many efforts have been put on the reduction of the Pt loading but nowadays a threshold seems to be obtained. Because the kinetics of the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction is very fast on Pt, it is possible to use MEA with a Pt loading as low as 35 \u00b5gPt/cm-2 without any effect on the voltage loss when such an anode is used in front of a well working cathode. But, the Oxygen Reduction Reaction kinetics is not so fast which is the limiting step concerning the electrochemical processes in a PEMFC. For that raison, the decrease of the Pt loading is now encountering a plateau.\nNano-CAT will propose alternatives to the use of pure Pt as catalyst and promote Pt alloys or even Pt-free innovative catalyst structures with a good activity and enhanced lifetime due to a better resistance to degradation. Nano-CAT will thus develop novel Pt-free catalysts (called bioinspired catalysts) and explore the route of nanostructured Pt alloys with very low Pt content.\nCatalysts are chemical species on which the electrochemical reactions are accelerated. PEMFC uses heterogeneous catalysis meaning the catalyst needs to be supported on a material in a solid phase (catalyst support).

These supports offering a better resistance towards degradation than the carbon black commonly used will address the issue of the support degradation and the MEA lifetime.\nNano-CAT will follow two routes, one low risk to ensure demonstration of the use of Pt alloys on new resistant supports and one high risk route to evaluate the feasibility of Pt-free MEA based on the use of bioinspired catalysts.\nFinally, Nano-CAT addresses all technical issues leading to the industrialization of the project outcomes for automotive application by the development of high quality manufacturing methods of complete MEAs required to maintain high power density and efficiency.", 97630.0, 3496771.0, 6, 8, "NANO-CAT", null, "http://www.ctechinnovation.com", null, "fp7_108541_999746021"], [1377993600000, 1472601600000, "Optimisation of Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategies for the Maximisation of Resource Efficiency", "C-Tech Innovation Limited", "WASTECOSMART - Optimisation of Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategies for the Maximisation of Resource Efficiency addresses the priority areas of a \u201cResource Efficient Europe\u201d and relates to the EcoAP, by boosting innovation based on research and technology development within the field of integrated waste management.
