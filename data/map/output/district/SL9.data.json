Moving from considering critical infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels and earthworks as inert objects to being intelligent (self-learning objects) the SAFE-10-T project will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden failures. This will be achieved by:\n\n\u2022\tThe Safety framework will incorporate remote monitoring data stored in a BIM model that feeds into a decision support framework (DST) that enables decisions to be made automatically with maintenance prioritised for elements exhibiting stress.\n\u2022\tA major advance that will be achieved in the project is that the algorithms at an object level and at a network level will incorporate machine learning to train the system to evolve with time using available monitoring data. \n\u2022\tA trans-disciplinary approach with experts in Artificial Intelligence and big data management working with owners, engineers with expertise in risk and modelling and sociologists  to make decisions.\n\u2022\tOur major European infrastructure managers (Rijkswaterstaat for roads and inland waterways and Network Rail) will undertake demonstration projects at critical interchanges and nodes of the TEN-T transport network.\n\nThe project will achieve significant impact in asset management by:\n\n(i)\tBy moving to intelligent objects that communicate their safety condition during extreme events we will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden catastrophic failure of infrastructure objects.\n(ii)\tThe project will use Open Linked Data formats to manage all data and inputs from other sources. Mitigation actions can be taken and warnings of the increased risk level can be transmitted to other agencies and the public.\n(iii) Demonstrate the concept of fully interconnected transport networks on the TEN-T", 218683.0, 2621577.0, 8, 14, "SAFE-10-T", null, null, null, "h2020_209711_948258712"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "VIRTUS IT LIMITED", 218064.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and seamless European transport system (06.03.03.01)", "fts_2017_13208"]]}}, "9DR": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXQ", "Chalfonts and Gerrards Cross Hospital", "nhs_RXQ64"]]}}, "9FG": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 122314.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_3821"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 102424.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_6099"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 51636.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_10308"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 30190.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_14160"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 27334.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_29291"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 24321.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_27645"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 6453.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_43362"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 3782.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_29078"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 3729.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2017_51999"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 2431.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_48210"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 2376.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_36058"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 2169.0, "General report and other publications (16.03.02.04)", "fts_2017_51003"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 1275.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2017_41962"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 1205.0, "Ensuring the protection of rights and empowering citizens (33.02.01)", "fts_2016_59247"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 1107.0, "Providing quality statistical information, implementing new methods of production of European statistics and strengthening the partnership within the European Statistical System (29.02.01)", "fts_2017_45517"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 1104.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_53717"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 1037.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_45195"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 609.0, "Support expenditure for the programme Employment and Social Innovation (04.01.04.02)", "fts_2017_50846"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 565.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_52149"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 428.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_55341"], [2016, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 345.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_37221"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 241.0, "Support expenditure for Erasmus+ (15.01.04.01)", "fts_2017_51231"], [2017, "RWS TRANSLATIONS LTD*", 193.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_68748"]]}}}}
