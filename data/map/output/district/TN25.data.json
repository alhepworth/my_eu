In contrast to the formal system, the sources of financing are fragmented. On the side of public authorities, there is a distribution across different ministries, regional and local authorities and communes. Employers obviously play an important role as do public employment services. In many countries, the learners themselves contribute through fees. There are a number of different mechanisms and tools, which can be targeted at learners directly or at providers.\r\nWhilst the cost of many learning offers remain an obstacle for many Europeans (especially younger or older people or persons with low educational attainments as highlighted by the Adult Education Survey), funding for adult education has been under increased pressure due to the financial crisis, and even a country like Finland is cutting funds for education. This is in contrast with the clear need to increase participation in lifelong learning. The PIAAC results have shown that at least 20% of Europeans lack basic skills, and the benchmark for participation has decreased in the last few years rather than made progress. \r\nThere is an urgent need - and recent survey among EAEA members confirms the importance of this - to find answers for questions such as: why do we need to invest in adult education? What are the indicators for funding? Where is investment needed? Which instruments work? Which funding mechanisms can engage (more) new learners?\r\nA working group of the European Commission worked on this topic in 2012/13. This project is a reaction and follow-up on this work. The consortium believes that there is a need to look into this topic from the point of view of civil society only and to update what has been achieved to make proposals for policy and financing practice that focuses on the providers and learners. \r\nIndeed, the partnership believes that there is an urgent need across Europe to \r\n\u2022 improve funding of adult education\r\n\u2022 improve efficiency of policies and public expenditure to reconcile the need for sound public finance and funding growth-friendly investments from providers and learners points of views\r\n\u2022 propose innovative solutions that can help to improve efficiency and the quality of public spending in education and training\r\n\u2022 improve the knowledge about funding instruments and how they work and for whom\r\n\u2022 to increase our knowledge of why and where to invest and then implement the funding instruments\r\n\u2022 continue the debate across Europe about participation in lifelong learning and especially of groups that currently do not participate and how to finance this participation\r\nThe objective of the project is to provide a set of analyses (such as 'why invest in adult education', indicators for financing adult education, where to invest, etc.) and policy recommendations targeted at policy-makers of all levels (European, national, regional, local, communal) and at providers to be used as advocacy tools. The partnership would like to monitor and analyse adult education policies and funding instruments and make proposals on how to improve them. This knowledge also benefits providers and adult education organisations as they will be able to use the analyses and recommendations in their own work.  The partnership believes that this peer learning aspect across Europe will contribute to finding the best solutions for adult education in Europe by drawing on European best practices to establish key indicators for monitoring and evaluating use of resources.", "http://www.individuallearning.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE01-KA204-013194_1"]]}}, "4PF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1546214400000, "Revolutionary Design of Spacecraft through Holistic Integration of Future Technologies", "Belstead Research Limited", "ReDSHIFT will address barriers to compliance for spacecraft manufacturers and operators presented now and in the future by requirements and technologies for de-orbiting and disposal of space objects.

During the life of the project they will combine their knowledge and experience to create a relevant, flexible and needs-driven qualification to specifically support growth across Europe's Social Economy. ECCE also sets up a new Learning Network as a way of disseminating and mainstreaming ECCE and its specialist toolkit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCE project partners will work collaboratively to develop the tools, knowledge and resources necessary to deliver a highly-effective, accredited social enterprise start-up programme. Each partner pools their knowledge and experience to establish a new vocational qualification to be used as a development path for people unaware of their potential to set up socially-responsible venture, which will contribute to the socio-economic wellbeing of their community, their peers and their countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn turn these ECCE certificate-holders will inspire fellow social entrepreneurs and will enthusiastically encourage others to take up the training available to them through the partners. By targeting hard-to-reach communities through this project the ECCE certificate will also represent a vocational learning bridge between people with low educational standards and higher education. Demand for higher education focussing on social enterprise is likely to grow as a result of ECCE; a result that is likely to continue beyond the project\u2019s funded timeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCE has the potential to drive significant social change. The partners develop the means for large numbers of aspiring social entrepreneurs to become enterprising and focused agents for change across Europe.  It also allows each partner organisation to develop good practice within their own daily work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nMost Member States have introduced measures to try to overcome the current economic down-turn. Governments are reducing subsidies & cutting grants to NGOs who in turn have increased need to respond to growing local needs created by these cuts. This creates a needs-driven opportunity for NGOs to emerge as social enterprises; developing business skills that to date have not taken priority. But training is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nBalancing needs of clients alongside those of commercial enterprise causes problems for organisations with a social purpose. This is a challenge but it also creates a niche market for growth. Many NGOs have potential to become quality providers of jobs, supporting by the emergence of enterprise. Some of the world's best and most successful entrepreneurs have been excluded members of society in their personal past. Using their natural entrepreneurship \"street-wise\" skills are used to overcome poverty & disadvantage. Many have had no entry-level qualifications that would have allowed them to access HE. This anomaly exists across Europe. (EU Platform against Poverty, EU2020). Through links to previous projects the partners have recognised a need for a bespoke, practical and effective toolkit to help incubate new enterprise within the social economy. ECCE responds to that need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod to be used:\r\n\r\nThe partners strengthen links between VET & the labour market by designing the ECCE course & working with partners to draft the framework for a new vocational qualification based on the needs of the social economy. Lisbon Strategy includes developing VET par-excellence. Without capturing natural entrepreneurship the EU will not meet these targets. \r\n\r\nThe partners analyse each vocational system within their own country, compare and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, take best elements from each, shaping ECCE. A report is published and preparation is made for mainstreaming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n1.

Each partner has recognised expertise. There are mobilities in Sweden, the UK and Romania.  The social economy is used as a tool to bring about modernisation of vocational training systems and promote lifelong learning for all. Participants take part training that includes Empowerment, Social Business Development and Rehabilitation through Real Work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon their return to France participants cascade their new knowledge and skills for widest impact and to inform colleagues and local partners about the need to modernise training systems as well as extend coverage and implementation of social enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Impact:\r\n\r\nThe project will not only impact on the daily working practices of staff participants. It will also have substantial impact and influence on the lives of wide ranging client groups who will be offered adapted services, devised through learning experiences and good practice transferred to local activity as a result of the mobilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact will also support the organisation as staff feed-back to Senior Management and the Board to influence future Strategic Planning.
