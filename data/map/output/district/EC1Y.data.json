This involves the consumption of one million tonnes of virgin paper, cutting down 32 million trees, the consumption of 100 billion litres of water, the generation of 25,000 tonnes of waste (solely in the UK), and the emission of greenhouses gases equivalent to half a million cars. Paper cups are often lined or coated with plastic such as polyethylene (PE) or oil- based waxes to prevent the liquid from leaking out or soaking through the paper. These paper cups are almost impossible to recycle because of the difficulties of separating the paper from waterproof oil-based liners. This means paper cups end up going to landfill or, at best, are incinerated to generate energy. The heavy environmental impact of paper cups is extremely unsustainable, with each one generating a carbon footprint of 0.11kg of CO2. \nUCUP, a novel sustainable paper cup for take-away drinks, provides an innovative solution to reduce the huge environmental impact of disposable cups. UCUP features an eco-innovative material obtained from brown seaweed which is bio-based, biodegradable and recyclable while it provides the same properties as current oil-based liners (waterproof, thermal and mechanical resistance) at a competitive price. \nOur main objective is to exploit the business opportunities of this new material in the food packaging and food services packaging (ready-to-eat & take away) sectors.

Urban municipal authorities, policy makers, urban designers and scholars are all called to respond to such challenges and a variety of approaches on understanding urban form, both theoretical and operational, has developed.

Organisations that traditionally support social entrepreneurs are starting to provide this same support to younger generations. In the same way, organisations which have always worked with youth are now including the provision of social entrepreneurship experiences within their services.\r\n\r\nAs a result there were several trials; projects were created to test how to best take advantage of the youth\u2019s interest in social entrepreneurship, and provide them with practical social entrepreneurship experiences that contribute to develop the skills they will need for their future careers. Even though some key learning points were taken, there are still many questions to be answered with regards to how to best provide these experiences.
