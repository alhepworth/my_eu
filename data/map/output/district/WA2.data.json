The partners want to narrow the gap between the expectations of companies with regard to knowledge, skills and competences on the one hand and the qualifications of the workforce immediately after training on the other. Indeed, on completion of current training of future foremen and site managers, companies generally only make these posts available to employees with 3 to 7 years of professional experience, although their needs are rather more immediate. This pattern is reflected in most of the partner countries.\r\n\r\nBased on a pragmatic and transnational analysis of the competency requirements (particularly cross-functional skills) for foremen and site managers prioritised by the companies in the partner countries, the project\u2019s objectives are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 joint adaptation of a representative sample of training courses to meet the expectations expressed by the companies and the creation of a support mechanism for trainees in personalised training to promote earlier employability, including in a transnational dimension,\r\n\u2022 joint identification and refinement of teaching methods and tools suited to the adjusted career paths, with the emphasis on modularisation of courses, personalised training and trainee support,\r\n\u2022 proposal of a transnational model for the validation, recognition and transparency of the learning outcomes of the adjusted training programmes.\r\n\r\nThe analyses carried out earlier by the project partners highlight the problems of recruiting foremen and site managers: not due to any shortage of workers in general, but frequently to a lack of training courses adequately adapted to the way in which these posts have evolved. That is why the partners are proposing a project aimed at both companies and individuals who are looking for:\r\n\r\n\u2022 training that provides access to a position facilitating socio-economic integration, as is the case with foremen and site managers,\r\n\u2022 vocational retraining,\r\n\u2022 professional promotion.\r\n\r\nThe project therefore forms part of the \u201cEducation and Training 2020\u201d strategy, at the same time facilitating:\r\n\r\n\u2022 the closer integration of training systems and companies and the prioritisation of alternating training courses,\r\n\u2022 the companies\u2019 competitiveness, through better training of the middle management employees they need, and the socio-economic integration of young people looking for a professional career,\r\n\u2022 the employability and mobility of the trainees.\r\n\r\nThe partnership was created to be both professional and complementary, uniting construction sector organisations and the multi-sectoral institutions or actors involved in vocational training. This includes those bodies with the following profile:\r\n\r\n\u2022 national paritarian institutions overseeing introductory and ongoing vocational training in the construction industry professions, including professional reorientation for workers with economic and social integration problems; these are authorised by national education ministries, labour ministries or national or regional professional certification bodies,\r\n\u2022 a national centre specialising in cross-functional teaching research, in association with institutional and university partners, mandated by the European Commission to implement EC recommendations such as EQF, ECVET and EQAVET,\r\n\u2022 recognised vocational training centres that are both regional and local networks.\r\n\r\nThis is a major consortium that will bring to fruition a credible project in terms of a variety of training contexts and situations leading to foreman and site manager positions.\r\n\r\nThe partners are planning a global communication strategy firmly focused both internally on their own networks and professional sector and externally, given that the end product is intended to be transferable to other types of training, other sectors and other countries.

The 37 participants of the project belong to different sections: 2-year-course in biotech, 3-year-course in IT and students of commercial education. Before attending Berufskolleg Hilden these students decided to work in very different professional areas and have reached different qualifications and certificates. The above mentioned project includes 3 different activities matching the 3 different sections. At a very early stage all students are informed about the possibility of internships abroad. Their interest is also aroused by separate informative meetings held by former interns reporting about their experiences in foreign countries. They get information about current partners of the Berufskolleg Hilden and about organisational and financial aspects. At the same time the existing contacts are carried on to emerge the current data according to supervisors and contact persons. The individual facts are directly given to the participants in order to start a personal contact and relationship to the tutors at an early stage; i.e. before departure. In the section dealing with commercial education the students start their placement in cooperating companies and contact them through their employers. According to  the section/activity varies the duration of their stay.  In the biotech section the students stay abroad for at least 3 months, in the section of commercial education the stay is only 3 weeks and in the IT section the student stay for 2 months.

The proportion of pupils disadvantaged and, therefore eligible for pupil premium is above average. A large proportion of our children enter school displaying skills that are well below the national average which results in a low starting point. Recently, there has been a dramatic change to the staff and staffing structure at the school.  Many experienced staff left the school and were replaced by teachers at the beginning of their career.In a drive by our Leadership team to increase standards and improve outcomes for all, there is a commitment to seek new and innovative approaches to teaching and learning. Through the innovative and creative teaching practices of our European counterparts, we aim to implement shared experiences that will result in our children understanding that they are part of an international learning community. The project's objectives are to:1. Gain knowledge of successful leadership models. 2. Develop staff confidence to gain innovative and creative approaches. 3. Improving standards. The newly formed leadership team have highlighted the need for all staff to become immersed in the creative and innovative teaching approaches that the international training courses provide. It is our intention to continue our teachers professional development in order to improve teaching and learning across the school. With this in mind, we aim to send four members of our Leadership Team to Sweden and Finland to look more closely at the successes of each individual country's education system.  It is our aim that ten of our staff will take part in mobilities linked to creativity and innovation. The expected impact of the mobilities will be a staff that are more confident in their own abilities, have raised self esteem and increased enthusiasm for delivering innovative and creative lessons that address the needs of our children and the school. Furthermore, the children will benefit from an increased knowledge of European countries and how they compare and contrast to their own country. As a result of improved self confidence our staff will use the pedagogical methodologies, gained during their training, to inform planning and deliver lessons that inspire and motivate the children. This will happen across the curriculum. In order to maximise the training undertaken, staff will disseminate their learning to other members of staff during staff meetings and Inset training days. Through these mobilities we will create strong partnerships with teachers and schools, which the staff encounter abroad. Partnerships will be further developed upon our return by creating curriculum links that will raise the children's awareness of our European counterparts. It is hoped that our experiences will provide us with opportunities to apply for and be successful in obtaining the International Schools Award. Our Senior Leadership team, upon their return, will discuss their findings and look at ways in which these can work towards achieving the priorities of our school development plan. Actions will be created and shared with staff on how we can move our school forward. The impact of the training will be monitored to ensure that the full potential of the training opportunities are not overlooked. Our Head Teacher is involved with clusters of Head Teachers and schools, of similar characteristics, that meet on a regular basis to discuss successes and improvements that can be made to teaching and learning within our schools. It is hoped that by sharing what we have learned we can benefit the other schools in our clusters, creating impact beyond our own school. The longer term benefits of this project are envisaged to be an upward trajectory of the standards achieved by the children from their entry point into school. Through an exciting and inspiring curriculum we would hope to increase demand for places at our school, making it the school of choice in our area.", "http://www.standrews-cp.co.uk/warrington/primary/standrews", "St Andrew's C E Primary", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023387_coordinator"]]}}}}
