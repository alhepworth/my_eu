These e-books are, however, mainly electronic versions of print book with little interactivity, other than the ability to highlight passages, take notes, change font size and navigate easily within and between books. A number of e-Textbooks are available for use in school and university education  but are not yet widely used and many are, again, not particularly interactive. It is now possible to produce truly interactive e-books (digibooks) which incorporate elements such as video, audio, galleries of photographs, overlays, drag and drop, feedback, maps, animations, quizzes, dictionaries and much more. Several companies such as Bookry and LearningApps are developing widgets for e-books to facilitate this interactivity. These digibooks facilitate learning in a more personalised manner, allowing the pupil (and teacher) to become co-author and engage in the editorial process, improving literacy as well as digital skills. These books can also send data back to the teacher, facilitating marking, assessment and feedback.  \r\nNone of the  schools involved in this project currently use e-books in their teaching and none of the schools have staff with any training in the production or use of e-books.  The aim of this project is to facilitate, explore and assess the use of interactive e-books (digibooks) for teaching and learning in a range of subject areas across our schools.  We will produce a resource bank which can be used in our schools and world-wide to help teachers and pupils to produce, customise and /or use digibooks for teaching and learning purposes. We also aim to compare e-books (which are Android and Windows compatible) with iBooks (compatible with Apple devices) in terms of ease of production, editing and use. A further aim is to investigate the transferability of these different types of digibook and to integrate both digibooks and the associated pedagogy into the schools' curricula, supporting digital inclusion.  We want to internationalise the education of our young people and to improve their linguistic and digital skills in the process.\r\nThe schools involved in the project are: Dollar Academy, Scotland , an independent, co-educational day and boarding school,  IMB Brugges, Belgium, IES Francisco Giner de los Rios, Spain, and IIS De Amicis, Italy, which have  pupils from varied backgrounds  and with varied abilities and V. gimnazija, Zagreb,which has many pupils with high educational aspirations. The main subject areas which will be covered initially are Modern Languages, Science,  History and Computing. \r\nIn the first year of the project, teachers will be trained by sub-contracted experts  in Scotland in the production and use of both e-books and iBooks. This will involve task-based training and will include coverage of  topics such as choice of software, copyright issues, storage etc.   Following training each school will choose  at least two particular elements (resource types) on which to focus. Over the following 4 months pupils and staff at each of the schools will create and collate resources of their chosen types for incorporation into digibooks ( focussing on using either Windows or Apple as a platform, although Dollar staff will use both) and will upload them to the resource bank website. They will also start to produce digibooks for use in their own subject area .  At a meeting in Spain  pupils and teachers  from all of the project schools will train each other how to make all  the resource types, how to make a digibook and how to produce and run a webinar.  \r\nBack at school, staff and pupils will work on making  digibook manuals, which explain how to create/ download and use their selected types of resource. These will be uploaded to the resource bank along with a wide range of resources. Further training will occur and more resources will be collated, produced and trialled ( including via webinar) in 2018-2019.  Each school will also trial one or more of the digibooks produced by another partner school.  A project meeting will be held in late 2018 in Belgium at which teachers will discuss and evaluate progress to date and plan further work.  At a meeting in Italy in March, 2019, pupils and staff from the project schools will collaborate  on running a workshop for local teachers.  Project pupils and staff will train the local teachers in the production and use of the various resources in the resource bank and how to make a digibook, as well as how to use digiboooks in their teaching. Two webinars will also be run, one by and for pupils and one by and for teachers. All resources will be uploaded to the Erasmus+ dissemination website for open use, with links to this site from each of the schools\u2019 websites. The final project meeting will be held in May, 2019 at which the resource bank will be finalised and dissemination assured.  The resource bank will remain available indefinitely and will be regularly updated.", "http://www.dollaracademy.org", "Dollar Academy (Governers of Dollar Academy Trust).", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036668_coordinator"], [2014, "Using Tablets for Interactive Learning In Schools across Europe", "Dollar Academy", 76098.0, 6, 6, "Numerous studies have found that the use of tablet devices in school education is beneficial. It has, for example, been found to improve the digital and learning skills of pupils; to improve their attainment and motivation; to facilitate improvements in pedagogy (facilitating learning for different types of learner and for different levels of understanding ; resulting in production of more creative and engaging lessons and in provision of improved feedback to pupils); to improve pupil-teacher relationships; to significantly transform access to and use of technology inside the classroom as well as significantly reducing school costs. Both teachers and pupils cited key features of tablets themselves (as distinct from laptops and PCs) as contributing to key benefits such as engagement and collaboration. These included portabilility (which led to ease and speed of use), the easy-to-use touch interface,  and better software (apps). \r\n\r\nAcross Europe and the world, many governments are trialling the use of tablets for the education of pupils in primary and secondary schools.  None of the schools involved in this project currently use tablets to any great extent in their teaching and  pupils do not have any access to tablets in most of the schools.  The aim of this project is to facilitate, explore and assess the use of tablets for teaching and learning in a range of subject areas  across our schools.  We want to internationalise the education of our young people and to improve their linguistic skills in the process.  We will produce a number of work packages which can be used in our schools and world-wide to help teachers and pupils to use tablets for teaching and learning purposes. We also aim to  facilitate the production and application of a whole school policy on the use of tablets in education, to evaluate properly the usability and accessibility of tablets and to develop and integrate these new strategies and tablet technologies into the schools' curricula, supporting digital inclusion.  \r\n\r\nThe six secondary schools involved in the project are: Dollar Academy, Scotland , an independent, co-educational day and boarding school for pupils from 5-18;  IMB Brugges, Belgium, which has  pupils from a range of backgrounds; Erasmus-Gymnasium, Germany, which has a focus on language education; IS  \u201cViola-Marchesini\u201d, Italy, has a wide range of technological studies courses and a significant  liason with industry and universities; Kaitaan lukio, Finland is an upper secondary school with an extended visual arts oriented programme and Olivier de Serres, at which there is some focus on agricultural education. The main subject areas which will  be covered are Modern Languages, Science, English and Music although it is believed that most subjects will be involved in the long term.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the project teachers will be trained at a meeting in Scotland in the use of tablets for administrative, assessment and teaching purposes.  Materials for this workshop will be produced at Dollar Academy.  Over the following 6 months pupils and staff at all of the schools will carry out research and collaborate across a range of subject areas to write 50-100 questions about their school/country/culture.  These questions will all be used to make an online game in which teams of pupils have to  'cross a map of Europe' by answering correctly a certain number of questions about each country. Pupils will play this game at a meeting in Germany at the end of the first year of the project. Pupils in modern language classes will communicate with each other in real time for the two years of the project.  Over the course of the first year teachers at each school will produce at least one work package which focusses on a particular subject area and provides all of the necessary resources and instructions  to enable other teachers and pupils to  work in the same way. Some of these packages will be demonstrated at the pupil exchange meeting and each school will elect to trial ( in the second year of the project) one or more work packages produced by another partner schools.   Further work packages will be developed in 2015/2015 and two  meetings will be held at which teachers will liaise, discuss and evaluate progress to date and plan further work.  In the final meeting in Scotland, the schools will work together to run a public workshop to which  teachers and pupils from local schools  are invited at which the outcomes will be demonstrated and trialled by pupils. all materials will be uploaded to a website for public use.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the result of this project will be increased knowledge and understanding of how to use tablets for teaching and learning across a range of subject areas along with all of the associated benefits and impacts on pupils, teachers and schools which are listed above. Longer term it is expected that this project will result in increased and more effective use of tablets for educational purposes in schools.", "http://www.dollaracademy.org", "Dollar Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000013_coordinator"]]}}, "7HZ": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "SYMBIOS SPAZIO LTD", 109517.0, "Delivering operational services relying on space-borne observations and in-situ data (Copernicus) (02.06.01)", "fts_2017_46698"]]}}}}
