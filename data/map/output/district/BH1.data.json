This will be worth them in their daily life, to accept better their own realities and managing them without violence and without having to resort to the consumption of drugs.

All coming projects are also intended to be pool projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A1:\r\n\r\nThis project is for trainees from the commercial business sector throughout Germany. The aim of the project is to strengthen intercultural competence and to further develop linguistic skills. Furthermore, personal, social and professional skills should be developed. As a result of globalization, such skills have become essential for future employees to be able to compete on the European market. A total of 600 participants will travel to the UK in groups of at least 10. The project consists of prior preparation in Germany and a three-week learning period in Great Britain. Participants are provided with a cultural and work-related introduction in the UK. Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in England. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills. Participants also have the chance to take part in cultural activities outside of the internship.

In the first year, thirty traineeship graduates should complete a three month internship including an introductory course and an accompanying evening class in the UK. The combination of scholastic and practical elements should allow graduates to develop skills which are not able to develop fully in a purely academic environment. This should improve their employment outlook and initiate an interest in international mobility at the beginning of their professional career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A5:\r\n\r\nThis project is designed for thirty graduates from hotel and catering traineeships.

With this application we plan to send apprentices in the dual system (13) (office management clerks, retailers, warehouse workers as well as industrial clerks and wholesalers acquiring the additional certificate \u201eEuropean Merchant\u201c) and students in full-time classes at the BBZ (19) (commercial assistants, nursing staff assistants, assistants to social education workers) for 3- to 5-weeks internships abroad (Belgium [3], Denmark [2], Great Britain [20], Austria [7]). As intended in our strategy for international development, the internships enable our  students to realize general differences in professional training as well as differences in business routines and company culture. Furthermore, the apprentices\u2018 professional and intercultural competences are boosted. In many cases this also applies to their command of English. \r\nLast but not least the apprentices\u2018 flexibility and self confidence concerning the ability to handle situations even in a foreign country cannot be emphasized strongly enough. For the assistants to social education workers the milestones for a workplacement abroad (duration, requirements) have been agreed upon in the BBZ. Enquires to several project partners are under way. We expect that we can arrange internships for 3 trainees in kindergartens etc in England. We are still trying to convince some apprentices from the engineering sector to do an internship. No matter how hard we try, it is still very complicated and time-consuming. Nevertheless, we are quite convinced that we will be successful in sending two engineering apprentices to complete an internship abroad arranged by our partner in Austria. Unfortunately, a renewal of the internship project program for hairdressers is still not in sight. Fortunately, we get a slightly but constantly growing number of applications for long-term internships from students for their first year after graduating. Like in 2017 seven future  commercial clerks want to do a several-months-internship in Ireland (6x6 months, 1x4 months). Additionally, there is 1 office management clerk who applies for Denmark (4 months) and a industrial mechanic for an internship in England (52 weeks). Especially with the underage trainees it obviously is necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher during the first days abroad. \r\nThe teacher serves as a kind of reassurance-back-up in case a difficulty arises. Afterwards the apprentices are supervised by our project partners abroad. Before the internships all particpants, students and staff are well-informed (cultural aspects, dress code, language). When they return, a feedback will be given by them to us. In order to constantly improve the quality of our organisational and administrative work, we also ask our project partners and the apprentices\u2018 companies for a feedback. As far as the staff mobilities are concerned we perceive a growing interest in the mobilities \u2013 also with colleagues not being members of the BBZ Europe-Project-Group. Apart from mobilities with a direct relation to the teachers\u2018 subjects (economics, nursing profession, social education, foreign languages) there are also colleagues who take an interest in congresses that concentrate on digitalisation in education and its consequences e. g. for teaching methods. Due to long-term relationships to partner organizations/schools a skype-based exchange \u2013 comparable to e-twinning - between groups of students has been initialized. So it is possible to exchange experiences in the classroom  in a more realistic way. Whether expansions into fields like the coproduction of goods  is realizable is being looked into. In the caring section an intensified exchange has been initialized between the BBZ and  our project partner in Belgium (German speaking community). Topics that will be dealt with are e.g. the different caring concepts and structure of the students' training. Here staff mobilities help to experience what otherwise can only be talked about theoretically. After having returned, all participants of mobilities will contribute to enhance the readiness for cooperation on a European level.

As a result since the existence of the Vocational Training Centre of B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Zwack J\u00f3zsef Vocational Grammar and Vocational Secondary School for Trade and Catering it actively participates in international cooperation, international internship opportunities within which it provides students the opportunity to participate in vocational training abroad with the help of grants.\r\nIn the constant and accelerated pace world the acquired knowledge given by the school with the graduation becomes obsolete quickly, so our school constantly rethinks and develops further the knowledge, learning and teaching system in accordance with the above-mentioned ECVET principles of trade, hospitality and tourism, for lifelong learning. The Vocational Training Centre of B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Zwack J\u00f3zsef Vocational Grammar and Vocational Secondary School for Trade and Catering offers practical, marketable courses, to which it adapts general, international \"best practices\" and always implements the latest technical content in them. Thanks to our regular international cooperation the international and domestic practices have become comparable which helps to develop our practical methods.\r\n\r\nAs part of the application our institution also supports its staff to take part in foreign professional training courses and study tours with the help of tender funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned improvements and changes within mobility:\r\n\r\nIn case of students (57 persons):\r\nFor a long time our school has to serve the increasingly diverse and differentiated society of students who have different backgrounds and family preparedness, motivation, and different learning needs when they come to school. Accordingly, the school is widely tries to satisfy the increasingly differentiated needs of society and to help disadvantaged students, which exists in most cases in social aspects. With the help of the project we also help disadvantaged students to get to foreign countries. This is particularly important in our region in B\u00e9k\u00e9s county, which is a highly underdeveloped area concerning the social situation.\r\nAbilities of the candidates for the mobility program are different in the professional, linguistic and social context. The fundamental motivation of the candidates of the program only lies in the fact to gain foreign work experience and they do not take into consideration that they should have a number of input competency to spend a month abroad which we make them aware of during the preparatory classes (language, professional, cultural, and psychological ).\r\nDespite our efforts it was found that the participants' awareness of the benefits and drawbacks of self-sufficiency has become clear for them only during the mobility. Therefore, more emphasis is put on the education of independent living. during the preparing sessions mentioned above and the in the framework of classes with class teacher \r\n\r\nIn the case of teachers (17 persons):\r\nIt can be observed that those teachers who participated in previous programs for teachers and study trips abroad have developed their practical skills, renewed methodically and thus increased the quality of their work, efficiency and motivation. The school wants to expand the competence development, methodological renewal ever drawing wider numbers of its teachers in the program.\r\n\r\nThe foreign language competence of the pupils and staff involved in the project does not always reach the expected level, so we want to increase this with the help of foreign language preparation and the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe need of escorts:\r\nAmong the students participating in mobility almost every group has at least one underage or underprivileged student who need the accompanying presence in foreign travels. In addition, the presence of this person is needed on-site to do the administrative tasks in the host country\u2019s partner institution.\r\n\r\nNew partner institutions:\r\nIn order to improve our standard of training besides the already existing and well-functioning international relations abroad we need to maintain further addition \u2013 in similar education profile \u2013 and new educational institutions should be explored, thereby expanding our potential for learning for teachers and students alike. Therefore besides the existing partner institutions we have involved new partner institutions, such as Lobog\u00f3 Panzi\u00f3, Homor\u00f3df\u00fcrd\u0151 in Romania; Mobilityfriends, Barcelos in Portugal; English 2000 School of English, Bournemouth, in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOverall, we strive to provide the widest possible field of vision for students and teachers by the Erasmus + mobility in the trained professions.", "http://www.english2000.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA116-035734_2"], [2017, "Internationale Kompetenz in der beruflichen Bildung Ostfrieslands", "Bournemouth Educational Centre Limited", 111720.0, 4, 6, "The following project is being carried by a combine of four vocational colleges, located in the Northwest of Germany; Leer (BBS I Leer), Aurich (BBS 1 und BBS 2 Aurich) and Norden (Conerus Schule). Its\u2019 goal is to support the mobility of trainees within the dual apprenticeship. Additionally, it is planned to introduce further education and sitting in activities for teachers to strengthen these activities and to support the international development and improvement of the facilities. \r\n\r\nThis syndicate of schools is prepared to cover a high range of different job sections within the dual apprenticeship, including e.g. health, social care, trade and industry, technology, economy and management. All participating schools have gained years of experience and competences within this section of international educational work, which is now being planned to join and develop. The following applied project consists of different activities abroad, whose intention is to broaden the students\u2019 quality and quantity of working experiences in foreign countries and to focus European education into the regional development of East Frisia. \r\n\r\nA total of 76 students (from all four schools) will attend specific job training programs in co-operation with our partner schools in the Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain and France. Each of these programs also contains student- exchanges. In addition, we offer specific and guided job training programs in our region. \r\n\r\nA total of 24 trainees working in the trade and industry sector will take part in  the so-called \u201cLee-Gro project\u201d which already exists for more than two decades. Here, the trainees will complete a job training of four weeks in a trade and industry company in Groningen, whose structures are similar to their home companies. This guarantees a high comparability and growth of knowledge for the trainees. An existing cooperation with the \u201cNorderpoort-College\u201d facilitates a remarkable success of the project. \r\n\r\nA three-week project with our partnership-connecting vocational college in Kepno (Poland) is suited especially for minor students. The missing maturity of the trainees caused by difficult social life circumstances, leads to the fact that a close and personal support is highly recommended. If young trainees got no chance to acquire in development possibilities like these, the chance of quitting the apprenticeship would provable increase. \r\n\r\nAfter having acquired a previous language course, 20 trainees of the sales-sector will have the opportunity to start a job training within the additional \u201csalesmen for international business activity\u201d qualification. Additionally, five students of the trade and technical sector will gain experiences in a new work-environment within the French branch of the East Frisian wind turbine manufacturer \u201cEnercon\u201d to broaden the trainees\u2019 social, language, intercultural and job competences. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, this project initiates a first step of co-operation between the ZSP w Ol\u00e9snicy (Poland) and a network of three representing vocational colleges in Breslau/Wroclaw (Poland). After two initiating visits and the development of a connecting declaration of intent, it is now planned to translate these steps into action and develop a cooperation-network for further upcoming projects. \r\n\r\nThe trainees will be prepared and introduced by our regional partners (RPZ Aurich, Europahaus Aurich), especially on the sectors of language, organizing, intercultural and personal competences. Agreements between the trainees and the facilities will be signed by contract.

Furthermore, a total of 8 staff mobilities is planned.at a.)Here 15 three-week mobilities in England (Bournemouth) are planned. 10 of these mobilities are reserved for industrial clerks and wholesalers/export merchants as one component of their additional qualification \u201cEuropean Merchant\u201d. The other five are planned for the same kind of apprentices not taking part in the additional qualification.  On the other hand we plan for 4 two-week mobilities in Belgium (St. Vith) for retailers, office clerks, warehouse workers. Another 2 mobilities in Denmark (Odense) are also planned for warehouse workers.at b.)Here 16 five-week mobilities for commercial assistants are planned (14 to England/Totnes, 2 to France/Bordeaux). Furthermore, 6 assistants in geriatric nursing will do a three-week work placement in Austria (Wolfsberg). at c.)One teacher each is meant to do a 5-day staff mobility in France, Denmark and Belgium. For England (Bournemouth and Totnes) a total of 2 teachers is planned. To Austria (Wolfsberg) we intend to send 3 teachers. This is also due to a  Congress in metal engineering (an Ecomedia project). Participating in this congress the technical department of our school will get involved in the European project scheme the first time after a break of several years. In future this department respectively the apprentices in the various professions are meant to become part of the BBZ Norderstedt mobility pool.Before and after the flow preparations and retrospectives concerning language, cultural aspects and the competences acquired as well as feedback in cooperation with the sending and taking partners and companies will be carried out. Europasses will be handed out in a special ceremony by our head of school.After their return home, their bunch of experience will surely have a positive impact especially on their company's attitude towards the European labour market.

While until a few years ago, it was small to medium-sized enterprises that were active mainly at regional level, it is now high-tech companies that act on a global basis.

This increased internationality can be seen in the job de-scriptions and vacancies: Working in international teams, multi-lingualism and international work experience are increasingly sought-after and ever more important job qualifications. Moreover the entry into professional life is getting harder for young people. If they can provide professional experience, the chances of get-ting a job are better. Additionally, the requirements at school are growing. In the international branch, where most students come from, three languages are taught. Thanks to the internship the participants could improve their English marks greatly, i.e. this project is essential in helping students on their way to a success-ful graduation. Therefore, especially under-performing students were addressed when the project was presented.\r\nAs the school has a high number of students with migration back-ground, this project makes an important contribution towards in-tegration because for the first time students experience what it means to be a 'foreigner'.

In a dynamic, open and innovative, strongly linked to the European and international dimension, it becomes more necessary than ever to operate on a European scale and expand the knowledge of the policies and European systems to be able to plan and implement interventions that produce efficiency and effectiveness on the local tissue especially in creating jobs for young people.\r\nThe reasons of the project Wo.M.En. - Women's Mobility ExperieNce, intended to a female  neo-graduated target, are derived from the overall figure of female employment (seven years from 2008 to 2014) reflecting a marked territorial difference: a significant increase in the central and northern regions (+135,000 units equal to + 1.9%) and a significant drop - and really \"exceptional\" - in the South (71,000 units less, equal to -3.2%).
