The best place to spread and bring into force this idea and the recommendations of the UN must be schools, because education and children are the best way to change the world. We will join a trend - the school and local agenda 21 movement- that have been put into practice in some regions all around the world.\r\nThe \u201cAgenda 21\u201d is a concept created by the United Nations in the 1990\u00b4s with the slogan -\u201cthink globally and act locally\u201d. This idea tries to promote sustainable development and environmental protection in our town council, in our region and in our school. Each institution should have an \u201cAgenda 21\u201d to protect environment in a small scale. The European Union has signed recently (March 2013) an agreement in which it is shown the desire to enlarge the awareness of this idea and philosophy.  \r\nOur task or objective is to create a conscience at both local and school level by implementing a final document of AGENDA 21 for our schools. This document will be a model for other schools and  a turning point  in the awarenes and active participation in  the schools and local communities. The document will be included as a formal and official document in all our schools and it will be integrated with other existing normative, guidelines and rules.

Each one of the partners will lead  the task related with these environmental aspects .  We have focused in the  first 5 issues to design practical activities, but the other remaining items are included in the so called MEDA\u00b4s (MAIN ENVIROMENTAL DIRECT ACTION).

High unemployment persists particularly amongst women and low expectations prevail. The school is experiencing an increase in the  variety of needs of children attending school.  Currently  teachers are noting an increase  with children who present with Aspergers, Attention Deficit Hyper Activity Disorder and  Dyspraxia to name but a few. Increasingly we are experiencing children with Mental Health issues which require support and counselling.  We find children are lacking in their ability to deal with their emotions, express how they are feeling, manage conflict or deal with setbacks. This ultimately has an effect on their achievements and standards and also in their long term aspirations. More traditional teaching methods and viewpoints no longer appear to be as useful. We want to change this trend and make a difference by attending professional development courses outside of the UK to broaden our knowledge, skills and dispositions.  \r\nOur very experienced six teachers need to be able to develop knowledge and skills in new and innovative ways which will promote life-long positive dispositions in our children. By developing staff's  competences and range of teaching methods we will increase pupil engagement and this will lead to enhanced educational,  social and emotional outcomes. In addition through exposure to alternative learning environments our teachers can witness first hand the impact that schools can have on their communities in other European countries. We will incorporate aspects of this learning as a model to promote change within our own school community, thus promoting  resilience, respect and responsibility not only in school but  beyond the school gates, and ultimately  influencing the home environment in a very positive way.\r\nWe have a highly motivated staff  who continuously seek ways of developing their professionalism both as individuals and as members of a team.  There is a willingness to learn from each other and we have a well established track record of cascading and sharing good practice with other professionals regionally.

The courses will provide expert advice, support and training in both Pedagogy and Didactics and in the promotion of pupil's Health and Well Being. This opportunity for our staff to travel and visit other educational settings will give them the opportunity to not only experience school life in another setting but also the culture and traditions of that country. They will explore similarities and differences between education systems, meet with other teachers and course providers and exchange ideas and solutions to the problems we all face on a day to day basis.\r\n This will provide opportunities for staff to develop their own personal skills and competencies working alongside specialists . Staff will have the opportunity to broaden their horizons through travel, they will experience the culture and traditions of other nationalities. They will have opportunities to learn and build upon their existing language skills. Ultimately they will have time away from school to share new experiences with other members of staff, many of whom will never have worked closely together, thus it will help to break down barriers and promote team work within our organisation.\r\nAs a result of attending the courses and evaluating them, each participant will develop resources, meet with staff and Governors to disseminate the main points of the course, conduct team teaching and/or develop a focused programme of support for targeted children and share the learning with parents and community through ICT.

It is necessary to include in the curriculum subjects and methods of non-formal education that develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills and awareness of shared global and local challenges. Statistics show that unemployment among young people is increasing across Europe. Nowadays, being a university graduate with high marks is not enough to ensure rapid employment. There are many reasons behind the problem of youth unemployment: lack of particular skills, wrong educational system, mismatches between education and needs in labor market, lack of self confidence and self esteem, and structural lack of working places. The Directorate General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) states in the document \"Rethinking Education: Investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\" that it is of utmost importance to equip young people with both theoretical knowledge and practical competence for life. \r\nThe LEEN-TEEN project aims to offer the participants, both educated and educators, the context in which to be exposed to innovative methods and models of good practice and acquire practical entrepreneurial experience in school through non-formal activities. Learning by doing and hands-on experience acquired, will help young participants be more prepared and meet the expectations of the job market. With this project, participants will be offered the opportunity to improve their EU key competences for adult life, particularly for working life and a foundation for their further learning. \r\nThe core of the project is the Learning, Teaching and Training Activities. These are a mix between Short Term Exchanges of Groups of Pupils age 13 to 18 (travelling with staff/accompanying adults) lasting for seven days; local activities/tasks taking place in each country and virtual meetings/virtual activities. The philosophy of the project - to sustain knowledge transfer from theoretical to practical level and European level to local/community level - will be attained through linking each mobility with the inter-mobility period in which pupils will apply the knowledge in a practical manner by organizing different events (Winter Event, Children's Day Charity Event, Product Promotion Event, Arts&Crafts Fundraising Event) in their school/local community. The project activities  are designed to be integrated into curriculum and to assure the attainment of the specific objectives of the project. Therefore, in each Transnational Learning/Training/Teaching Activities meeting which will take place in every country of this Strategic Partnership, the schedule will be similar for each mobility. \r\nIn order to project implementation, in June 2015, there will be a Transnational Project Meeting for coordinators to monitor and evaluate first year activities and results. The success of the project and objectives fulfillment will be ensured through the methodology used to implement it. Each step will be carefully planned and monitoring.

Such project work is generated by the school in partnership with local industry and players in culture, media, social work, youth and other fields and in this way it places students in contact with the labour market.  The project work will be supported by the use of a virtual digital platform that the partners will create so that it may become a common working place and cooperation between students under the instruction and mentorship of teachers and the local industry that benefits from the work of the students. This cooperation will therefore not only bring VET schools closer to enterprise but also brings enterprise into the school space. The platform will be available online so that students can work from home, in their own time, alone or together with others instilling in them a sense of responsibility, cooperation, autonomy and a sense of enterprise.Teachers and students will work in a start up environment during pilot activities in the participating schools and then after the end of the project lifetime when schools adopt InternPrize practice for themselves.There will be two training activities for teachers in Spain and in Greece on the subject of start up and on the InternPrize methodology, use of tools and virtual workspace.

This results in two distinct problems in the processing of these materials by extrusion methods. The first is the presence of small particulate contaminants, which can give rise to serious defects and the generation of scrap product. The second is batch-to-batch variability in the bulk melt flow index, due to differences in the source of the waste materials used. This demands re-optimisation of machine operating parameters, resulting in line downtime and materials wastage. Our process will be based on novel \u2018Soft Sensor\u2019 technology, which will monitor the viscosity of the polymer melt during processing and control the selective application of ultrasound to ensure consistent processing, using an intelligent fully closed-loop system. We will also develop an ultrasonically assisted filter pack capable of filtering fine particulate contaminants with a low back pressure, improving filtration of plastics. These innovations will enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled plastic materials.", 281403.0, 1108547.0, 6, 8, "ULTRAVISC", "http://www.ultravisc.org", "http://www.cherrypipes.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58254.jpg", "fp7_107640_996648326"]]}}, "7AY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Improving Coaching skills through EU Co-operation", "Dungannon United Youth C.I.C", 38388.0, 3, 4, "Dungannon United Youth CIC (DUY) applied for funding as the sending organisation to work in conjunction with Dungannon Swifts FC Ltd and Crumlin United FC to send 30 Club coaches to three different locations within the EU to increase coaching skills, studying differing levels of coaching and different aspects of coaching on each mobility.\r\n\r\nAll organisations are located within areas of targeted social need (TSN) as classified by the N Ireland Statistics Research Agency in 2010. These three organisations which span different levels in NI football worked together on this project to share their experiences to improve coaching skills  at all levels through EU co-operation. Football binds the clubs together as does the community engagement which are are committed to, in additional all are located in areas of social deprivation, within a community with mixed religious beliefs and that has a high % of ethnic minorities.\r\n\r\nFootball coaches work within one of the most results-driven labour markets in the world where only 35% of workers can expect to be in the same job position within a given three year period. Unemployment rates for professional football coaches remain above the national average with 26% of coaches holding a professional qualification being unemployed at any given moment (UEFA, 2010). This mobility programme provided participants with additional European skills to reduce the risk of subsequent unemployment for coaches at DSFC and improve job security and enable career progression for coaches at DUY and CUFC. Currently a large proportion of coaches at DUY and CUFC are volunteers but by improving their quality of coaching by undertaking an EU mobility they will be eligible to enroll as an Irish FA part time coach for which a Level 1 coach is paid \u00a314 per hour, which will boost their earning potential.\r\n\r\nThe three receiving partners in Portugal and Spain, have all been selected on the basis of them being internationally recognised Centres of Excellence in their own particular area of expertise.
