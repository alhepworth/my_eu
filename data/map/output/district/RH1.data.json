X5gon combines content understanding, user modelling quality assurance methods and tools to boost a homogenous network of (OER) sites and provides users (teachers, learners) with a common learning experience. X5gon deploys open technologies for recommendation, learning analytics and learning personalisation services that works across various OER sites, independent of languages, modalities, scientific domains, and socio-cultural contexts. It develops services OER media convergence including full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, videos, tests, software, related events, tools, materials, techniques used to support access to knowledge. Fivefold solutions are offered to OER sites:\n\u2022 Cross-modal: technologies for multimodal content understanding;\n\u2022 Cross-site: technologies to transparently accompany and analyse users across sites;\n\u2022 Cross-domain: technologies for cross domain content analytics;\n\u2022 Cross-language: technologies for cross lingual content recommendation;\n\u2022 Cross-cultural: technologies for cross cultural learning personalisation.\nX5gon collects and index OER resources, track data of users progress and feed an analytics engine driven by state-of-the-art machine learning, improve recommendations via user understanding and match with knowledge resources of all types. \nThe project will create three services X5oerfeed, X5analytics and X5recommend and run a series of pilot case studies that enable the measurement of the broader goals of delivering a useful and enjoyable educational experience to learners in different domains, at different levels and from different cultures. Two exploitation scenarios are planned: (i) free use of services for OER, (ii) commercial exploitation of the multimodal, big data, real-time analytics pipeline.", 248919.0, 2729437.0, 5, 8, "X5gon", null, null, null, "h2020_211074_969032426"], [1422748800000, 1517356800000, "Translation for Massive Open Online Courses", "Knowledge 4 All Foundation Lbg", "Massive Open Online Courses have been growing rapidly in size and impact. Yet the language barrier constitutes a major growth impediment in reaching out to all peoples and educating all citizens. TraMOOC aims at tackling this impediment by developing high-quality translation of all types of text genre included in MOOCs (e.g. assignments, tests, presentations, lecture subtitles, blog text) from English into eleven European and BRIC languages (DE, IT, PT, EL, DU, CS, BG, CR, PL, RU, ZH) that constitute strong use cases, are hard to translate into and have weak MT support, thus complying with the call objectives. Phrase-based and syntax-based statistical machine translation models will be developed for addressing language diversity and supporting the language-independent nature of the methodology. For a high quality, automatic translation approach and for adding value to existing infrastructure, extensive advanced bootstrapping of new resources will be performed. An innovative multi-modal automatic and human evaluation schema will further ensure translation quality. For human evaluation, an innovative, strict-access control, time- and cost-efficient crowdsourcing setup will be used. Translation experts, domain experts and end users will also be involved.  Separate task mining applications will be employed for implicit translation evaluation: (i) topic detection will be applied to source and translated texts and the resulting entity lists will be compared, leading to further qualitative and quantitative translation evaluation results; (ii) sentiment analysis performed on MOOC users\u2019 blog posts will reveal end user opinion/evaluation regarding translation quality. Results will be combined into a feedback vector and used to refine parallel data and retrain translation models towards a more accurate second-phase translation output. The project results will be showcased and tested on the Iversity MOOC platform and on the VideoLectures.NET digital video lecture library.", 186508.0, 2637898.0, 6, 10, "TraMOOC", null, null, null, "h2020_194192_969032426"], [1320105600000, 1414713600000, "Transcription and Translation of Video Lectures", "Knowledge 4 All Foundation Lbg", "Online educational repositories of video lectures are rapidly growing on the basis of increasingly available and standardised infrastructure.  A well-known example of this is the VideoLectures web portal, a free and open access educational video lectures repository, and a major player in the development of the widely used Opencast Matterhorn platform for educational video management.  As in other repositories, transcription and translation of video lectures in VideoLectures is needed to make them accessible to speakers of different languages and to people with disabilities. However, also as in other repositories, most lectures in VideoLectures are neither transcribed nor translated because of the lack of efficient solutions to obtain them at a reasonable level of accuracy. The aim of transLectures is to develop innovative, cost-effective solutions to produce accurate transcriptions and translations in VideoLectures, with generality across other Matterhorn-related repositories. Our starting hypothesis is that there is only a relatively small gap for the current technology on automatic speech recognition and machine translation to achieve accurate enough results in the kind of audiovisual object collections we are considering. To close this gap, TL will follow two main research lines. First, we will study how to better deal with object variability by massive adaptation of general-purpose models from available lecture-specific knowledge. Second, as we think that accurate enough results are unlikely to be obtained with fully automatic methods alone, we will explore how to better reach the desired levels of accuracy by intelligent interaction with users.  On the other hand, it is our goal not end up with a system prototype that is only evaluated at the lab and can hardly be used in real-life settings. Instead, we will develop tools to work with Matterhorn, and thus we will be able to evaluate them in a real-life setting.", 101724.0, 3714763.0, 5, 7, "transLectures", null, null, null, "fp7_100795_969032426"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "KNOWLEDGE 4 ALL FOUNDATION LBG*K4A", 248260.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_13247"], [2017, "KNOWLEDGE 4 ALL FOUNDATION LBG*K4A", 46257.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_30754"]]}}, "5JQ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1433116800000, 1446249600000, "World\u2019s first complete motion-preservation 'Implant-less' surgical correction for Scoliosis", "Atc Group Limited", "Scoliosis affects 2-3% of the world population i.e. about 12 million people in the EU. 20,000 cases of severe scoliosis are reported each year in the EU but less than 3,000 cases ever undergo surgery due to cost and complexity of the surgery. Severe cases of scoliosis are treated by spinal fusion; a major surgical procedure that makes the spine permanently rigid restricting physical activities and permanent arrest of spinal growth. The impact of spinal deformity caused by scoliosis on the quality of life before and after surgery is huge compared with other chronic conditions such as arthritis, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes and hypertension.\nDue to the need for an alternative method for better correction of scoliosis deformities we have developed novel devices and a highly innovative care model involving a safer and significantly less invasive, complete cure which preserves spinal mobility and growth potential. Our solution will result in reduced cost of treatment by over 40% because of shorter hospitalisation, reduced operating time, elimination of additional procedures and lifetime care costs.\nSpine surgery currently holds a \u20ac10.2 billion global market share and is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% to reach \u20ac17.5 billion by 2022.
