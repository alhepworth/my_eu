In Europe that movement is mostly being developed by informal groups of\r\nwomen who feel the need to join into communities with peers to exchange ideias, share knowledge and expand their business. In\r\n(name of the project) we find a priority to involve incubators/trainers/adult educators on entrepreneurship to extend their\r\ncompetences for Mumpreneurship and provide a better and suitable service for Mumpreneurs.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, FEMME project's  main purpose is to give a concrete and experimented answer for Mumpreneurs providing on one hand for trainers/educators the opportunity to exchange experiences, empower their skills and creating tools for efficient training with their European peers, and on the other hand providing women-mothers with the opportunity to participate in best practices showcases and networking activities, increase their contacts, expand their business and get in touch with other (different) ideias on a peer-to-peer basis. These will be the project's target groups: 32 Trainers/Staff members on Adul Education and Mumpreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of the project are:\r\n- To empower trainers/adult educators on mumpreneurship;\r\n- To empower mumpreneurs; \r\n- To know the state of the art of mumpreneurship in the partnership countries;\r\n- To exchange best practices on mumpreneurship initiatives;\r\n- Dissiminate mumpreneurship by establishing the basis for an European Network on Mumpreneurship;\r\n- To ensure economical/social gender equality.\r\nThe direct target groups in the project are of two kind: Trainers/Adult educators, Mumpreneurs.\r\n\r\nWithin the project we expect to produce the following products/tangible outcomes: \r\nP1) 1 Report on the state-of-the-art of European Mumpreneurship\r\nP2) 1 Guide on European best practices on Mumpreneurship\r\nP3) 1 Guide with experiences/recommendations for Trainers/Adult Educators on Mumpreneurship initiatives\r\nP4) 1 Guide for Mumpreneurs\r\nP5) 1 Web and facebookpage on Mumpreneurship project\r\nP6) 150 Leaflets for each partner\r\n\r\nWith these products we intend to achieve the folowing results:\r\nR1) Call the attention of stakeholders, local authorities and entrepreneurial ecosystem (incubators, entreprenurship trainers...) for a different economic sector\r\nR2) Increase 75%  the number of services provided by Mumpreneurs that are knowned and used in local communities\r\nR3) Empower 32 trainers/adult educators/incubators on the specific needs and key competences that should exist for a mumpreneurship ecosystem \r\nR4) Provide guidance for 80 mothers who intend to create their own business\r\nR5) Clarify what is Mumpreneurship", "http://www.hp-mos.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA204-035777_3"]]}}, "8BT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1398902400000, 1525046400000, "Consistently Optimised Resilient Secure Global Supply-Chains", "Security Projects Uk Limited", "CORE will consolidate, amplify, extend and demonstrate EU knowledge and capabilities and international co-operation for securing supply chains whilst maintaining or improving business performance, with specific reference to key Supply Chain Corridors.\nCORE will be driven by the requirements of:\n\u2022\tthe Customs,  law enforcement authorities, and other agencies nationally and internationally to increase effectiveness of security & trade compliance, without increasing the transaction costs for business and to increase co-operative security risk management (supervision & control);\n\u2022\tthe business communities, specifically shippers, forwarders, terminal operators, carriers and financial stakeholders to integrate compliance and trade facilitation concepts like green lanes and pre-clearance with supply chain visibility and optimisation.\nCORE will consolidate solutions developed in Reference Projects in each supply chain sector (port, container, air, post).

While automated systems are appealing to achieve high productivity and quality requirements, their sensitivity to change is becoming increasingly a bottleneck to substantial reduction of lot sizes and more frequent change-overs. \nThe project VISION is to enable full economic sustainability of the production systems based on intelligent modular plug-and-produce equipment. To achieve this, it is focusing on three main innovation strands: 1) embedding plug-and-produce capabilities into automation devices, robots and machines, 2) enabling vertical and horizontal connectivity between plug-and-produce automation components and higher level control and business functions, and 3) creating a easily extendable and adaptable manufacturing operating system (MOS) that permits the easy introduction of new products, work orders and changes in the equipment and allows easy deployment of optimisation and changeover management strategies. The targeted INNOVATION is a common, openly accessible plug-and-produce system platform which allows all stakeholders in the automation system value chain to come together and jointly develop and exploit solutions. Therefore, the project is proposing to integrate well established plug-and-produce system concepts from many years of research in this field, into industrial-relevant technology platforms which have emerged in recent years. \nAs the vast majority of components/ devices/ machine manufacturers and system integrators are SMEs, plug-and-produce can only be achieved by placing specific SME requirements at the forefront: solutions by, and for, SMEs.\nThe RTD approach will be driven by proposed industrial scenarios and pilot implementations which will be carried out to systematically test and validate the readiness of the targeted exploitable results in three key industrial sectors (white goods, automotive and electronics).", 310974.0, 7301611.0, 6, 16, "openMOS", null, "http://www.ceme.co.uk", null, "h2020_198382_951594154"], [1377993600000, 1504137600000, "Health Monitoring and Life-Long Capability Management for SELf-SUStaining Manufacturing Systems", "Hssmi Limited", "The vision of SelSus is to create a new paradigm for highly effective, self-healing production resources and systems to maximise their performance over longer life times through highly targeted and timely repair, renovation and up-grading.
