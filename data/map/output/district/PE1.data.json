In 2016 the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy ranked second in France and the number of people with \u201cvulnerabilities in economic, family and cultural terms\u201d is the highest in France - 45% of the population. Within the age group of 15-24 years old the Academy has a dropout rate of 28.8% in comparison to 25.4% for France. (CEREQ)\r\nWithin this dropout rate, the highest number comes from vocational high schools. An effective way to limit early school leaving and contribute to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives is to create a dynamic environment in vocational high schools. This will allow students from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds, often coming from migrant families or rural areas with fewer mobility opportunities to do their work experience in a European country.\r\nDue to the severity of the issue as described above, along with our previous successes, we the steering committee (DAREIC, GIP FCIP and the PACA Region) wish to support 42 vocational high schools in the implementation of work experiences in Europe for 902 less privileged students studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel during a 24 month period (689 Erasmus mobility grants and 213 Region co financing).\r\nThe main objective is to give them the opportunity to live an experience that will be an essential added value for their socio-professional integration. In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services. The DAREIC will coordinate the preparation, mentoring, implementation and enhancement of mobility activities of each school working together with the PACA Region. The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons. This could be achieved through the dissemination of information, personalized pre-departure coaching and by making the most of the experience gained thus creating the conditions for success within schools.\r\nGIP-FCIP, DAREIC and Region will work as a steering committee that will evaluate and measure the impact of the project, in order to develop a strategy to improve practices as well as the quality of mobility and capitalize on acquired experiences. \r\nThe impacts of this project are numerous. This experience will be a structured step in the personal and professional development of these young people and a tool to clarify their professional career plan. Locally, this project will help improve the image of vocational training courses making them more attractive. More broadly, it will have positive impacts in terms of economic development and social cohesion in the region as this multi disciplinary consortium will share, discuss and reflect ideas to tackle the priority educational objective, develop the coordination of participants, and exchange practices in the development of public policies around youth mobility in the PACA region.", "http://www.sueryder.org/shop-with-us/high-street-shopping/specialist-shops/vintage-and-retro", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046763_4"]]}}, "1JY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1288569600000, 1414713600000, "Cooperation and shared strategies for biodiversity research programmes in Europe", "Jncc Support Co Lbg", "The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems are major scientific and societal challenges.

Because of the globalization, employees of the future will work in a more diverse environment. Looking at these trends, 21st Century skills are gaining in importance. With the Skills Agenda (2016) the European Commission invites stakeholders to work together to: Improve the quality and relevance of skills formation -  Make skills more visible and comparable - Improve skills intelligence and information. Critical thinking, entrepreneurship, problem solving or digital competences are just some of the competences enshrined. In the changing labour market, VET organisations need to have attention for the 21st century skills to prepare students for the future. Research shows the implementation of the 21st century skills in VET is not sufficient within the Business educational programmes. Occupations in the Business sector are changing (think of e-commerce/e-services) and organisations need to develop modern and future-oriented Business educational programmes. To be able to do this it is necessary to find out the real competence needs that companies sets to to future work. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: With the results of this project partners have the overall desire to improve the employability of VET students in the Business sector or as entrepreneurs in Europe. Therefore, the project has the objective to develop future-oriented and innovative modules for business educational VET programmes.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: In this project 6 partners work together to achive the common objective of the project: 5 VET organisations and 1 company in the business sector. Partners have promised to stimulate the exchange of/between teachers who want to develop international education and teaching with others from abroad. Together they will stimulate the use of new technical development in learning and teaching. After research the partners concluded it is important to investigate the 21st century skills employees need in the Business sector so that future-oriented innovative modules can be developed in VET. Additionally, teachers of the VET organisations need skills (mainly digital and communication) and tools to design and teach the modules. The close collaboration between teachers, students and companies in this project is very unique.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND RESULTS\r\nEuropean framework of 21st century skills for the business sector: \r\nVET organisations, students and companies create a common understanding for which 21st skills employees of the future need in the Business sector. Beside that they will also create a common understanding for which 21st skills teachers in business educational VET programmes need to be able to prepare students successfully for their future. A European Framework with competences will be developed. \r\n\r\nBlended learning modules and OER: \r\nWith the help of the mentioned framework, teachers and other professionals teachers are able to design future-oriented innovative modules. The modules will be based on blended learning and it will be possible to integrate them into the VET qualification standard, they will be available in a free open education resource (OER - e.g. Moodle). \r\n\r\nTeacher training activities and programme:\r\nWith the help of the mentioned framework, teachers will be trained to develop their skills so that they will be able to design and teach the modules as a part of their programme. A custom made teacher training programme will be developed and executed. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nIn this project the participants will work project-based, structured towards the formulated objectives and results. The project period will be divided in consecutive phases (preparation, exploration, training part 1, development, training part 2, testing and adjusting, evaluation and disseminatio). Every phase knows it's own activities and results.\r\n\r\nIMPACT AND LONGER TERM BENEFIT\r\nThe project will have a positive impact on the participating organisations and their teachers/professionals and VET students. The employability of VET students in the Business sector or as entrepreneurs in Europe will be improved. The results will have posItive impact on companies in the business sector and policy makers (ministries of educations) too.

The region in which ROC de Leijgraaf is located has large numbers of internationally operating technical, logistic and agricultural businesses that increasingly require young professionals with international experience. ROC de Leijgraaf wants to help fulfill this requirement by offering  its students challenging education, future oriented education.  In order to provide education within this framework we want to offer students the opportunity  to go on international internships and teachers will require supplementary training in an international environment. This is the reason for this application.\r\n\r\nAt ROC de Leijgraaf 4000 young students between the age of 15 and 20 follow vocational education at EQF levels 2, 3 or 4. These young students take full time courses and annually 60 students go on an international work placement (this includes non-subsidized international work placements). ROC de Leijgraaf would like to participate in reaching the goal, that was set by Brussels, of 6% international work placements in 2020. Our target for the next two years is to send 160 students  on an international internship (both subsidized and non-subsidized). We want to achieve this by being a good and transparent organization with clearly identifiable contacts for the students. This means we will not have a collective  international office for the whole organization but rather individual  coordinators in each department who are therefore more recognizable and approachable for the students. In order to achieve this we operate according to a four tier approach. 1. We provide information at the right time; 2. We provide customized supervision in the preparation of the international internship; 3. We provide guidance during the internship and finally 4. We evaluate and process after the internship.\r\nIn addition we adapt our programme to the relevant level of  the student.  We invite higher level students to participate in an individual international work placement whereas lower level students are stimulated to participate in international internships as a group.\r\nIn preparation of the international internships and activities we entered into a partnership with schools in Germany (2), Finland, France and England in September 2016.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed which included clauses regarding the exchange of students and teachers.\r\n\r\nROC the Leijgraaf has 650 staff members. Annually an average of 20 staff members participate in international supplementary training. However, 50 to 60 staff members are actively involved in international projects. Not only by supervising students during their international work placement but by their involvement in projects in Bosnia, France, USA, Germany, and other countries in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we would like to increase the number of staff members who participate in international supplementary training up to 40. We aim to do so through partnerships. Participating teachers will also have to be prepared to collaborate with colleagues from partner schools in the development of international education.\r\nWith this project we expect to be able to provide students with a more international education and thereby increase their chances on the employment market. Furthermore, we will be able to help regional business fulfil their need for professionals with international experience. Our own staff members will become more flexible in the use of new methodologies and teaching techniques in their lessons and finally we will be contributing towards better relations and understanding in Europe.", "http://www.peterborough.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA102-034958_4"], [2017, "MORE TO EUROPE", "Peterborough Regional College", 68459.0, 7, 7, "The project will develop management and administration of student internships in Europe (on-the-job learning) so that it fulfills effectively the vocational skills requirements in vocational education curricula and builds up the the students' competence and competence points.

With the implementation of projects within the framework of ERASMUS + the Berufskolleg Viersen is able to offer pupils the opportunity to complete internships abroad. In addition, cooperation with new partner institutions is to be intensified and partnerships, which already exist for several years, are to be continued.\r\nIn the field of carpentry the two individual mobilities requested here are a supplement to an existing non-ERASMUS+ funded exchange in France. By offering this stay in Sweden the students have a greater variety in choosing a possible internship abroad according to their inclinations or language skills.\r\nFor many years the exchange with the V\u00e4stervik Gymnasium in Sweden and the associated internships abroad in the field of electrical engineering have been an integral part of the European activities of the Berufskolleg Viersen. By applying four mobility options for this educational program this tradition is continued.\r\nWith the application for three further mobilities for the \"H\u00f6here Berufsfachschule Informationstechnik\" (fulltime vocational school IT) it is intended to initiate and establish exchange projects in this program as well. The implementation of the internship abroad in the twin town of Peterborough provides a link between the area of IT and the dominant English language in this area.\r\n\r\nSix requested mobilities for educational staff are used to identify the framework conditions of the various education systems in the partner countries and within new partner institution. For this purpose a symposium has been formed two years ago involving several schools from different European countries. In this context knowledge transfer and best practice knowledge take place. In addition, it is important to enable training staff to manage the modalities and to acquire new mobilities.\r\n\r\nA stay abroad inevitably requires either the use of a foreign language, even if it is not the host country, and / or other communication. The listening comprehension of a previously, probably in the school context learned language is sharpened by the internship, the use of the language as well as the vocabulary are being simplified. A stay abroad promotes foreign language and communication skills of the participants and can therefore also lead to improved academic performance.\r\nIn addition to the professional and language-related skills an increase of the soft skills takes place. In dealing with people from different countries and by staying in a different cultural radius attitudes and behavior can be changed. The initially as strange regarded circumstances are increasingly seen as diversity and enrichment. By sharing views and opinions with people in the host country the intercultural competence is increased. Increasing curiosity and change in tolerance behavior have a positive effect on the development of the personality structure.\r\n\r\nAll mobilities have in common that the trainees are performing their internship in private enterprises or public, non-profit organisations. The duration will be limited to 14 days. For all projects the application procedure includes the expression of the motives and goals in terms of participation in mobility for all participants. During the placements, participants gain professional or job-related knowledge and skills taking country-specific characteristics into account. The trainees of the electrical engineering are accompanied and supervised by educational staff of the BK Viersen. For the other mobilities the monitoring is being realised by education staff of the respective partner institutions.\r\n\r\nA documentary will be prepared by each trainee afterwards and presented within the respective department. This way further learners are encouraged to participate in mobility projects.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits to the trainees will be an increase of diverse skills that lead to improved occupational competence and advanced personal skills.\r\nThrough additional mobility projects the Vocational School of Viersen quantitatively expands the educational area and the provision of advanced education.

This proposal will launch a knowledge-transfer programme between industries and Universities for designing durable fuel injection systems through use of existing as well as newly developed CFD models that will build upon those currently used by the industrial partners. These models will include effects not captured so far but believed to be of imperative importance: the prediction of cavitation surface erosion occurring upon collapse of cavitation bubbles. The new models will account for the effect of extreme pressure and temperature developing instantaneously at the time of bubble collapse. In addition, the heat produced during the fast acceleration of the fuel as it flows through the injection holes can result to flow boiling and thus, significantly alter the heat transfer characteristics between the flowing fluid and the metal of the injector. Models for boiling heat transfer will be included to the CFD models predicting the cavitating flow development and surface erosion.
