These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies.

The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs.

Removal of limestone pavement stone for decorative use in domestic gardens has been the main threat to these habitats in the past, but there is now also a growing concern about the impact of commercial afforestation with non-native species.  The needle fall and shade of the closing canopy is leading to a significant deterioration of the habitats.  Loss of traditional woodland management practices is also resulting in the gradual decline in species diversity at these sites.

Given the inadequate educational and well-being outcomes for many of the most disadvantaged groups in British society (particularly looked-after children, families experiencing multiple problems) the social care sector is called upon to achieve fundamental changes. The high-profile Munro review of child protection argued for a child-centred system as is commonly found in countries where social pedagogy underpins care and welfare provisions. The influential Association of Directors of Children's Services therefore recommended that local authorities should adopt social pedagogy to ensure 'a consistent and holistic approach to underpin the commissioning and provision of support for children and young people across the age range, and their families'. Whilst social pedagogy is clearly recognised as a way of addressing the need for systemic change - the Government is currently funding a social pedagogy pilot under its Innovation Programme - and pilot projects have consistently demonstrated its potential to improve outcomes, taking social pedagogy to scale is hampered by the cost of training a substantial part of the workforce and a lack of free comprehensive learning resources that can offer compelling insights into social pedagogical practice in other countries and support innovation.We aim to address these issues effectively by creating a Massive Open Online Course in European social pedagogy, consisting of 9 sessions that offer unique insights into social pedagogy in the partner countries. Our international multi-sector partnership between 9 organisations leading social pedagogy developments in higher education, vocational training and organisational capacity-building is designed to share innovative and best practice across linguistic barriers that have frequently prevented cross-fertilisation in social care across Europe. To support this aim and influence policy-making, we also propose to produce an academic research report that draws on the learning about social pedagogy between the 7 participating countries, outlines innovative ideas with the potential to impact on social care practice and makes policy recommendations about how these can be cross-culturally translated in order to develop a coherent conceptual and practice framework in social pedagogy across Europe.
