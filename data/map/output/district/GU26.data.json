Students are required to develop technical knowledge, skills and experience in addition to linguistic competence in the fields of service of food and beverages, in bartending, hotel management and in travel agencies. The preparation of work placements will be jointly carried out by the partners of the project. \r\nThe students should gain knowledge of operations management and control processes from a European perspective. They should get a clearer understanding of the European language and culture of the country where the placement takes place. The placement abroad should help to increase self-confidence and interest in tourism-related jobs.\r\nThe sending partner is responsible for preparing the trainees for their placements so that they are aware of the culture of the receiving partners' country and to ensure that their trainees have the required linguistic and technical skills  for  work placements.\r\nThe sending partner  selects those young people who can benefit most from the program. The students have to agree to the  individual learning objectives and action plans of their host companies. The sending partner will send this information to the receiving partners. The receiving partners will make sure that the participants get adequate job offers and send work placement information to the sending partner so that the participants can  be adequately prepared before going abroad.\r\nThe receiving partners will be responsible for providing support to the participants during their placements. They will inform the work placement provider, will assist with the continual assessment of each participant and provide individual skills profiles on completion. The  final assessment will be carried out at the workplace by the host company and the receiving project manager.\r\nOne main target of the project is to make the  participants aware of the different cultures and different tourism systems operating in the EU member states.\r\nThe project will promote vocational training of young people and prepares them for their working life and the technological changes for which the travel & tourism industry is renowned. \r\nThe development of linguistic skills is an essential part of the project.  The coordinator maintains the view that Germany will not be included in the program as the language acquisition does not play any role whatsoever.\r\nIn order to be able to gain appropriate experience, a minimum length of stay in a foreign country is necessary. Our students are obliged to undergo practical trainings  8 weeks at the Higher Vocational School) in the fields of service as well as cooking, in  reception work (including customer services ) and in bartending, wine expertise, event management and in many more fields.\r\nAs there is no compulsory international training, this project offers a unique opportunity for the students to work abroad and to gain experience not only in practical areas of education but also in theoretical areas, such as foreign language training. \r\nIt has been agreed that a suitable length of stay is between 8 and 12 weeks . This enables complete integration into all aspects of the work process.  This length of stay also enables students to experience both professional and social everyday life in the host country.  The selection of the host countries is based upon the languages offered at our school (English, Italian, French, Spanish).  Emphasis is  placed upon work exchanges with Italy, the UK and France and Spain. A participation in the project will clearly demonstrate the flexibility and mobility of our students, two  qualifications which are expected from future employers.", "http://www.grayshottspa.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039025_7"]]}}, "6LG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1225497600000, 1320019200000, "ISO Shipping Container Tracking and Monitoring System", "The Defence Manufacturers Association Limited", "90% of all cargo moves in containers and approximately 250 million are shipped annually. There were 1138035 SMEs in EU 25 as of 2003 in the transport and communications industry. The SME segment of the road transport industry in EU 25 employs 3.2 Million people, whilst 107200 personnel are employed in the SME maritime transport industry. Our member transport operators face theft of goods, illegal immigration, transport of dangerous goods and drug and contraband smuggling. In addition to these crimes, authorities must be vigilant to possible terrorist use or targeting of transport vehicles and infrastructure. Among these multiple threats, the misuse of the ISO maritime shipping container transport system is the most important one requiring a co-ordinated pan European response. The ubiquity of containers is the system\u2019s principal strength; however there is little or no control over possible mis-use of the system by terrorists because less than 2% of containers are X-rayed or checked at ports. Current tracking devices require external antennas and are prone to damage or vandalism. Our concept is to replace the container door with a composite one which is transparent to RF. Tracking and sensing electronics to detect door opening, chemical explosives, radioactive devices and stowaways would be encapsulated in the door, thus greatly improving security and reducing losses. Target price of the system is \u20ac 740. We have estimated that over a ten year period insurance savings alone would amount to approximately \u20ac 38 billion across Europe.", 174095.0, 2375784.0, 9, 14, "ISOTRACK", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112305.jpg", "fp7_94520_998516740"]]}}}}
