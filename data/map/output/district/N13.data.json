The objectives of this project are primarily to raise awareness among young people about the effects of the climate change, and to empower young people to raise their voice in the global debate on preserving natural environment. Other objective is the increased learning mobility opportunities for young people, through organizing the event on Svalbard region highly affected and topic of intense debate. A travel to arctic will give to young participants broader perspective on the topic, but also a platform to reaching wider audience through allowing them to witness on the spot the real effects of the climate change and thus to prepare a reliable dissemination results that will be later shared on the social medias.Within Climate-Action project, we attempt to:- to promote the pro-ecological way of living in Europe thanks to the use of social media and the intellectual outcomes of the expedition of young people to Svalbard - to teach young people that through creating intentional groups we could more efficiently tackle the contemporary social issues- presenting Svalbard as an integral European territory, and involving young Europeans into caring about this land- fostering cooperation between young people from Europe, UK, Svalbard, Norway and Turkey.The project predicts 10 participants from UK, Norway and Turkey who will spend time together with each other in 2016.

The cultural diversity will be the starting point for a presentation of the different ways of celebrating Christmas as well as a debate on 'the importance to get united in diversity (to raise awareness about EU values)' as well as on tolerance, exclusion, racism and xenophobia.. Moreover, all countries are encouraged to take part in the event with at least one participant with disadvantaged backgrounds and/or fewer opportunities from either a social, economical, health/medical, educational, cultural or geographical point of view to foster (as for the other participants) their inclusion, mobility and employability. On the other hand, the event provides an opportunity for students and teachers to network with a view to future collaboration in terms of arranging student and teacher exchanges, and of planning participation in European programs.The main part of the event is an exhibition build up in two multi-purpose halls of the hosting hotel in the city center of San Benedetto del Tronto, where each delegation gets a stand to be decorated with typical Christmas items from their regions and where they offer small products for tasting from their country. They should distribute documentation on their region and discuss with the visitors about the different Christmas customs in Europe. The hosting partner will above all organize  an entertainment program together with other Italian schools or organizations. Its principal will ask the local Municipality to invite local primary schools to visit the exhibition with their pupils, thus giving them an opportunity to have a \"European look\" at Christas and its customs. After the official opening of the exhibition to the public, the event continues with a Parade through the old city of San Benedetto del Tronto, to promote the event amongst the local population, in which the participants march in their traditional Christmas clothes ( e.g. Saint Lucia for Sweden, Beffana for Italy, St Nicholas (Sinterklaas) for the Czech Republic or Hous\u00e9cker for Luxembourg, Christkindel for Alsace, St Nikolaus and Krampus for Austria, Father Frost and the Little Snow Child for Russia, aso) with their national flags and those of the AEHT and the Erasmus+ Program fluttering in the breeze along a route decided by the organizers. On two evenings, always half of the delegations will set up a European Buffet at the Hotel school IPSSOA BUSCEMI, where students will have to prepare and serve traditional food for Christmas from their region. The guests are the participants themselves as well as special guests invited by the hosting partner who supported financially or materially the event. For the following day is scheduled a Cultural show at the City theater with presentations by each delegation on Christmas traditions (songs, music, dances, legends, sketches, ...) in their respective countries. A religious Church Service may be considered an optional extra, and attendance will be free choice. A Tourism program as well as a sociocultural program will be offered by the hosting partner to the participants during their stay to get even more acquainted with the hosting city and region as well as its traditions. An group excursion to discover the wonders of Ascoli Piceno and Offida is also scheduled. At the end of the activities, an assessment session will take place, which will help the AEHT to improve the organization and guarantee the smooth running of the event in future years by means of enhanced guidelines.The organizers expect significant improvements of youngsters' linguistic, cultural and transversal skills as well as main key competences. Through exchanges with their peers and new practical experiences, students will also broaden their horizons, get more responsive to sociocultural diversity, develop their professional abilities and enhance their employability. These improvements will be recorded in a Youthpass handed over to the participants.The AEHT Head Office will disseminate the outcomes of the projects via its newsletter, Internet site and Facebook page to all 400 AEHT member schools and even not members. All other partners will also contribute to the dissemination of outcomes through different media amongst their school community.", "http://www.docklandsacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-LU02-KA105-000248_3"], [2016, "Competentiegericht evalueren in een Europees kader", "SIMPLY ALLIANCE LTD", 18590.0, 7, 8, "Provincial Institute Piva wants to adress the evaluation of competences in school in a modern way. In view of the growing number of nationalities among the student population in Flanders and more specifically in Antwerp, each with their own cultural background and schoolcareer, we are looking for modern and flexible evaluation instruments.Instruments that will allow the pupil to evaluate himself and others, aided by a teacher or coach.In Piva we would like to implement this in a modern and digital way within all 4 fields of expertise offered in our school (bakery \u2013 butchery \u2013 hotel and catering industry \u2013 tourism).In order to get an idea of existing evaluation systems for vocational education abroad, we would like to send 16 teachers to schools with which we have formed a partnership through relevant Erasmus+ experiences in the CHASE-network and AEHT. The schools were specifically chosen in light of the difference in evaluation systems applied.We further plan to send 2 teachers to Europe\u2019s biggest ICT-event for education, the BETT show in London, over the next two years. This will allow the teachers to attend workshops and lectures concerning the evolution of ICT in education.Since 2014 Piva has been working on a strategic plan for the future in which both evaluation and internationalisation are key points. This project will therefore fit perfectly within the evolution and development  of the school and the current needs within secondary school education. The final objective is to evaluate the student more efficiently and more personally as to his skills needed in his chosen labour market.We will implement this gradually with the aid of digital tools that will facilitate differentiation and that will make the evaluations fit closer to the social environment of the student, the guidelines (ECVET and curriculum goals) and the reforms within the secondary education in Flanders. The \u201cM-decreet\u201d (Measurements Decree) wants to offer a wide support to every pupil and focuses mainly on the principles of UDL (Universal Design of Learning) guided by the principle that, what is necessary for some, may well be benificial to all. UDL has already been fully implemented in quite a few countries, whereas for us it is still a steep learning curve. Also in this field we could certainly learn a lot from the experience gained in other countries.", "http://www.docklandsacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE02-KA101-017174_6"]]}}, "4XS": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "FAITH MATTERS COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 49951.0, "Promoting non-discrimination and equality (33.02.02)", "fts_2017_28037"]]}}}}
