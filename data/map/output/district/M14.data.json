Young people from the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom will come together to learn with and from each other.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to empower young people by encouraging the development of skills and competencies needed to participate fully in European societies. In addition, the aim is to raise awareness of European values and socially relevant subjects.\r\nSUFIS  from Stockholm  is working on this project together with Moss side in the UK, Dalmar from Netherlands, and GIK from Denmark. These NGOs noticed in their daily work with migrant and refugee youth that they often experience barriers to full participation in the European society. They grow up in a society that differs culturally from the society in which they and / or their parents grew up. They are therefore confronted with cultural differences, but they are unaware of what that means for them. These  youngsters are not used to reflecting on this. Thus making their bi-culturality  a risk rather than an opportunity. They experience uncertainty and are unaware of the value of their latent inter-cultural competencies. Socio-economic inequalities are additional barriers to participate as full citizens.\r\n\r\nBy this exchange we offer 36 youngsters, aged 18 to 26 years with different background, the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills, and give them a learning experience in an international and inter-cultural environment. The participating youngsters participate in a program of diverse informal learning methods: energizers and other playful games, workshops, excursions, dialogue, debate and cultural exchange. They are encouraged to reflect on and take full responsibility for their learning process. This project enables young people to become active and socially engaged citizens and to use the gained knowledge and experience for the benefit of their societies.", "http://www.mosssidesportsclub.com", null, "erasmus_2017-2-SE02-KA105-001835_2"]]}}, "4PX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "For those about to dance!", "CrisNandez group", 20730.0, 6, 6, "This project is a multilateral youth exchange funded by the European Commission through the \"Erasmus +\" program.

The total number of participants will be nearly fifty including leaders in each country. The proposed activities revolve around the world of Hip Hop in all its facets (dancing, rapping, graffitty and DJ) as a vehicle for the active participation of young men and women migrants, refugees and natural in rural and urban degraded areas where young people have difficulty access to opportunities. The methods used will be participatory, active and very dynamic, detailed in the annex of activities.\r\n\r\nThis project puts us in a new scenario, to which we find ourselves not if not for participation in projects like this. By mere tourist we would not get a glimpse of the lives of others as we will have during the days activities. Other ways of living day to day, the perspective that each one gives to the common problems that we have and young Europeans places us in a space of greater awareness of other cultures, especially when a migrant and you live in a rural area poorly communicated, for example. These cross-cutting aspects characterize this project and contextualize.\r\n\r\nOur project promotes dialogue between young people from different backgrounds and cultures, because it is a multilateral project, ie several bands, with wealth in nuances that entails. Thus, we promote intercultural encounters that will both informal and non-formal spaces, the foundation of the methodology applied.\r\n\r\nThis project also helps to prevent and combat prejudice, where we highlight those that lead to the exclusion, in its broadest sense. We look forward to the participation of each and everyone irrespective of their origin, economic status, social status, disability, geographical difficulties. We will pay special attention to the inclusion of women and men on equal at all times. There also will monitor balance nationalities, when we do group activities.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize that this project encourages a sense of mutual respect and understanding of diversity in the European mosaic in which we live. This project is like a small sociological, intense and extremely instructive experiment.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a clear effect on strengthening the sense of European citizenship among the young people who will participate in it. But so it will have on the people who will indirectly contact us during activities and even after the conduct. Thus, other youth groups, media and even technicians, experts and politicians will be more present than ever the importance and value we have young people as engines of social change, with a clear European approach.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have a more intimate and personal effect. It will allow us to understand our role as part of the present and the future of Europe, as key players in the process of change and improvement of the living space in which we live.

Several members of staff who teach languages have not received formal language-teaching training and therefore would greatly benefit from firsthand experience of  teaching methodology whilst being immersed in the culture and language of the country.  All of the staff involved in this project teach across the service, so will be able to disseminate their new skills to a wider cohort. Due to the transient nature of the students, many of the students returning to their mainstream schools will have benefited from the improved level of teaching and an enriched curriculum.  The proposed project will offer the staff involved the opportunity to establish and forge links with teaching staff in France. \r\nAs part of the whole-school development plan focusing on developing links with the wider community, we have identified that the school does not currently have a link with schools in Europe. The project will help the school to forge links with a school in France. Prior to the visit, the participants will complete and carry out with students baseline assessments to gauge both staff and student levels in the target language. This will enable progress to be measured as the assessments will be repeated on return. The participants will carry out detailed research into the area they are visiting and the education system and prepare information to share with the staff and students in the host school. \r\nThe members of staff who will be taking part in the project due to the nature of the service teach a wide range of subjects and have recently been asked to teach more Modern Foreign Languages across the sites. One member of staff who has been teaching for about 20 years feels that she would benefit from being immersed in the language to regain confidence in her pronunciation and to be inspired and motivated by new methodology. \r\nThe course provider will issue our participants with clear expectations and the course will be certificated. There will be a contract between Manchester Hospital School and Home Teaching Service and the course provider focusing on learning arrangement, roles and responsibilities to ensure that quality learning takes place and students benefit. \r\nThe project will have a significant impact on the participants.
