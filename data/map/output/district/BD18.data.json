This will save European healthcare organisations huge sums whilst improving patient outcomes. The consortium contains all the necessary partners to ensure success.\nBased on the concept of 4P medicine, CONNECARE will provide decision support for the adaptive management of personalised clinical pathways and will deliver tools to monitor patients\u2019 activities and status, thus empowering them and providing them with recommendations to self-manage their condition, resulting in substantial improvements in their quality of life.\nThe three dimensions underpinning the required proposed paradigm shift are:\n1. Organisational: making health and social care systems interoperable, promoting collaboration among care settings, and moving from institutional reactive care to a home-based preventive model.\n2. Care and social services: addressing health risk prediction by combining already operational population-based tools with a patient-based five-dimension scoring strategy consisting of i) screening, ii) risk stratification, iii) mapping, iv) intervention, and v) surveillance. \n3. Technological: delivering a CONNECARE system which leverages existing assets from partners to offer smart Adaptive Case Management, self-management and 3-level monitoring features, fully integrated with management systems in place.\nAn iterative patient-centred co-design process will ensure a progressive refinement of model and tools, providing foundations for adoption and transferability. In addition, clinical trials will be held in three leading-light regions in integrated care uptake \u2013Catalonia, Israel, and Groningen \u2013 to evidence improvements in outcomes and efficiency.

Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services.
