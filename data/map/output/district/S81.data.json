We have a top priority: gaining an international and European exposure. Some of us have sent students and apprentices abroad for a couple of years and managed to build a reliable network of workplaces and strong partnerships (UK, Finland, Spain, Germany). Experienced and willing to make mobility accessible to a greater number of students, we want to encourage the expansion of the other members thanks to our network thus allowing more young people from modest backgrounds to go on work experience placements.\r\nOur mobility actions are aimed at vocational baccalaureate students and apprentices in Commerce, Customer Services, Sales, Logistics and vocational baccalaureate students in Business & Administration, Beauty & Care, Clothing Design and Metal Work. All the students are part of our European classes. They wish to gain professional and cultural skills in a foreign environment and raise their language level. Mobility experiences are real life experiences and assets to complete their training, adapt to the demands of the labour market and continue their studies.\r\nWe have planned to send 90 students and 30 apprentices, aged 17 to 20, over the next two years. We will send different groups of selected students together according to their lines and types of training. The baccalaureate students will stay for 4 weeks whereas the apprentices for 2 weeks owing to the legal obligations binding them to their employers in France. We will inform, advise and prepare them to live a comfortable work experience abroad. Our challenge will be to mix and gather the different types of students during linguistic, cultural and professional preparation sessions by pooling the teaching staff of our colleges (teachers, language assistants and civic service voluntary workers). Our aim is to create a feeling of cohesion and help each young learner fit actively in the \u201cCitoyen d\u2019Europe\u201d path we will especially set up for them.\r\nOur students will be placed either in companies or benefit from adapted professional stays within the frame of our partnerships. The teachers will organise and coordinate the students\u2019 stays by keeping close contacts with their tutors and the college partners. They will also accompany them on their trips and will pay on-the-spot visits to assess the students\u2019 progress along with their different partners. We will use and complete both national evaluation documents (official grids based on vocational baccalaureate frameworks) and the Europass assessment forms to validate the different skills acquired. The students will be encouraged to take specific oral examinations to highlight their personal, linguistic and professional involvement (baccalaureate with the \u201cEuropean Section\u201d distinction or EuroMobipro). They will be honoured for their progress and their exemplary attitude at graduation ceremonies. \r\nWe have also planned 8 professional stays for our teaching and management staff. Their impact on teaching practices is an added value for our initial training schemes within our respective colleges.\r\nThe steering committee of our consortium will ensure the quality of our mobility actions throughout the stages of the project (organisation, financial management, intermediary and final reports). The members will draw specific attention to analysing our results, measuring the impact of the project on the students trained in their area. They will also support the partnerships to strengthen our European identity.\r\nAbove all, we are willing to act on a human level. Thanks to our project and the activities planned, we want to show our students and apprentices that they are able to succeed. The vocational route within our educational system can also contribute to the personal and professional development of these young adults.", "http://www.nnc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036810_1"], [2014, "Qualifications East Midlands and Strasbourg 5", "North Nottinghamshire College", 23865.0, 2, 7, "This project will support 28 VET specialists and practitioners working in the post-16 sector over a two year period.

The need to effectively (and imaginatively) engage with and work with employers to identify and address skills needs is well documented: the Richard review of apprenticeships and the UKCES Review of Adult Vocational Qualifications in England (November 2013).  Aligned to this is the recognition of the benefit of skills competition as a way of raising awareness and the benefits of VET.  Competitions, whether domestic ones such as the annual Skills Show or international events (Euroskills and Worldskills) are a way of showcasing the abilities of young adults but lack national buy-in.

According to the European Wind Energy Technology Platform publication \u201cO&M strategies are based on periodic inspection; fault statistics from existing stock is either unavailable or insufficient; maintenance needs to be minimised through preventative strategies and tools like conditional monitoring; performance of offshore farms is severely impacted by poor reliability leading to major production losses.\u201d Turbines are not achieving a design life of 20 years with failure rates of >1/turbine/year, remote tall structures mean that maintenance and inspection is costly and difficult. Replacing a \u20ac3000 bearing can turn into a major \u20ac165,000 cost involving cranes, crews etc. For on-shore turbines operation and maintenance costs 10-15% of income over 20 years, rising for offshore to 20-25%. Intermittency of wind power also requires standby generation by open cycle gas turbines (aero-derivative units) in order to attain rapid start-up and load following capability. These units have markedly lower MTBF compared with steam and gas turbines. This consortium wish to develop a means to perform prognosis, diagnosis and root cause analysis of rotating machines via new time-frequency analysis techniques (based on higher order spectra) to the machine vibration signature during transient operation. This differs from classic techniques which have been applied to stationary signals. Thus we overcome the problems that components cannot be excited during steady state operation and precise resonance frequencies are not known.

This is currently cured by surgical procedure which requires a viscoelastic High Molecular Weight (HMW) product of Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Device to fill the space in the eye created during the surgery and to protect the healthy endothelial cells. Due to the growing elderly population, this market segment is expected to grow at least 7% per year and will reach \u20ac80 Mn in the EU and \u20ac240 Mn worldwide by 2014. The market need for (HMW) products is currently served by Hyaluronic acid (HA) and cheaper alternatives derived from cellulose with properties inferior to HA. The manufacturers have currently to rely on few suppliers of the high-quality raw materials i.e. roosters bred on a special diet. The animal nature of the raw materials makes the SMEs particularly vulnerable in light of a bird flu outbreak, creating the threat of losing up to an entire year supply of the raw material with a single outbreak in the region. In addition, using raw materials of animal origin in humans requires compliance with existing EU regulations (EC 1774/2002 and Directive 90/426/EEC, and also Directive 86/609/EEC, 3 R\u2019s Declaration, and REACH). Hence EU SMEs such as ourselves realize that we should switch to a non-animal source of HMW substance, as a substitute to rooster combs originating HA. The main objective of the OkraVision project is to substitute animal based production of HMW HA with a cheaper and non-animal HMW substance: Rhamnopyranose\u2013Galactopyranose\u2013Galactopyranosyluronic Acid (RGGA) from the okra plant (fruit) with the targeted chain length of 800-1000 units, MW of 5-6 MDa, and the targeted zero shear viscosity of 1-3 Mn mPas for 1-2.5% aqueous solution.

Totally there are several thousand drilling rigs where approximately 2400 rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in North America. Drilling processes are lubricated by a viscous oil/water invert emulsion known as drilling mud. Although Water Based Muds, (WBM), mostly are used in the top hole sections, down in the drilling/bore holes where temperatures can reach 200\u00baC, the mud used is still Oil Based Muds,( OBM) (mixture of 45% oil, 45% water and additives) or Synthetic Based Muds (SBM). The waste from the drilling process is a heavy sludge of rock, clay, sand and drilling mud (oil and brine). In 2004 the total amount cuttings from OBM and SBM generated on the Norwegian Shelf was nearly 250 000 tonnes cuttings and 45 000 tonnes drilling oil brought onshore. Recent operations in sensitive regions in the Barents sea even requires that WBM cannot be dumped and must be treated on-shore.  From 2003 and onwards Western European countries are expected to spend on average between 0.5% to 1.5% of GDP on soil remediation in primarily the agricultural sector, industrial plants, land development and municipalities.

A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution.
