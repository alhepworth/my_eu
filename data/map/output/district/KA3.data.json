This problem is far from being solved. The main challenge encountered is that most autologous skin grafting techniques are based on transplanting split-thickness skin (the today\u2019s gold standard). Split-thickness skin contains all of the epidermis, but only remnants of the dermis. This lack of dermal tissue, frequently leads to significant scarring. Consequently, a true dermal substitute is required, which instantly exerts the cell-instructive properties of a neo-dermis. The partners of EuroSkinGraft can now offer 2 dermal substitutes, Novomaix and denovoDerm, plus the dermo-epidermal skin substitute denovoSkin. The development of all 3 substitutes was significantly supported by the FP6-program (EuroSTEC). The envisaged clinical studies are aiming strictly at a one-step surgical procedure (instead of the common two-step procedure, using Integra Artificial Skin).This is to be reached with the following protocol:\nClinical application of Novomaix\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on Novomaix applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoDerm\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: split-thickness skin on denovoDerm applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nClinical application of denovoSkin\n1.\tExperimental arm 1: denovoSkin applied on full-thickness wounds\n2.\tReference arm 1: split-thickness skin applied directly on the wound bed\nThe strength of this project lies in: the high degree to which real regenerative medicine is translated into the clinic, the innovative and highly functional character of the 3 products to be tested, the central contribution of the 3 SMEs, and the excellence of the 3 clinics.", 322878.0, 6310609.0, 5, 10, "EUROSKINGRAFT", "http://www.euroskingraft.eu/", "http://www.medicaldevice.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/161094.jpg", "fp7_101996_968950170"]]}}, "7BU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Lenguas, motor de inclusi\u00f3n", "East Ayrshire Council", 7700.0, 2, 2, "Federica Montseny Secondary School is located on the outskirts of Valencia, on the east coast of Spain and has a training offer in Compulsory Secondary Education, Upper Secondary Education (A levels) and Vocational Studies.The Compulsory Secondary students come from local Primary State Schools, one of which is a CAES Primary school (center for singular education action). The students coming from this school  belong to families with low socio-cultural level, limited economic resources and at risk of social exclusion.On the other hand, our school belongs to the net of plurilingual schools of Valencian Community and is a pioneering centre in our Community on teaching through two foreign languages (English and French) simultaneously. This allows some  of our pupils complete their studies in Secondary Education knowing four European languages: The two-cooficial and two foreign.Federica Montseny School wants to do the project \u201clanguages a motor of inclusion\u201d to include all our students in the Educative system and also in the European reality through the learning of languages, favouring their personal development, social inclusion and feeling of European Citizenship.Our main objectives focus on the improvement of all the students\u2019 linguistic competence in foreign languages, increase the multilingual courses on offer (levels and subjects), update / upgrade teacher\u2019s expertise  in didactics and methodology as well as their own language proficiency, applying new ICTs  in the classroom, getting to know at close hand an educational system with a different way of grouping students which allows us lay the foundations for a more inclusive future, increase the number of teachers involved in European projects, enhance our institution\u2019s capacity for international cooperation, increase our contacts network and contribute to develop  a European citizenship awareness in our students and institution. From all the teaching staff, the selection panel will choose 7 teachers who best meet the established profile for each mobility according to the scale set out in the project. Participants will carry out the following activities:1. Job shadowing at \u201cGrange Academy\u201d in Kilmarnock, Scotland:two teachers, one in the scientific, technical field and another in the sociolinguistic field will visit a school in the Spring of 2017 in order to get to know the Scottish educational system, its curriculum and institutional linguistic policies. They will analyse/ how this policy is applied and how ICTs are used in the classroom.2. Study visit to secondary schools and Training seminars in Belgium. 2 teachers will do job shadowing and training activities for 7 days, from 12 to 18 February, 2017. Its aim is  to take a close look at how different subjects are taught in English, to exchange professional and cultural experiences and discuss problems found at schools, educational systems and students regarding the topics mentioned. 3. Course on CLIL methodology in England: 1 teacher during 12 days from 18 to 29 July 2016 will take part in a course which aims to learn the fundamentals, develop and evaluate didactic resources and design didactic units which will help promote integration of all the students in the multilingual approach. 4. Course for teachers of  English in Ireland: \u201c\u201cExploring English and Culture in Ireland: Inquiry based methodology for Teachers of English\u201d 2 TEACHERS of English will do a 12 day training course in July 2016 the aims of which are to create an active  Portfolio, analyse Irish culture and literature, share didactic resources with other teachers, literacy across the curriculum,  promote the European dimension in education through strategies likely to lead to future KA2 partnershipsThe teachers taking part in the project will round out their teacher training in different points. Once the project has been accepted and after the selection panel has chosen the suitable teachers, each one will sign an agreement with the school, commiting to accomplishing the task program and the settled schedule for the mobility, and also to all the activities that will be carried out while the project is on. We expect the project \u201clanguages a motor of inclusion\u201d will motivate our students, increasing their self-esteem and encouraging their adaptation to school. A distinguishing mark of our school is our concern about offering our students a high standard in foreign languages. Thanks to this project, we will improve and increase our multilingual courses on offer, so that it reaches the most students at our school.The language training and direct watching of the methodology used by other schools will let us address high quality plurilingual programs.We mean to get the training needed to integrate all the students in the educative system and in the European reality, through language learning, favouring their personal development, their social inclusion and awareness of European citizenship.", "http://Www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023329_1"]]}}, "7DF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Language Immersion Course", "Kilmarnock Academy", 3207.0, 1, 1, "Whilst this application is for one secondary school teacher from James Hamilton Academy to take part in a Spanish language immersion course, our whole staff team are committed to raising attainment in language learning, in line with the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 Languages Approach and the national curriculum.

The activities, resources and materials received will be shared with school colleagues and across East Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project we anticipate an increase in language capacity, improved confidence when teaching Spanish, the acquisition of teaching ideas to provide stimulating and engaging language lessons and ICT being used more fully in language learning. This will allow our learners to access foreign languages more fully and provide scope for links to be made with European schools. In the longer term, we hope to raise attainment in language learning, ignite enthusiasm for learning about other languages and cultures and therefore see an increased uptake of languages in the senior school.
