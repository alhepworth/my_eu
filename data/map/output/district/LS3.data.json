The Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST) is the major Vocational Educational and Training (VET) college in the Maltese Islands. The MCAST trains and prepares youths and adults in a wide range of specialised skills in order to provide the Maltese future workforce. It is therefore crucial in the current global scenario for the MCAST to keep its VET system constantly updated by exposing and training its students and staff in other countries and beyond the national VET scenario. In itself the project acts as an essential cross-fertilisation project for VET education across the EU.  \r\na) The INCVET project in line with the MCAST European Internationalization Strategy will give MCAST students a work experience in an other European country. Students from all of the MCAST institutes, including: creative arts, sciences, engineering, business, ICT and community services will be eligible. For each of its six different institutes, the MCAST has identified a number of potential partners which will host students in companies, organisations or colleges abroad. These partnerships and their links to the different institutes and areas of studies are summarised in the attached Annex 2.  The expected learning outcomes for the students going on an Erasmus+ traineeship are to: \r\n1. gain work experience in their specific industry \r\n2. increment the educational experience at MCAST by learning new tools & accessories on their placement abroad\r\n3. face the main challenges in the specific industry\r\n4. learn to work under pressure, in a team and independently\r\n5. appreciate the main differences between the local market & the European market\r\n6. discover another European country i.e culture, language, values\r\nThe INCVET project would offer 126 students the possibility to do a traineeship in a company or vocational college abroad. \r\nMCAST will also participate actively in the new ErasmusPro by sending 20 students attending the Officer in Charge Navigational Watch course to carry out a practical training period at sea. By linking their training with the INCVET project the MCAST will be supporting a whole class of students from the  Centre for Maritime Studies (CMS) to carry out training lasting for 6 months as officers on sea-going merchant ships &/or coastal merchant ships &/or cruising crafts &/or yachts or fishing trawlers.  This experience is an example of integration between the educational curriculum at MCAST and the Erasmus+ program.\r\nIn 2018 both Valletta and Leeuwarden are cultural capitals of Europe. MCAST has been collaborating with the colleges of ROC Friese Poort , Nordwin  and Friesland and various student exchanges and collaborative projects have been developed. MCAST is planning on sending 30 students to the Netherlands to collaborate and do a traineeship experience with their Dutch peers. These mobilities are in line with the MCAST European Internationalisation Strategy and are aimed at giving an exposure to students in their area of study and to give a cultural experience.\r\nThrough all student mobilities MCAST students will get a different perspective to their industry while keeping updated with latest technologies and working methods. The placement abroad will increment the education and training of the students and it will help students become more independent while opening up their minds to other European cultures and values.  Each successful student mobility will be recognized by a signed and registered Europass Mobility Certificate.\r\nb) In line with the MCAST European Internationalization Strategy 'MCAST firmly believes that the continuous professional development of its staff is key to the college's success'. It is crucial for MCAST staff to stay constantly updated within their respective fields so that they can provide an updated instruction to MCAST students. It is essential for staff within the sciences, information technology, creative arts and engineering to be kept abreast with technological advancements. Through  a 5-day training in other vocational schools MCAST staff will observe new areas of study, new technologies, new teaching methods etc.  The staff will scrutinize the curricula of their respective fields with experts in other VET institutions. This will be a cross-fertilisation exercise across VET institutions.  The mobilities will be in line with the MCAST training needs for both academic and administrative staff (Annex 3).\r\nc) Students and staff with special needs will have an equal opportunity to apply and participate in this project. These participants will be supported whole-heartedly by the MCAST International Office and the NA, including the provision of accompanying persons where needed. \r\nFinally, refer to Annex 4 for the Application, Selection Procedure and Dissemination.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-MT01-KA116-038354_2"], [2017, "Planes, Trains & Mobilities to VET Opportunities across Europe", "Leeds City College", 490749.0, 16, 28, "Leeds City College aims to maximise every opportunity to help our students to obtain the critical, in-demand skills and competences sought after by employers and to ensure that all students are prepared for future progression to further/higher education, Apprenticeships & /or sustained employment. \r\nPlanes, Trains and Mobilities to Vet Opportunities across Europe, along with localised work experience and enrichment activities, will drive this intention. Beneficiaries will be able to engage in the working practices, cultures and society of their European counterparts which in turn will determine their attitudes and the values that they place in Europe and International engagement. \r\nAs well as the intrinsic development of employability and the technical /educational enhancement of sector specific skills and professional craft, the Mobility placements provide a unique experience for all beneficiaries, but especially students, to develop greater resilience as they encounter new situations, ways of working and living which challenge and extend their own knowledge, experience and aspirations. Given the increasing pace of global change, including the unknown impact of \u2018brexit\u2019, independent learning, employability and transitional skills are imperative for our students to sharpen their competitive edge and to cope and thrive with the ever-changing pressures of employment, re skilling, up skilling and responding to diversification of employment work patterns.\r\nQualitative evidence demonstrates that successful completion of an overseas placement has an impact on student beneficiaries\u2019 personal development & maturity but also gives them a level of credibility and differentiation that can contribute significantly to their future progression. Access to mobility placements is hugely advantageous to LCC students, many of whom have underachieved at school and lack the basic, vocational and soft skills required to access jobs. \r\n\r\nPlanes, Trains & Mobilities will enable 203 LCC students from 14 curriculum schools to participate in a variety of work settings in 15 countries, hosted by 27 partners.\r\n25 Staff will participate in Staff Trainer Activities (STA) and 50 staff will participate as accompanying tutors to student placement.\r\n\r\nThe key themes running through the 17-19 project are: \r\n*The continued enhancement of sector specific, employability and other transferable skills with reference to Europe 2020 and the Leeds City Region LEP Strategic Economic Plan 2016-36 \r\n*The continue to implement ECVET to add value and enhance independent learning\r\n*To underpin college expertise through teaching methodology, strategic awareness and exposure to different EU approaches and to apply good practice to inform curriculum design, college wide services and professional acumen to the benefit of the wider college and college group\r\n*To scope partner response and solutions to changing employment markets, in particular how mismatches of supply and demand are met.\r\n*To ensure that dissemination activities have a wider impact & that a ripple effect can be achieved for the benefit of the wider college and external networks - ref European Internationalisation Development Plan (EIDP)\r\n*To work with partners to develop post \u2018brexit\u2019 strategies to ensure that that this hugely important reciprocal co-operation can be sustained and grown, with reference to the EIDP and 2017/18 Internationalisation Strategy.\r\n\r\nThe project will include opportunities for students with learning difficulties and other disabilities building on the partnerships established in 2016-18 and aims to continue to grow the number of apprentice beneficiaries, as outlined in the EIDP for 2017/18. For the SLDD placements, accompanying tutors will provide a high level of support for the full duration of the mobility.\r\nThe STA allocation includes greater involvement from senior management, apprenticeship specialists and student services. \r\nThe majority of partners are well established and through the quality review process offer sector specific placements that fully adhere to students qualifications and sector ambitions. These relationships have also led to the STA placements that aim to improve good practice and to share /refocus strategic approach and bias. In line with the EIDP, new partners have been introduced  to further the scope of beneficiary experience and the wider impact on the operational awareness of  LCC, with reference to niche work placement opportunities, curriculum quality and shared experience of multi campus, city based colleges and large economically and ethnically diverse student cohorts. \r\n\r\nThe range of partners and member states enables LCC to oversee a wide range of employer and education practice, cultural & social priorities and different methodology & bias. The quality of partnerships ensures that placements are a good fit, that it is realistic to implement ECVET across the majority of student mobilities and that the safety and safeguarding of beneficiaries is secured.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", "Leeds City College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA116-036084_coordinator"], [2018, "Expanding Horizons: Developing VET Opportunities across Europe", "Leeds City College", 457744.0, 16, 27, "Expanding Horizons: Developing VET Opportunities across Europe builds on the knowledge, expertise and experience of previous KA1 VET mobility projects, and is driven from the evaluation & impact measurements of the 2016-18 and 17-19 project allocations. For this project, partner organisations have been selected based on standards of vocationally specific work placements and the quality of the holistic mobility experience. The relationship with many of these partnerships is based on reciprocal arrangements and the trust and respect established through years of collaboration. The KA1 Application will see 192 student beneficiaries, supported by 49 accompanying tutors and 8 staff trainers representing 10 vocational sectors completing mobilities with 26 partners in 15 EU countries.\r\nExpanding Horizons continues to implement the themes set out in the Vet Charter application and European International Development plan to:\r\n\u2022 Enable student and staff beneficiaries to engaged in international settings and in doing so to recognise their potential contribution as global citizen through exposure to different cultures and work practice; Develop the technical sector skills, employability and other soft skills to enhance their future opportunities and life choices; Provide opportunities to the heterogeneous student cohort promoting equality and diversity through the recruitment, selection, preparation, support and monitoring processes; Enhance student social mobility and progression opportunities through the experience, self-knowledge and reliance developed on placement; Drive internationalism across college vocational delivery through the shared experiences, skills and knowledge acquired whilst on mobility placements by student and staff beneficiaries; Open dialogue through staff trainer placements for professional acumen with reference to good practice in pedagogy, methodology, processes and systems; To drive the structure and quality of mobilities through ECVET. Placements will be meaningful to individual students\u2019 vocational sector areas and qualification outcomes; and build sustainable collaboration and future projects as the UK moves into a post Brexit landscape to enable the college to continue with its internationalisation aims and developing strategy\r\nThe majority of students will not have experienced living away from home without parent/carer intervention. Many come from deprived backgrounds and these mobilities are a unique opportunity for them aspire to different outcomes. For all beneficiaries the engagement with European sector professionals and peers will provide a potentially life changing experience which will have a ripple effect and influence as  the personal and collective mobility experience and knowledge is shared with their student cohort. \r\nThe application includes places for accompanying tutors to support student groups on their initial journey, completing risk assessments on site to ensure their safety & wellbeing and working with partners to support students to adjust to the location, culture and living arrangements. \r\nSEND students will continue to go on placement, these students have learning and physical disabilities and to ensure that they can fully engage and experience all that a placement can offer, they will be supported by 2 staff members for the full two weeks of their placement. In the 16-18 allocation, it became very clear that for practical and safeguarding purposes a higher staff to student ratio was needed. \r\nThe student beneficiaries will be students from FE Vocational programmes both 16-18 and 19+ years, apprentices, SEND and students from vocational foundation degrees. The beneficiaries from foundation degree programmes will be progressing on vocational routeways in the following areas:\r\nApplied Computing; Cyber Security and Networking; Sports Coaching; Sports Performance; Sports Physical Education; Creative Arts Performance Practice; Fashion, Theatrical and Media Hair & Make Up; and Travel, Tourism and Aviation: a total of 33 students & 6 accompanying persons for flow numbers A1-38 to A1-43 & for 5 x Staff Trainers Abroad for flow numbers A2-1, A2-2, A2-6  & A2-07\r\nThe overall number of beneficiaries in Expanding Horizons has dropped from the projected number at Charter application. The college is balancing the demands of \r\n\u2022 an impending Ofsted inspection in 2018 and the restricted release of accompanying staff from their curriculum duties until post inspection therefore pushing more placements in 2019 from the 2017-19 allocation\r\n\u2022 The reduction in the number of eligible staff for STA placements \u2013 many have already taken advantage of this opportunity.\r\nFor these reasons the Transnational team have decided to reduce placement numbers to uphold the quality standards & to ensure that the placement tally remains realistic to the current college situation.

The MCAST trains and prepares youths and adults in a wide range of specialised skills in order to provide the bulk of the manpower needed by the local industry on a national level. \r\nIt is therefore crucial in the current global scenario for the MCAST to keep its VET system constantly updated by exposing and training its students and staff in other countries and beyond the national VET scenario. In itself the project acts as an essential cross-fertilisation project for VET education across the EU. \r\nThe main activities associated with the participation in this project will include: \r\n1) In line with the MCAST Internationalisation Strategy (Annex 1), the participation of the MCAST in this Erasmus+ project will give learners a unique enhancement to their educational experiences as they will have the opportunity of going on traineeships in companies and vocational education institutions in other European countries.  This is especially important within the context of a globalised economy: the students are presented with the opportunity of training in the international employment market. This project would offer over 120 students the opportunity to do an international VET learner traineeship in a company or vocational college and giving them the chance to apply the knowledge they learnt at the College, to learn new practical skills from their placements but also to be able to learn about a different European country and its culture. On successful completion of the mobility, a Europass Mobility Certificate will be issued to each participant in recognition of the experience gained. \r\nFor each of its six different institutes, the MCAST has identified a number of potential partners which will host students in companies, organisations or colleges abroad. These partnerships and their links to the different institutes and areas of studies are summarised in the attached Annex 2.  The expected learning outcomes for the students going on an Erasmus+ traineeship are: \r\na. to get work experience in their specific sector\r\nb. to recognise the main challenges in the sector\r\nc. to perform tasks independently & in a team\r\nd. to use standard tools & accessories in the specific sector\r\ne. to appreciate the main differences between the local market & the European market\r\nf. to appreciate different people, languages & cultures\r\nThe MCAST will also send students from the  Centre for Maritime Studies (CMS) on VET mobilities which last 6 months. These students will conduct practical training on board ships. This is fundamental for the students to acquire their profession as maritime officer. The Erasmus+ program will also offer OLS support to these students who often have to work on vessels to improve on their language skills.\r\nOne of the major changes in the scope of the mobility flows is the substantial increase in mobilities of learners and staff in the Netherlands. For 2017 and 2018 the MCAST, in line with its European Internationalization Strategy, desires to increase the number of VET learner traineeships in vocational institutes in colleges based in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. In 2018 both Valletta and Leeuwarden will be cultural capitals of Europe. The MCAST has initiated several collaborative projects with the colleges of ROC Friese Poort , Nordwin  and Friesland for 2018. The MCAST desires to send 40 learners to carry out a traineeship in these vocational colleges in the Netherlands to work on collaborative projects. These collaborative projects will not only give an exposure to students in their area of study but will foster a cultural exchange between two European countries.  Students from all of the MCAST institutes, including: creative arts, sciences, engineering, business, ICT and community services will be eligible to apply. These Dutch colleges have strong ties with local industries and can give a good exposure to MCAST Technical College students in the respective industries.\r\n2)  Staff; For MCAST staff to stay updated and relevant in today's educational system it is crucial that the staff is regularly trained and kept abreast with technological advancement. Through this project the staff would be given an opportunity to receive a 5-day training in other vocational schools besides the opportunity to observe new areas of study, new technologies, new teaching methods etc. This will be a cross-fertilisation exercise across VET institutions.

These opportunities contribute to the college\u2019s investment in employability skills and also ensures that LCC students and staff are aware and confident of their potential role within the wider European community.  The relationships of respect and trust that have built up between participating curriculum staff and their European peers adds to the quality of the placements and will also support the implementation of ECVET principles across the majority of placements.The correlation between the staff trainer participation in placements, the competences and experiences that they have gained and the impact of these on their professional practice once back in the UK, has driven the demand for the mobility placements for both students and staff, as well as driving the development of European partnerships. Staff trainer participants are essential in the building of a modern & dynamic 21st Century teaching & learning environment. Due to their observations and experience they are able to transfer knowledge, skills, new cultures, values and different approaches to pedagogy & methodology, directly to their own vocational areas and hence wider college.The range of partners and member states enables LCC to oversee a wide range of employer and education practice, cultural and social priorities and different methodology and bias.

The New Skills for New Jobs agenda highlights the need to raise the quality of education, extend lifelong learning and upgrade skills to overcome the socio-economic crisis affecting European countries.  Young people are currently suffering from very high levels of unemployment and need to be supported by flexible, high quality education and training systems which respond to the needs of today and tomorrow by matching their learning outcomes to the skills required by employers.  As stated in the Lisbon Treaty, they also need to be empowered to participate actively in society, to develop their professionalism and to enhance their social skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will underwrite the Leeds City College strategic aim to extend the employability skills (defined as \u201ca set of attributes, skills and knowledge to ensure effectiveness in the workplace to the benefit of themselves, their employer and the wider community\u201d) of its staff and students by building on previous experiences of supporting staff and student transnational work placements through the Lifelong Learning Programme.  NIACE has highlighted the need for increased collaboration between providers and employers to effectively meet the needs of learners/employees through providing the requisite skills and opportunities; these placements for LCC staff and students will go some way to providing prospective employees, and their Tutors, with the necessary knowledge and skills to support these vocational sectors in the region. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will enable 270 students, supported by 57 accompanying staff, to undertake work placements for 2/3weeks, and 23 staff to undertake one week placements to 35 organisations based in 13 Member States \u2013 Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff participation will enable LCC Tutors to review the College\u2019s Strategic Plan in the context of the hosting organisation, to assess new teaching and learning methodologies and to liaise with employers. On return they will disseminate their experience and work to impact on the modernisation and internationalisation of the College.  In the light of the current economic climate this opportunity will give the students an advantage in the labour market (both in the UK and overseas) as they will have not only the relevant qualifications but also appropriate knowledge and customer care skills to enable them to work constructively in these vocational areas.  In countries with relevant experience the following sectors will be supported by the ECVET system - Care (Estonia, Finland & Malta), Construction (Estonia), Hospitality & Catering (France), IT (Estonia), Sport (Finland), Travel & Tourism (Finland), thus ensuring that the skills acquired by the student participants can be recognised as part of their UK qualification.  Tools will be developed to be fit for this purpose \u2013 Memorandum of Understanding, Learner Agreement, Mobility Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hosting vocational training organisations and companies, which include previous and new partners, have all been chosen for their ability to support staff to develop their teaching and learning skills, and students to access continuing training towards their qualifications in an appropriate working environment.  LCC will liaise with the hosting organisations to establish the optimum times for these placements to fit in with local market demand, taking into account any national holidays to maximise the benefits to be gained in the context of their own UK responsibilities.  For apprentices (who form a large number of this cohort of students) discussions will take place with employers, as well as Tutors, to ensure that the placements best fit all current requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility of participating in such a project gives LCC students something achievable to aim for and acts as a tremendous incentive to retention.

In this Erasmus+ Mobility Project the focus will be on \u201cSafety at Work as compared to European Standards\u201d. \r\nObjectives:\r\nIn this project the different rules and regulations in the field of safety at work will be examined, documented and discussed. It is the aim to expand the school curriculum and the vocational curriculum through knowledge of European work safety processes and methods. \r\nProfile and Background of the Participants\r\nAll 111 participants stem from the German Dual Apprenticeship and already have basic knowledge in the field of safety at work. The comparison between German safety regulations and standards with the ones in the partner countries is the added value of this project. \r\nActivities and Methods\r\nBefore and during the project safety at work will be the core theme. Within the framework of their work placements, the participants will contrast, compare, document and realise German and Finnish safety rules together with students of their partner school in the companies and schools. \r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following learning goals will be achieved:\r\na. The participants will carry out a work placement focussing on safety at work as compared to European standards and document, compare and evaluate it.\r\nb.

The participants gain the ability and competence to inform themselves about safety at work in a European country and to obey safety regulations at work.\r\nPotential long-term Benefits\r\nSafety at work is often reduced through the existence of an accident insurance. Your own safety regulations at work have to be completed through regulations of the other country.

The aim is to improve working conditions by addressing commonplace practical problems. \r\nIntellectual output\r\n\r\nParticipants of the project will get an opportunity to produce and compile materials that are connected to health and wellbeing. The materials can be in various formats: video, text, online clips, audio etc. The material package can be used by companies and education providers when the issues of work well being and occupational safety are addressed. The digital material package can be integrated into either vocational studies or core skills studies e.g. entrepreneurship, physical education, health education, work safety education and chemistry. Also a digital work wellbeing test will be made in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning, Teaching and Training events\r\n\r\nThe project will take two years. There will be altogether 4 Learning, Teaching and Training events, one in each participating country. Each meeting will focus on specific aspects of health and well-being: work safety, chemical and cosmetic legislation, ergonomics and microbiology. There will also be visits to local companies and lectures and training by stakeholders. The project's final event will be a dissemination event in Finland. In this event outcomes of the project will be launched.

The consortium wishes to offer work placements in European companies for VET learners that experience difficulties in entering the job market, and also short job-shadowing/observation periods for the staff of the consortium members.Within the project, mobility activities are planned for 3 different groups of beneficiaries:- 80 grants for work 8-week work placements in European companies (Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom), for continuing VET learners, not preparing for a diploma (\u201cgroup 1\u201d). These people encounter difficulties in entering the labour market and in managing their transition to working life. They are monitored by counsellors at P\u00f4le Emploi or \u201cMissions locales\u201d (members of the consortium);- 20 grants for work 4-week work placements in European companies (Italy, United Kingdom) for continuing VET learners, enrolled in a regional training programme preparing beneficiaries for entering skills training or employment (\u201cgroup 2\u201d). These people are in the process of professional reintegration after several months of unemployment. They have identified a professional project, but are weakened by the lack of transversal skills. An accompanying person will travel with each flow in order to help the trainees to settle in. 4 grants are needed for accompanying persons;- 10 grants for 3-day job-shadowing/observation periods (Finland, Poland, Spain), for staff of the consortium member organisations (\u201cgroup 3\u201d). They promote mobility and need to live a mobility experience themselves and to open up towards a European dimension.After an open call for tenders, AFORMAC was chosen by the Regional Council to assist in the implementation of the project for the beneficiaries of groups 1 and 2.The main objectives for the VET learners (groups 1 and 2) are:1\u00b0 behaviour: motivation, autonomy, self-reliance, communication, social skills, mobility2\u00b0 professional: professional skills and competence, new professional techniques and practice, better knowledge of the world of enterprise;3\u00b0 linguistic and cross-cultural: practising a foreign language, discovering another European language, realising one's European citizenship, growing aware of one's own culture.Transversal skills - necessary for one's personal, social and professional fulfilment - are in the centre of the project for these two groups of VET learners, and this even prior to gaining professional skills as such.The main objectives for the staff mobilities (group 3) are:- development of professional skills;- better understanding of the stakes of European mobility;- improving linguistic and cross-cultural skills;- making the European area one's own and realising fully one's European citizenship.Expected outcomes for the VET learners include:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills- re-establishing one's personal and professional project- increased employability- renewed interest in learning- more active citizen involvement- better capacity for geographical mobility on all levels: regional, national, European, or even international- quicker access to better employment or to skills training/a diploma courseEnvisaged results for staff are:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills;- stronger interest for European mobility;- better understanding and anticipation of the Europe 2020 targets for life-long learning;- increased sense of belonging to Europe.Finally, the potential longer term benefits of the project include : - pursuing the regional dynamic created amongst the members of the consortium of AUDACE mobility projects;- training of better quality for continuous VET trainees in Auvergne;- internationalisation of employment/training support structures;- more international activity both in sending and receiving regions;- a wider perspective on one's professional practice thanks to exchange;- bringing VET centres and businesses closer together, thus enhancing the active role they can play in the issues of unemployment of young Europeans;- European cooperation on other innovating projects.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014842_12"], [2014, "Work Experience for Social and Health Care Assistant Students and PA Students, 2014-2016", "Leeds City College", 133061.0, 10, 23, "In the departemental order for the vocational educations in Denmark it is pointed out that the vocational educations have to provide the students with knowledge about international conditions as a basis for employment and education abroad.

Ekami and other local operatives, development organizations, university of applied sciences and other vocational institutions have realized the need to commit into project cooperation and exchanging experiences by annually participating in Brussels Open Days event, where the representatives of the cooperative institutions will also be invited.\r\nThe second underlying factor is to develop the procedures for identification and recognition of prior learning. The college\u2019s management has documented the general international exchange principles regarding the implementation of ECVET into the international strategy. There is awareness of ECVET in many of the partner countries, however, putting it into practice has not necessarily started, not even in national level.\r\nThe third influential aspect is the need for more long-term planning of mobility. As a solution, it has been decided to create an international path for the students. This path will be endorsed by the teacher\u2019s international path.\r\nFourth goal is to gain volume for mobility and participation of new groups. The international exchange volume of the students going abroad is approximately only a half of the national mean value. The objective of the college is to achieve a controlled increase in the exchange volume without harming the quality.\r\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\r\nObjective 1: Local cooperation in order to enhance international operations\r\nObjective 2: To further the implementation of ECVET\r\nObjective 3: Developing and implementing a long-term international path\r\nObjective 4: Creating new mobility groups and increasing the exchange volume\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNT AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS\r\nThe number of student mobility in the project is 97; their backgrounds are:\r\n- 60 students of vocational basic education\r\n- 5 students of vocational adult education\r\n- 16 teachers of vocational basic education\r\n- 5 teachers of vocational adult education\r\n- 6 instructors of coastal workshops\r\n- 5 workplace instructors\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES/MAIN ACTIVITIES\r\n1. Activities for enhancing the local cooperation in international operations\r\n2. Activities for implementing ECVET\r\n3. Activities for developing and implementing a long-term international path\r\n4. Activities for creating new mobility groups and increasing the exchange volume\r\n\r\nMEANS AND METHODS USED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT\r\nThe project detects new possibilities to develop international mobility through participant network. This investigation creates a foundation for a mobility plan, which is tested in practice. The mobilities will be a part of ECVET execution. The gained experiences will help develop the exchange implementation.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF RESULTS AND EFFECTS\r\nThe effect of international exchange on further education will be detected through local cooperation. This, in turn, may increase the students\u2019 motivation to participate in student exchange, thus improving the results of the exchange.\r\nECVET-based activity will provide a more goal-based execution of exchange and a better utilization of the study period in carrying out the qualification.\r\nLong-term international path will provide a vast amount of possibilities for the student to prepare for the exchange and, also, independently study languages, for instance.\r\nActivating new groups will increase the mobility by 50 per cent, on average, which will create more equal possibilities for the students and the teachers to participate in exchange.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE LONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nThe expanding of cooperation and long-term planning and implementation may open new, unpredicted possibilities in developing the exchange.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008776_12"], [2015, "L\u00e4rarfortbildning med Europeiska kurser , jobbskuggning och samarbete mellan l\u00e4rare fr\u00e5n olika l\u00e4nder.", "Leeds City College", 45706.0, 7, 7, "The project aims to broadly develop the skills of various categories of teachers at Virginskagymnasiet  in \u00d6rebro. The aim is that our teachers will be better and more professional in their meetings with our students and by their new insights, experience and skills also improve achievement among our students. Students are always at the centre of everything we do at Virginskagymnasiet and what we do in these various international activities we do for our students' sake. We want to strengthen schools courses based on the different challenges that they face. We want to strengthen all programs and increase the attractiveness of upper secondary school. Strengthen spoken languages in the school, and increase understanding of the EU and how it works.\r\n\r\nLanguage Introduction where we have students from all over the world, who bring their various heavy rucksacks and experience. How shall we strengthen them, make them cooperate better with our students on the national courses, integrate them better, reach them where they are, help them depending on their situation, etc.\r\n\r\nFor The National School for the Deaf and the National School for the Hearing Impaired we need to give teachers the tools for their toolbox in order to be able to meet students who need extra help and consideration, and give them tools on how they reinforce the motivation and commitment of young people who have it extra tough.\r\n\r\nOn the vocational program also wants to teach us get tools to support and enthuse pupils with special needs in mathematics.\r\n\r\nAll the programs are particularly interested in how they can develop work with ICT, based on all students in \u00d6rebro from HT-2013 has its own computer. (1: 1). We have a huge need to further develop all our employees in ICT, but especially in vocational programs. It is about changing the pedagogy and to rethink how teaching can go to.\r\n\r\nIn all educational programmes there is a lot about all the computer programmes and all the new opportunities opening up didactic now that all students have their own computers. Everything is possible and our teachers need to realise this\r\n\r\nOn the sports program the teachers work differently, with 40 \u00b1 5 hour week, and they want to work more thematically. We believe that this is seen to reduce the feeling of stress amongst teachers. The teachers experience a tremendous pressure generally at the school, which is a big problem for everyone, so it would be interesting to compare how teachers feel about this and how it works in some European countries. Through job shadowing and conversations with teachers in different countries we want to find out how it works in our partner schools and new schools that we hope comes into contact with through the individual teachers involved in courses and hopefully get new contacts for the future. \r\n\r\nWe want to involve the whole school in our international work and it will become a natural part of the school's daily work.\r\nWe shall use a variety of different methods: Study visits, teaching, job shadowing, sharing our experiences, project collaboration, workshops, seminars and discussions. We shall also participate in courses where our staff have the opportunity to meet teachers from other European countries and thus get even more new impulses.\r\n\r\nIn the short term this strengthens the individual teachers in their commitment and teachers' work, and raises awareness of Europe and the world. They also get knowledge that they can directly transmit to students.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, our students gain a greater achievement, we increase students' opportunities for mobility based on increased international knowledge and experience. We strengthen the students in European Studies and emphasise the importance that we in Sweden is part of the European Community.\r\n\r\nOur students gain:\r\n\u2022 Increased intercultural understanding\r\n\u2022 Tolerance to other people and clear democratic values\r\n\u2022 Solidarity with other people and vulnerable groups\r\n\u2022 Increased knowledge of global issues and challenges\r\n\u2022 Increased understanding of their own society and culture through mirroring and greater self-awareness\r\n\u2022 Increased confidence in their own ability\r\n\u2022 Train students in increased accountability\r\n\u2022 Increased motivation through a reality-based learning\r\n\u2022 Improved language skills\r\n\u2022 Preparedness for study and work in other countries\r\n\u2022 International contacts and networks\r\n\u2022 Good social feeling in classes and teaching groups\r\n\u2022 Promote cooperation between pupils and between pupils and teachers\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we have more international cooperation projects and will create networks within tsport, ICT and language.\r\n\r\nIn Slovakia we especially give our teachers of modern languages strengthen their professionalism as the Slovakian school is a certified school in cooperation with Goethe Institute and Cervantes Institute. We have also a lot to learn from them about how they work with peer learning, which we also are developing more of in \u00d6rebro and Virginska upper secondary school sports programme.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA101-012169_6"]], "extra": 23}, "esif": {"data": [[1491004800000, 1585612800000, "LEP Skills Service", "West Yorkshire Consortium of Colleges Consortium Ltd (WYCC)", "Providing a unique offer to business the Skills Service will incentivise employers to train their staff through a package of support which builds on good practice and lessons learned, unlocking the potential of the skills system for businesses in Leeds City Region.", "ESF", 7000000.0, 14000000.0, "esf_england_675"], [1477958400000, 1561852800000, "Reach Higher", "West Yorkshire Colleges Consortium", "The project, \u2018Reach Higher\u2019 will widen participation in higher level skills through a programme of activities co-designed by employers that will attract and engage new participants onto higher level courses, allow progression onto courses which will lead to a qualification and ultimately into employment in the key sectors filling gaps and shortages in the city region.", "ESF", 3500000.0, 7000000.0, "esf_england_673"], [1477958400000, 1561852800000, "More Skills Better Jobs", "West Yorkshire Colleges Consortium", "The project, \u201cMore Skills, Better Jobs\u201d will provide individuals in low-paid employment with access to training and improved skill levels, leading to greater earning potential.
