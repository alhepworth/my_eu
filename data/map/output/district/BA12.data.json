The project also aims to develop knowledge for students and staff to develop knowledge concerning global work that has been raised in the curriculum for higher education and goals to attain in the Natural Resources Programme. Through our experience we know that projects such as these students do develop their ability to discuss subjects from different view points. This will help the students in making a positive progress in their studies.\r\nThe duration for this application is two years. Realgymnasiet has four different courses, these are; animal care, horse care, dog training and nature guide/tourism. This project would give 12 students and one accompanying person, per year, the possibility to go abroad in year 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe project will be run by personnel at school who will designate a coordinator in charge. The project will be divided into five phases; planning/application, preparation, implementation, follow-up/evaluation and spreading.\r\nThe emphasis of the result is mainly for the participant who has through the project enhanced his/her employment capacity by an enriched network in their professional field, personal development, a cultural perspective and so on. Also the school will benefit from the results through the spreading phase.\r\nLong term we hope that this project will help us in having good relationships with our partners and in developing he global perspective on our education now and in the future.

Food and language as inseparable intercultural and linguistic indicators to facilitate understanding between countries.", "Warminster School", 41104.0, 2, 2, "Are we really what we eat? Food and language as inseparable intercultural and linguistic indicators to facilitate understanding between countries.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND / CONTEXT.  We have two contexts: food and the language surrounding food. Our world seems to grow smaller, but our societies seem to know very little about the basics of life from one country to another, meaning that they are unable to learn from each other.  Food is one of the most important basic needs, yet the 26 miles that separate England from France also separate two countries with differing attitudes to food.  We have the stereotypes of \"English food is bad\" and \"French food is good\", but is that true and why?  Our other context is language.  The languages departments of our two schools, Warminster School in the UK and Elisee Mousnier school in France, have been working together for nearly 3 years. Each year we have developed this relationship, and this time we want to involve innovative teaching and learning activities for our learners.  Children may not be motivated by language, but they are usually motivated by food, so by joining the two we hope that everyone will both benefit and enjoy.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT.  The objectives are (1) to encourage pupils to consider and learn from information that they will acquire themselves by carrying out joint presentations and documents with their counterparts in the other school.  (2) to enable pupils to increase and develop their use of the other language, by a combination of guided activities, independent research, regular correspondence/Skype conversations with pupils in the other school, and an exchange during which the pupils will spend a week living with a family in the other country. (3) To allow pupils to discover for themselves that they can work, both in person and via the internet, with other young people in a different country despite not being completely fluent in each others' language.\r\n\r\nThere will be 45 participants in total, with a total of 5 accompanying teachers. The pupils come from varying backgrounds, a good social and educational mix in both schools.  They will be in Year 10 / troisieme in 2017/2018, and already learning each others' language at school.  They do not all find learning language easy, but all are willing to tr\r\nAttitudes to and use of food questionnaires prepared by teachers taken by pupils to find answers from as many people as possible, as a basis for further investigation and also the acquisition of language.  Questionnaires will be shared with the partner school via the VLE, enabling schools in both countries to see what the other school's community thinks.\r\nResults from questionnaires to be processed by pupils, using various means - this might include putting in to a graph or writing a description of results in the target language.\r\n Pupils in each school produce (and send to the other school) bilingual presentation/ video to explain their understanding of local social attitudes to food, and a description of a few 'typical' dishes.\r\nPupils decide which recipes could be considered traditional in each country, and start to translate them.\r\nPupils have first electronic meetings in which they help each other with language in recipes.\r\nPupils prepare collaborative presentation - social attitudes to food\r\nPupils (groups of French/English pupils) prepare collaborative document comparing results from questionnaires.\r\nPupils prepare second collaborative presentation, having exchanged ideas during visit in March.\r\nNear the end of the month there will be an evening presentation by staff and pupils of each school to the wider local community of parents and local residents, to share the experience and learning from the project.\r\nPupils in both countries finalise and agree on content and format of final document, guided by teachers if required.\r\nProject leaders produce all remaining paperwork in respect of this project, including a document commenting on and recommending (or not) which innovative practices should be used or adapted for use in future.\r\n\r\nWe will use data collection and analysis via questionnaire in two languages, collaborative learning via VLE, Multi-media presentations, dissemination of results to the wider local community, production of logically sequenced research findings in a public document.\r\n \r\nAs a result of pupils' mobility, planned learning and active involvement and participation in the project they should acquire improved linguistic ability and a real appreciation of intercultural similarities and differences. Their horizons should be broadened and they will end up knowing that they accomplished something that often seems hugely difficult when you are 15 years old, thereby increasing their sense of self-worth.\r\nStaff in both schools will benefit from observing each others' systems, and from discussing teaching styles. \r\n\r\nPotential long-term benefits include improved intercultural understanding, more functional use of language for both.", "http://www.warminsterschool.org.uk", "Warminster School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036828_coordinator"]]}}, "8QS": {"nhs": {"data": [["RNZ", "Warminster Community Hospital", "nhs_RNZ32"]]}}, "9AF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1362096000000, 1488240000000, "Integrated Approaches to Food Allergen and Allergy Risk Management", "Indoor Biotechnologies Limited", "Up to 20 million European citizens suffer from food allergy.
