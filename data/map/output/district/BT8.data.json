In 2014 the partners were involved in organising Screenagers international seminar.  The seminar highlighted the innovative practices in ICT use in youth work and the learning outcomes for young people. However, the seminar also highlighted the challenges and identified needs for the youth sector. There is a resistance to ICT use in youth work due to fear around child protection issues, lack of competency by youth workers and lack of common policy on the issue of ICT use in youth work. Gaps in regional and national policy for the youth sector and gaps in implementation of European policy were also identified as an overarching challenge.  \r\n\r\nThe project rational is in line with the objective of the Erasmus+ programme: \u201can increased level of digital competence [and] more strategic and integrated use of ICTs\u2026by education, training and youth systems.\u201d (pg 93-94, Erasmus+ Programme Guide, 2014).  The objectives of this project are directly linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.  One of the main aims of DAE is enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion and the need to equip young people with the right skills to enable them to succeed in the labour market. In Ireland, it is highlighted as an aim in national policy in the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures publication. \u201c [To] support initiatives in out-of school settings, to teach children knowledge and skills relating to information management, new technologies, coding and digital literacy\u201d (Better Outcomes, Brighter Future, pg 69) The government commits to enhancing digital literacy of young people to build their skills and increase their employability and safety online. However in the national policies of some partner countries there is a focus on formal education in relation to ICT use and young people. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to focus on strategic partnership development and research. The project involves five partners The National Youth Council of Ireland, The Youth Council for Northern Ireland, Verke, National Development Centre for Online Youth Work in Finland, wienXtra from Austria and the Center for Digital Youth Care in Denmark.  \r\nIn order to achieve the objective this project aims to produce an international research report, a synthesis of the five national reports. The partners will agree on the research questions and develop a standardised research design and carry out research at a national level with youth organisations, youth worker and young people. We plan to use a variety of methodologies such as focus groups and an online survey to ensure the inclusion of diversity of organisations, youth workers and young people in the research and a wide scope. \r\nThis research report aims to address the lack of information on use of ICT \r\n\uf0d8 Map the use of ICT, digital and social media in youth work\r\n\uf0d8 show best innovative practice\r\n\uf0d8 the outcomes of the use of ICT, digital and social media in youth work \r\n\uf0d8 the challenges and barriers to use of ICT, digitial and social media in youth work \r\n\uf0d8 identity examples of how these challenges have been overcome\r\n\uf0d8 identify training available for the youth sector\r\n\uf0d8 identify  recommendations for training needs\r\n\r\nSuch information will help to highlight gaps in practice and will also inform policy in the area.

There will be a dedicated website. The partners hope to use the research outcomes to inform future projects. \r\n\r\nResearch shows young people are using ICT, digital and social media. This cannot be ignored by youth work due to lack of knowledge, investment or fear. There is a difference between a young person using ICT and being digitally literate. Youth work can assist young people in becoming digitally literate and to use ICT to its potential, to their advantage and safely.  However, in order to do this we need to know how youth work is successfully doing this and what the challenges are to the youth work sector in responding to this identified need.", "http://www.ycni.org", null, "erasmus_2014-2-IE01-KA205-008474_3"]]}}, "7RH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "TECNO RETE 4.0: nuove competenze per il trasferimento tecnologico", "Breezemount Electrical & Hydraulics Ltd", 297079.0, 6, 31, "In 2016 the fourth industrial revolution was one of the hot topics that provoked a debate about what skills to form to meet the needs of new 4.0 companies and industries. \r\nThe 4.0 will bring, according to some analysts, and in line with the national plan \"industry 4.0\", automated and interconnected production generating the need for new curricula and new career paths.
