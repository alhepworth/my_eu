The project is seeking to build staff competence and confidence in providing an immersion course which will allow the participating key staff member to perfect her knowledge of Spanish culture and practice of Spanish language in an authentic setting, gaining valuable pedagogical skills, thus enabling the organisation to redress an existing gap in suitably qualified staff and offer two foreign languages to more learners, through the broad general education and into the senior phase.  The activity involves a three-week immersion course in Spain wherein the key staff member will be immersed in Spanish language and culture, obtain intensive instruction in pedagogy for Spanish language teaching including teaching in the target language, using ICT, song and other cultural  tools to give a more enriching and authentic learning experience to learners. The key staff member will also have the opportunity to benefit from learning with others in the preparation of curricular materials, networking with others to create links with foreign partner schools and personnel with a view to creating language exchange opportunities for learners, promoting these to the associated cluster primaries, and promoting global citizenship within the organisation.  It is anticipated that with the increased knowledge and confidence which the key staff member will gain from this activity, the key staff member will disseminate all knowledge, pedagogical tools and techniques learned to all colleagues in the organisation and within its cluster primary schools.   It is hoped that the organisation will be able to reinstate events such as European Day of Languages, and offer to its learners more exchange opportunities to with foreign partner schools, and encourage cluster primary schools to do likewise, to continue to maintain and promote the profile of Modern Language learning in the organisation and in the cluster primaries.", "http://www.clydevalleyhighschool.org.uk/", "Clyde Valley High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047267_coordinator"]]}}, "7EY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Language Training", "St Aidan's Primary School", 1800.0, 1, 1, "Due to the recent change in the Scottish Government Language Policy for education we will be offering two modern foreign languages to our pupils through the introduction of the teaching of Spanish.  We currently have one member of staff trained to teach Spanish by the local authority, however, we feel that attending an immersion course will improve the participants confidence in teaching the language as well as offering cultural experiences which can be shared with the children.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for teaching Spanish at a primary level, to improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish to young learners, to develop cultural awareness and understanding of cultural Spain and to improve participants competence and performance in Spanish. \r\n\r\nAs a school we have previously taken part in partnership programmes through the British Council and are very keen to take on a new partnership with a school in Spain. As the immersion course includes visits to a local school it offers opportunities for our school to make links with these schools face to face. \r\n\r\nThe impact on the school of the participation in the course will be vast. Firstly, it will ensure that staff are confident in teaching the Spanish language before it is fully implemented into our school. It will provide us with resources and ideas to use when planning, assessing and evaluating for the teaching of Spanish. There will be opportunities to share experiences with parents which will build effective links between the school and the parents.  Pupils will learn a foreign language through experiencing the culture of the language not just learning the vocabulary.
