During their vocational training learners will increase their professional qualification and employability.\r\n\r\nWe intent to send about 150 students and apprentices of Tyrol to companies in Europe. The average training period will be between 4 and 20 weeks. During their placements trainees will improve their language skills, professional and social competences such as flexibility, persuasiveness, ability to handle work pressure, contact to colleagues/senior staff/external people. They will also obtain an insight in other cultures, mentalities and enterprises. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of a network of European intermediaries, receiving enterprises, sending partners of regional companies and vocational education schools (e.g.: secondary schools and colleges) such as the HLW Reutte, HLW Lienz, Zillertaler Tourismusschulen, Villa Blanka, HLW Landeck and Tyrolean companies for example: Swarovski Optik KG or TH\u00d6NI Industriebetriebe GmbH.\r\n\r\nThe planned project (scheduled for 24 months and starting in June 2015) is a long-term strategy in order to offer ongoing EU-granted placements to young Tyroleans. The demand on the part of students in vocational education is increasing, also the number of apprentices taking part. The project is managed and coordinated by the Local Agency Tyrol and it\u00b4s experienced staff, in close with the sending institutions as well as with the regional Chamber of Labour and the Tyrolean Government.

This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_20"]]}}, "2EP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Young Europeans improving skills in Community Supported Agriculture", "Cae Tan Community supported agriculture ltd", 19696.0, 4, 6, "\u201cYoung Europeans improving skills in Community Supported Agriculture\u201d will be an EVS project for 3 volunteers from France, Hungary and Spain.

English is the language that will be used in all three countries. Owing to differing schedules in the vocational colleges in Germany the length of the various stays abroad differ - 60 days in Wales, 4 weeks in Malta (in Malta technicians in electronics and mechatronics), and 3 weeks in Denmark. Our trainees in business admin and electronics/mechatronics will go to Wales, whereas only technical trainees are earmarked for Malta and Denmark.German industry and ABB in particular are in need of superbly trained employees with good language skills (at least one foreign language) and a high level of personal skills. They will additionally have experience in working abroad and thus have no problem to work and live abroad if necessary or when they are sent abroad on project related activities.The main aims of our projects are the improvement of the language skills (English) and personal skills. All in all there will be 52 trainees enrolled in this mobility project:1) 20 trainees in business administration, who will work in Swansea in SMEs and local retailers. 2) 12 technical trainees (electronics/mechatronics) for Wales as well (4 weeks only).3) 10 technical trainees (electronics/mechatronics) in Denmark. Within the scope of this activity there will also be a mobility project by our Danish partner with Danish trainees coming to ABB in Heidelberg.4) 10 participants to Malta, where they will work in SMEs in electronics/mechatronics and business administration. ABB does intentionally not send our trainees to other ABB organisations to ensure that the experience our apprentice have is very widespread and not influenced by the ABB way of doing things.The projects in Wales and Malta are insofar similar as the participants will be working in selected organisations (shops/offices/local authorities). Additionally there will be several sightseeing visits with a historical and cultural background. Twice weekly there will be English courses in the evening including cultural information and discussions, and there stay will then terminate with the exam SEFIC) of the LCCIEB which is recognised worldwide. The competency levels are C1/C2 for the business admin trainees and B1/B2 for the technical apprentices.In both countries they will be accommodated in holiday apartments/flats which will add to the further development of their personal skills as they have to organise themselves (organise cohabitating, rules, costs, planning, etc.). In Denmark the trainees will be attending courses and workshops with their Danish counterparts (who will also come to ABB Heidelberg on their own ERASMUS+ project). They will also work-shadow in local enterprises. They are accommodated on the college premises (boarding). The long-term benefits  of this project are better qualified employees with \"European work experience\" who can integrate more easily in multinational teams and can avail themselves of cultural and foreign language skills - employees German industry is in need of. Additionally 9 of our own trainers will go for their own learning experience to Malta (2), Denmark (2) and Wales (5). These will be mainly technical trainers concerning Malta and Denmark and a mixed group for Wales.Just as the trainees the trainers will have work experience in Welsh organisations and also additional cultural and English courses. In Denmark they will be fully integrated into the vocational college, but also work-shadow in local enterprises. The working language in both cases is English.Whenever possible we plan to send our trainers at different times from the trainees (this might also create bottle necks regarding placements, but in particular in Wales slight overlaps might occur due to the fact that our trainees are in Wales for almost 9 weeks.Here we also aim at having better qualified training staff who then can also prepare and advise the trainees better and more easily for their stay abroad.
