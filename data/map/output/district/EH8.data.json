The Scottish Government have introduced the 1+2 Languages Approach and their aim is to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn a modern language from Primary1 onwards and additionally to learn a secondf modern language from Primary 5. The City of Edinburgh council and this school have recognised this initiative as a priority in education and have begun to support staff in delivering the 1+2 Languages Approach.\r\n\r\nThe key staff involved in this application, which includes most of our teaching staff will build on the work that the council has done to embed the language in their school. This will be achieved by sharing the knowledge and skills to all staff through creating a resources folder on the servers, CAT sessions, professional dialogue and workshops. This will upskill all staff and increase their confidence in teaching French. Ultimately, this will have an impact on the young learners of The Royal High Primary School. Having more knowledgeable teachers and confident teachers will increase children's ability to learn French (L2) and very soon, Spanish (L3) from P5. Learning experiences will be improved because French will be used coherently in daily routines, taught with IDL topics and opportunities for using ICT at home and in school will be increased. The implementation of E-twinning will allow the children to learn about French in context making it very engaging for them.\r\n\r\nThe applicants are very enthusiastic and are keen to share their knowledge further afield. They will be ambassadors for the immersion course in France, sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleagues within the Portobello cluster of schools to include five Primary Schools and one Secondary School. They  will also happily contribute to meetings about 1+2 languages across the city in co-operation with our Development Officer. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term, the aim is to build the children's confidence and ability in languages, raise awareness and share the importance of learning languages within the City of Edinburgh Council with the intention  of an increase in pupils choosing to take languages in the secondary school.

The team is an example of European diversity: partners from the North, the South, the East, the West of Europe, from the Atlantique to the Mediterranean Sea, involving Europeans out of Europe, from a linguistic diversity to a cultural mix. This project is also supported by political (e.g. Firminy), economic (e.g. Italian local authorities) and cultural (e.g. Europa Nostra) institutions.ProPEACE seeks to place the academic field of heritage in a European perspective. In order to do this, it offers innovative solutions for a dynamic modernization of the European higher education about heritage. Indeed, curricula on heritage are usually offered by Humanities and Social Sciences faculties. Those have real difficulties to reform and adapt to new realities. At the end there is an intellectual and social challenge of working on a moving disciplinary field offered by a rigid structure.In Europe, Culture and Heritage are among the main sectors creating jobs and income for youth and the population in general. It is crucial to improve their performance and seek to promote their sustainable development. However it is necessary that the academic system can follow and support this movement. All European cities dream of labeling (UNESCO, European Capital of Culture) but how many of them can develop and manage in a sustainable and successful way their land with their heritage? There is a lack of trained staff and university does not have a prospective vision of the future and is unable to change its methods. Consequently, many European cultural projects do not develop as they could. It is also difficult to define what makes heritage because its media success blurs its definition.Then, over 3 years, ProPEACE will offer a program of activities to reconsider the European heritage, provide citizens\u2019 proposals regarding a cultural future together and meet employers\u2019 needs and expectations. Each year, in December, short-term training events will be held for academics and administrative staff. They will be opportunities for exchange on teaching practices in order to develop and redefine the concept of European heritage. New proposals will be developed during those events. Such proposals will be tested during Intensive Study programmes. Every year, in June, these IP will gather academics (14 of them from partners) and students (up to 90 European students in total).  Economic actors and policy makers will also be associated. During IP, the use of digital technology will be expanded. ProPEACE is based on project dynamics, with an entrepreneurial spirit. It is isomorphic: use of digital tools and participatory methodologies are taught to academics in order to train students to design, manage and develop projects for a new concept of heritage, particularly through NICT. Throughout the project, academics and students will be co-working via a digital platform. Activities and productions resulting of this activity will be developed through a spirit of connection, participation, collaboration, and citizenship: free and open access resources such as a virtual encyclopedia on European heritage, a lexicon 2.0 and videos \"180s for interculturalism\" will be jointly developed by students, academics and representatives of civil society such as elderly people and migrants. Other intellectual outputs will provide proposals for new methodologies and definitions for modernizing teaching practices: a methodological guideline, a learning lab innovating heritage and some European work cafes.Dissemination activities are also planned, such as digital exhibitions, publication or MOOC. They are aimed at sharing the project results within and outside the participants, taking into account specificities of each of them.All tools and intellectual outputs delivered by ProPEACE will be transferable and adaptable in other institutions.

In an effort to set up a broad-based consortium, RESCEU has expanded the constituency beyond the core consortium partners by including all other relevant and interested stakeholders within and outwith EU as Associate Partners. This allows RESCEU to leverage third parties\u2019 expertise, knowledge and connections with other relevant worldwide initiatives for the benefit of the project.

Systems are often nonlinear, measurements have limited dynamic range, noise is rarely Gaussian and reconstruction is not always the final goal.

This important unmet challenge drives the ambitious targets of this proposal.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I have pioneered the development of chemical fluorophores that allow unparalleled analysis of biological systems. In this project, I will implement an innovative approach to unify cutting-edge methodologies in chemistry and biology and develop Dynamic Activatable Fluorophores (DYNAFLUORS) as a chemical toolbox with enhanced imaging capabilities over current technologies. \n\nThe cross-disciplinary and ambitious nature of this project will open multiple avenues for broad impact in many areas of chemistry as well as in basic biology, imaging and medicine. DYNAFLUORS will allow us to image, from the molecular level to human tissue, the activity of immune cells in tumours and the response to therapy in real time. This ground-breaking chemical platform will represent a step forward in the forefront of chemical imaging and will create new opportunities in the personalised management of cancer.\n\nIn the long term, DYNAFLUORS will become a transformative toolbox for monitoring disease in humans. The integration of functional fluorophores into imaging technologies to perform \u2018optical biopsies\u2019 in vivo and to create patient-specific drug-response assays has the potential to revolutionise the diagnosis, stratification and personalised treatment of disease.", 1729708.0, 1729708.0, 1, 1, "DYNAFLUORS", null, "http://www.ed.ac.uk", null, "h2020_214533_999974941"], [1454284800000, 1548892800000, "Scalable Understanding of Multilingual Media", "The University of Edinburgh", "Media monitoring enables the global news media to be viewed in terms of emerging trends, people in the news, and the evolution of story-lines.

Witness the painstakingly slow scaling up of cellular signalling models, despite their central role in cell response.

The threat posed by deleterious mutation accumulation in humans, where natural selection has weakened in many populations, and in endangered species, where declining effective population size has made selection less effective, and 2. The extent by which new mutations sustain response to artificial selection. By characterizing many thousands of mutation events by genome sequencing of MA lines and wild mice, I will determine the molecular spectrum and the factors explaining mutation rate variation across the genome. I will exploit this new knowledge to address the long-unanswered question of the causes of correlations between nucleotide diversity and the recombination rate and the density of conserved genomic elements. I will develop new approaches, incorporating the simultaneous action of mutation, selection, drift and recombination, to determine the contributions of background selection and selective sweeps to variation in nucleotide diversity, and to quantify the contributions of coding and noncoding mutations to fitness variation.  \nThe project will lead to substantial advances in the understanding of the role of new mutations in explaining phenotypic and molecular diversity in mammals.", 1584026.0, 2179217.0, 2, 2, "DENOVOMUT", null, "http://www.ed.ac.uk", null, "h2020_203413_999974941"]], "extra": 624}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "International Master of Science in Infectious Diseases and One Health", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH", 2240549.0, 3, 3, "The International MSc in Infectious Diseases and One Health (IDOH) is a two-year (120 ECTS) joint master degree taught in English and awarded by three European universities (Universit\u00e9 de Tours - France, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona - Spain and University of Edinburgh - UK).

The partnership consists of frontrunner universities in b-learning European wide for full expert representation. They will create a reference model for developing and implementing blended learning, embracing all levels of an institution: the design of the blended course, organisational aspects such as staff support and training, and institutional leadership, developing policies and strategies making the institution continuously innovative. \r\n\r\nIt is a maturity model with criteria and instruments to assess the degree of maturity of b-learning and innovation. Connected with this is a framework for change, based on progress markers related to stakeholder-focused outcomes. Internal stakeholders are learners, teaching staff, teaching and learning departments, technology departments and university leadership. External stakeholders, influencing practices and policies in universities: governments, European university networks and the EU level.\r\n\r\nThe concept of blended learning itself is far from clearcut. The literature spans various definitions and meanings,  e.g. \u201dthe thoughtful integration of conventional and digital methods of teaching and learning\u201d (Graham, et al., 2013). It is agreed that the digital is not a supplement and does not simply replicate aspects of the conventional \u2013 each should enhance the other. Blended learning combines conventional and digital methods to achieve an \u201coptimal exploitation of ICT and internet\u201d integrated with the conventional technologies of physical material, and co-presence in space and time. The value of blending the two is that digital methods offer much greater personalization, flexibility, inclusiveness and efficiency than conventional methods can, but they have to be used appropriately (Laurillard, 2015).\r\n\r\nThis matters, because universities face challenges as keeping quality with large student numbers and lower budgets per learner, supporting study progress and success and meeting the needs of part-time students. Innovation by b- learning will lead to quality enhancement of the learning experience, personalization, accessibility,  flexibility and inclusion. Furthermore b-learning is suitable for teaching large groups synchronously and asynchronously; constituting small learning groups; capitalizing on the worldwide connection with research; multi-campus education and blended mobility, etc.\r\nHence, b-learning plays a role in solving problems teachers and leaders face. Also, they enrich institutional concepts on learning (e.g. the \u201cguided independent learning\u201d or \u201cactive learning\u201d models), as well as institutional policies for teaching and learning. Furthermore, it can contribute to solutions related to scalability and cost-effectiveness in higher education. \r\n\r\nB-learning pratice is increasing, primarily because of the ubiquitous presence of digital technology and the increase in the digital skills of both students and teachers. EUA studies revealed that a majority of HEIs have established blended learning courses and programs. But, more than half of the institutions applied b-learning in 'some' faculties or by 'individual teachers' (Gaebel, Kupriyano and Morais;  Sursock (2015). However, the Changing Pedagogical Landscape study made clear that even within frontrunner institutions only 20% or less of the courses are blended. Moreover, many course models used just replicate face to face courses or don\u2019t meet the requirements of high quality course design. \r\n\r\nA preliminary force field analysis was done within the partnership with regard to innovation by implementing b-learning. \r\nPositive factors for succeeding b-learning implementation were:  the strong presence of digital technology at universities and digital skills of students and teachers; strong learning environments; good practices in b-learning, although incrementally dispersed; the experience with MOOCs; the need for enhancing quality for large student numbers of students; the need for covering all types of learning; where applicable a strong institutional leadership. These positive factors are important for anchoring change processes.  \r\nNegative factors were: academic culture not in favor of innovation;  attitudes of students and staff towards online learning; leadership not engaged for innovation by b-learning; no policies, strategies, concepts, frameworks; mis-conceptions on blended/online teaching; low awareness of innovative pedagogies; b-learning competences of staff not enough developed; no adequate solutions for the changing workload of staff; partial innovations only; no incentives for career development; no substantial budget; weak governmental strategies.\r\n\r\nPartner institutions are engaged, but developments are going slow and efforts are dispersed and not systemic enough.\r\nThe project will contribute to a deep change within the partnership and beyond.", "http://www.ed.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA203-035288_2"], [2015, "Entrepreneurship, Modernization and Innovation in SoutH Africa", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH", 381127.0, 4, 9, "Based on a previous EU project on innovation in South Africa we realized there was a need for a capacity building project in the region.

It calls for innovation, work to \r\n\r\n \u2018define how, when and where ICT can be used effectively in pedagogical and assessment approaches\u2019 and activities to support teachers and learners to increase their digital competence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale for this project\r\n\r\nOne of the primary aims for an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership is \"enhancing the quality and relevance of the learning offer in education, training and youth work by developing new and innovative approaches and supporting the dissemination of best practices\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed consortium, led by the Computer Science Department at the University of Warwick, propose to form a Strategic Partnership of pedagogical and technological experts with the aim of further developing, trialling, evaluating and disseminating a novel framework \u2013 developed by the Empirical Modelling research group at the University of Warwick \u2013 for \u2018creating knowledge and solving conceptual problems with the support of digital tools\u2019 (cf. the digital competence of the same name identified in EC DIGCOMP). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall introduce new principles and tools for a computing practice that enables educators and learners  to collaborate in creating live interactive resources (\"construals\") that serve as personal, shareable 'working models' or understandings. \r\n\r\nSuch a practice is more accessible than conventional programming but more expressive and powerful than conventional uses of ICT. Its adoption will lead to the online development of open educational resources that can be flexibly modified by educators and learners alike to give exceptionally rich support for blending educational practices combining instruction and construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis contributes to the wider aims for Strategic Partnerships to promote take-up of innovative practices in education, training and youth work and enhance the professional development of those working in these fields by increasing the quality and range of initial and continuing training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed consortium allows for the project to draw on a unique blend of skills and experience, and to access opportunities to trial and disseminate the activity through a number of learning activities covering learners of all ages across the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives and activities\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of our project is to promote 'making construals' as a new practice that promises to better support teachers and learners to create knowledge and solve conceptual problems with the support of digital tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the framework has potential to address policy objectives, challenges and needs relevant to several fields of education, training and youth, our proposal is to form a Strategic Partnership covering more than one field. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe core activities of the Strategic Partnership will be to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Develop and refine the existing framework and tools, drawing on the pedagogical and technical expertise of our consortium \r\n\r\n\u2022 Apply the framework in a number of educational contexts with a range of learners to explore and test its potential to enhance the teaching of computing/programming and other subjects\r\n\r\n\u2022 Refine the framework and tools in light of its application in educational contexts and launch it as an open educational resource\r\n\r\n\u2022 Conduct experimental studies to evaluate the efficacy of the framework for supporting learning \r\n\r\n\u2022 Dissemination of the framework and tools as elaborated below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widespread adoption of making construals as a new digital skill to support personal learning and collaborative construal construction as way of developing open educational resources.\r\n\r\nGreater awareness of the critical impact of the mode of construction upon the qualities of software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDissemination and longer term benefits\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be disseminated via an international conference, and establishment of the proposed MOOC. A range of other dissemination channels \u2013 including development of a project website, newsletters, presentations/publications to conferences/workshops, online publications and presentations through social and contemporary media, and the Erasmus+ dissemination platform  - will be used during the lifetime of the project to increase awareness of the activity and encourage wider contribution and support for the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also expect project outputs to be disseminated through subsequent work, for which we will seek support during the life of the project. This will include web resources that embody explanatory mechanisms that can be readily explored, extended, remixed and customised for personal use.

Drawing on such agency and using a group of trained Facilitators, a cohort of 60 students drawn from the three participating universities will be trained as Social Responsibility Auditors in a student-centred, action-reflection learning based programme, delivered in blended mode. This will culminate in four Audits of different European higher education institutions, carried out by cross-national teams of the students involved. Satisfactory completion of the training, the linked audit and of the assessment requirements by means of production of individual e-portfolio of evidence of learning will see students awarded a Level 6 EQF Certificate in Social Responsibility Auditing.Integral to the project will be production of a significant, innovative Open Education Resource (OER) that will include a Facilitator Training Manual, an Auditor Training Scheme, an Auditor Manual and an Assessment Manual. The OER will be launched at a trans-national European Conference to be held in Spring 2019.

Physical Education (PE) has holistic benefits for all in physical, social and cognitive domains. There are additional benefits for children with SEN including the development of motor skills, the reduction of the risk for secondary medical conditions, the promotion of cognitive development, and the promotion of language and communication. In the interest of the holistic development of young children, generalist primary school teachers teach all subjects of the curriculum in many countries while other countries have specialists PE teachers or both. Literature highlights the challenges teachers experience teaching PE, particularly as non-specialist teachers. The practices adopted by PE teachers are critical to the success of true inclusion policies. As teacher educators we believe from our work that it is challenging for teachers to find information and resources related to inclusion in PE in one specific platform.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\u2022 To map the current situation with regard to accessing information and resources on inclusion in primary PE;\r\n\u2022 To develop teacher training toolkit/resource to disentangle each of the above mentioned challenges in primary PE;\r\n\u2022 To make the toolkit/resource available in a free open educational platform (web application);\r\n\u2022 To develop a teacher training toolkit for the implementation of this toolkit/resource.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe consortium consists of the main partners University of Luxembourg (project coordinator), Dublin City University, The Hague University of Applied Sciences, University of Trnava, University of Edinburgh, University of Valladolid, Institute of Technology Tralee, European Physical Education Association (EUPEA). The project partners will be represented in total by 22 teacher educators, researches and teachers. They all have an expertise in primary PE as well as inclusion in educational settings.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nThrough this strategic partnership, the consortium proposes to develop a central platform for a  toolkit/resource, made available as a free open educational resource (web application), consisting of inclusive PE strategies The toolkit/resource should assist teachers to easily access information, resources and tools to assist their teaching of PE to include all children in PE lessons, with a focus on children with the following challenges: obesity, physical disabilities, motor differences, cultural differences (migrants, refugees), social and emotional challenges, chronical diseases (diabetes, asthma, \u2026), gender challenges, language challenges.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe project coordinator will use the methodology adopted by the University of Luxembourg (UL), therefore agile project management will be used throughout the project execution. The UL project leader will be responsible for overseeing the execution of the project plan, through its various activities and the management of their execution.

In Europe is widely widespread the belief that through a more pervasive digitalization within companies is possible to give birth to a fourth industrial revolution in which the \"cost of labor\" factor loses importance, for the benefit of the workforce cultural factor. In other terms, instead of cheaper labor costs we should have robots, sensors, equipments and software applications, with workers, technicians and managers culturally prepared to handle them. A change of paradigm that effectively opens new scenarios in the production of goods and services and in the labor market.\r\nA revolution that hinges on a stock of competences to which workers and citizens need to be trained on, in order to be prepared for the change. \r\nThese new capabilities are related to the so-called \"Computational Thinking\", that must be deeply connected to the \"Critical Thinking\", so that is possible to synthesize them into critically-computational skills (CCT). We must not confuse CCT with computer skills necessary to perform the ICT professions. It is rather using some of those skills, to create a culture which incorporate some proven mental processes of that discipline- such as the definition of algorithms \u2013 in order to reuse them in any other fields.\r\nDespite some authors consider Computational Thinking as a key competence, we could almost think to it as a cross-sectoral learning with respect to the 8 key competences, particularly those related at least to (#3) science, technology and Mathematics, and (#4) digital competence. \r\nWhereas young people at schools are (recently) trained on these skills, little or nothing is done to prepare adults to this transformation. It follows that workers who are not able to participate in the few training courses on these issues, are likely to meet a cultural gap which reduces opportunities and professional openings.\r\nThe project aims to help reduce this gap through a training action on the issue of CCT competences, addressed to trainers professionals and adult workers, project\u2019s final recipients.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to create a Common Methodology for approaching to teaching/learning of these skills, addressing adults and actually implementing a digital platform, accessible from desktop or mobile through which teachers can find a guide on how to teach CCT, and an actual \u201cgym\u201d to train and integrate their own digital culture before forwarding it to the students. On the same platform there will be realized 3 case studies by the project partners in which the CCT is applied to the field of environmental sustainability, social responsibility and sustainable development. These enable trainers, businesses and citizens to understand the added value of CCT applied to real problems, and learn a methodology to teach/learn its sub-skills.\r\n\r\nActions:\r\n1. Study, exchange of experiences and development of a Common Methodology, connected to existing models with proven effectiveness, suitable to teach/learn the CCT to adult people.

The icing on the cake is a two week internship in London or Edinburgh during which they will be able to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired during their course in a different but authentic environment and using a foreign language. This will present our students with the opportunity to push their boundaries and it will also motivate them to fully commit to their final year. Many vocational education students in Office Administration are starting to lose interest in school towards the end of their secondary school education and we feel this opportunity will give them an exciting final year to look forward to, work towards and complete successfully. \r\n\r\nIn order to be considered to take part in the project, students must show that they are motivated, social, open to experiencing different cultures, prepared to spend two weeks abroad and aware of the added value of the opportunity they are given.\r\n\r\nIn the lesson schedule of their final year provision will be made for one seminar lesson per week during which students will become acquainted with the language and culture of the internship locations.\r\n\r\nThey will study life in the United Kingdom, in particular in London and Edinburgh. They will learn about the language, the food, the location, the customs, the currency, tourist attractions, etc. In addition, they will also be prepared on a personal level and will be taught many life lessons: communicating effectively, living together, resolving conflicts, planning, organising, improving their independence by living and traveling in a foreign city and in a foreign language which in turn will strengthen their social skills. This will enable them to achieve many curriculum specific goals (giving a presentation, researching information, self-evaluation, peer-evaluation, etc.) as well as more overarching educational goals. Concrete examples include lessons in communicating (British small talk), budgeting, resolving conflicts. They will visit the British shop in Everberg and take a cooking workshop. They will research specific information about their destination, as well as suitable accommodation and transport options. They will complete a Europass CV and Language Passport. They will make a short video highlighting their motivation for the project and they will clarify this in an interview in front of a jury of teachers and external experts. They will write a weekly blog detailing their most interesting experiences. They will write an assessment of their internship experience and will present their experiences to the students who will come after them.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the school year is the two week continuous internship in either London or Edinburgh where students will apply and strengthen the knowledge and attitudes acquired at school and where they will execute the tasks of an administrative assistant in an international context: making telephone calls, welcoming visitors, classifying documents, handling correspondence, conducting sales consultations.\r\n\r\nThis will enable them to demonstrate a number of general and professional attitudes, such as punctuality, orderliness, politeness, adhering to dress code, self-reliance, self-confidence, motivation, pushing their boundaries. They will practise the language and experience the culture of their destination in diverse ways. They will become acquainted with company culture in the United Kingdom and will learn to execute the daily tasks at their internship in ways which refine and extend their job specific competencies. In this way they will greatly improve their future job opportunities, they will get a taste for moving around Europe, and they will become aware of their European citizenship. The teachers who accompany them will also benefit by updating and expanding their course specific knowledge, improving their English, strengthening the relationship with their students, establishing contacts with internship companies and expanding the project network.\r\n\r\nIt is our expectation that this will enable us to attract new students to the Office Administration course and to expand the foreign internship to all students in Office Management and Communication year 6.

They are initially presented with behavioral disorders such as disturbed relationships with peers and family, low school performance, and so on, but they are also accompanied by mental pain and deficits in social and occupational  interaction. If these disorders are left untreated, they tend to become more severe with consequences  on the psychosocial life of the individual as they have cumulative action and diminishes the possibility of smooth progression in adulthood of these teenagers. Additionally, these disorders can continue in adulthood, affecting the professional and psychosocial  performance  of young adults  (increased rates of involvement with law, police and mental health and welfare services) and, of course, the financial burden on families and society in general.\r\nAbout one in three children with behavioral disorders, such as  aggression, thefts, lies, truancy, escape from home, vandalism, evolve into adults with antisocial personality, continuing their lives with criminal acts, frequent imprisonments and high rates of repetition of violent offending behavior. Both these behavioral disorders and the other aspect of the adolescent's reaction, depression, if  not treated early in life often remain with the adolescent and young adult with relapses and impacts on its functionality all his life. In addition, they are often accompanied by substance use (nicotine, alcohol, drugs), while the greatest and most serious risk is suicide (suicide is the third cause of death among adolescents and young adults) and increased rates of involvement with the law as well as mental health and welfare services.\r\nThe enormous financial burden of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and their continuity in adulthood is known, as unmanaged behavioral disorders are associated with increases financial burden by 10 times.\r\nAssessment, diagnosis and treatment of psychopathological disorders and psychosocial problems of adolescence, although being the subject of specific mental health services for adolescents, are often a task for adult mental health services due to poverty of resources. Therefore, those professionals that are involved in the management of  teenagers  and young adults need to have as much knowledge as possible of procedures for early identification, diagnosis of mental disorders of adolescence, interconnection and close collaboration of all involved services . On top of the management of these difficulties in their life  in areas of  family life , social interaction , work and educational areas due to mental disorder, but in addition to all the above mentioned areas the UK National Health System  combines actions and  support the needs of adolescents and their families focusing on the wider community.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to familiarize professionals dealing with adolescent behavioral disorders with centralized and interconnected mental health services and the use of weighted appropriate early recognition and intervention diagnostic tools. Specifically, participants will be trained in the diagnosis and management of complex mental disorders of adolescents and yung adults and in the organization of an individualized treatment plan, using specific scientific tools and interventions. In addition, it is necessary to train judicial officers because teenagers with mental disorders are associated with delinquent behavior and also other specialties that come into contact and must recognize and manage these individuals.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the educational goals, a flow of 16 people from Greece, for 6 days, will be trained in theory and practice.

energy that can be captured from waves, tides, and salinity & thermal gradients. ME has the potential to deliver electricity to 350 million households globally by 2050. The NWE region leads the way in ME development and is uniquely positioned to become the global industry leader. However, efficient growth is hampered, as the sector is regionally oriented and fragmented. Foreseeable errors in technology development are being repeated, making the development of ME technologies unnecessarily inefficient and expensive.\nThe Marine Energy Alliance (MEA) unites regional expertise and capabilities of leading organisations with a track-record in ME development. The main objective is to progress the combined technical and commercial maturity level of 40 SMEs developing ME Concepts (TRL 3-4), reducing the risk in the subsequent capital-intensive demonstration phase by 20%. This is achieved by delivering a tailored suite of integrated technical and commercial services, which is innovative and new to the sector. To ensure long-lasting impact, an after-care module is put in place in which after-care plans of the ME Concepts are carefully monitored. Concept Booster Hackathons will be organised connecting maritime and offshore companies to ME Concepts to lay the groundwork for future collaborations.\nA ME Investment Portfolio enabling investors to diversify risk by investing in multiple ME Concepts simultaneously will be developed. These activities support 120 companies in bringing new products to the market and leverage \u20ac8 million of additional funding. To sustain MEA, lessons-learned in the service delivery to individual ME Concepts are used to develop a Technical & Commercial Service Offer, which will be jointly implemented after the project lifetime. This Service Offer aims to support another 40 ME Concepts in the years after project finalisation contributing to the creation of 300 new jobs and 500 maintained jobs in the NWE region.", 1514764800000, 1672444800000, 261633.0, "nweurope_36_9"]]}}}}
