The training is going to have the form of a weekly training seminar (theory and practice) and it is going to take place in the installations of the  Ashford- Kent company, with possible  implementation period ranging between the last two months of 2014 till the end of 2015 (whilst schools are on holidays)\r\nDESCRIPTION: Energy Management of Buildings - Energy Inspector of Public Buildings\r\nIt is widely known that the demand for fossil fuels that are used for the production of energy has internationally shown an increasing tendency. As a result it influences in a radical way the economies of energy dependent countries, as it is Greece which on one hand spends enormous amounts of hard currency for the import of fossil fuels and on the other hand presents in the level of electricity production and final use, a picture of non efficient utilization of the various energy systems.\r\n \r\nThe institutional framework of the European Union binds the members states for the enforcement- implementation  of Energy saving programs in the following directions\r\n1.     The existence of governmental programs for the promotion of energy investments in the wider public sector\r\n2.     The  creation of new energy regulations and models\r\n3.     The energy performance  certification of buildings\r\n4.     The energy inspections of  installations\r\n5.     The rational pricing of energy\r\n\r\nThe margins for energy management improvement and efficiency in our country, Greece are enormous since there is a great waste of energy as it is proved by the Energy intensity indicators (units of energy per unit of GDP) that ranks/ classifies          Greece in the worst place in Europe right next to Portugal.\r\nThe energy management aims at the rational use of energy and financial resourses and at supporting functional objectives of the management of a building  by means of specific organizing actions and techno-financial measures. However, in order to ensure its benefits on a continuous basis, it is required a systematic organized and continuous process of knowledge, evaluation, observation and improvement of the real energy state of a building and its users behavior.\r\nIn addition the successful application of this process presupposes a contemporary framework of energy policy, a complete strategic approach and staffing  the institutions with well trained Energy Personnel\r\nSome  examples of successful practices that could be adopted by the public institutions are the following: Energy inspections of building installations, the use of suitable sensors and softwares, the energy certificates, the choice and funding of new sustainable/viable energy technologies, the co- productions of heat and electricity by means of natural gas, the interventions of replacement of light arrays with new low consumption lights, the complete application of bioclimatic architecture, the use of central solar systems and the central equipment of retrieving and storing heat.\r\nTaking into account the efforts that have been made  in the past few years for establishing and applying acontemporary /up-to-date institutional framework in terms of saving energy in building, the public sector has to be the first to respond in introducing procedures and implementing measures for improving the energy efficiency of building infrastructures.\r\nTherefore the public sector is called to introduce new organizational and financial schemes as well as new energy technologies and software in its buildings setting in this way the example for the rest of the users.\r\nFor all the above reasons the submission of this particular proposition  is essential.", "http://www.easgroup.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL01-KA102-000436_1"], [2018, "\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2  \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd 1000 m2)", "Electrical Assessment Services UK Limited", 18067.0, 2, 2, "The present action consists of the certified training of 16 teachers from the 1st Laboratory Center of Larissa (Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical) of higher technical education from Greece by ELECTRICAL ASSESSMENT SERVICES Ltd in the United Kingdom, providing training in electrical and engineering installations in large business premises (over 1000 m2) in the United Kingdom and generally large buildings.
