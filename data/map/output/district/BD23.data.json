Considering Euro4Science 1, a sucessfull strategic partnership, from the participants and partners feedback we also identified several needs and opportunities that justify a new project with much wider scope and ambition in pursuit of innovative and mobilizing  practices in secondary school education.Responding to a challenge that threatness Europe the partnership, although based in the initial core of members (which is important to gurantee the continuity) is now reinforced by the integration of two new countries, Turky and Greece which represent critical regions in view of the present human refugees crisis. Integration is now a keyword in Euro4Science 2.0.Euro4Science 2.0, includes the development of a Forensic Science Educational Toolbox which, despite exploring the same \"case-file\" forensic like aproach as in euro4Science 1, now pretends to wide activities subject expanding the range of topics from STEMs. The philosophy of enquiry education and case files exploration complemented with lab and field activies is now comprehensive to incorporate important priorities of present day citizenship and challenges including health education, envirnomental sustentability and inclusive society and human rights.An updated version of a Forensic Science Educational Toolbox with proper design and new materials and proposed activities aligned with the topics covered by Euro4Science 2.0 goals is produced in a number of units (1000) to assure a much wider dissemination and supporting of teachers involved in training actions. Inclusion of a Video Library will have an expected impact both on project visibility and dissemination as well as on supporting activities implementation in school contexts.In order to implement the innovative educational activities proposed and responding to a clear identified need, Euro4Science will promote the creation of a network of teachers properly trained in a hierachical chain of workshops, from central \"Train the trainers\" hubs to local \"hotspots\" in order to reach a significant number of teachers and through them ultimately by secondary school students.Students targets for Euro4Science 2.0 are included in ISCED 3: Upper secondary education (generally 14-16 years) where higher dropouts and demotivation are critical. Students participate both in testing periods and in a series of final Science Festivals organized by  partners and including a limited although significant exchange program  where all school community participates.The Forensic Sciences in  Education Book Edition , the Web site and an international conference will promote Euro4Science 2.0 sustentability beyond its completion.", "http://www.sghs.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA201-022893_3"], [2014, "Euro4Science: Exploring \u201cCSI Effect\u201d and Forensic Sciences to boost the appeal of science to young people and reinforce interdisciplinarity in European high schools", "Skipton Girls' High School Academy", 217130.0, 4, 6, "According to the European Commission, around six million young people drop out of school each year \u2013 about 14% of all pupils. On the other hand, improving the attractiveness of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to young people is crucial to generate a more skilled workforce in the EU. \r\n\r\nNowadays, youngsters are particularly open to the \u201cCSI\u201d thematic and iconography. This may be the leitmotiv for an innovative strategy of education aimed at mitigating early school dropout and promoting inter-disciplinarity and cultural exchanges while favoring social inclusion.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cEuro4Science: Exploring CSI-Effect and Forensic Sciences to boost the appeal of science to young people and reinforce inter-disciplinarity in European high schools\u201d (EU4SCI) aims at developing and implementing innovative practices, tools and methodologies in schools, enhancing the quality and relevance of the learning offer in education, more specifically regarding the attractiveness of science-related subjects and careers. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop, test and implement a Forensic Science Education Toolbox in 4 languages (English, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Polish) to be used in European Schools. This Toolbox will be designed and produced to be used by students under teachers\u2019 supervision. It will consist of a main box with lab materials and several support documents: students Guide; teachers\u2019 Guide; CSI Cases.\r\n\r\nEU4SCI will also organise 3 \u201cCSI weeks\u201d with a range of exciting activities for pupils and engaging the whole learning community. The CSI weeks (Portugal, the UK and Bulgaria) will host a programme with different activities including: sharing experiences of Educational Forensic Science Projects; presentation of \u201cCSI cases\u201d and development of activities around them; bioethical debates; conferences and debates with teachers, students, and other stakeholders/organisations; Science fair, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides the CSI weeks, several other events and initiatives will be implemented in the 4 participating countries, including: workshops for teachers; short-term exchanges of groups of pupils and \u201cCSI@school\u201d international conferences.\r\n\r\nThe project is carried out by partnership coordinated by a University of Aveiro (Portugal) and involving two schools (Portugal, the UK), one NGO (Bulgaria) and 2 SMEs (Portugal, Poland). Through the proposed activities, partners will address needs that have been identified in the current EU school context, namely:\r\n\r\n- To promote inter-disciplinary pedagogical approaches, through the collaborative development and implementation of a Forensic Science Educative Tool Box.\r\n\r\n- To promote teacher\u2019s involvement in experimental education by testing and using the Toolbox and engaging in several activities of the project.\r\n\r\n- To improve the motivation of European students to scientific culture and professions, as result of the participation in exciting activities with a strong scientific and pedagogical component and contacting professionals that use this knowledge in their day-to-day work.\r\n\r\n- To contribute to minimize early school dropout, as result of the increased motivation for classes and a wider perspective of possible career options, including those connected to scientific fields. Within this objective, particular attention will be paid to messages transmitted to girls, to foster gender mainstreaming and pass the message that scientific subjects and careers in science-related fields should be considered as career options for youngsters of both genders.\r\n\r\nBy fostering the attractiveness of science-related subjects through exciting activities connected to the \u201cCSI Theme\u201d and by engaging teachers and pupils of different ages in a project held at international level, Euro4Science will contribute to build a dynamic network of schools in Europe, decrease early school dropout and integrate pupils and teachers in a more motivating school environment.", "http://www.sghs.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PT01-KA200-001012_5"]]}}, "1US": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "2017 Vocational Experience", "CRAVEN COLLEGE", 314100.0, 4, 4, "The College is experienced and fully committed to organising European educational visits.
