From the other side there are opportunities for the young people in difficult situations (unemployed, school drop outs etc) who could take advantage of migration by using the mobility programmes such as European Voluntary Service and gain new skills abroad and in this way improve their chances to be fully involved in European society.

After arriving to desirable destination, for young people of migrant and refugee background, real battle just than starts, one that involves efforts for \u2018right\u2019 integration and inclusion based on equal rights and responsabilities as a rest of respective community they decide to settle. \r\nThe problem of employment of young people with migrant and refugee background is a most burning one.Youth are in danger of becoming the \u201ceducated unemployed\u2019 and joining the so-called NEETs (not in employment, education or training). They can be even more marginalized if their gender, ethnicity, social status, disability or geographic location isolates them from the mainstream. A young person without work for prolonged periods will struggle to recover:  Experts warn of their long-term lost income, increased dependency on benefit payments and their wasted potential.  \r\nIn the face of such economic and social challenges, there is demand, especially for young people of migrant and refugee background, to better prepare them for today\u2019s varied and unpredictable career paths. \r\nThe main aim of the project is to increase the quality of youth work services for migrants and refugees by equipping youth workers (coordinators, facilitators, mentors) with competencies necessary for development of social entrepreneurship ideas and projects. \r\nThe project is based on an intensive learning process to reach following objectives: \r\n\u2022\tTo enable participants to go through a process of development of social entrepreneurship projects and reflect on its different steps;\r\n\u2022\tTo gain understanding on how to do social entrepreneurship projects and how to make it relevant for the needs of young migrants and refugees;\r\n\u2022\tTo increase the knowledge of the background to social entrepreneurship (theory, concepts, steps, philosophy);\r\n\u2022\tTo develop practical skills in designing and implementing social entrepreneurship projects;\r\n\u2022\tRaising awareness about problems that youn meegrants and refugees are experiancing \r\n\u2022\tIntroducing tools regarding how social enterprises tackle societal problems in respect of young migrants and refugees\r\n\u2022\tTo motivate youth workers in order to undertake and utilise social enterpreneurship as a force for social change\r\n\u2022\tTo introduce necessary tools to youth workers on how to find innovative ways of tackling social problems in respect of young migrants and refugees\r\n\u2022\tTo develop pilot projects which address social challenges in their organisations or community \r\n\u2022\tEquipping youth workers with the relevant skills of how they can cope with social problems of young migrants and refugees in their society\r\n\r\nPersonal development, creativity and well-being have the potential of becoming the key outcomes of a learning system that follows the right track. This \u201cright track\u201d involves the use of innovative pedagogical methods, enjoyable and inspirational environments, collaborative learning that rests on a competence-based and learner-centred approach. And because we are all different, education needs to take into account the rich diversity of individuals. \r\n\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of this training course will be the youth workers from partner organisations through their experience of cooperation, intercultural learning and adopting new knowledge, skills and attitudes to improve their work with young people. The participants will develop and improve new programmes, start up social enterprises, implement new projects... aiming social change and increasing employability of young people with migrant and refugee background \r\nYoung people including young people with migrans and refugee background immediately benefit from these activities with improved self-confidence, greater respect for others, increased sense of responsibility and more motivation to persevere in the achievement of their goals", "http://www.mtba.org.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DE04-KA105-015985_7"], [2014, "New Enterprising Youth Excghanges", "Wai Yin Society", 20612.0, 3, 3, "New Enterprising Youth Exchanges will give 54 young people from UK, Sweden and Greece, New Eyes on the world and new opportunities to develop their entrepreneurial skills, giving them potential solutions to use their existing skills to think about new employment opportunities.

The participant\u2019s objective is, while learning about the artistic expression of theatre and music, to go deep into themselves and learn about the universiality of human emotion and expressing it artistically. This project will increase not only the participants knowledge of the arts, but can help them communicate and cooperate with people from different backgrounds and express themselves universally. This project, on the other hand, will provide a fresh start and a new platform for similar activitieis around Europe with which the youth will increase their artistic interactions, overcome cultural differences and incite them in thinking differently, as a starting point for making the world a better European place. \r\n\r\nIn that sence the objectives of the Project are :\r\n-Teaching the fundamentals of theatre and music\r\n-Surpassing cultural differences\r\n-Using the universal voice of artistic expression\r\n-Forgetting the past, learning the consequences of war and sharing love\r\n-Having a more compact European youth\r\n\r\nThe number of participants and participant profiles:\r\nIn our project, there will be  instructing participants in total from 7 countries. we have decided that the age limit is 16-24.In total, there will be 41 participants.\r\nDescription of the methodology to be used and activities: A team of theatre and music professionals will work with the participants on practically teaching the basics of theatre, pantomime and music. A music studio and a hands-on music equipment will be provided for the participants in order to learn the craft of musicians.

Among them, freight carriers and shippers are interested in minimizing freight logistics costs in order to maximize their profits, while maintaining a competitive level of service to their customers. City administrators and residents are oriented towards a decrease in traffic congestion, social costs and environmental nuisances, even though they are often direct beneficiaries of high quality delivery services. This leads to a multitude of differing and possibly conflicting objectives that are involved in urban freight transport planning and decision making, yielding a high level of complexity. This provides a main motivation for the development of tools for helping decision makers to reach higher grades of efficiency. \nDespite growing academic interest, the extent to which freight transport is acknowledged and formally considered in local authority transport planning varies considerably from country to country, and on a more local level, between towns and cities.
