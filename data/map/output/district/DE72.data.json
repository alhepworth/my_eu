This can be designed to be stiff (maintaining its position) whilst being light weight. For a similar sized currently used heliostat CSP, the structure would be self supporting (Sandwich structure) the weight would be 627kg, giving a weight saving of 80% of the backed structure and 23% of the unreinforced glass collector.\n\nThis weight saving has benefits in terms of installation and transportation, but the main advantage of the weight saving is, the energy required to adjust the collector would be greatly reduced thus a reduced energy control system could move the collectors during service. With the metal components removed, corrosion resistance is greatly reduced.\nAn advantage of a carbon fibre structure is the low coefficient of thermal expansion. In the areas that will benefit most from a CSP, the arid conditions produce high temperature variations daily.\n\nThe technical goal of this project is to produce lightweight yet robust components for CSP\ncollector components. Materials and processes will be identified and exploited to optimise the product and issues preventing optimisation will be investigated and solved. This proposal will have several aspects of work. Design and production of a novel composite collector, producing an adequate reflective surface on the composite, ensuring composite supports for the reflective surface, protecting that surface, and evaluating the effectiveness of the product. Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) will be considered to deposit a highly reflective coating onto a composite that will need to be manufactured to a high accuracy (surface finish) and durability.", 173528.0, 1172651.0, 5, 8, "CompoSol", null, "http://www.epmtechnology.com", null, "fp7_101548_963972227"], [1356998400000, 1459382400000, "Design and manufacture of a flight worthy intake system (scoop/NACA divergent intake) SCOOP AND NACA DIVERGENT INTAKE TRIAL (SANDIT)", "Epm Technology Ltd", "'This proposal supports the supply of an innovative scoop and NACA divergent intake, qualified to a sufficient\nlevel to support flight trial activities.\n\nWith a successful pedigree in intake design, coupled with a wealth of experience in complex structures and\nhaving gained a detailed understanding of scoop intake design from successful delivery of the original JTI funded scoop program, GKN and its partners are very well positioned to optimise design solutions and provide the most appropriate design for icing performance, acoustic design and application, manufacturing techniques and optimisation of the novel technologies employed in the previous programme.\n\nKey to programme success is evaluating material selection early to meet the harsh environmental requirements encountered by the scoop. Material selection directly effects ice protection efficiency, structural capability, weight and validation of system performance.\n\nComponent manufacture will incorporate the novel technology approaches applied in the previous program\nincluding lessons learnt and process capability. Within this partnership a wealth of composite manufacture in\ncomplex structures exists to optimise robust manufacturing solutions that can be converted into production\nsolutions with ease.\n\nAs a supplier of electro thermal ice protection systems for a multitude of applications, such as wing ice protection and engine intake systems, coupled with a high pedigree of successful acoustically optimised nacelle application technology, GKN has a foundation in providing design solutions for key technologies that support bleed less technology application and see the scoop ECS divergent intake system as a key step in providing all electric aircraft ice protection systems to support a change in systems architecture for future generations of aircraft.
