Carlisle Youth Zone (CYZ) is the receiving organisation. Volunteer Centre Kielce and Kreisjugendring Stormarn are the sending organisations.  \r\n\r\nMomentum World's mission is to enhance the career prospects of all young people. Working with CYZ this project offers opportunity for 2 volunteers from disadvantaged backgrounds to work in a vibrant and outward looking, well resourced youth centre based in the great border city of Carlisle in Cumbria, 20km south of the England/Scotland border. The objectives of the project are: \r\n\r\n- To offer an opportunity for relevant work experience to build volunteers cv's and enhance future employability\r\n- To improve competences in youth work and associated activities\r\n- To improve competences in IT, media literacy, critical thinking and team working as a pathway to future employment\r\n- To give a greater understanding of working with a variety of stakeholders, understanding diverse needs and using initiative \r\n- To improve language skills\r\n- To give an opportunity to be involved in event organisation and delivery\r\n- To enhance intercultural awareness\r\n- To promote and foster international relations by example of co-operation in work\r\n\r\nCarlisle Youth Zone  (CYZ) are seeking help with overall youth work and to improve  marketing and communications both internal and external. CYZ would like one youth work volunteer to work with designated team leaders to provide innovative and challenging positive activities to build social and emotional skills of young people. This involves work in sport, music, drama, dance and arts and crafts. Full training and experiential learning will be provided for the volunteer. CYZ would like the other volunteer to have a role in marketing and communications. Working under the supervision of our Development Manager, the volunteer will be responsible for developing social media output, helping recruitment and retention of members, developing and supporting fundraising activities, assisting in the PR function promoting activities to the wider media, carrying out market research and managing and maintaining databases of information, photos and video. Both volunteers would be part of a wider ethos of volunteering in CYZ with a current cohort of 100 volunteers helping to run the organisation at all levels supporting paid staff.\r\n\r\nThe profile for participants to be placed at CYZ is  young people who have enthusiasm, who want to work with other young people and who are open to gaining confidence in speaking to and leading others. Sporting or musical skills, love of drama and enjoyment of the outdoors are all a bonus. IT and media skills would be a bonus as far as the second volunteer is concerned but this is not an issue in the selection process. As co-ordinators Momentum, working with CYZ as the host organisation wish to select young people with fewer opportunities or from disadvantaged backgrounds. The selection process will involve application, motivation letters and cv presentation which will produce a short list leading to Skype interviews. \r\n\r\nThe basic elements are as follows;\r\n\r\n1. Pre departure training - job description and introduction of role to be played. Administrative and logistic arrangements. Intercultural skills training. Delivered by sending partners.\r\n2. On arrival  - orientation and understanding, venue and delivery at CYZ, Carlisle\r\n3. Induction training - start September for 1 week. Working methods used; Team building.

When the  Dutch school visited the school in Appleby, UK, they found out how they were affected by water as well as a result of yearly floodings. Therefore both schools share a common interest in exploring the way water shapes us and our environment.  Both schools wanted to explore this question in a wider context and in different parts of Europe. We contacted a school in Rimini (Italy) because they are directly on the Adriatic coast and a school in N\u00e1chod (Czech Republic) which is located near the mountains where there are water springs and upper river streams. Also the school teaches a study programme about Travel and Tourism, where water is taught from the point of view of ecology and its influence on the environment, tourism, means of transport and economics. As all schools are located in smaller cities we contacted a school in Munich (where the river Isar runs through directly from the Alps) to include an urban aspect to our explorations and to find out how water is used for recreational purposes in big cities. \r\n\r\nWater is vital to all countries. It affects the areas we live in and therefore shapes our society. When looking into the sources available we soon found out that most water projects have a narrowed focus: They either focus on the purely scientific elements of water or merely on aspects of sustainability, without addressing the questions we were interested in. Therefore we would like to develop learning material that address the following questions: \r\n\r\nHow does water shape us and the areas and societies we live in? Which opportunities do we derive from water and what challenges do we face because of the water that surrounds us?  We will look into recreational purposes of water (tourism, esthetic aspects), economic opportunities (for example transport), environmental issues (floodings, rising sea levels), the management of water itself (quality of drinking water, waste water treatment) and the geographical aspect (how beaches, rivers, seas and lakes shape the regions which we live in). Besides, our project focuses on the way how water moves us,  i.e. how does water connect people with different ideas, cultural backgrounds and interests? \r\n\r\nWhat we will create in our project \"Moving Waters - how water shapes us\" is a series of lesson material in the field of sciences, arts and languages. The schools involved in this project will all include students aged 13-19. A total number of 800 students will be involved in this project, 92 of which will also be selected to travel to the partner schools. As the level of our students may vary, we will create lessons that are suitable for students from different backgrounds, who follow education on different levels and who have different learning styles. Our approach is student-centered, i.e. our students will do research themselves, present their results, compare their findings and share their newly gained knowledge. The material can be used within schools in all countries, even with few facilities. \r\n\r\nAbove all, our project aims to promote the acquisition of skills and competences of both students and teachers. More in specific, our project aims to increase students' intercultural competences, to enhance multilingualism (using English and German as a lingua franca), to increase their knowledge of water and water management, to foster their digital skills, to increase their self-confidence (as a result of their growing intercultural competence) and to challenge Euroscepticism. The project also supports the recently announced assessment of global competence in PISA tests by OECD, which is the capacity to examine global and intercultural issues, to take up multiple perspectives, to engage in open, appropriate and effective interactions and to act for collective well-being and sustainable development.\r\n\r\nFor teachers, the project will lead to  the use of more innovative and activating didactics (also beyond the project), which will, as a result of the student-centered approach, hopefully lead to a greater social inclusion of students with different backgrounds, interests, competences and learning strategies.  Furthermore we hope to improve the ICT skills of teachers as a didactic tool.\r\n\r\nThe project will further help to motivate students for studies in the field of water management and to enthuse them to study abroad .\r\n\r\nFinally, the project will help schools to gain insight into different pedagogical approaches,  to foster arts, economic and natural sciences, to enhance the use of ICT by both teachers and students in a thoughtful manner, to improve learning outcomes of students  who have participated in the project as a result of an increase in student-based approaches, and better communicative skills in English and/or German. \r\n\r\nLikewise, our project will form the foundation for further cooperation between the different schools.", "http://www.appleby.cumbria.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA219-035242_1"]]}}}}
