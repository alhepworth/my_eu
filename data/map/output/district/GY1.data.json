Employees who will continue to learn throughout and who can work in an international environment. In relation to this, Euregio plays an increasingly important role.In its new strategic plan 2015 \u2013 2020, Graafschap College has listed five strategic policies, one of them being:education in the Euregio network  and in an international global context.Graafschap College aims to offer both students and employees a learning environment where they acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to work as a professional in the dynamic, complex, increasingly international and culturally diverse society.These competences can be achieved by physical mobility. In order to (further) develop our students\u2019 international and intercultural competences, Graafschap College also offers internationalisation at home. Graafschap College students are prepared for a dynamic labour market focused on an international environment. Think of the border region with Germany for example.Main topics from September 2015 (start of the charter)In the fall of 2015, a study trip to Finland was organized together will colleagues from ROC Twente, for members of both Boards, directors and educational managers. Its central theme was VET in an international context. At this moment, the insights acquired are used to write the new framework document on internationalization, and a hands on approach in all sectors.Plusprogram for talented Engineering students:Four Engineering students will leave to Gambia in half a year\u2019s time, to work on a development project in close cooperation with Stichting Bouwen Nederland.Graafschap College by now participates in RADIX. This is a reference group of a number of internationalization coordinators of different regional schools. Graafschap College is secretary for the new Intereg V application, for the Gronau-Enschede euregion.At this moment Graafschap College looks into the possibility to become co-organiser of the so-called Europe Summer School. This implies offering a one or two week summer course to foreign students.De sector educatie en participatie stelt vanaf dit jaar 15.000 euro ter beschikking voor studenten en medewerkers om meer ruimte te bieden voor  internationale stages (soort scholarships)For this call, the above means that in comparison to previous calls, the accent shifts towards Germany. We are applying for a fund to allow 23 employees to increase their knowledge of the German language and to cooperate with a Berufskollege in Berlin. The cooperation started in 2015, is extended and enhanced at the least.By mutual successful visits to each other\u2019s school, a project is now started to have students orientate on their profession, language skills (German and English) in order to prepare students even better for the professional and labour market. These students explicitly chose for optional program 1 International. Students take classes half of the day, or cooperate in a project (English and German) and join German students to their internship workplaces in Berlin. By now both optional programs have already been translated internationally for the Berlin Berufsschule, so that students can be received well prepared. It is expected the project will have a renewing and promotional influence on students, and that programs can be tuned into each other.Almost all students are offered German classes by now!Just like last year, there is an application for MIJN SCHOOL studentsBeside gaining practical skills, it is mostly about giving students the opportunity to become acquainted with another culture, society, and educational system. Many of the students enrolled in this project have been offered the opportunity to meet people outside their relatively limited social life. The vocational aspect of the exchange will be substantial. A guide is included in the application for this group. We apply for a fund for 63 students for a foreign internship in Germany.

This programme runs over a two year period and can be completed in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland and Finland. Four departures will be organised in groups of 6 youths to better organise the training prior to departure.\r\nWe offer an internship of 15 days to supervisors in 6 European countries: Spain, Bulgaria, Ireland, United Kingdom, Finland and Germany. The periods are chosen based on availability of supervisors. This is actually an individualised career plan since these participants can also choose the host country and the type of business in which they want to do their internship.\r\nTo understand this issue we must not forget that if the targeted public is fixed, we do not actually know each individual personally since we are not a schooling organisation and do not know the participants before the selection is started.\r\nThe profile of beneficiaries:\r\nFor SFP: youths selected in the Missions Locales, are highly motivated ,available, registered as trainees in vocational training, willing with a real personal project to fulfil.\r\nFor supervisors: motivated and willing, they have an undeniable desire to evolve in their careers and to help their structure to progress to a new dimension, particularly a European one.\r\nDescription of participant\u2019s activities\r\nSFP: Harnessing the professional internship in companies by sector of activity, deepen linguistic knowledge (prior to departure and during the course if necessary) and be able to take advantage of this wonderful cultural and social experience which they are going to benefit from.\r\nSupervisors: Recognise, identify and discuss the work practices of social inclusion structures of other countries. It is very important for us to share and exchange these procedures, by adopting and making others adopt them.\r\nFor immersion quality we advocate only accommodation with host families and we also organise 3 or 4 cultural visits.\r\nThe methodology is that of rigor. The roles of each individual are determined by agreement between the consortium members who make up the Directing Committee, our partner companies and also the beneficiaries of the mobility. All are bound by a signed agreement.\r\nImpact: We have already measured this impact with the last mobility projects we  with different Leonardo programmes. The after effects are very important on a local, regional and national level. The MdEY is by nature a structure dedicated to Europe, which organises many youths and adults exchanges, we can certify that the impact of a mobility project is important. We have evidence from young people who, five years later, still talk about their experience and by the growing demands (20%) we receive.

These students are between 16 and 19 years old. They are often from disadvantaged social classes. They often have to face problems of motivation as they consider attending a vocational school as a failure. The integration of a European class and the prospect of a European mobility is a real boost for these students. Moreover their training will be valued and certified by a European diploma \u201cBaccalaur\u00e9at mention europ\u00e9enne\u201d and they will obtain the Europass mobility portfolio at the end of their internship.\r\nThe objective of this project is to enable the school to enhance its professional training offer and to motivate students thanks to a European mobility, financially accessible to their families. This project is a great educational tool for language and professional teachers. Indeed, it allows them to conduct joined and concrete pedagogical actions. We want to offer this mobility opportunity to a maximum of hardworking and deserving students: the criteria to integrate a European class are not only based on their  linguistic abilities and thus enable willful, diligent and professional students to join a European class. So we plan to send 20 students to Spain and 50 students to Ireland in the next two years.\r\nTo build this project, we work closely with a provider in the host country. They will be in charge of selecting the host companies for the future interns who will stay four weeks. The work placements must meet the requirements of the curriculum of the diplomas and they will be assessed as part of the diploma \u201cBaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel\u201d. Moreover, we pay particular attention to the choice of the provider who will be the link between the students and the High School during the 5 week stay in the host country. Great importance is given to the assessment of the students in their host businesses. Indeed this assessment will allow teachers to meet companies\u2019 tutors in the presence of the student. It is usually a very constructive and enriching relationship between the student, his tutor and his teacher. That stimulates students to make their best to succeed at school in order to be well trained and to pass their exam successfully.\r\nThe impact of the project is particularly important both for the students and the High School as we have seen in previous years. It really enhances the training offered by the school that communicates widely on the European opening opportunity. The benefits for the students are not only on the linguistic level but also on the personal level. As a matter of fact, they make significant progress in terms of autonomy, maturity, adaptability and self-confidence.\r\n\r\nLanguage and professional teachers widely use this mobility experience to conduct joined educational activities that motivate students. We also notice that this first opportunity to do an internship in another European country allows many young people to broaden their professional horizons. It clearly affects their behaviour and motivation in a positive way. This experience abroad will enrich their CV.

The professional integration of young people is subjected to the pressure of a difficult and increasingly competitive economic environment. In this context, the practice of a foreign language has become a leading criterion for employability. With this in mind, the Lycee des Metiers Florian wants to allow pupils of European sections to perform a training period in a company located in Spain or in the United Kingdom, during their final year.\r\n\r\nRecruited by a motivational interviewing and language tests, the pupils of the european section will have professional education courses in the chosen language (english or spanish)  and strengthened language courses to get the  \u2018Section Europe\u2019 mention on the Baccalaureat certificate.

This means that the students\u2019 families deal with important social problems. Some of our students have met school problems when they were in their secondary schools and they came to our vocational school because they couldn\u2019t study in a traditional high school.\r\n\r\nThese young have lost their school and social landmarks and our role as teachers is to help them to become self-confident anew. Our main mission as education specialists is to encourage them, to focus on the positive aspects of their personality. We also have to find more and more innovative tools for this kind of public.\r\n\r\nThe mobility is a real lever for a good integration into the workplace because it allows the students to become more open-minded.

It is thus important for French schools to organize new educational learning methods.\r\n\r\nOur challenge, while launching this plan, is to give all these young the hope for a better professional future.\r\n\r\nThe English language, as it is taught in our school, must become an oral means of communication and exchange in our students\u2019 professional environment.\r\n\r\nTo take up the challenge, we have created a project steering committee in charge of implementing and of following this mobility plan.\r\n\r\nThe first phase was to determine the grades that would be part of this European plan. The project steering committee decided that the students preparing a BTEC in Commerce, Sales or Customer Relation would benefit from this innovative career path in a foreign European country. The three branches are part of the European class created in our vocational school and it was thus natural to set up this plan for this school grade and this type of studies. We have registered the 22 students that were in this class.\r\n\r\nThe activities scheduled during this mobility are the following ones:\r\n\r\n- One week of lessons in a language school (Irish or English) with an individual accommodation in a host-family for a better immersion of our students.\r\n\r\n- Three weeks of internship in an Irish or English firm in the professional domain of each of our students.\r\n\r\n- The students will be able to familiarize themselves with the habits and customs, which are different from ours, as far as culture and the professional domain are concerned.\r\n\r\nA plan methodology will be implemented by the teachers and the management team of the school within the frame of the project steering committee.\r\n\r\nTools for the preparation and for the follow-up of the activities are implemented.

More recently, the Centre International d\u2019Etudes \r\nP\u00e9dagogiques (CIEP) selected our school for a partnership with Kingsbrook business \r\nand enterprise school, in UK. http://www.kingsbrook.org.uk/.\r\nDuring the 2010-2011 academic year, a virtual exchange via e-learning took place. It \r\nwas helpful as it enabled students in their first year in B-Tech National to introduce \r\ntheir professional projects to their British counterparts, once a month.\r\nBetween 2011 and 2013, a B-Tech National class specializing in security went to Auschwitz with an explicit aim of ensuring transmission of the duty of remembrance. Another class went to Dachau.\r\n One teacher has been  adviser  for the European and international issues (ERAI) since 2010. He acts as a liaison between the international partners, the funding agencies and the DAREIC (School representative for European and international relations)   of the Paris Academy.\r\nIn order to reinforce our commitment to the European culture, we consider it essential that our students enrolled in the Administrative European sections should do part of their training periods in one or more European countries.\r\nIndeed, professional mobility and language acquisition are made a priority for our students because of the internationalization of trade. They enable the students to broaden their professional, cultural and personal horizons. They are also a real passport for students wishing to further their education in a Two-Year Technical Degree, where the knowledge of languages is a real advantage.\r\nTherefore, In November 2014 and November 2015, 24 students in administrative B-Tech National should have the means to do a 5-week training period in British and Spanish companies in Swansea, GB and Madrid, Spain.", "http://www.testenglish.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001624_1"], [2014, "Mobilit\u00e9 des jeunes en lyc\u00e9e professionnel et rayonnement au sein de la communaut\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne", "TESTENGLISH LDT", 14520.0, 2, 6, "Saint Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise Technical school is located in the southern suburbs of Paris.\r\nIt\u2019s been leading Erasmus mobility programs for more than 13 years.\r\nOur initial challenge is to bring the 260 students to pass their exam (Professionnal Baccalaureat ).\r\nGathering the entity of our school around this rewarding program constitutes our main objective.\r\nSince 2001, more than 60 students from our European sections have been granted a professional and personal experience within the mobility program (formerly named \u2018Leonardo\u2019) in Ireland, England and Wales.\r\nIn addition to that, a twinning partnership has been carried out with Wiesloch Highschoool in Germany. In that respect, those flourishing programs ensure the future challenges that we need, however, to improve year after year.\r\n\r\nEach experience enables us to facilitate the students\u2019 professional integration in the midst of the European community.

They have lost faith in the school system and this leads them to often skip classes or drop out. Faced with alarming figures, the educative team of the Sales program would like to develop mobility projects as part of the curriculum with the hope to motivate the students again.  Previous experiences have given positive effects on our students' results and behaviour. They are now more confident and plan to carry their studies to a high leveL.
