Through narratives, we raise the consciousness of people in a disadvantaged position in society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand storytelling enables us to make a closer connection to the everyday life and troubles of individuals which sets the agenda for collective action. It is also useful as a strategy of communication: stories are much more appealing then figures.\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that we can increase the quality of our practice, our communication strategies and our learning methods by being inspired in a European context. \r\n\r\nIn this application the focus lies on embedding specific knowledge of storytelling in the practice of community development in Flanders. That's why we would like to organise a studyvisit to The Village Storytelling Centre as they are practiced in the art of Storytelling as a applied method for community development.\r\n\r\nThey will develop a three days course based on our needs. There will be different workshops:\r\n- an introduction in storytelling\r\n- hands on sessions in the use of storytelling to empower disadvantaged groups\r\n- hands on sessions in the use of storytelling in communication strategies\r\n- reflection on the ethical aspects of storytelling\r\n- visit to a community development organisation in order to learn the do's and dont's\r\n\r\nThe main learning goals are \r\n- knowledge of the use of story gathering techniques and methods in story telling\r\n- increased confidence in communication strategy\r\n\r\nThe participants are experienced community development staff of SAM steunpunt Mens en Samenleving and regional institutes for Samenlevingsopbouw. All with substancial experience in the field, but keen to learn more about storytelling. \r\nWe intend to implement storytelling in the sector Samenlevingsopbouw and that's why we need several ambassadors. \r\nWe create a mixed group of participants:\r\nOn the one hand staff members from SAM steunpunt Mens en Samenleving with different profiles: research and development, learning and development, staffmembers with specific focus on education, housing, combatting poverty and a co\u00f6rdinator. (total: 8) \r\nOn the other hand staff members from each regional institute. (total : 8) The selected staffmembers have a focus on learning and education or on communication strategy.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, results from the study visit we be documented and disseminated to interested audiences through SAM steunpunt Mens en Samenleving in their curricula and the regional partners at national level and through Epale and EuCDN (European Community Development Network) at Europe-wide level.", "http://www.villagestorytelling.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA104-046707_1"]]}}, "5SD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Tell me your fairy tale!", "Crookston Castle Primary School", 56885.0, 6, 6, "The project which is planned by us will be an opportunity to discover a bit forgotten, in our point of view,  the world of fairy tales. We firmly believe in the sense of technological progress but we want to protect some important things  against destruction, creating some kind of compromise.  Nowadays children are imbued with popular culture and it\u2019s difficult to get them to read or listen to the stories with the pleasure. We want to show them that the world of fairy tales can be combined with modern technologies. The youngest recipients of the project are three years old children and the oldest - teenage students. We are going to show that the topic of fairy tales may connect students of all ages and backgrounds. We\u2019re going to do this by creating attractive methods of education, based on the number of multimedia aids. Thanks that we\u2019ll provide access to new technologies for all pupils, regardless of the economic situation or origin. Participation in the project will also help equalize chances of the students and give all an opportunity to learn about other cultures and found friendships outside the country, which may lead to cooperation in the future. In this way we can also improve their language abilities. \r\nThrough our activities we want to encourage our teams of teachers to self-improvement, to introduce innovative teaching methods and to cooperate with the local community.\r\nThe project is going to be attended by six partner countries: Poland (as a coordinator), Italy, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the United Kingdom and Greece. All organizations are primary schools with the exception of Bulgaria, which is kindergarten. Poland, which belongs to the School Complex is going to have in their composition kindergarten in September 2015. Our actions are going to be based primarily on the exchange of experiences in order to provide the highest level of education. The first crucial action is going to be an introducing with partners by organization of thematic days in each school. Every school for one day will change the decoration, including the possibility of preparing some special clothes by the students and teachers. From the beginning, we will take care of the effective promotion of our activities by maintaining websites and newsletters in the school which will cover current events. We are going to conduct regular correspondence between our students by the form of traditional letters, e-mails and video calls over by the Internet.  We would like to arrange six meetings with partner countries to be able to get to know our schools, to see how the lessons look like in practice and to inspire from the solutions applied in the functioning of the school. From experience from previous projects we know that such visits provide many ideas which are implemented later. \r\nOne of the main effects of our actions will be creating a teaching guide describing the methods of working with fairy tales during the lessons. We want to compile a book with a collection of fairy tales from our countries, as well as a publication with some stories created by ourselves. The great attraction for younger children will be exchanging a puppet  and experiencing various adventures. We\u2019re going to prepare some performances based on chosen fairy tales. We want to raise our skills by organise training course with therapy by fairy tales prepared by ourselves. The topic of fairy tales will be an opportunity for us to organization numerous art competitions, for the preparation of games and to set up their reading marathons. The final popularized event will be  a Fairytale Festival, which will provide plenty of activities and the presentation of the results of our work for the local community. \r\nWe are confident that thanks to our project the topic of  fairy tales will  remain for the long time in our schools. This will happen through the creation of teaching guide, as well as many other publications and multimedia supports and the products of children\u2019s works. The completed actions will activate  the sphere of student\u2019s family , as well as the local community.

In this situation the young people between 18 and 25 years old, with less experience, with fewer opportunities, with an individual identity less marked and developed, and a future without certainty and stability, feel themselves \"nomads\" , always in search of new references. While remaining strong the inexorable trend toward cultural uniformity through the overall process of \"westernization\", several elements of varieties and distinction between the groups are still alive and active. They often emphasize reactions of fundamentalism, racism and self-closing where a young weak and disoriented can easily fall. In this way, the pluralism and diversity of traditions, customs and languages, which in themselves constitute grounds for mutual enrichment and development, may lead to an aggravation of the identities that gives rise to clashes and conflicts. In this current situation, young people need, therefore, to open to new experiences that lead to the knowledge of new forms of integration and dialogue and that allow, on one hand the maintenance and establishment of its own cultural identity and, on the other hand, the recognition of multiple cultural expressions for the development of  mutual respect of their peculiarities. The overall objective of the project \u201cTuMiAmi\u201d is bring 20 young people (between 18 and 25 years and from 4 different countries) to reflect on the concepts of identity, culture and intercultural that starts from the reflection on the self (identity),\r\npasses through the knowledge of the others (cultures) and finally arrives to investigate the interaction between peoples and cultures (intercultural).

Through a combination of rational and well-planned activities based on non-formal learning and on learning by doing that stimulate the peer education, the young participants will be guided to acquire technic-organizational skills, attitudes and competences which will aim at self-knowledge, personal development, strengthening their self-esteem, increase the sense of initiative and active participation, acceptance and understanding of cultural relativism and of new forms of integration. In order to ensure the achievement of the objectives and results described above, the project \"TuMiAmi\" will provide a steady communication between the participating organizations, an Advanced Planning Visit in Serbia to train the future team leaders and some pre-departure meetings between the participants from the same country. Following these preparatory stages,  a youth exchange will take place in Palermo between 25 September and 9 October 2015, that will be the core of the whole project. During the first eight days, exercises and games (simulations, role play, group activities, discussions, debates, evaluations etc ..) will be proposed by a facilitator. They will enable participants to test themselves and to participate in an active and dynamic way by preventing the occurrence of passive moments. From the ninth day on, the activities will be more practical and will try to stimulate creativity and manual skills of the participants.

The young participants will create cultural itineraries on topics related to tangible elements of each culture by devising ways and strategies to make them interact to each other. In this phase will be fundamental the contribution of young people belonging to the foreign communities of Palermo.
