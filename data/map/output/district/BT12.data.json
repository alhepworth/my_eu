The main objective is to give the students an opportunity to get to know a foreign culture and the daily routines of a typical kindergarten/school abroad whose key cohorts are mainly from socially deprived and marginalised backgrounds.  They are expected to conduct themselves on a professional level where they are embedding and integrating within these environments, adapting their practice to meet the needs of the children they are working with while closely observing/recording holistic child developments and comparing this to normative milestones. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Furthermore, the students are expected to design and execute (perform) pedagogic activities with the children building relationships and learning from each other; what do we have in common and why are we different; reinforcing the value and benefits of understanding and embracing inclusion and diversity .  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Ongoing reflection is a key and integral aspect of this project; Staff and students will meet on three separate occasions to pause and reflect about what kind of learning has taken place.

The group objective of \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d consists of a total of 25 young between 18 and 35 years old, in possession of a VET certificate, obtained in any of the institutions that make up the Consortium.The professional areas which the project addresses are:- Physical and sports activities- Agrarian - Administration and management - Graphic arts- Trade and marketing - Electricity and electronics - Hospitality and tourism- Information technology and communications - Installation and maintenance - Personal image - Sound and vision - Wood, furniture and cork - Health- Sociocultural and community services - Transport and vehicle maintenanceNeeds and problems of young students and/or graduates from Cuenca in these sectors are broadly:- A high rate of youth unemployment. - Little or no work experience. - Limited knowledge and use of a second language. - Low level of self-employment in the province of Cuenca. - A high concentration of the population in rural areas. - Very limited labour supply in the province due to lack of a solid business network. - Academic offer very limited. - Loss of human capital for young graduates who have to emigrate to work in jobs related to their training. - Lack of knowledge and use of ICT.- Little awareness of European citizenship and the workforce to compete in a global market.Based on the socio-economic context, the identified needs, the professional sectors and the overall project objective, we have established the following specific objectives:- Improve the employability of participants through quality labor practices in companies abroad.- Provide the tools to adapt to a new work environment in a different culture and learn other methods of work in a foreign company.- Develop skills in a second language.- Acquire job skills learning to create supportive alliances in a very different socio-cultural framework, working with people from other cultures.- Promote equal opportunities for young people in rural and urban areas, and between men and women.- Acquire social skills and develop personal skills by learning to organize and structure work routines.- Provide career guidance to participants.The relevance of the project is enhanced by the fact that it operates on a rural, depressed territory with scarce resources, providing greater opportunities for participants to complete their qualifications and find employment.\u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d provides 25 selected participants, according to a public and transparent procedure, the organization of stays for completing professional training in European companies for 3 months in Padova (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal), Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Prague (Czech Republic). In each of these cities, the Consortium has the support of a set of intermediaries and host companies that consolidate the quality of the project partners, with which they are collaborating for years.At a cultural and social level, apprenticeships offer young people of Cuenca the opportunity to live an enriching experience that will take place in a cultural context characterized by diversity, with new forms of work and resolving conflicts, which contribute to having a broader vision and social skills increasingly valued by companies.In short, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d is the result of the commitment of the Consortium and its partners in continuing the promotion of training and employment for local young people.

The majority of young people with severe mental health disorders have experienced significant educational interruptions due to their illness. The onset of most psychiatric difficulties occurs between the ages of 12 and 24 (Kessler et al. 2005; Patel et al. 2007). This is a time when many young people are completing their education, making early career choices and establishing relationships (Patel et al. 2007). \r\n\r\nAs teachers working with students who have severe mental health difficulties, we see firsthand the lack of educational supports available for our students. Many have been out of school for up to two years and feel they are unable to reintegrate.

Helping them finding back a place in society and regaining confidence is their priority. \r\n\r\nAll of our students require and deserve a specialised education programme to allow them to return to education while addressing their educational and medical needs. This does not exist for our students currently but it does exist internationally.

The removal of border control in the Schengen area is its most visible expression. Although important steps have been made, the vision of \u201cborderless EU\u201d is far from accomplished. The deterring economic situation in the EU gave new impulse to nationalistic and Eurosceptic movements in EU member states and candidate countries. Soon after the crisis started, media and politicians, by default, mostly found the culprit over the border or among members of minority groups.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic shift in attitude towards \u201cothers\u201d can\u2019t be explained if borders are perceived as lines on maps separating nation states. Borders are \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 a complex and dynamic mental phenomenon, (re)produced through creation of binary distinctions between the \u201cI\u201d/\u201cWe\u201d and the \u201eOther(s)\u201c/\u201cThem\u201d. People constantly draw (mental) borders between themselves and others in accordance with their individual experience, perception, memory, belief, by taking into account the collective ones they identify with \u2013 and thus practice inclusion or exclusion.\r\n\r\nBE-SMaRT is on the ball regarding the fact that understanding mental borders needs a transdisciplinary approach of different aspects of borders and thus to comprehend their impact on (young) peoples\u2019 life-experiences and constructions of identities within ever more globalized societies. Therefore bottom-up reflective educational approaches in the professional development of teachers and teacher students will be developed to challenge memories and \u201ctraditional\u201d conceptions of \u201cEurope\u201d's borders. The major innovative issue of BE-SMaRT is not just to bring together the concept of \u201cborders\u201d with individual/collective memory but to do this within teacher education and thus to act in an pedagocical context. The project\u2019s target groups (teacher, teacher students, education providers,\u2026) show this particular educational potential. In this way, BE-SMaRT is complementary to other initiatives dealing with borders, border perceptions and/or memories, which are not targeting \u201eeducational multipliers\u201c.\r\n\r\nThe project approach is multidisciplinary but anchored in Teacher Education and includes teacher students and teachers in service (as focus groups), curricula and textbooks (as political references and basis media for schools), the collection of border related life-stories/memories (as working material for teachers and teacher students) will be included in and form the basis of analysis.\r\n\r\nBE-SMaRT is designed in two progressive steps:\r\n\r\na) Analysis of studies and publications on existing and empirical knowledge of border perception through memory: Quantitative and qualitative research methods will be employed for the collection of data and for the establishment of a scientific basis in order to have relevant information and sound didactic foundation for the development of the module. The project research will focus on the representations of \u201cborders\u201d in different fields that ultimately will lead to an evaluation of existing, and the development of new approaches regarding the understanding of, and in turn, education on \u201cborders\u201d which may challenge more traditional, mainly spatial conceptions.\r\n\r\nb) Based on these diverse studies, an under-graduate and/or post-graduate module for initial teacher education degree programmes will be developed. The module aims at opening teacher education from its traditionally national orientation to a European dimension. It will become integrated into the existing university programmes and also may be used as a course for Erasmus incoming teacher education students. Blended learning components will enable communication between teacher students of the partner universities.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the module will be based on critical reflection of individuals and groups in relation to their current situation. Within BE-SMaRT, this involves questioning existing assumptions, values, and perspectives which underlie young people\u2019s actions, decisions and judgements \u2013 in the present case referring to border and memory \u2013 in order to liberate them from their habitual ways of thinking and acting. This transformation of perspectives is only possible through the critical reconsideration of one\u2019s own perspectives and orientations to perceiving, knowing, feeling, and acting \u2013 this means: what has been learned before \u2013 the frame of reference \u2013 has to be unlearned to make room for new knowledge, skills, and attitudes: it has to be re-constructed. \r\n\r\nThis approach seems most appropriate at a time when young people know the EU\u2019s political borders and perceive borderfree life within Europe as set. BE-SMaRT is about opportunities for young, dynamic EU citizens (= teachers of tomorrow) to experience meaningful dialogue about othering, to encourage them to see mutual understanding as basis from which to shape and build a more socially just, inclusive and successfully functioning European society.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA200-001602_5"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "St Mary's University College", 79765.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", "St Mary's University College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046988_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "St Mary's University College", 74447.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", "St Mary's University College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035381_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "St Mary's University College", 56388.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", "St Mary's University College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000037_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "St Mary's University College", 51888.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", "St Mary's University College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023524_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "St Mary's University College", 41818.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", "St Mary's University College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-013892_coordinator"]]}}, "6LW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Upskilling Young Players & Coaching Staff in Northern Ireland via European Mobility", "IRISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION LTD", 112462.0, 3, 4, "The Erasmus+ mobility flows can be categorised as below:\r\n\r\n\u2022 32 VET Learners (plus 5 accompanying persons) aged 16 or under who are undertaking a vocational foundation apprenticeship through the Club NI programme.  \r\n\u2022 42 VET Staff  (Spain- 20 places community/ women\u2019s/grassroots coaches.

The impact of moving away from home at a young age is significant as they struggle to meet the demands of being away from home. A staggering 90% of young players who are offered professional contracts with clubs in England dropout and return home within 2 years, as a result of being ill-prepared for the demands of playing at this level. Mobility will address this issue by improving skill sets and making them better equipped to deal with being away from home and adapting to a different working environment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of VET Staff, mobility will directly address the skills gap that has developed between coaching professionals in the UK and mainland Europe. The relative ignorance of European innovations in player development pathways has had a negative impact on the success of coaching delivery at community and grassroots level. \r\n\r\nVET Staff will study the innovations at acknowledged (UEFA) Centres of Excellence in Spain or Portugal, which are applauded as having a world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.

It is this area between schools, the grassroots/community coaching framework and the professional clubs where the real benefits of European innovation will be applied by the returning mobility participants to maximum effect. This project will add real value by increasing, on a national basis,  knowledge, skills and competences among VET professionals as a direct result of their participation in European mobility.  \r\n\r\nThis project will enhance talent development in Northern Ireland in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football, and allow the large numbers of young people, male and female, to achieve their maximum potential as a player, irrespective of the level that they participate. European innovations and methods will be introduced to provide more transparent links between the regional coaching centres, the national performance centre and also our International Level Centre. \r\n\r\nThis project will directly address the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. The Irish FA is a fairly unique entity in its access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other VET Professionals to seek out mobility opportunities.

The Irish FA has been involved in European mobility programmes for the past seven years, since its first funding award in 2009 for a Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project. Since that time the Irish FA has successfully completed a total of eight mobility projects under the Lifelong Learning Programme which has involved both VET staff (coaches) and VET learners (trainee players).The application seeks funding for a total of 56 participants drawn from two categories of VET staff:1. Community and grassroots coaches employed by local football clubs, local councils and schools within the region to deliver vocationally relevant training to young players. 2. Female coaches involved in women\u2019s football who are actively involved in the promotion of female participation in Northern Ireland football and developing young elite girls and women in the sport who will travel to Spain.A thematic focus will be placed on the upskilling of adult coaches working in regional centres, professional clubs, youth and community clubs and schools, with a particular emphasis on women\u2019s coaching. Mobility will focus on the following key themes:1) To educate coaches in the activities of football clubs and other sporting organisations within Portugal and Spain.2) To encourage research in coaching methods in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football which incorporates a European perspective addressing issues of player development, gender equality, coach CPD and aspects of community development. 3) To share best practice on sport and to create concrete development support models in Northern Ireland that foster better implementation of European best practice at all levels of the game.The specific objectives relate to the professional development of the participants, increased employability and improved job security. These include but are not restricted to the following:1. To allow VET coaches to acquire the skills involved in the theory and delivery of the most advanced European coaching processes.2. To enhance the employability of participants through the acquisition of additional skills and qualifications.3. To enhance security of tenure and improve career progression for participants.4. To monitor employment rates among participants and compare the data with coaching personnel who have not participated in European mobility.5. To improve the skills of coaches in the female game and increase participation in women\u2019s football in Northern Ireland and to enhance employment prospects of coaches employed in women\u2019s football.The receiving partners in Portugal and Spain, have all been selected on the basis of them being internationally recognised Centres of Excellence in their own particular area of expertise. Portugal and Spain are renowned as countries which have championed the development and expansion of men\u2019s and women\u2019s football at all levels. Spain have been recent World Champions and the national coaching expertise and player development programmes in men\u2019s, women\u2019s and disability football are unparalleled in world football. Spain and Portugal excelled in the field of youth development coaching, with strong vertical links between professional clubs and community player development programmes. This mobility project will lead to a new way of strategic thinking for the participating mobility coaches on their return to Northern Ireland. The innovative coaching skills and competences derived from the mobility experience will become apparent on the professional and personal levels where they will see that planned methodical research must replace chance development in their teaching as they strive to help build world class coaching programmes and elite player development pathways. It is this area between schools, the grassroots/community coaching framework and the professional clubs where the real benefits of European innovation will be applied by the returning mobility participants to maximum effect and where most progress will be made.

The Clubs strategy is three fold. They aim to promote participation in grassroots' football at the very lowest level, identify and train youth players to give them every opportunity of getting signed by a professional Club in England /Scotland, and for those that don't they provide the opportunity of professional first team football at the highest level within Northern Ireland's domestic league. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecognising the high drop out rates particularly between 17-19 year olds LFC have identified the need to provide an opportunity for players at this vulnerable age, at which disadvantaged youths, disillusioned with high rates of unemployment, all too often resort to anti social behaviour; to continue in the game and see an introduction to coaching as an excellent vehicle for them to do so. Availing of a European mobility abroad would enable these beginner coaches to take the first step on the coaching ladder which in conjunction with undertaking a recognised qualification would enhance knowledge, skills and employability. The participants would be able to 'give something back' to the community by continuing grassroots coaching in their Club and local areas and enable LFC to benefit from the learning practices abroad to enhance their competitive advantage in the Northern Ireland domestic league. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partner organisation has been selected as being an international centre of Excellence within Portugal which is 4th in the FIFA World rankings and as such was deemed to optimise both the learning opportunities of the coaches and give maximum credibility to the mobility whereby the coaches from Northern Ireland would be able to observe best practice from a leading football nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities during the mobility will comprise a match at Browns between Northern Ireland and Portuguese participants which will be used to access and benchmark the level of development between the competing players and facilitate discussions between both teams' coaches as to match tactics and technical training.

For this segment of the young population they consider the necessity of training focused on their specified difficulty, which in a year increases their employability and makes possible subsequent rapid entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\nFor the achievement of these objectives, the ALEF will work with 4 intermediary partners (EUROYOUTH (Lisbon, PT), AMADEUS (Vienna, AT), INTERN EUROPE (Belfast, UK), EPPAS (Prague, CZ), which will support the development of the activities of ODISEO 2015 during the stays of the participants abroad.

The key objective is to innovate curricula by strengthening the system of pre-school teaching/learning with the implementation of a training plan addressed to the school staff. The other key objective is the creation of meta-cognitive intervention model (MEET APP and Guidelines) aimed to strength skills for lifelong learning in early childhood.

MEET APP (02 output) is a free download APP, with an easy and comfortable approach to be used by each self. The tool will be addressed to the LIM (digital whiteboard), already existing at schools, and to the MOBILE devices at home, in order to reach also families and parents (on Smartphones and tablets- Play Store and ITunes compatible) interested in using the methodology, materials and plays.  MEET is based on the concept of Disabilities for Ability where experiences and good practices enhance skills and competences in contexts of disability and special educational needs, for an inclusive and interactive integration. It strengths the pedagogical contexts of teaching/learning; and it enhances skills for lifelong learning minimizing the potential risk factor for dysfunctional in the school experience with a focus on SEN (Special Educational Needs) and disabilities. This proposal wants to develop an innovative model adopting a holistic approach for teaching in early age (0-5). It has a children approach focused on life skills, promoting their expression and fostering their own approaches to learning and working. This approach helps children to be prepared for the next learning and schools stages, and it can be a preventive approach for their future growth. MEET provides children with the best start for the world of tomorrow, as ECEC policy recommends, thinking about competences beyond schools. The project, through a pilot action, at the end and after the project end (ensured by the protocol signed), involves 3 schools/early childhood centres, 60 teachers/professionals in ECEC, 90 families and 90 children. The project is based on the recent EU reflections about ECEC systems, whose relevance and priority is emphasized by the EU documents and national local policies, but also reflects the suggestions of National Ministries regarding the construction of stronger ECEC school curricula in partner Countries. The most recent and significant European contribution is the final speech of the EU Council on Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (Brussels,19-20/05/2011) and the discourse of the EU Presidency during the Conference on Excellence and Equity in ECEC (Budapest, 21-22/02/2011), underlined the need of a school to offer a strong starter education and to boost skills for job and well being. Additionally, constitutional charters of the partner Countries as well as the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, express the importance of education and the role of the school as a place where it must raise social equality, equal opportunities, removal of economic and social obstacles promoting the equality of citizens and the ability to become an active participant in personal growth as well as of the own country.The consortium, involving 4 partners in 4 EU countries, is representative of a wide spectrum of Countries and of skills thanks to the involvement of important and articulated professional profiles.

Growth in electricity from renewable sources is stalling due to intermittency, grid restrictions, curtailment, and high costs. Sustainable energy to supply the transport sector and heating demand are even further underexploited. GENCOMM will address these issues by developing a sustainable, renewable community-scaled, hydrogen (H2)-based, energy model based on the results of 3 pilot plants that will use local renewable sources to supply electricity, heating and transportation fuels.\nThe project will begin by addressing the communities, mainly remote, around the pilot facilities in the Western Isles (Scotland), Saar-Lor-Lux region (Germany, France, and Luxembourg), and County Antrim(, to then continue to expand throughout NWE region.\nGENCOMM aims to reverse the current situation in which communities meet 75-80% of their energy needs from non-renewable sources. The proposed model will allow renewable generated energy to: [1] be dispatchable [2] meet heating demand and [3] supply transportation fuels. Therefore, through the model, communities will be able to develop autonomous, secure and sustainable energy matrixes.\nThe main output of the project is an H2-based energy model.

As part of our school development planning for 2012-15 we identified as high priorities pupil language and literacy levels, teaching practices and methodologies in the classroom and the development of staff capacity in these areas.  \r\n\r\nLanguage acquisition and the development of literacy skills occur in every subject on the curriculum of Col\u00e1iste Feirste.  Each subject area has an action plan to integrate language learning with content learning.  This happens naturally in the context of immersion education but it is the experience of Col\u00e1iste Feirste that it also must be planned for specifically in each subject through a variety of learning strategies and opportunities.  As Col\u00e1iste Feirste is the only stand-alone post-primary school teaching through full IM immersion in the north of Ireland, there is a lack of understanding and expertise in this area and much of the staff capacity and teaching methods have been developed without external support.  We have recently formed a relationship with the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) in the south of Ireland in relation to language planning through content in subject areas. We intend to organise further workshops and planning days with PDST on this issue.  In addition St Mary\u2019s University College, a local third level institution, have developed a Masters course in Irish-medium immersion education for teachers in post-primary IM.  Some of our teachers are pursuing this course.  We hope that this will generate further professional discussion and expertise.  One aspect of this MA course is Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and we would like to use this strategy as part of our Literacy Development Plan.\r\n\r\nIn 2013/14 we are looking at language development planning within subjects and are sharing practice both within the school and with colleagues in the south of Ireland.  This plan is at an early stage but we intend to focus on language planning in several subjects in 2014/15 in order to implement the learning points from this year\u2019s work.  We will then monitor, evaluate and review the impact of the plan on pupils\u2019 learning and language development.  In 2015/16 we will then plan for a focus on language development in other subjects.  We believe that the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) will be an important element in our overall development plan for effective language learning through the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nAs part of our school development plan, and as a result of the lack of experience, expertise and understanding of Irish-medium immersion education at post-primary level at a regional level, we would like to access such experience and expertise of language learning in immersion and bilingual contexts at a European level.  We believe that the first step in this plan is for 4 teachers to attend the Playing CLIL training course from 26th October to 1st November 2014 in Gran Canaria.  We intend that these teachers will enhance their understanding of how CLIL works, network with and learn from other teachers working in bilingual contexts and develop resources and activities to be used in Col\u00e1iste Feirste.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nThe competences and experiences acquired by these teachers will be integrated into our overall school development plan for developing pupils\u2019 language and literacy skills in Irish through teaching the subject content in the full curriculum.  They will practise the resources and activities with pupils in their own subject area, they will gather evidence and evaluate the impact on pupil learning and they will share their conclusions with the whole teaching staff.  We will then review the project with staff and adapt our school development plan in this area accordingly for Year 2 of the project.  This may also entail other staff accessing European mobility and cooperation activities.\r\n\r\nThe longterm benefits to the school will be increased staff capacity to take forward our school development plan on language and literacy, the sharing and further improvement of practice in the classroom and the increased language skills of pupils to access the curriculum.
