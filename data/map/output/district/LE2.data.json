We are here to help children get ready for their futures, and we need them to be curious flexible learners, who are able to face change and challenge with resilience and courage in our global world. This is supported by developing learning dispositions and a growth mind set. The creative curriculum, assessment for learning, a huge emphasis on wellbeing and regular professional development impacts on standards being above national averages. However, as part of the school\u2019s journey it needs to build on this further through high quality development globally, raising staff expertise and skills within a European context. \r\n\r\nAt Brocks Hill School we are planning to use this project as a start to develop international activities and global learning through building on and widening staff pedagogy, such as through looking at the Finnish Education system and wellbeing in Spain and Italy (both of which are two key areas for the school development plan). The project is also the start of developing a more global curriculum. We are involved in some international work such as supporting a child in Ghana but do not have direct European partnerships. We have also just become part of a  GLP network  to support out work to intergrate a more global element to our creative curriculum which will inspire and engage pupils and improve outcomes for the whole child. We strongly believe that as part of our school development engaging in global learning with schools and education in Europe and enhancing our curriculum will enhance pupils SMSC, curiosity, global awareness and independent learning which strengthens the schools vision, values and ethos further.\r\nTherefore, the main aims of the project are:\r\n\u2022 To improve teaching and learning through quality professional development and internationalisation \u2013 improving staff expertise (teaching and learning support staff)\r\n\u2022 To enhance the schools creative curriculum further through developing more global links, such as sustainability\r\nTo develop leadership skills and expertise of staff within a European context and learn from first hand experience in other colleagues practice in Europe  and develop sustainable partnerships\r\nTo achieve the aims staff professional development is essential to reflect on and evaluate policy, practice and methods /strategies used in European contexts to develop further high quality teaching and learning experiences which develop the whole child.

An accompanying person will also stay with the group for the first 5 days of the mobility to help with the settling in and adjustment period.\r\n \r\nPrior to the mobility, students will be supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of Learning Outcomes, which will be shaped by the job description that they have been given by their placement. These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  They will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with the participants to chart their progress and they will sign off the participants' Learning Agreement at the end of the mobility when Learning Outcomes have been achieved. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal development that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the learners will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the European labour market and a set of transferable skills that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment and an international outlook. \r\nIn the short term, this will be evident through the successful completion of Learning Outcomes. We also plan to monitor and evaluate the impact of the mobility of the longer term by looking at participants future career pathways and how the mobility has supported their progression to employment. \r\nThe anticipated impact for participating organisations is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk", "Leicester College", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012289_coordinator"], [2017, "Erasmus Backpackers", "Leicester College", 68900.0, 2, 4, "Our consortium is composed of 5 vocational \u201ccolleges\u201d located in and around Mulhouse in the Alsace region. The \u201cLyc\u00e9e Professionnel du Rebberg\u201d, the \u201cLyc\u00e9e Professionnel/ CFA F.D.

We have a top priority: gaining an international and European exposure. Some of us have sent students and apprentices abroad for a couple of years and managed to build a reliable network of workplaces and strong partnerships (UK, Finland, Spain, Germany). Experienced and willing to make mobility accessible to a greater number of students, we want to encourage the expansion of the other members thanks to our network thus allowing more young people from modest backgrounds to go on work experience placements.\r\nOur mobility actions are aimed at vocational baccalaureate students and apprentices in Commerce, Customer Services, Sales, Logistics and vocational baccalaureate students in Business & Administration, Beauty & Care, Clothing Design and Metal Work. All the students are part of our European classes. They wish to gain professional and cultural skills in a foreign environment and raise their language level. Mobility experiences are real life experiences and assets to complete their training, adapt to the demands of the labour market and continue their studies.\r\nWe have planned to send 90 students and 30 apprentices, aged 17 to 20, over the next two years. We will send different groups of selected students together according to their lines and types of training. The baccalaureate students will stay for 4 weeks whereas the apprentices for 2 weeks owing to the legal obligations binding them to their employers in France. We will inform, advise and prepare them to live a comfortable work experience abroad. Our challenge will be to mix and gather the different types of students during linguistic, cultural and professional preparation sessions by pooling the teaching staff of our colleges (teachers, language assistants and civic service voluntary workers). Our aim is to create a feeling of cohesion and help each young learner fit actively in the \u201cCitoyen d\u2019Europe\u201d path we will especially set up for them.\r\nOur students will be placed either in companies or benefit from adapted professional stays within the frame of our partnerships. The teachers will organise and coordinate the students\u2019 stays by keeping close contacts with their tutors and the college partners. They will also accompany them on their trips and will pay on-the-spot visits to assess the students\u2019 progress along with their different partners. We will use and complete both national evaluation documents (official grids based on vocational baccalaureate frameworks) and the Europass assessment forms to validate the different skills acquired. The students will be encouraged to take specific oral examinations to highlight their personal, linguistic and professional involvement (baccalaureate with the \u201cEuropean Section\u201d distinction or EuroMobipro). They will be honoured for their progress and their exemplary attitude at graduation ceremonies. \r\nWe have also planned 8 professional stays for our teaching and management staff. Their impact on teaching practices is an added value for our initial training schemes within our respective colleges.\r\nThe steering committee of our consortium will ensure the quality of our mobility actions throughout the stages of the project (organisation, financial management, intermediary and final reports). The members will draw specific attention to analysing our results, measuring the impact of the project on the students trained in their area. They will also support the partnerships to strengthen our European identity.\r\nAbove all, we are willing to act on a human level. Thanks to our project and the activities planned, we want to show our students and apprentices that they are able to succeed. The vocational route within our educational system can also contribute to the personal and professional development of these young adults.", "http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036810_2"], [2015, "Sustainable Tourism and Sports Work Placement", "Leicester College", 57556.0, 2, 2, "Leicester College is one of the largest public further education colleges in the United Kingdom, with a student body of approximately 27400, offering a comprehensive range of technical, vocational and higher education qualifications across a broad range of programme areas from entry-level up to bachelor's degree level.\r\n\r\nLeicester College is committed to enriching the lives of all members of our community and to creating new opportunities for them.  This is reflected in our Mission Statement: \"To deliver a wide range of high quality learning experiences to support the diverse communities we serve and the personal, social and economic development of individuals and enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nThis project will provide 4 cohorts of 15 of Level 3 Diploma students and Higher National Certificate / Diploma students in our Travel and Tourism and Sports and Fitness Departments with a two-week work placement located in Tenerife, Spanish Canary Islands for 16-18 days at a time over a 24 month period during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years.  The work placements will provide these students with practical experience and increased work-based skills and knowledge that are fundamental to their programmes of study.  The work placements will be part of their mandatory coursework and will be 'for credit'.  The work placements will also provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training that is unavailable to students in Leicester but readily accessible in Tenerife.  \r\n\r\nEach cohort will travel to Tenerife with  accompanying staff who will participate in the induction and orientation processes and the finalisation of Learning Agreements.  The timing of each cohort's mobilisation will be agreed by Leicester College and the host partner organisations,  taking account of the availability of students due to exams and UK holidays, the needs of partner organisations, their capacity to host and other issues that may affect the preferred timing.  One cohort is expected to travel each semester.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and will receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, our students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study at Leicester College, and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that would be unavailable to them in Leicester.  Many of our students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and, generally, opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.  The project will add value to their Leicester College programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally.\r\n \r\nThe longer-term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining technical / work-based skills and knowledge, the students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.    It is hoped that participants will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the labour market in another European country, and a set of transferable skills and an international outlook that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will aim to enhance the attractiveness of Leicester College to prospective Travel and Tourism and Sports and Fitness students and develop its reputation as a provider of high-quality education, complemented by enhanced complementary learning opportunities through international work placements.  Through participation in the mobility project, Leicester College will have the opportunity to develop long-term relationships with the host organisations in Spain, with whom it can work closely to develop closer ties and possibly expand the fields in which mobility opportunities are offered. \r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level, this will provide young people with an enhanced training programme, providing them with experience they could never gain in local work placements, and thereby a better chance of attaining employment in the sector.  It supports local and regional drives to reduce youth unemployment, and build the confidence and capacity of young people. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact for participating host partners is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk", "Leicester College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012771_coordinator"]]}}, "7TR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Enhancement of AASE in Rugby via EU mobility", "Leicester Football Club PLC", 59557.0, 2, 2, "The mobility will be effectively planned, organised, monitored and evaluated by the mobility management team to ensure that the key learning outcomes as detailed above have been achieved. Key to the evaluation process will be reports from the participants which will benchmark what learning objectives have been achieved and which will be compared and contrasted against the participants' intended outcomes prior to the commencement of the mobility, utilising questionnaires received post selection for the programme. Tables will be prepared to analyse the relative % success rates against each specific outcome. In addition all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. \r\n\r\nThe programme will be targeted at benefiting participants who are disadvantaged in the labour market which by virtue of the competitiveness of professional rugby union the learners inevitably are. Often players come from socially deprived areas, have learning difficulties and have limited interest or ability in academic education. Each participant will benefit from improved employability, enhanced career progression and greater job security following the mobility. \r\n\r\nA key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved employability and so LT will track participants' employment history for a period of three years, updated annually following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition LT 's team's performance will similarly be measured annually for a period of 3 years following the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe Project Manager, Ged Glynn, Head of Rubgy Operations, will be key to the evaluation process. Knowing the candidates personally and being on the mobility he will be able to provide a balanced judgment in relation to individual benefits and enhanced learning for each participant. \r\n\r\nFollowing the mobility both participants and the partner organisations will be required to produce a final report identifying project outcomes and areas for improvement of future mobilities, critically assessing skills acquisition, language training and cultural integration.\r\n\r\nAll parties' contributions will be correlated in an overall report evaluating the merits of the project in relation to the learning objectives and outcomes, as well as identifying areas for improvement for subsequent coaching study visits within the EU.
