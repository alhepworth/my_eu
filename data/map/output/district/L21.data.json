It also monitors the objectives of international cooperation and the development of communication skills in foreign languages. The main substantive content of the project focuses on national parks. It has the ambition to compare the way of nature protection in national parks in the Czech Republic and the UK  - the  Czech Giant Mountains National Park (KRNAP), which lies near Trutnov and the region of Snowdonia in the UK which is also a  UNESCO Biosphere Reserve site  like KRNAP. What is more, the park is also easily reached from Liverpool, which is the seat of the partner school.  During the project  we want to follow the next four areas of interest:\r\n1. The national park nearby \u2013 its characteristics, history, geological and geographical conditions, the way of nature protection.\r\n2. Coexistence of man and nature in the national park or a  biosphere reservation. Searching a compromise between environmental protection and conditions for people\u00b4s lives. \r\n3. Protected species of flora and fauna in the compared parks, the incidence of endemic and other unique phenomena.\r\n4. The ecological footprint of our school. Characteristics of the environmental operations of my school. Comparing the situation in both schools. Modern building versus 90-year-old building. \r\nIndividual tasks will be implemented on the Liverpool side by  the four-member teams, on the Czech side by five-member teams. The teams on the Czech side  are wider, because except obtaining relevant information , the Czech teams are going to  process outputs from work in English. During the project we plan to carry out two international work meetings of teachers involved into the project. The first one in October 2017 in the UK, another one at the beginning of 2019 in the Czech Republic. The working meetings will be held for planning the activities of the first and second half of the project and the organization of exchanges. Following the launch of the project, pupils will communicate electronically and using the eTwinning platform. The students will work in groups, collect and exchange information from different areas of interest and prepare PPT presentations. During the project two short trips of the involved students will be conducted. In October 2018 a visit of Czech students in the UK and in September or October 2019 a  visit of English students in the Czech Republic . During the exchanges, the two groups will  work together on further fulfillment of the tasks of the project and finalize the outputs. During their stay, the two groups under the program will visit the monitored national parks and work practically and directly in the field.  \r\nThe main common outputs are:\r\n1. PPT presentations introduced within a student conference made during a Czech visit in Liverpool in October 2018.\r\n2. Processing of photos and other documents for a joint exhibition presenting and comparing selected national parks in the Czech Republic and Great Britain. The exhibition will be installed in both partner schools with public access granted. \r\n3. Processing of a series of information panels in two languages with the results of the project. The panels will be placed in both partner schools for at least five years. \r\n4. Bilingual paper jigsaw puzzle with the outputs of the project intended for the public. It will be available in schools and information centres of the two selected national parks. \r\n5. Wall calendar with the outputs of the project.\r\n6. Web presentation of the project on both schools and a separate public page on the selected social network, where outputs of the project will also be available.\r\nThe target group in the realization of the project are pupils and teachers of both participating schools. During the realization of the project they will process a particular topic that will focus on biology and environmental education. The area appears to be very important in terms of education and sustainability. During the implementation there will be continuous and long-term cooperation using ICT. The cooperation will culminate in two common partner stays, during which cooperation on the professional aspects of the project will be closer and more contact. Due to the fact that the project is international, processing special subject is not the only objective of this, but also the development of communication, language and presentation skills. Studying a foreign language and the motivation for it, are closely associated with exploring cultural studies, history, culture and social conditions in the country. These factors can, of course, be best assessed during mutual visits and stays. All the more, if  that accommodation for children is provided  in in families. In terms of quality processing of the chosen special subject of cooperation we consider it necessary to carry out trips abroad during  the project ,  also because of the the authenticity of acquired materials.", "http://www.litherland-high.sefton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CZ01-KA219-035520_1"], [2018, "LANGUAGES LITERACY AND LINGUISTICS", "Litherland High School", 30243.0, 1, 1, "Litherland High School is part of a multi- academy trust. After becoming an academy in 2015, we are in a trust organisation with three further primary schools and three further secondary schools.  This now provides us with the scope to take a languages leadership role across seven schools\r\n\r\nWe strive to provide every student with the best education possible, regardless of their individual need. This was proven in the school\u2019s recent award of the specialist inclusion mark. \r\n\r\nInclusion is key to all aspects of Litherland High School, as is further reiterated in the school\u2019s motto of \u201cTogether in the Business of Learning.\u201d\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming an academy, Litherland High School was a specialist language school and languages have always taken a high priority in our school. As a result of this, all pupils study Spanish, with French and/ or Chinese being available as an option to students.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will enable MFL staff to become fluent and practice their language to disseminate this knowledge to the pupils in their care. For other curriculum staff, this experience will allow them to view the teaching of grammar and languages in other teaching areas. Hopefully, this will allow staff to enhance their classroom practice in the teaching of literacy.\r\n\r\nWe would like to involve 14 members of staff from the MFL department and representatives from a range of other departments. We would also like to include a senior manager in one of the visits in order to promote a long-term strategic impact on the whole school.\r\n\r\nWe will create continuity and sustainability through offering training to new members of staff so that they are able to take over the teaching of languages, continue to provide support across other departments in our school who wish to increase the European dimension, and continue supporting local primary schools. \r\n\r\nUpskilling MFL teachers in their second or third language will increase flexibility within our department and mean that we are better able to manage the timetable and offer more choice to pupils. It will also mean that there is consistency in the CPD offered to all staff. As part of the previous project, participants developed materials for new staff based on what they learned on the course. These have been very useful for new staff, but they will gain much greater benefits from participation in immersion courses. They will continue to add to these resources.\r\n\r\nStaff from different departments will work closely together to achieve  project aims. Participants will have the opportunity to increase their own management competence through working together to steer the project and disseminating outcomes to the rest of their departments.\r\n\r\nOur previous participants will play a key role in supporting the preparation of our new participants.\r\n\r\nOur plans involve training courses each in Spain, France, Germany and Italy; a total of 14 mobilities. These training courses include language learning, cultural immersion, methodology and pedagogy input opportunities for professional discussion and the formation of professional networks and visit to a school in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe participants represent different departments within our school, including MFL and literacy. The training courses will include language learning, intercultural understanding and internationalism, methodology pedagogy, teaching ideas and resources, professional discussion of issues relating to the teaching of languages in schools and a visit to a school in Europe school where they will be able to observe best practice and build links with colleagues.\r\n\r\nWe will share out learning with the three other secondary schools and three primary schools in our Trust\r\n\r\nOur project will link to our school development plan, and where possible, we will use our school\u2019s performance measurement systems to help us to assess whether, and to what extent, our project has reached its objectives and results. These will help us to understand the achievements of our project in relation to our pupils achievements in languages and whether they opt to continue languages to AS and A2.\r\n\r\nOur staff professional development system will be used to understand what impact our project has on our staff confidence and competence in language teaching. We will supplement these with lesson observations and surveys of staff views at the beginning and end of the project.", "http://www.litherland-high.sefton.sch.uk", "Litherland High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047125_coordinator"], [2014, "Building on success", "Litherland High School", 20320.0, 1, 1, "Our project is focused on enhancing the International dimensional across the curriculum. \r\n\r\nWe need to incorporate more international activities and cultural awareness into every aspect of our curriculum and school life. We need to improve the language skills of staff in our MFL department so that everyone can teach a second or third language. We also want to improve practice in school through observation of other countries and the sharing of good practice within the MFL department and in other curriculum areas. \r\n\r\nWe are keen to establish joint projects between schools in the UK, Spain and France across all curriculum areas. We would like to have the opportunity to see how literacy is embedded throughout the curriculum in other countries. \r\n\r\nOur school is focused on improving the attainment of young people with low basic skills and we are keen to improve outcomes in English and maths .\r\n\r\nAnother of our whole school aims is to have more community involvement in school life. We would like to see how other schools involve the whole community. We also want to form long-lasting partnerships with students and colleagues in Spain and France. We need to improve the number of our students going on to further education and cut our rates of early school leaving. We also want to increase our involvement and contact with our feeder primary schools and find strategies for successful transition.\r\n\r\nOur activity plan involves 8 members of staff from across the school taking part in training courses in Spain and France including language learning, cultural immersion, methodology and pedagogy input opportunities for professional discussion and the formation of professional networks and placement in a school in Spain/France. We would like to send members of staff from the MFL department and also representatives from the literacy and maths departments. \r\n\r\nThe results of the project will include a more highly skilled staff with an improved professional profile, more choice of languages available across the school, better results in literacy, more cooperation across departments, increased to communication with native speakers and more joint projects. This will increase our children\u2019s attainment within languages and their understanding of other cultures. It will also increase their motivation and enjoyment of the subject and encourage them to continue with languages leading to greater uptake.\r\n\r\nThe impact of new ideas and fresh ways of teaching will also be felt in other departments outside of languages. This will result in a general increase in motivation and attainment. A long-term impact of this will be that more children stay in education the longer and go on to further education. We would also like to see more of our children choosing careers involving languages. \r\n\r\nThere will be more involvement of parents and the local community in school, bringing greater cultural awareness and openness to the community and increased contact with our primary schools which will improve transition. We hope that this project will also impact on our link schools in Spain and France.

They demonstrate proper cultural and experiential background and, will have their career progression in this Institute and also have good language skills.They have shown keen interest in the European dimension and a constant attitude to inclusive and innovative practices in teaching methodology. They're aware of the potential of the area and of the Institute and are interested in promoting their development.The project proposed five main goals that meet the same compelling needs:1) UPDATE ICT. Our Comprehensive Institute, located in an area just as interesting scenically and culturally, as disadvantaged by distance fand isolated, aims to train young and motivated teachers, to use new technologies in an effective way for teaching purposes. This is to enable pupils to open up to enlarged spaces and dimensions of wider European scope and enable them to acquire the technological skills, needed nowadays. The project therefore aims to bridge the methodological gap, caused by years of obsolite equipment consequently delay in teachers' updating. The AD and other key players, already with good ICT competencies,will be trained to subsequently extend the training to all the other teachers, strengthening the actions of PNSD.We intend to participate in a Training Course on ICT in Britain and start a Job Shadowing activity with the Belgian and english schools, particularly equipped and competent in integrating ICT in instructional strategies 2) METHODOLOGICAL UPDATE. The Teaching Staff is next to a substantial renovation. Students require a more active and experiential approach, which enables them to acquire skills in addition to knowledge. So, we want to form, to the use of effective, cooperative and active teaching methods, a group of teachers who will constitute,  in the coming years, a valuable support for the whole Institute. These methodologies will also aims to support the curricular learnings  and encourage interaction and inclusion, especially of pupils with Special needs or Learning Difficulties, present in the Institute.For this purpose teachers will be involved in both a 10-day Training Course, organized by an accredited institution in the Czech Republic, and in a Job Shadowing in English, Spanish and Finnish schools, that use active, inclusive and innovative.teaching methods 3) UPDATE COURSE  REGARDING THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES. The valley, which is home to the 5 brunches  of our Comprehensive Institute, has a significant environmental assets, of which pupils are not aware. Therefore, it is considered essential to acquire strategies to bring teachers and pupils to live their environment as a source of well-being and learning. This awareness will lead in future,  to a prospective vision of their environment, such as employment chance. In fact, the valley has a strong tourist vocation, to date however stifled by stereotypes, which hold back development.  Even in this case it was decided to start a \"dual track training\" that leads teachers to acquire greater environmental awareness and a relevant teaching methodology that is efficient and futuristic. Were then initiated both, Training Course in Iceland on \"Outdoor Learning\", and Job Shadowing activities  in Spain and Norway, schools that normally use this method, also to encourage, among students, the improvement of Problem Solving and Decision Making skills  .4) ENHANCEMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE. Transversal  goal to all areas mentioned above, is the strengthening of the English language, which will be achieved thanks to the attendance of the courses, all  taught in English language, to the  exchanging activities with colleagues (email / Skype ...) before, during and after the project and the Job Shadowing in each partner country5) OPENING THE EUROPEAN DIMENSION. The Institute, situated in a rather isolated location, needs opportunities to approach to wider perspective dimensions, to acquire European awareness and promoting it within the Institute and in the community.All activity will help to achieve this goal and ensure the progressive extension also in a long future termTransversely the project  will be driving and bring a general modernization of the methodological approach, a gradual evolution of professionalism and effective methodologies. Additionally, for  students, it will facilitate the achievement of clear  in curricular and personnel results.In the long term it is expected that Europe, interaction and innovation become the constant background of the Institute.", "http://www.lander-road.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023125_3"]]}}}}
