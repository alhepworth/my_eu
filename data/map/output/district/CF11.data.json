CEIP  teaches through the Native language of Catalan and some Spanish with again many children speaking three languages.    Both schools also focus on their native languages ,Catalan and Welsh, as core areas of the curriculum.  The importance of the transnational link focuses on this celebration of global citizenship, inclusion and encourages positive attitudes to diversity. This project focuses on the development of language and literacy skills through digital communication whilst supporting article 30 of the UN rights of a child:  The rights of children belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minority groups.       By looking at the way in which we as schools deliver Literacy and language skills to our learners who speak additional languages we would hope to share good practice and develop innovative ways of addressing possible underachievement for this group of learners.   Digital literacy is also an important part of being a global citizen and we aim to combine Literacy and digital skills throughout the project.  By using digital platforms we intend to provide a sustainable link between the schools. We intend to provide rich, real life experiences that enhance learning whilst in turn developing teaching and learning skills.  We want to encourage learners to nurture their language skills viewing them as an additional tool to learning and an important part of their global citizenship.        Following analysis of baseline data which will include pupil questionnaires, national outcome data and language assessments we will plan an action research project based on the current good practise and innovation.  This will include learning and teaching approaches, communication through arts and developing feedback and assessment techniques.  Our learners will participate in a Literacy link where they will peer assess written work from the partner school.

Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal.

Both are highly motivated & have a particular interest in & knowledge of ICT. Their infectious enthusiasm has inspired other teachers to engage with new technologies. Due their prior experience of delivering high quality training sessions & on-going technical support, we feel confident that they will be able to effectively cascade this newly acquired knowledge through to all of our staff & pupils. \r\nFE- Our long serving Headteacher (our former Early Years coordinator) will attend FE in Early Years course. She is the ideal candidate because of her experience in; establishing excellent relationships with parents & families, Foundation Phase practice & studying of Emilia Reggio. Our School Improvement Plan reflects the increase in disengaged parents & we have highlighted the need to rejuvenate our efforts to engage them. Engaging hard to reach parents has been proven to have a disproportionately positive effect on student learning & achievement & also combat several poverty & deprivation issues surrounding education. Therefore we will be appointing & investing in a Family Engagement Officer (FEO) who will accompany the Head on this course. We are hopeful that this visit will inspire our FEO as he/she begins this vitally important role for our school. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities:- 1. Our ICT Coordinator & E. Learning Leader are to attend a course on Emerging Technologies in Croatia focusing on i-pads, coding & programming. They will be shown how their effective teaching & learning can impact on raising the attainment of their pupils. This will enable our staff to network with IT experts from other European countries to improve their own ICT teaching. 2. Our Deputy Headteacher & newly appointed Family Liaison Officer are to attend a course on Family Engagement in Early Years, Reggio, Italy. Italy is a renowned centre of excellence for Early Years education & is known for it's ability to foster excellent, trusting & supportive relationships with parents & intergenerational family members. We will also be exploring a Reggio setting whilst in Italy to observe first-hand how they are able to successfully engage their parents in their child's learning process & reduce unauthorised absences.\r\n\r\nMethodology:- In Croatia; \"there are more teachers using ICT in more than 25% of lessons, above the EU average; student use of computers in class is above the EU mean & more students are in schools where teachers have spent between 1&3 days on ICT professional level.\" (Survey of Schools: ICT Education, 2012).

These CAs, which are often rare diseases, are a major cause of infant mortality, childhood morbidity and long-term disability. \nEUROCAT is an established European network of population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of CAs. EUROlinkCAT will use the EUROCAT infrastructure to support 21 EUROCAT registries in 13 European countries to link their CA data to mortality, hospital discharge, prescription and educational databases. Each registry will send standard aggregate tables and analysis results to a Central Results Repository (CRR) thus respecting data security issues surrounding sensitive data. The CRR will contain standardised summary data and analyses on an estimated 200,000 children with a CA born from 1995 to 2014 up to age 10, enabling hypotheses on their health and education to be investigated at an EU level. This enhanced information will allow optimisation of personalised care and treatment decisions for children with rare CAs. \nRegistries will be supported in using social media platforms to connect with families who live with CAs in their regions. A novel sustainable e-forum, \u201cConnectEpeople\u201d, will link these families with local, national and international registries and information resources. ConnectEpeople will involve these families in setting research priorities and ensuring a meaningful dissemination of results.\nFindings will provide evidence to inform national treatment guidelines, such as concerning screening programs, to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children and reduce health inequalities in Europe.

Unfortunately, although the importance of parents in sport is well known, support, and education for parents remains scarce. If parents provide children with incorrect information, inappropriate support, or insufficient guidance it can have extremely detrimental effects on their physical and psychological health. For example, inappropriate parental support has been associated with reduced levels of self-esteem, increased levels of anxiety and stress, as well as excessive physical training and injury. Thus, ensuring parents are well educated and informed about how best to support and guide their children in sport is critical to minimizing physical and psychology health risks. Recognising the need to better educate and support parents of young athletes, this project seeks to unite academics, organisations, and practitioners from across Europe who work in the field of youth sport, and have particular expertise in working with, supporting, or educating the parents of young athletes. By uniting these experts, this project will provide a platform from which we can share knowledge, identify best practice, and subsequently improve parent education to increase the positive influence of parents in sport and minimise health risks to athletes. The project will proceed in three stages: First, collaborative partners will meet to discuss issues regarding parental involvement in sport and key areas in which parents require further or better education. Next, partners will identify and document best practice regarding the education and support of parents in sport. Finally, production of educational materials for parents, coaches, and organisations to enhance parental involvement and reduce health risks.", "http://sport.wales", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_579595-EPP-1-2016-1-UK-SPO-SSCP_6"]]}}}}
