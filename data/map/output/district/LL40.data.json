They mainly comprise a mosaic of two Annex 1 Habitats Directive woodland habitats: \u2018Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles\u2019 and \u2018Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines\u2019. However, the conservation status of these two habitats is \u2018unfavourable-bad and declining\u2019 and \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019 at the Atlantic biogeographic level. The primary cause is invasion by non-native plant species, especially the shrub Rhododendron ponticum, which alters light and soil conditions, outcompetes native flora and suppresses regeneration. Among the other threats are over- or under-grazing, a lack of management, and atmospheric nitrogen pollution. The UK holds around 95% of the old sessile woods and 70% of the Tilio-Acerion forest habitats, and therefore has a particular responsibility to return these habitats to a \u2018favourable\u2019 conservation status.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6690", null, "life_2"], [1997, "Atlantic Oakwoods - Restoration of Atlantic Oakwoods", "Caledonian Partnership, Highland Birchwoods Ltd", 2765725.0, 1382863.0, "Moss and lichen-rich old oak woodlands are an Annex I habitat type restricted to Britain and Ireland where this is the climax 'temperate rainforest' community of Europe's Atlantic coast. In Britain it is restricted to sites in the west of the country, many of which have been subject to management - including forestry practices - which have degraded their nature conservation interest. Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.\n\nThe project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.\n\nAt each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken. Another important activity would be controlling grazing - particularly by sheep, deer and feral goats through a mixture of stock fencing - over 60 km - and deer culling. The effectiveness of the various measures was to be monitored and assessed and the results disseminated on a web-site.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=251", null, "life_28"]]}}, "2HZ": {"life": {"data": [[2016, "LIFE Welsh Raised Bogs - New LIFE for Welsh Raised Bogs", "Natural Resources Wales", 4452761.0, 3334137.0, "All active (Annex I Habitats Directive habitat code 7110*) and degraded (Annex I Habitats Directive habitat code 7120) raised bog habitats in the Natura 2000 network in Wales have unfavourable conservation status.
