We are passionate about inspiring and empowering people to participate more actively in creating healthy and resilient local communities. We aim for our work to help people live healthy and fulfilling lives, as well as increasing people\u2019s motivation to take care of the natural environment. \r\n\r\nMany of our funded educational activities are specifically tailored for mental health users and people with physical learning difficulties, often at the most isolated and vulnerable edge of the spectrum. We aim to equip adults with the necessary skills and key safety aspects to make independent choices, and to increase levels of confidence across all areas of life. In training alongside others, our learners increase their networks of support, reduced isolation through shared experiences and increase learning. Our work supports increased social inclusion of often disadvantaged and marginalised people.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen our work in ways that bring about the kinds of wider social benefits we aim for, we have identified a range of needs that relate to increasing the quality of our work and staff competences, as well as enabling us to extend and improve our curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe key areas of need are:\r\n1) Strengthening staff competence to work with diverse learners in a multicultural context. \r\n2) Strengthening staff competence to apply eco-psychological and eco-therapeutic approaches with learners from disadvantaged communities and groups. \r\n3) Increasing organisational capacity to run longer wilderness immersion courses. \r\n4) Broadening our curriculum to go beyond wellbeing and inclusion towards pro-environmental behaviour. \r\n\r\nIn terms of internationalisation, we recognise that strengthening our international networks and connections across EU countries can help us to meet these needs in important ways. Therefore, we want to build strong links enabling our staff access to training in Europe, especially as exemplified in the work of Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu and their Nature Based Practice and Learning Program.\r\n\r\nDuring 2018 we will send 19 members of staff, both junior and senior facilitators, on a series of structured training courses and teaching assignments.\r\n\r\nThese activities will enable us to further the professional development of our trainers and move the organisation along a pathway towards key strategic development goals.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the project are to meet the key needs listed 1 to 4 above. In addition we aim for these activities to enable staff to: experience and understand a plurality of pedagogical approaches, which will enhance their capacity to deliver innovative and high quality adult education in the field of nature connection; feel more confident and inspired in their work as educators; make valuable steps in their own professional development, so as to increase their future employability and economic security; gain significant experience of pan-European cooperation in the sharing of best practices and the development of innovative pedagogical approaches.\r\n\r\nWe envisage the Nature Connection for Social Inclusion and Pro-Environmental Action project to enable us to make some significant advances in terms of the quality and provision of nature-based education with diverse and disadvantaged learners. There will be an increase in our capacity to develop innovative and high quality work. Best practice in the design and delivery of nature-based education will be shared between European partners. Our trainers will work more effectively with multicultural learners, and in providing more transformative and immersive educational opportunities. Our ability to foster learner centred educational approaches will be significantly enhanced. We will be able to develop innovative curricula that promote pro-environmental behaviour. \r\n\r\nThe longer-term benefits include: Stronger links between nature-based educators across Europe; increased capacity within the sector in the UK; More innovative approaches to nature-based education which support disadvantaged groups; Nature-based educators being better equipped to work in a multicultural setting, thus supporting a more tolerant and pluralistic society; Learners being inspired and motivated in ways that support increasing civil society responses to the ecological crisis now facing us.", "http://www.circleofliferediscovery.com", "Circle of Life Rediscovery CIC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-035987_coordinator"]]}}, "6EL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2018", "Old Whyly", 351229.0, 9, 37, "\"TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2018\" -  \u201eTyroleans on the Road 2018\u201c\r\n\r\nThe project objective is to promote the transfer of Tyrolean students in vocational education and Tyrolean apprentices to European companies, offering them possibilities to gain work experience and to improve language skills.

For this purpose it is of major importance to think ahead of time and to develop a vision of this profession in future under consideration of megatrends, trends and innovations influencing this occupational profile in order to get ready for changes that are ahead of us. The FutureDRV project investigates this future of professional driving by taking a look into tasks and role of professional drivers and their qualification requirements in 2030 and beyond.FutureDRV understands the way towards a well qualified future workforce within professional driving as a joined effort that requires the engagement of different groups of stakeholders. It approaches not only a single set of competences or measures to be addressed/ undertaken by an individual stakeholder with its approach but takes this occupation as a whole into the focus. It, therefore, approaches the future of professional driving from different angles in order to address those aspects sufficiently and comprehensively:_It developes a FutureDRV PROFILE describing the professional driver and its future role and the related knowledge, skills and competences within the 4th industrial revolution. The FutureDRV profile aspires to become a major reference on future skill needs within professional driving within the upcoming 15 to 20 years._Exemplary FutureDRV LEARNING SOLUTIONS are developed that support the current workforce to keep up with the changing and increasing qualification requirements. Those learning solutions address learning outcomes new to the current workforce taking up trends within learning and adapting those to the characteristics of drivers. In this way flagship learning solutions are developed pointing the way towards the future of competence-building within this vocational field as part of lifelong learning._The FutureDRV RECOMMENDATIONS address different stakeholders such as employers and VET providers with suggestions how to prepare professional drivers for their future requirements. They identify actions to be taken in the context of individual EU Members States in order to take the characteristics of those systems into account. Finally they address the European level and here specifically Directive 2003/59/EC and its role within preparing professional drivers for the future._Finally, a FutureDRV TIMELINE makes trends and innovations and their interrelations with each other and with qualification requirements on drivers transparent, puts a time dimension to those upcoming changes and defines responsibilities and steps to be taken by different stakeholders. The timeline is therefore a key tool for policy making, VET and career planning and human resource development in the context of professional driving.All together the FutureDRV project results equip the transport sector with valuable tools and recommendations for the development of a professional driver workforce capable of meeting the future needs of the sector across Europe.", "http://transformotion.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA202-003242_4"], [2018, "Steer to Career DRV", "Transformotion Limited", 264756.0, 5, 5, "The road freight transport industry represents one of the most important sectors in Europe, providing millions of Europeans with fresh produce, bulk goods, liquids and other essentials every day. \r\nArguably the most important position within road freight transport is that of a professional driver, who often has responsibility for driving a truck, loading and unloading goods, liaising with customers, managing routes and schedules and maintaining safety standards. \r\nEstimates show that there\u2019s over one million truck drivers working in Europe today, and while it\u2019s fair to suggest that the public perception of a professional driver has been poor it continues to be a valued and important role that flies under the radar of many Europeans.  \r\nHowever, times are changing and quickly. The widely publicised testing and development of autonomous vehicles has demonstrated the speed at which technology will change the landscape of the labour market. The widespread introduction of this technology is likely to occur through the commercial road freight sector in the first instance, as it offers the most significant potential towards cost reduction and enhanced safety as well as overall improvement in factors such as air quality and fuel efficiency.  \r\nHowever, the consequence of introducing this technology will be the impact that it will have on the one million plus professional drivers within Europe. Forecasts suggest that by 2030 the majority of journeys made by a large goods vehicle will be fully automated, which leaves a question mark over the role of professional drivers in the truck of the near future, and at this stage it isn\u2019t clear about what part they will play in transporting goods. \r\n\r\nThe average age of a European professional truck driver also continues to rise year after year, which demonstrates an ongoing problem to attract new drivers into the industry. It also shows that the industry relies on the experience and skills of well-established and knowledgeable drivers. \r\nSo we know that the role of drivers will change significantly over the coming years, therefore it's important that transport businesses and professional drivers can be as prepared as possible. \r\n\r\nThe Steer to Career DRV project will focus on developing curricula and professional learning programmes to help companies prepare their professional drivers for a more diverse role within a company. These objectives will focus on areas that will become more important as we move into the age of vehicle autonomy and will include the principles of managing people, basic financial management, emergency responder, customer service and safety management.  \r\n\r\nThe project will also seek to develop two sets of guidance; one for managers / company owners and one for professional drivers. The guidance will focus on competences, attitude and social skills, with the aim of helping managers to deploy drivers to alternative positions within a company, and to help drivers recognise the competences they need in order to continue to be successful in their professional life.  \r\n\r\nIt is essential that this project is undertaken on a transnational scale because the potential problem is a universal one. Work will be done in conjunction with European and National Qualification Frameworks and will leverage systems such as ESCO (to identify potential career options) for research and development purposes. The experience and knowledge of the project partners will also be utilised where possible and as appropriate. \r\n\r\nIn order to successfully achieve the objectives of the project, Steer to CareerDRV will; \r\n\r\n\u2022 Engage, through interviews and questionnaires, a wide range of stakeholders on the development of the professional, personal and social skills of truck drivers \r\n\u2022 Undertake industry research to determine the most important and relevant competences \r\n\u2022 Use the information and output from the series of DRV projects (ProfDRV and ICT-DRV)\r\n\u2022 Develop a set of professional learning objectives based on management and communication\r\n\u2022 Produce guidance for managers and professional drivers \r\n\u2022 Promote the project through media and publication channels \r\n\u2022 Disseminate the guidance and findings industry-wide", "http://transformotion.co.uk", "Transformotion Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048259_coordinator"]]}}}}
