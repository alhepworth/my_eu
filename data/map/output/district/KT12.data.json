Data-intensive applications are among the most important and commonly encountered kinds of industrial application, and are increasingly important with the emergence of 'big data' problems. Emerging heterogeneous parallel architectures form ideal platforms to exploit the massive-scale inherent parallelism that is usually implicit in such applications, but which is often difficult to extract in practice. \nSolving this problem will bring major economic benefits to the software industry.\nTo address this challenge, RePhrase brings together a team of leading industrial and academic researchers, software engineers, systems developers, parallelism experts and domain experts from large companies, SMEs and leading universities. It aims to develop a novel software engineering methodology for developing complex, large-scale parallel data-intensive applications, supported by a very high-level programming model. We will exploit advanced pattern-based programming, refactoring, testing, debugging, verification and adaptive-scheduling technologies to build an interoperable tool-chain supporting our methodology, based on but significantly extending existing industrial and research tools. These tools will significantly ease, and even automate, all phases of typical software development, from design and implementation to long-term maintenance and software evolution. The generality of our approach will be ensured by targeting C\\\\ and the most popular low-level parallel programming models, such as the C\\\\11/14/17 standards, pthreads, OpenMP, Intel TBB, OpenCL and CUDA.

One of the four pre combustion CO2 capture technologies that are being developed in CACHET is the Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) process. The SEWGS process produces hot, high pressure H2 in a catalytic CO shift reactor with simultaneous adsorption of CO2 on a high temperature adsorbent. The system operates in a cyclic manner with steam for adsorbent regeneration.  The overall objective of proposed project CAESAR is the reduction of energy penalty and costs of the SEWGS CO2 capture process through optimization of sorbent materials, reactor- and process design. It is emphasized that with an optimized SEWGS process CO2 avoidance cost could be reduced to < \u20ac 15/ton CO2.    CAESAR takes into account the lessons learned in CACHET in order to bring the SEWGS process a big step closer to the market. To achieve this, CAESAR takes a necessary step back such that novel, more efficient CO2 sorbents with regeneration steam/CO2 ratios less 2 will be developed. This value is needed to bring the CO2 avoidance costs to about 15 \u20ac/ton. Heat integration and the use of sorbent coatings can further enhance the efficiency.    CAESAR will focus on the application of the optimized SEWGS process for pre combustion CO2 capture from natural gas. However the scope of application of SEWGS will be broadened to application in coal gas and industrial processes. A design for a pilot unit will be delivered for these applications.  There is a clear delimitation between CACHET and CAESAR. The emphasis in CACHET was placed on demonstrating the SEWGS process on a larger scale in a continuous, multi-bed SEWGS process demonstrator.

In addition their common language will improve. An intercultural training will prepare them for the stay and their intercultural competences will increase. The students will reflect  on their own self-concept and on other cultural orientations. Because of that prejurdices will decline. They will compare different paedagogic concepts with a focus on concepts of child-care welfare and different eduacation systems.\r\nThe vocational teachers (6 / per anno) will get to know the institutions and will have the chance to exchange experiences with the colleagues abroad about paedagogic concepts. The gained knowledge will be evaluated and will have a positive impact on the curriculum in the padagogic department. Other topics are the conditons, curricula and assessment of the placements and the cooperation in the future.\r\nThe hosting institutions hope to get some daily support, innvoative ideas from the students and a cooperative professional exchange of ideas from the German vocational teachers. \r\nEspecially the Goethe-Institut in Tallin is interested in teaching the German language.\r\nFor the future our partners hope to have an active interaction and exchange of students and a discussion about contents of curricula and paedagogc concepts which will all parts of the cooperation will sutainably benefit from.\r\nThe organizational part of the project will be done by an administration sectretary, because our teachers ill not have the time for that. \r\nIt is important for us that quality audits and management assessments will be undertaken annualy. In order to that the experiences will lead into a continous improvement process that supports the paedagogic work environment.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001869_4"]]}}}}
