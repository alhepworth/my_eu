At the same time, we must not overlook the financial aspect necessary to the achievement of societal objectives, which become important in the context of the resources made available by the institutions related to the community, such as municipalities. Indeed, by working together businesses can reduce costs, share risks and create new platforms for growth. Consortium co-operatives run on a shared and equal way by, and for the benefit of, their members. Members can be businesses, partnerships or individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt local and regional level, this project aim at providing a realistic, practical and effective answer to address a variety of current issues that exist also at EU level, such as the economical emergency, the unemployment rate, social cohesion, the digital agenda, rural and remote territorial development. At national and EU level, the project aim at providing a workable good practices considering the preparation of the targeted population in terms of competences, considering the recognition, transferability and accumulation of the entrepreneurial competences according to the ECVET framework in order to foster the mobility and improve the employability of the targeted group represented by citizens in remote or rural areas. Mobility indeed represents a key answer to the current low rate employment context at EU level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe target group addressed by the project in hand are citizens from rural or remote area, and most particularly the \u201cNot in Education, Employment, or Training\u201d (NEET) population.

Present practice is to convert the toxic metabolic waste product ammonia via nitrite to nitrate in a nitrifying bio-filter. This microbial process demands oxygen and reduces the pH, requiring expensive buffering treatment. The accumulating nitrate is generally flushed from the farm into recipient waters without pollutant removal. The DeammRecirc proposal is based on the recent experiences and success of using deammonification to convert ammonia to nitrogen gas in other waste water treatment applications. This method will in the proposed project be adapted for use in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) for fresh- and marine water species. By using a deammonification reactor within RAS, ammonia will be converted to nitrogen gas in one step. Deammonification bacteria enriched in granules will be adapted to RAS water qualities. The advances compared to current SoA include reduced oxygen use, reduced cost for buffering chemicals, lower carbon footprint, reduced levels of nitrate rich effluent released to the environment, reduced pumping cost and treatment need of new exchange water. The project includes 11 participants, of which four are industrial SMEPs, which will produce, develop and distribute the DeammRecirc system post project, one is a large enterprise end user, one participant is from S.

European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas. The biogas will be generated from the Biomass (aquaculture faeces and unused food waste) filtered out from the outlet of the tank through the use of an innovative micro-scale anaerobic digestion biogas generator.", 14715.0, 1151506.0, 4, 11, "OPTITEMPTANK", "http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=f3c287ef370241a9befb06b2d8103617", "http://www.selonda.co.uk", null, "fp7_94827_998165212"]]}}, "2RD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Eingliederung von Migranten in das Arbeitsleben innerhalb der EU", "South Cave Tractors", 29421.0, 7, 13, "The vocational training at the dual vocational college (Duales Berufskolleg) incorporates a job placement of several weeks or months.
