People, especially young people, are pushed to the margins of society in many ways: homelessness and street living; broken families; educational and employment underachievement; racial and cultural discrimination; falling into a cycle of economic and social dislocation from the mainstream. In an Erasmus+ programme, four organisations that work to combat this problem, particularly among young people, are seeking to join forces in a series of Conventions to look at sharing their knowledge in a very practical way in order to develop a shared body of learning about what can best be done to help, support, guide and nurture those in serious need. They are YMCA North Tyneside, Emfasis, YMCA na Slovensku and Sport Works (North).Crucially the project will be focussed on the views of young people, not the management of the organisations or professional workers. It is the young people who will do the work to think about how to reach out the people who need their help the most. Many of the young people have themselves come from a disrupted background, whether it be homelessness or other disadvantaged situations. Others have worked extensively with street people, volunteering to make a difference. Some have both received and then gone on to deliver help, as their lives become more positive and happier.Over two years180 young people will come together in a series of 60-strong three week-long conventions in Slovakia, Greece and the UK , in order to consider how to create a best practice and a shared wisdom about dealing with social exclusion. Each organisation will visit the others and see how they go about their work, and join in activities to focus on what they share as practitioners in this field, and what they can bring uniquely to the discussion from their own particular perspective. The partners anticipate some challenging, surprising and hopefully entertaining sessions. Activities include group sessions and workshops, observing and participating in practice, cultural activities, shared sporting and teambuilding activities, time for reflection, and social mixing.To produce a tangible outcome the participants will together create a website, including a history of the project and video diaries from the conventions, which it is hoped will be a toolkit for their own practice and for anyone working with socially excluded people. Alongside the website there will be various social media channels which it is hoped will create a virtual community of those concerned to do something practical about marginalisation.The project will produce a collective practice and wisdom which will add to the effectiveness of the partner organisations in dealing with social exclusion, and help others in the field. It will raise the profile of the hidden problem of marginalisation and the people working to mitigate its effects. In the longer term it is hoped that the project will help towards the creation of a culture where social exclusion is acknowledged and recognised, and there is a substantial drive to tackle its root causes.", "http://www.ymcanorthtyneside", "YMCA North Tyneside", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024958_coordinator"]]}}, "8HG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Mobile aujourd\u2019hui pour \u00eatre employable demain", "FuDa International Trading Co Ltd", 18472.0, 2, 11, "Sophie Germain high school is the promoter of the Erasmus+ project 2014-2015 and will give the opportunity to 12 motivated students, willing to live an unusual experience, to go to England as a trainee. They are students preparing a baccalaureate exam (High School Leaving Certificate) in administration & management, sales and trade.\r\nWe do have 18 work placement possibilities  and more (see appendix 2: letters of intent, appendix 3: list of partners) thanks to the relationships we developed  throughout the six previous Leonardo projects. However, we chose to give this opportunity only to 12 participants which gives us the possibility to have six extra safe work placements in case of problems. \r\nAfter several months of training (see appendix 1: work plan), the students will go to England in January & February 2015.  \r\nThey will do a work placement linked to their vocational training during four weeks in the area of Whitley Bay and Newcastle. \r\nStudents in administration & management will be welcomed in companies such as OXFAM, North Tyneside Council or Tynemet College or international companies such as  Fuda or Ferguson Transports. \r\nSales and trade students will get the opportunity to improve their skills in charity shops such as Age UK, Barnardos, British Heart Foundation, Red Cross,  and shops such as FE Maughan and Marks and Spencer, the new partner in this Erasmus+ project. \r\nOur students will individually stay at selected host families in order to encourage relationships and improve their English.   \r\nMrs Christine Goodwin, the manager of Northumbria school of English, will be in charge of selecting host families, providing linguistic support, and organising one cultural activity each weekend. She has been involved in our mobility projects for four years. \r\nOn Tuesday afternoons the participants will meet Whitley Bay High School students during tuitions where they will attend linguistic and cultural supports. Whitley Bay High School teachers all agree that French students show a real interest in the English language and culture.  This could lead them to be more open-minded and dynamic. Our participants mobility could also offer future prospects to English students who are not willing to leave their country. It will enable us to organise exchanges and encourage mobility in both countries. Our vocational high school is located in Thionville, in the core of \"La Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Luxemburg, France and Germany). This location makes this experience relevant. Indeed, mobility with these three countries is a characteristic of local employment markets with the increasing number of border workers. This new application aims at securing this need to get interested in other farther European countries. One of our school project priorities is the mobility development. Moreover getting involved in such a project enables to meet the demand of the objectives of our European sections.  \r\nSuch a project offers obvious and important benefits for our students. This mobility is a profitable experience, useful and enriching their professional career. Discovering a new culture and improving language skills will develop autonomy, responsability,  and self-fulfillment.  Besides, a one-month work placement for our students, in an English company, will encourage the awareness of  European citizenship. Indeed very few students are unaware of this concept because they are not used to travelling. The impact of mobility on our students will help them to pass their examination more easily and to get the \"European\" Mention plus the \"Europass Mobility Certificate\". Thus, thanks to an improved C.V., their job search or future studies should be faced with less anxiety.  \r\nConsequently, they will be more likely to work on the European or international market.  This Erasmus+ project will make our Sophie Germain high school, the Region Lorraine and the European Union more attractive and enhance their values and fame. \r\nWe will try and share our experience and activities with the press and media, which hopefully should raise interest in other students to join the programme. \r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the educational systems have to upgrade and fit into the new ways of teaching and learning.

AR technology appeared to represent a significant development in the context of image-guided surgery (IGS).\nThe quality of the AR experience affects the degree of acceptance among physicians and it depends on how well the virtual content is integrated into the real world spatially, photometrically and temporally. In this regard, wearable systems based on head-mounted displays (HMDs), offer the most ergonomic and easily translatable solution for many surgeries.\nMost of the AR HMDs fall into two categories according to the see-through paradigm they implement: video see-through (VST) and optical see-through (OST) HMDs. In OST systems, the user\u2019s direct view of the real world is augmented with the projection of virtual information into the user\u2019s line of sight. Differently, in VST systems the virtual content is merged with images captured by two external cameras anchored to the visor. With respect to technological and human-factor issues, both the approaches have their own strengths and shortcomings. In this project, we identified in a hybrid OST/VST HMD, a disruptive solution for improving surgical outcomes.\nThe application driven device will be developed from existing systems and exploiting the knowhow acquired within the consortium on photonics KET technologies. The resulting device will undergo three clinical trials whose results will be fundamental towards a straight industrial exploitation comprising economic viability analysis.\nVideo-Optical See Through AR surgical System (VOSTARS) will be the first hybrid see-through HMD surgical navigator.

We will compare how immigration effects students in different locations in Europe and how our students can help the integration of immigrants  into our cities; minimising discrimination, segregation and racism.  The outcome of the project will be to develop resources in a range of different media, that are available in at least 5 different European languages, and involve the experiences of external agencies. \r\nIn the current climate across Europe internationally we are seeing an increase in immigration especially with the refugee crisis.  As a group even small schools (Rask Molle) are welcoming refugees within their classrooms and are therefore having to develop skills and an awareness of how to interact and integrate students into their cultures whilst having an appreciation of their life style.  In preliminary discussions we discovered that different parts of Europe are responding in different ways to handle the  immigrants and the project will look to educate and evaluate our different approaches.  The next decade will only see an increase in immigration and there is a need to greater prepare schools and communites to faciliate the co existance of immigrants and local people: enabling immigrants to thrive within and complement the whole of Europe\r\n\"Immigration, there is no going back\"\r\nThrough the project we aim not only to look into the cultural differences but also to prepare our students to have a career in work places that are multicultural (due to migration) building a society with intercultural competency and without prejudice.  If this  project was not transnational we would  be unable to share our different experiences to increase our adaptability.  \r\nWe plan to meet 7 times over the project and work between each meeting will be to preapare our students to be able to contribute fully during the mobilities. \r\n \r\nMeeting 1\r\nA Transnational meeting where Erasmus + leaders plan in detail the full project  in Newcastle.\r\nMeeting 2\r\nA learning, teaching and traning activity meeting in H\u00f6velhof, Germany, to meet with sea watch volunteer, refugees and visit a refugee camp and further add to videos and paper resources.\r\nMeeting 3\r\nA learning, teaching and training activity meeting in Rask M\u00f8lle Denmark, to meet participants of Venligboerne and find out how to set up an aid organisation to further develop video resources.\r\nMeeting 4\r\nA transnational meeting where Erasmus+ leaders evaluate the project so far and plan the next step in the project.\r\nMeeting 5\r\nA learning, teaching and training activity meeting in Spain,where we will produce the films.\r\nMeeting 6\r\nA learning, teaching and training activity meeting in Iceland, to meet with Palestinian families and research how Iceland are dealing with immigration and further develop videos.\r\nMeeting 7\r\nA transnational meeting in Denmark, where we evaluate the project .\r\n \r\nOver the whole project we aim to have 100 mobilities but the project itself will reach out to all pupils in our schools as well as our local communities.  \r\nDue to the project individuals will show an increase in spoken and written English language ability for all countries (excluding UK citizens).\r\nPupils involved in the project will be able to work in international groups and will be able to have a greater awareness of immigration so will be more understanding and tolerant.   Pupils will be greater prepared for life after education and be ready to work with mixed nationalities and cultures which is more frequently occurring in our even increasing transient world.\r\nFor the long term benefits of the project, as the title refers to 'Immigration, there\u00b4s no going back', this project will not end but as political views and experiences change the project will continue to be developed and disseminated to our students.
