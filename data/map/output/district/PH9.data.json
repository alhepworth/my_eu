After several decades of recovery in the UK, the population is currently declining. While the reason for this is not fully understood, it is clear that illegal persecution associated with commercial shooting of red grouse (<i>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</i>) is a significant factor. The decline is particularly serious in northern England and southern and eastern Scotland, where the hen harrier is nearing extinction as a breeding species. Other factors that are likely to be impacting breeding success include inappropriate land management, human disturbance, and predation of eggs and young from nests. Recent analyses published by the UK government indicate that enough suitable habitat exists to support up to 2 650 pairs in the whole of the UK (compared to 630 pairs in 2010), suggesting that, in the long term, the potential for population growth in the absence of persecution is significant.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4935", "http://www.rspb.org.uk/henharrierlife/,", "life_145"]]}}}}
