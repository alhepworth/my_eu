In each region it brings together 2 secondary and 4 primary schools to work with the local authority and an additional expert partner. Half of the pilot schools in each region have been involved in previous transnational education activity, while half are inexperienced.The 16 project partners are collaborating to achieve the following objectives:\u2022 8 sustainable bilateral partnerships which include regular communication between staff and learners using a variety of media (including virtual methods, letters, phone calls and visits) and which strengthen the longstanding partnership between the two regions.\u2022 Transnational project management experience and capacity within all 16 organisations\u2022 Sharing of best practice on delivering education on Health, Sport, Nutrition and Wellbeing, as well as Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) and Information Communications Technology (ICT)\u2022 Sharing of resources among schools, local authorities and expert partners, particularly on topics surrounding health education, global citizenship, ICT and MFL.\u2022 Healthier participating organisations which are delivering more concrete activities related to the project topic and improved academic attainment of young people.\u2022 Provision of meaningful contexts for work on MFL (exchange work with counterparts in target language) and ICT (eTwinning, video-conferencing, blog, social media) which should motivate learning in these disciplines.\u2022 Widened perspectives of staff and learners through transnational work.\u2022 Understanding of own and others\u2019 identities, shared history and present, and place in Europe and the wider world.\u2022 Empowering of learners to lead activities and take responsibility for project delivery.\u2022 Increased confidence of staff and learners in a range of areas, particularly MFL, leadership, communication, teamwork, and international working.\u2022 Production of resources for use by schools more widely including digital content and a project DVD. This toolkit should support practitioners in all Sunderland/Saint-Nazaire schools to deliver transnational school projects (particularly with focus on MFL, Global Citizenship, Social inclusion and School achievement through healthy living styles).\u2022 Delivery of dissemination events to share project results and transnational project management experience and to support other organisations to consider future applications for transnational projects.\u2022 Promotion and publicity for European transnational project work.All partners bring significant experience to the project in different areas, and will be responsible for delivering content, as outlined in project partnership agreements. Additional partners will play a key role in developing content and activities and will use their expertise in the project theme to support schools to achieve the E-SCHOLAR objectives.Project partners will use a variety of methods to deliver this work, including:\u2022 virtual communication\u2022 joint project work\u2022 parallel activities, with preparation and results shared\u2022 events, including sports festivals organised by project partners\u2022 participation in initiatives including Journ\u00e9es sportives, Sport Relief, World Food Day\u2022 training (both within individual partner regions and jointly and offered by project partners and additional stakeholders)\u2022 meetings and workshops with relevant stakeholders\u2022 invitation to speakers to inform learning\u2022 dissemination events\u2022 production of multimedia toolkit including digital resources and DVD\u2022 regular press releases and social media content during E-SCHOLAR\u2019s term\u2022 systematic monitoring and evaluation of project activities throughout its lifetimeThey will also use travel to one another\u2019s regions to deliver other activities.

As areas become stressed due to water exploitation or environmental pressures, the amount of water resources available for use have been decreasing (World Meteorological Organisation, 1999) and Europe has not been able to avoid these pressures. It is crucial to protect and improve water consumption to provide a sustainable practice for economic development and to maintain human settlements. LOWTEV will bring considerable water savings to the food industry which is comprised of over 230,000 SME organisations. With an excellent consortium with experts in the fields of food science and sanitisation we will develop a low water pressure ultrasound device integrated with an automated rapid hygiene monitoring system. By providing an alternative system for cleaning in place technology on bulk handling equipment for food processors, a factory site would benefit from at least a 10% savings in overall water use. This equates to an estimated \u20ac30,000 worth of savings on water and energy bills per factory, providing a return on investment in under 1 year of installation. The food industry sector within Europe lag behind in terms of innovation and R &amp;D investment; this project will address the environmental issues to improve water resources and will also improve the competitiveness of the SME food processing and bulk handling communities. Through reducing the clean cycle times on conveyor equipment, this will realise more productivity within the food processing cycle by reducing the labour costs and times for cleaning.", null, 1257650.0, 5, 9, "LOWTEV", "http://lowtev.pera.com/", "http://www.challengerfoods.co.uk", null, "fp7_92643_998321091"]]}}}}
