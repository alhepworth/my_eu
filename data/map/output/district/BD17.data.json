We wish to build upon these strong links and our successful work experience over the next few years and build an even stronger partnership that can continue to benefit our students and the local community. \r\n\r\nReferring to the Europe 2020 strategy, we want to create an innovative project that delivers effective investments in education, research and innovation by creating an app to learn a foreign language at a young age. Applying the language skills of students in two schools, the aim is to teach a foreign language to younger children through the use of mobile technologies, which will not only encourage the primary pupils to keep learning a foreign language, which is crucial for their future job prospects but it will also motivate the secondary pupils to go on learning foreign languages too. It is envisaged that students engaged in this project will increase their job prospects through practice in different fields of work: teaching, programming, marketing, coding.  By increasing their career opportunities and inspiring them to make lifelong learning and mobility a reality, we will contribute to poverty reduction and  the reduction of early school leavers, something which is critical on a school, national and international level. \r\n\r\nWe will work together to enable our students to achieve the Foreign Language Leaders Award. This will be the certification gained for producing Apps and a website to teach languages and delivering these Apps in a Language Festival at both schools. Students will work with a professional App maker and web designer in each phase of the project in order to produce quality teaching materials that will be an innovative way to teach languages. The information and training gained from working with these professionals will be cascaded down to other students participating in the project over the following years in the project too. It is anticipated that the initial Apps are evaluated, modified and added to so that at the end of the three years there is a wealth of resources, created by our students, available to young language learners. In addition to creating the resources, the students will firstly market them to the local and wider community and then will teach primary school students a foreign language in an annual Language Festival, to be held in both Cuxhaven and Bradford. In addition to this, students will spend more time in primary schools so that more students can access the resources and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nThe project will directly involve 20 students from each school each year of the project These students will be from a variety of social backgrounds. We will try to encourage students from poorer backgrounds to participate in the project as they will get the opportunity to experience a new culture and language and also they will benefit from the acquisition of skills that will make them socially mobile and, potentially, raise their aspirations. We will also ensure that we provide opportunities for students with Special Educational Needs. The students will take on many responsibilities during the project such as maintaining the eTwinning Twinspace, market research , organisation of the Festivals and keeping stakeholders and press in the loop about project activities. \r\n\r\nWe expect the impact of our project to be significant and to continue to have such an impact for years after the end of the project through the dissemination of the apps and methodology and also through continuing with the Language Festivals once they have become an established part of our school routine. We will enhance the employability and ICT language skills of our students and teach our students to be responsible citizens, tolerant of other cultures. We will also impact upon younger learners by providing innovative language learning resources which will foster in them a thirst for language learning that should continue into their later studies. We will also impact upon the wider community by fostering positive relationships with local primary schools and businesses.", "http://www.titussaltschool.co.uk", "Titus Salt School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013509_coordinator"]]}}}}
