In order to remedy this problem the proposed project 'FIREPROOF' would develop a very universally applicable regulatory framework for maritime fire safety based on probabilistic models and numerical models of ignition, growth and impact of fires. The framework would be quite similar in principle to the well established probabilistic damage stability regulation. The methodology of the proposed fire safety regulation is summarized as follows:  The methodology would consist of a mathematical model that would generate instances of fire  scenarios according to the correct probability distribution of the elements of the scenario.  It would also consist of numerical models to assess the consequence of the scenarios so generated.  For any given ship - traditional or novel, a large number of scenarios would be generated  and their consequences assessed, and the results would be aggregated to give rise to fire risk  metrics.

A Guidance document for monitoring impact on students\r\n8. 5 academic publications that will report the findings internationally.\r\n9. 5 practitioners\u2019 publications that will report the findings internationally.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the project will have direct impact on the practices of the participating schools.  This will have longer term benefits both for teachers and for students. Teachers that take part will change their future practices and embed the idea of students\u2019 voices and lesson study in their practices.  Children\u2019s participation will be increased through the process of the project, especially for those students that are hard to reach, since they will be trained to take the role of researchers.   Overall, all students in the 30 participating schools, as well as in other organisations who will adopt the approaches via dissemination plans, will be empowered through such approaches and develop skills that are essential for active citizens, such as expressing their views more freely and having a say in decision-making. This will have longer term impacts in relation to the inclusion of all, but especially for those who are hard to reach.    The intention is that all of this will have a much wider impact on policy and practice across the EU.", "http://www.wordsworthprimary.co.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036665_6"]]}}}}
