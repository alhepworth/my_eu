The overall aim of VALERIE is to boost the outreach of research by facilitating the integration into innovative field practices. The work in VALERIE consists of three major approaches. (1). Stakeholder-driven approach. Ten case studies set the central stage for the bottom-up approach of the project, aided by highly effective tools of web semantics and ontology. Cases are centred around a specific supply-chain, a farming sector or a landscape. The stakeholder communities (SHC) represent the natural networks engaged in innovation. They drive the process of articulating innovation needs, enabling the retrieval of precisely matching knowledge and solutions, and evaluating their potential in the local context. (2) Theme-driven approach. VALERIE retains six thematic domains that are at the heart of sustainable production and resource use. These six provide the back-bone for structuring the annotation and summarising activities, which in turn will provide a vast body of knowledge accessible via the Communication Facility (CF). (3) Knowledge disclosure. VALERIE will launch a \u2018Communication Facility\u2019 (CF) for the EIP-Networking Facility. The CF supports communication amongst actors in the field and researchers. Next, it injects new knowledge into the innovation process, by enabling users to retrieve highly relevant (tailored-to-needs) information, based on their own vocabularies. In offering tools for communication, as well as content structured for efficient knowledge retrieval, the CF fuses the advantages typical of \u2018learning networks\u2019 and \u2018linear\u2019 modes of knowledge sharing. The CF will be set up, tested and integrated into the EIP-NF platform, as a generic infrastructure for use by \u2018fresh\u2019 stakeholder communities, also beyond the life of the VALERIE project.", 90797.0, 3074483.0, 7, 16, "VALERIE", null, "http://www.adas.co.uk", null, "fp7_111331_951120988"], [1451606400000, 1577750400000, "MULTIscale SENTINEL land surface information retrieval PLatform", "Adas Uk Limited", "With the start of the SENTINEL era, an unprecedented amount of Earth Observation (EO) data will become available. Currently there is no consistent but extendible and adaptable framework to integrate observations from different sensors in order to obtain the best possible estimate of the land surface state. MULTIPY proposes a solution to this challenge. The project will develop an efficient and fully traceable platform that uses state-of-the-art physical radiative transfer models, within advanced data assimilation (DA) concepts, to consistently acquire, interpret and produce a continuous stream of high spatial and temporal resolution estimates of land surface parameters, fully characterized. These inferences on the state of the land surface will be the result from the coherent joint interpretation of the observations from the different Sentinels, as well as other 3rd party missions (e.g. ProbaV, Landsat, MODIS). The framework allows users to exchange components as plug-ins according to their needs. The proposal is based on the EO-LDAS concepts developed within several ESA-funded projects, which have shown the feasibility of producing estimates of the land surface parameters by combining different sets of observations through the use of radiative transfer models. We will provide a fully generic flexible data retrieval platform for Copernicus services that provides integrated and consistent data products in an easily accessible virtual machine with advanced visualisation tools. Users will be engaged throughout the process and trained. Moreover, user demonstrator projects include applications to crop monitoring & modelling, forestry,  biodiversity and nature management.

The success of this approach to the laying hen sector and other sectors will be evaluated by the ability of the network to encourage practice-led innovation, check the effectiveness of the innovation, ensure optimum use of scientific information, provide a route for traditional knowledge transfer when required, disseminate results of innovation to others and ensure that policy is informed by practice-led solutions.", 54940.0, 1659879.0, 5, 8, "Hennovation", null, "http://www.adas.co.uk", null, "h2020_194800_951120988"]]}}, "5HD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "EUROVOUZELA 4", "Adept Security Systems Ltd", 96961.0, 8, 19, "EUROVOUZELA 4 is the successor to 3 successful projects, the first one approved in 2014, the second in 2015 and the 3rd in 2016  which allowed the sending of 60 students and 17 teachers and staff in mobility  to 13 different countries, consolidating partnerships with schools, companies and intermediaries in several countries and new possibilities for projects and partnerships on the way.\r\n\r\nIt is promoted by the Vocational School of Vouzela, founded in 1991 and located in the interior of the country, geographic conditionality has not been impeditive to the installation of several productive units, with which we work every day, together with the local authorities.\r\n\r\nWith this project, we want to strengthen our work of training young people well prepared to enter the labor market, holders of diplomas of a reference school and with teaching oriented to the practice. These are motivational factors for the school success and school abandonment prevention in a school whose main challenge today is to provide hope and confidence to its young people, who carry years of school failure and lack of prospects for the future and who do not review in the traditional model of education. This project helps us to make each student believe that he has value, that he has an opportunity and that he can aspire to be successful.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- Preparing students for active life: transition from academic life to the labor market\r\n- To improve the educational offer of the EPV in a sustainable way, combating school abandonment and failure through motivation and attractiveness\r\n- Bring the school community closer to the European reality - to create international partnerships and synergies\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities are:\r\n- Sending of 9 teachers and staff - trainers / teachers, course directors, class directors, pedagogical director, direction - on shadowing job missions to Germany, Sweden and Greece. We are betting on 2 more participants and 2 new countries for a greater diversity in learning.\r\n- Sending 14 students from 11th and 7th grade students to attend curricular internships (63 days and 280 hours of internship and 70 days and 320 hours of internship, respectively).
