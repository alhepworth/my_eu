All students attending this school have to do a compulsory  bussiness-related internship of 12 weeks between the third and the fourth year (any time between June 1 and October 6 every year) There is also the possibility of doing a voluntary internship between years IV and V. \r\nAbout 40 % out of the around 100 students who have to do their compulsory internship every year choose to do this abroad, which means they decide to work in one of the various EU countries,  such as Germany, the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy and France, as well as in Switzerland or Turkey. \r\nDoing an internship in a foreign country is of immense importance for the students\u2018 personal and working lives. They have the chance to experience a non-German-speaking working environment on the European labour market and to use and strenghten their acquired skills. \r\nThe aim of doing an internship in an EU-country outside Austria is to give our students the opportunity to \r\n- use their aquired knowlegde from school in subjects such as Business Studies, Accountancy, IT, Cooking and Service (which are important subjects in our type of school)\r\n- get some insight into the corporate structures of other countries \r\n- gain some job experience on the European labour market\r\n- improve their foreign language skills \r\n- improve their social skills and their sense of intercultural understanding\r\n- foster their personal development. \r\nThe target group for this programme are 17-year-old students (for the compulsory internship between years III and IV) and 18-year-olds (for the voluntary internship between years IV and V) who at this level have a fair knowledge of Business Studies and Accountance. Furthermore, all of them have been taught at least two foreign languages (English \u2013 B1+) and  (Italian or French  - B1) some of them are even learning  Spanish (Level \u2013 A2) as a third foreign language. In the first three years all students have to attend the compulsory subjects Cooking and Service (all together 15 lessons a week) \r\nFor the project participants doing an internship in the tourist industry or any other field of business abroad will be an immense profit for their future working lives. One of the major educational objectives of a vocational school providing higher education entrance qualifications like ours is to prepare our students for a working life where all the needs of modern economy and international business relations are considered. Moreover, the aspects of improving foreign language skills and getting familiar with business habits in other countries will be a major advantage for the young people who take part in this project. International companies are increasingly looking for employees who have got a sound knowledge of languages as well as good social and intercultural skills which can be practiced best abroad.", "http://www.mullion-cove.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034835_12"]]}}}}
