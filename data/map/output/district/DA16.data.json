The play is set in Iceland in 1940, when Britain occupied the country. At the time, the locals worried about the fact that many of the young Icelandic women spent most of their time in the barracks, dancing and flirting with the soldiers. This became known as \"The Situation.\" The play is about Siggi, a young Icelandic man who falls in love with the English soldier, Thomas. The project is a production of this play, as a collaboration between young English and Icelandic theatre makers. It is produced by Rokkur Friggjar and RF theatre, companies that have worked with young artists in an international setting before.\r\nThe project will give many young artists an opportunity to work with people from a different national background both in their own home country and as visitors in a different one. It will give them a chance to learn from each other and gain new skills and confidence from the collaboration. Putting on the performances will give them a chance to share their vision with a larger, more diverse group of people than they otherwise would. \r\nRokkur Friggjar is an Icelandic theatre company and has six members\r\nWriter and director: Anna \u00cdris. Anna \u00cdris has been involved in youth theatre since 2012 and has written and produced several shows of different sizes. This will be the first time she works with a group of actors from both Iceland and England. \r\nActors: Halla Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir, Fannar Arnarsson and J\u00f3n Nordal. \r\nFilmmaking and promotional material: \u00der\u00e1inn Gu\u00f0brandsson. \r\nMusic and composition: Viktor Ingi Gu\u00f0mundsson\r\nRF Theatre is an independent theatre and production company based in London. It focuses on involving Englsh artists interested in international work. It currently has four members that work in four different fields. \r\nProducer and scenic manager : Sophie Nicholls \r\nAdvertising and marketing: Adam Joseph Baxter\r\nLighting Design: James Rodd\r\nActor: David Fenne\r\nRehearsals will be led by the director, Anna \u00cdris, but each actor will get a chance to lead at least one workshop wherein they teach the ensemble methods they have learned or developed. This way we make sure the process is always based on an exchange of knowledge and practice and that it helps young artists grow and find their own way of working. \r\nThe group believes firmly that leading is a way of learning and will give each participant space to share their visions with the group. The actors will do this in the workshops, but the technical team will do this by inviting the team into their workspace and walking them through the basics of what they do. We have found that this increases understanding between sections of theatre makers and makes for better work. \r\nThis method of working will help young actors build their own method of working as well as their confidence and skill level. It will give them an understanding of the challenges of working internationally and teach them to facilitate for others coming into their country. It's a method that lets you progress by teaching your own methods and learning the methods of others. \r\nEach of these artists will go back to their lives after the project with a greater understanding and new relationships formed. They will bring this new perspective with them as their career blossoms, through whatever times may come next. They will have this experience and be able to draw on it for future projects and pay it forward in kind by sharing it with others. They are now entering the professional theatre world knowing that they have already and can continue to work internationally, regardless of borders, cultures and language barriers.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-IS01-KA205-038783_1"]]}}, "2BL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "FORWARD FOR MFL AT BEXLEY", "Bexley Grammar School", 23429.0, 1, 1, "Bexley Grammar School is an 11-18 mixed grammar school located in South-East London. \r\n\r\nThe school teaches approximately 1500 students, with around 500 in the sixth form. \r\n\r\nWe have a higher than average proportion of students with both SEN and EAL. The school employs a full time dedicated SEN department to support those students with additional needs. This work has paid off in that the value added score for both SEN students and EAL are actually slightly higher than our non SEN/EAL students.\r\n\r\nThe funding that accompanied designation as a Specialist Language College enabled us to enhance our Language provision throughout the school to become one of the leading schools in the country for the delivery of Modern Foreign Languages. \r\n\r\nThe school's status as a Specialist Language College is still extremely important and a total of seven modern languages are offered to students. \r\n\r\nAlthough the funding ended, its powerful legacy has shaped the school, underpinned our move to the International Baccalaureate Diploma and allows us to remain at the top of this area of the curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll students must take at least 2 languages to GCSE, and all International Baccalaureate (IB) students in the sixth form must also take a language as part of their course. \r\n\r\nIn September this year, the sixth form will go fully IB. meaning that every student will be required to study a foreign language from year 7 to 13. \r\n\r\nWe teach all our lessons in target language to a high standard, however in a large MFL department of 17 teachers we only have 3 native speakers of their teaching language. We are all very proficient, but as non-natives, raising our level of knowledge of target language and culture is an ongoing requirement.\r\n\r\nWe plan a 2-year project involving MFL staff it will involve 7 MFL teachers taking part in 11 immersion courses in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. They will each visit the country of their main specialism (one taking two mobilities) to further develop and refresh their skills. Three of the 7 would additionally visit the country of their second MFL specialism. This would be a total of 4 mobilities to France, 3 to Spain, 3 to Germany and 1 to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe immersion courses include intensive language learning, cultural immersion and focused cultural activities, language teaching methodology and pedagogy, opportunities for discussion with other MFL professionals and the opportunity for participants to spend time in a European school, sharing practice and developing links.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase our use of target language beyond the confines of the MFL curriculum. We already focus on pupil interaction language and avoid English entirely within our MFL classrooms but would like to really boost our own linguistic abilities in order to be able to deliver an experience which is increasingly authentic.", "http://www.bexleygs.co.uk", "Bexley Grammar School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047006_coordinator"]]}}}}
