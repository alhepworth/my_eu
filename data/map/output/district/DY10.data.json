CleanPEA will purpose it to support and encourage corporate fleet owners/operators to make the change from diesel-/petrol-powered, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV \u2013 cars and vans) to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) equivalent. This will help the EU meet its demanding CO2 emission reduction targets, as cars and vans contribute around 15% of all CO2 emissions across Europe . Fleet Innovations Ltd. (FLEET) is an ambitious, Innovative-Driven Enterprise (IDE) with a strong desire to internationalise their business and led by a team of experts and serial entrepreneurs in providing data capture/reporting technology systems and fleet management solutions to track corporate business mileage/journey data. While engaging in customer building activities for our current solution (PEAK Miles), we discovered a strong desire among commercial corporations with company LCV fleets to switch to EVs as a way of cutting their cost and meeting their carbon reduction obligations . Europe\u2019s corporate fleets produce around 380Mt CO2 emission annually, accounting for around 8% of all EU emissions . We have conservatively estimated that the successful commercialisation of CleanPEA will allow us to generate new cumulative revenues and profits respectively of \u20ac94.32m and \u20ac57.55m (EBITDA) 6 years post project (2022). As a result, we would create 91 new jobs across Europe and directly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by 609,780 tonnes.", 37942.0, 54204.0, 1, 1, "CleanPEA", null, null, null, "h2020_199266_939031490"]]}}, "3QE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Home Sweet Home", "Heathfield School", 129406.0, 5, 5, "Home Sweet Home!\r\nFive rural European high schools from England, Turkey, Greece, Spain and France will take their 11 to 15-year-old students from the cocoon of their home to the larger home that is Europe. Through this three-year-long adventure where they will discover each other's culture through each other's house, find out about houses of the past and houses of important people, they will also learn to accept originality and differences and they will be ready to act tomorrow as environment-friendly citizens of Europe when they will  design their house of the future. But most of all, they will \r\n- improve their level in the Foreign Languages they are learning at school (English, French and Spanish) so that they can get their Europass Language Passport\r\n- improve their digital skills and get a common certificate specially created for the project\r\n- improve their knowledge of the world of work and be ready for some of them to go to a vocational school to prepare their future job. For this, they will complete the Employability for Life Charter implemented by the English partner.\r\n\r\nAs the schools involved are small, the project will concern all the students of the schools : activities will be implemented in all the subjects taught in our schools at different moments so that they are well integrated into our curriculums. However, only a few pupils will travel abroad during the transnational meetings or the little exchanges groups : they will be ambassadors who will talk on behalf of their schoolfriends to present their work and who will return to their schools with the account of what they will have done abroad.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Home Sweet Home will also affect our local communities : we don't want it to be only a school  project but we want the parents, the neighbours, the people in our villages or little towns to be aware of what's going on and to know more about Europe as the place  where they all belong, the place they live in where their next door neighbours are French, Spanish, Greek, Turkish or English.\r\nSo let's move from our home to a larger one which is called EUROPE!", "http://Www.heathfieldschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002432_3"]]}}}}
