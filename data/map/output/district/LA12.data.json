All participants attend or have just finished (from no more than one year) a vocational  and training path in the field of tourism services and who will carry out the relevant professional work experience abroad.\r\nRENADRION intends, therefore, offer young people experience in companies of their field of study that includes the ability to deal with the language skills possessed and the acquisition of specific job competencies. It aims, in particular, to align the learning outcomes achieved in the education and training path with the needs of the labor market in the field of promotion and management of tourism and enhance the knowledge of the development strategies adopted in other contexts in the field of interest, using the internship experience as a fundamental part of the training.\r\nAmong the general objectives of the project:\r\n- Promote lifelong learning as a right of the persons to increase and update their skills, abilities and knowledge in formal, non formal and informal learning contexts;\r\n- Promote the transparency of learning and compliance training to the needs of businesses and professions in order to facilitate the meeting between demand and supply of labor and increase the productivity and competitiveness of the production system;\r\n- Enlarge the marketability of qualifications at national and EU level in order to facilitate geographical and occupational mobility also in terms of the internationalization of businesses and professions.\r\nMobility experiences will increase also the soft skills of the participants, such as the spirit of initiative, adaptability and the ability to relate and interact with cultural backgrounds different from their own.\r\nThe transparency of learning in the tourism sector will be guaranteed, finally, through ECVET and the establishment of a partnership able to work on mutual understanding on units of learning outcomes and method of evaluation, validation and recognition of knowledge, skills and competencies achieved by participants in mobility.\r\nThese, therefore, the expected impacts:\r\n- The development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (210 young students and recent graduates);\r\n- Set up of training models and tools of innovative value;\r\n- Diffusion of results and training models between stakeholders in the macro sector concerned and in the VET systems;\r\n- Make available the results and training models for institutions and professionals of local/regional level.\r\nThe project can therefore be considered exemplary, being integrated into the strategic development of each partner in the consortium, as well as transferable outside of it, for different reasons:\r\n- It represents the effective realization of a model of WORK BASED LEARNING with a system of actions aimed at specific training, but also at the global growth of the person. It provides continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and supervised by trainers and mentors; activities of support and mentoring; teaching and training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;\r\n- It lays a system of midterm and final means to monitor the progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as its evaluation, validation and certification.", "http://www.lakesidehotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005892_19"], [2017, "European WBL paths for quality professional training in tourism", "Lakeside Hotel Yorkcloud Limit", 481272.0, 7, 39, "BACKGROUND\r\nThe tourism industry is a key sector of the EU. It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3. Mobility Realization: Internship in the company; Monitoring and tutoring; Project feedback and experience of mobility; Assessment, certification and validation of skills acquired.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY in 4 PHASES\r\n1. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"Moncada\" in close collaboration with other 16 partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.lakesidehotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_19"], [2016, "LEO quali-TC ECVET ENLARGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY", "Lakeside Hotel Yorkcloud Limit", 472814.0, 7, 39, "Due to the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of emergency - as the unemployment rate for the aged 15-24 reached more than 44% - and it is, therefore, widely believed that it is necessary to foster experiences of integration into the production system since the years of education and training.Recent economic developments have shown, moreover, the need, in a global context, of a highly skilled workforce. As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.lakesidehotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_19"], [2017, "Kungsmadskolan in Europe - Mobilty Project for Students in the Hospitality Industry", "Lakeside Hotel Yorkcloud Limit", 160261.0, 4, 6, "The background to the project we are seeking funds for is our established cooperation with a number of companies in Italy and the UK.
