The impact for this group will be the development of their learning in terms of the use of non-formal education techniques as a method to improve teaching quality. Moreover teachers will acquire a facilitated tool in order to develop basic teaching competences. Furthermore teachers will enhance their leadership skills and act as a role model for their students, communicating positive behaviors in school. Teachers will be able to improve their capacity to develop new exercises and teaching strategies following non-formal education methodology. Educators will be able to monitor and be aware of warning signs and factors that may intervene in school attendance. Finally teachers\u2019 well-being will be improved too. Through professional development, teachers will feel the support of a tool that will enhance their efficiency and confidence when working with toddlers and children. Enhancing their teaching quality, teachers will become competent to deal with daily challenges occurring within school and preschool structures.\r\n\u2022 Participating Organizations: The expected impact on the partner organizations will be  direct and will include the development of learning in terms of professional development, non-formal learning, early childhood education and specifically how to combine the three elements, as well as the provision of a new offer for their beneficiaries.\r\n\u2022 Target groups: The direct target group, as mentioned above, will benefit in a strong way. Regarding the indirect target group which is children up until 7 years old, those will be able to receive a better quality of education. Students will improve their self-development and learn how to actively participate in learning process. Through non-formal education directed to promoting positive behaviors and active participation, children will succeed to be better prepared in order to enter classroom.

Along with KULT, the following organizations have mandated Memos act as applicant and coordinator: International BURCH University and the e-learning provider IDEGO (both Bosnia-Herzegovina), Volunteers Centre Skopje (Macedonia), Medway Youth Trust from Kent (UK), Mladinski Center Velenje (Slovenia), Udruga Mladih Roma \"Romska Budu\u0107nost\" from Rijeka (Croatia), and Ligo Lex Legis from Prishtina (Kosovo). 4 of the consortium members are based in Partner Countries, 5 in Programme Countries of the European Union.\r\n\r\nThe network\u2019s efforts are building on the learning experiences of the following activities and events:\r\n1. the Erasmus+ projects \u201cRecollecting the Future\u201d and \u201cBrain Drain, Brain Gain + Circular Migration\u201d coordinated by Memos and implemented in Montenegro, Macedonia and BH in 2016 and 2017\r\n2. the \u201cStudent Pavilion Summer School\u201d organized by national and international partners at IBU \r\n3. \u201cEurope@DJHT\u201d, a 4-day gathering of 400 youth workers and experts from the youth field in the framework of the German Child and Youth Welfare Congress in 03/17 in D\u00fcsseldorf. \r\n\r\nThe partner consortium devotes special attention to the European Agenda for Youth Work as adopted at the 2nd European Youth Work Convention in Brussels in 2015.  In line with the Agenda\u2019s central theme, BOOTS aims to establish common ground for youth work practitioners across all sectors and throughout Europe. For this purpose, the project is driven by a partner network that reflects the complex and disparate institutional settings of youth organizations in Europe. \r\n\r\nBy involving several co-applicants who work with hard to reach youth, we underline our determination to respond to the priorities emphasized in the current edition of the Erasmus+ Programme Guide.  By boosting transversal skills (also called soft, basic and future skills or competencies), the project is particularly committed to appreciate the differing social, economic and educational backgrounds of the participating young people and the organizations they are affiliated to. In the course of its implementation, the project will explore how youth work can react to the multitude of risks and uncertainties young people nowadays are facing and under which circumstances an independent youth work approach needs to be completed by collaborative action.\r\n\r\nActivity 1 is a 3-day youth worker seminar in March 2018 to be conducted in Kent (UK). The event is dedicated to bring up-to-date the project\u2019s operational planning, to re-examine its goals and expected learning outcomes. Also, the participants will discuss the possibilities to establish a strategic partnership and to systematically involve relevant stakeholders. Each partner will be represented by one person.\r\n\r\nActivity 2 is a youth encounter organized in Ilid\u017ea (BH) in August 2018 and hosted by the Institute for Youth Development KULT and International Burch University. Each partner designates five youth and one youth leader to participate in the eight-day event. The participating organizations will jointly implement various  informal and formal training tools designed to strengthen the transversal skills of young people \r\n\r\nActivity 3 is a 5-day seminar hosted by the Volunteer Centre Skopje in Struga (MK) in October 2018. Each consortium member will designate 3 staff members or volunteers to participate in this mobility activity for youth workers.  Along with the assessment of the achieved results, the participants will deal with the Non-Violent Communication approach of Marshall Rosenberg. In particular, they will discuss how and to what extent NVC can equip youth across Europe with transversal skills that sensitize them for the common fundamental values of our societies.\r\n\r\nIn all phases \u2013 planning, implementation, and evaluation \u2013 BOOTS is determined to improve the participants\u2019 socio-professional development and the internationalization of their youth work practice. On the institutional level, the project is going to enhance the management, governance and innovation capacity by sharing their youth work practices and by testing new non-formal learning methods.", "http://www.themytrust.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DE04-KA105-016069_7"], [2017, "ACTIVE BEING", "Medway Youth Trust", 37750.0, 5, 5, "The European Union sees as a priority to enhance the active citizenship of young people. As such, it depicted in its aim to bring people from different parts of Europe together to promote mutual understanding, a sense of ownership of the European Union, and the emergence of a European identity to complement local and regional ones. This is also reflected in the EU 2020 Strategy which emphasizes the importance of promoting increased self-empowerment and esteem, more active participation in society, and enhanced intercultural awareness. Therefore, it is the reflection of the importance of healthy and active lifestyles that lead to positive change and involved citizens. \r\n\r\nHowever, unstable wellbeing such as obesity, depression, social withdrawal, delusion, excessive anxieties, insomnia, emotional outbursts and substance abuse are widespread across Europe. Unfortunately, this seems to be predominant among European youth, who are the future generation and form an important part of the EU. Statistics show a substantial increase in cases from ages 10 to 20, a peak in the early 20s, and then a steady decrease. \r\n\r\nA state of deficient wellbeing is detrimental in many ways to the individual and the regional bloc at large. Disturbed youth have a high tendency to engage in deviant acts such as radicalization, vandalism, robbery. Resultantly, contributing to high rates of unproductivity, radicalization and mortality in the EU.  \r\n\r\nPrompt measures are requisite to curb this situation and prevent further perpetuation of this cycle.  Thus, alternative active engagements, such as sports, is seen by the partners as a way to stay both physically and mentally healthy, but also enhance the active participation of young people in the local community. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to strengthen the active citizenship of marginalised young people by providing them insights into their general wellbeing, both physical and mental.  \r\n\r\nBelow are the underpinning objectives to achieve the aim of the project:\r\n\r\n1. To inspire participants to see themselves as agents of change and inspire self-value;\r\n2. To increase level of confidence to acknowledge their challenges and act upon them;\r\n3. To make efforts at addressing the issue of inferiority complex and \r\n4. To make participants acknowledge the value of a healthy life, sound wellbeing and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project involves 73 participants who are young people between 17 and 20 coming from various regions of the EU characterized by a common will to experience and learn different methods of improving their general wellbeing. These young people need a change of lifestyle to counteract the impacts of their surroundings. They need to have a good example of how healthy life choices are made. In order to lead successful and healthy lives, they have to understand which attitudes are correct, and how to adapt these new lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThe project will entail a variety of outdoor centered education, which foster learning through interactions between emotions, actions and thoughts in a natural authentic environment will be employed. Some of these activities include; Rundbold, fishing, yoga, football, stress relief exercises, to mention but a few. This will enhance efficient operationalization of objectives towards achieving the main aim of the project and optimal results.\r\n\r\nThe vision here is to produce open minded, motivated and enriched young envoys, who will serve as channels of transfer of information on the necessity of living a healthy lifestyle. And in the long run end up affecting not only 21st century youngsters, but also future generations all over Europe. Various countries and the European Union at large will become endowed with resourceful, healthy and productive citizens.", "http://www.themytrust.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA105-034024_2"], [2016, "Me and My Community", "Medway Youth Trust", 20736.0, 9, 9, "The Europe 2020 strategy has a clear ambition that Europe will succeed if it acts collectively. Underpinned by key priorities this projects aims to contribute to those priorities.  Specifically to foster high-employment economy to deliver social and territorial cohesion.
