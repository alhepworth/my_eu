After the development of a first project in Dublin of 31 mobilities, a second one with more destinations, sending institutions and mobilities and a third one that strengthens all the lessons learnt in the previous one, the new project consolidates the work done and the cooperation with the General Directorate of Vocational Training in the region of Madrid (DG FP). \r\nThe new figure ErasmusPRO has been added and the number of destinations has grown on to recently-acceded to the EU countries as Slovenia, which also allows the increase of the number of ordinary mobilities (84, including 4 of long-term mode) and of special needs (8), as well as the educational centers/sending institutions members of the consortium (18) which find it difficult managing mobilities on their own.\r\nThe project\u2019s objectives for the students are, therefore: improve their employability with the acquirement of new technical skills, improvement of social and language skills and self-confidence and matureness gaining because of the unique experience that staying abroad means. And for the sending institutions: facilitate their participation in European mobility projects with the corresponding internationalization of their work, as well as amplify and diversify their educational offer. \r\nThe new project keeps growing in terms of number of mobilities and destination countries. It consists of 90 mobilities for students to make an internship period in companies based in United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy,  Slovenia, Czech Republic and Portugal (without a training period): 50 of Intermediate Vocational Training students to make their module of Training in Working Centers, 30 more and shorter for students of Intermediate Vocational Training on their 1st or 2nd year of study, 4 for long-term mobilities of the type of ErasmusPRO and 8 more for students of Intermediate Vocational Training and Professional Programs with special needs. Students will be given preference but recent graduates will be allowed to take part in the project as well. It consists as well in 14 vacancies for accompanying people for each travel flow during the first days of stay, and, of course, for the 8 students with special needs, considering the previously acquired experience and the fact that most of the students have never been abroad and/or come from deprived areas. \r\nActivities. The project has a clear intention of continuity and consolidation of the three previous ones. The DG FP and Foundation have agreed to maintain 15 of the sending institutions of the current project and to add 4 more in order to cover the placements offer. The Mobility Comitee will periodically meet and Foundation will draw up a record of the agreements reached. Informational and of the project\u2019s dissemination talks are foreseen (with previous participants) in each sending institution. The participation in the selection process will be open to all students that meet the criteria stablished in the Call Bases that will be agreed, approved, and published by the Comitee. At least 86 participants will receive language training from the OLS and pedagogical and cultural talks are also foreseen. The educational plan will be agreed between the sending and hosting mentors and stablished in the Learning Agreement document. The internship monitoring will be made in a direct and periodic way by the two mentors, the partner institutions, and the Foundation itself. Project management in each stage will be conducted by Foundation. At the end of the internship periods a final evaluation of each student will be made and supporting documents will be issued (Europass Mobility Document and Certificate of Attendance).\r\nMethology. Foundation will maintain the professional relationship with the partner institutions that will provide host companies and will manage accommodation, insurance deals and journeys (travel days). \r\nExpected results and impact. Complement the students training, consolidate the links with partners, internationalization for all (participants, sending institutions, coordinator, etc.) and support the European integration of recently-acceded countries developing mobilities in destinations as Slovenia.\r\nLong Term Benefits. Strengthen the institutional and strategic relations with DG FP, European dimension awareness of the sending and receiving institutions, and the most important one for all consortium members: improve the capacity of the participant to find a job that satisfies their professional, financial and of personal development needs.", "http://www.british-study.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048832_19"], [2017, "VETquality+", "British Study Centres Teacher Training", 136720.0, 7, 11, "Thirteen years of experience of the Goldenberg Europakolleg (GEK) \u2013 both a college of further education and a vocational school- offer an established project background and a perfect basis for the new European programme ERASMUS+. \r\nBoth of the school\u2019s locations are situated in major economically important areas near Cologne.

Implementing the ideas of the  learning organization, Kaunas Jesuit High School participated in the projects of European Union Lifelong Learning program 2011-2013.  The participants of the projects have successfully improved the general competencies and mastered the best  educational practices, but the English language user competence B1 the teachers acquired does not allow us to implement  the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme qualitatively, as our community has become a member of International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme network since 2013. Aiming to develop a well-rounded personality, our gymnasium is willing to provide the equal opportunity for students from Litghuania and abroad to acquire international education which is recognized by the Government of Lithuania. In order to become a full-fledged member of the international network of schools, our gymnasium is going to help to improve English language skills 11 teachers (literature, biology, chemistry, information technology, physics, economics, art, math, geography), enabling them to participate in the five-to-ten day intensive English language courses. The relevant themes of the project are: the development of the English language communicative competences,  the integration of the English language and the subject on international scale, the use of IT technologies in the lessons of various subjects. Seeking to accomplish  the strategic objectives, Kaunas Jesuit High School has chosen the partners of the program  Erasmus +  - European (Malta, UK ) language schools  with international experience in teaching English methodology. The participants of the project will improve the competences to work with basic, secondary and the International Baccalaureate Diploma program  thus gaining a positive perception and evaluation of lifelong learning competence, will  gain experience in sharing the material with their colleagues from the EU countries, will develop language learning  skills, will improve skills of the English language  integration  into other subjects, will strengthen teachers'  ability to use ICT  teaching methods. The teachers will share their experience  with communities of our gymnasium,  other schools around Kaunas  and Lithuania, they will also prepare their subject descriptions.

We do this via training for trainers in a mutual way on debate education methods, public speaking and developing persuasive motions and key messages. But was also aim to improve the way how we can make sure  that the youth with fewer opportunities are heard and reach out to a wider audience than the 'debate room'. This means that our participants, volunteers and youth workers, will harvest key messages when they apply debate education and local debates in their communities for youth with fewer opportunities. The last goal is that we want to make this OPEN UP! network more sustainable and structural so that the partners and their youth workers and volunteers who work with youth with fewer opportunities really can work on impact, progress and empowerment of youth with fewer opportunities. \r\nThe problems of those youth will be adressed in this project. First of all their problems of being excluded, lacking skills that are needed in the 21 century. We offer them those skills- via our trained participants- as critical thinking, active citizens, argumentation, networking, public speaking, leadership skills. \r\nThe other problem is the growing gap between this target group and the public autorities . In general youth are not heard on issues of their interest and their needs are not well reflected in policy documents. Therefore we want to emphazise stronger than in the previous years the need that youth are heard, we want to develop strong key messages via the debate activities at grass root level and improve campaigning for it so that youth are heard and connected. \r\nThe participants  in OPEN UP! network will not only learn technical skills to train youth in debating and campaigning to be heard. They also will learn to work with pedagogical approaches that put youth in their strenght; open space, co creation, action learning and other innovative learning skills. \r\nThe activities are simple but effective: We start with a thorough preparation of the partners, based on setting own learning goals, reflection on products of  OPEN UP in the last years, and a joint cooperation to develop the trainings. Than we will implement a training on developing Training for Trainers skills to teach others to debate and speak in public as well as on developing persuasive strategies to campaign for the key messages of local youth. This will be applied in the local communities among target groups like minorities, Roma youth, russia minorities, refugees and youth who need to be prevented from radikalisation.. This application willT stimulate reflection on own learning goals and meanwhile support local youth to become active citizens through debate education.  The second training is in Istanbul and based on the application and test of the campaign model. The participants feed back what the messages are from their youth and we develop an even stronger campaign. The next phase is the implementation of the campaign, reaching out to local, national and international autorities to make youth be heard and organising debates in the local setting. Finally we will have a reflection meeting in Brussels to analyse the progress of 'how youth are heard, especially youth with fewer opportunities' and how we could improve this. The reflection will be also with external partners as the EU Commission, International NGO;s in Brussels and other stakeholders that have interest to engage youth with fewer opportunities, to empower them as active citizens and to listen to them in order to give due weight to their needs.

We focus our analysis on specific solutions that can be implemented in various countries to overcome this pressing issue and we can do that by creating and educating a pool of qualified coaches and trainers in select cities across Europe that will lead the long-term process. We also want to develop ties with well-established and influential networks that can amplify the voice of the youth.

Those skills will result in a series of local trainings to debates on (hidden) discrimination by young people. The second phase is a learning circle focused on improved campaigning and advocacy skills of the network in which youth workers learn to collect and aggregate motions, ideas and stories of young people and to campaign for a joint statement. This campaign is implemented together with youth locally and internationally. It results into a vibrant European conference about social inclusion for all (third phase),  where 50 young people from the grass root  debate with EU representatives, artists, intellectuals about their perspective on what Opening UP in Europe means to achieve sincere social inclusion. Methodology: Considering most of the knowledge and information is already with participants as they have a first hand experience of the issue in question, we use action learning approach, where participants exchange information, experience and knowledge and learn from one another.  We also focus on many innovative ways of learning both for the youth workers as well as to be applied for the youth. Results: We have further built on a network of  'local heroes' that are grassroots leaders in social change in communities across Europe.  These local heroes are enabled to 'open up' the society by fostering debates and dialogue about discrimination (of youth) . This results in youth driven local and international policy debates with clear motions that deliver action oriented agenda setting to achieve social inclusion for all.84 young people with fewer opportunities  developed their debating and listening skills and ability to analyse their rights and problems, to debate about  problems  in relation to discrimination. Self-esteem and understanding  of how to complain about violations of their rights is increased. They have grown in their intercultural communication skills as well in their self esteem to act as active citizens in Europe.Thirdly, responses of young people with fewer opportunities about discrimination will be heard and seen in societal and political discussions at the local, national level and  at the international level in Europe. Lastly, A learning network that works together and coaches internal partners to connect disadvantaged youth to society and to foster debates and advocacy against discrimination to achieve social inclusion for all. Products will be two learning circles with additional cutting edge material on content, local debates/dialogue between youth, police/authorities and local government,  action points for change in 12 communities across Europe and from this 12 policy briefs that are  consequently aggregated to 1 European policy brief.

By enhancing the participants\u2019 self-esteem, understanding of rights and over-all competences \u2013such as command of foreign languages- which they will use in training disadvantaged youth, we aim to promote youth-driven change in these neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThe participants will be youth workers from the disadvantaged neighbourhood who are motivated to enhance youth driven change, role models among the youth in the neighbourhood who can drive and inspire others by being ambassadors for change, managers of youth centres and - organisations who want to change their strategies and lastly debate trainers interested in learning to teach disadvantaged youth. The group of participants will be mixed in terms of age, gender and culture.  \r\n\r\nThe project will be executed through different activities. It will start with online exchanges where the participants, in their own neighborhoods, share their methods and information with each other and formulate learning questions for themselves. What follows is the training for trainers exchange in February, where there will be seminars on relevant topics, training for trainers about IDEA\u2019s Debate in the Neighborhood method, exchange between the partners and the development of a plan of action. Then the trainers will implement their plan of action and everything they\u2019ve learned in their own neighbourhood, and report on the progress in a reflection paper. Lastly the participants can share experience and reflect on the results, plan future activities and disseminate the results in  wider network  at a final meeting in Belgium. \r\n\r\nThe participants will, in this project, learn new skills and improve their ability to train youth through debate education, so that those youth will act as agents of change in their own neighbourhood. On a local, regional, national, European and international level the impact will be significant. The participating youth workers and their neighborhoods will inspire and motivate other neighborhoods and their youth centers to use debate education in order to connect youth to society. The regional authorities and policy makers often show interest and will hopefully fund the projects thus contributing to the youth-driven change. On a national scale the position of youth will change permanently through the constant inspiration and motivation the trainers and youth themselves give to others. Step by step  youth\u2019s voice will be heard by the authorities.
