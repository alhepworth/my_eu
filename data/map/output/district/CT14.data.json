The project targets  reluctant learners  most of whom are long-term unemployed women and single parents who need additional levels of support to access employment. \r\n\r\nThe objective is to make learning fun so that non-traditional learners can be supported towards employment whilst developing their literacy and numeracy skills. Whilst helping to break the cycle of disadvantage in low-income households the project raises awareness of food-related issues and shows those taking part how to better feed their families.  \r\n\r\n75 learner participants are trained during the life of the project. There are also 15 staff and/or contracted volunteers who train as Job Coaches as part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis transnational partnership project is led by LitFest.eu, France and the partnership includes local community organisations in England, Belgium,  Romania and France, all directly engaged with the target group. Together the partners provide a new training course with modules delivered in each country. This course is designed around essential elements of employability but the foundation upon which training is based is something that inspires an automatic recognition and drives participants through gentle learning techniques - the subject is food and nutrition. This impacts on the health and wellbeing of 60 families who parents take part in this project.\r\n\r\nIt is proven that children from low-income families under-achieve in education and often suffer illness and long term social exclusion. To break this cycle parents need to be educated so that they not only provide positive role models but also better understand how to produce essential nutritional, low cost meals and healthier lifestyles. Breaking the spiral of deprivation and long term unemployment is vital if Europe is to a better quality of life for people living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on the success of Literature for Life (2014-2016) and some of the work is a direct off-shoot of \"Josephine and her Soap Bubble\" (children's adventure story book produced in the last project). Book and Cook further develops the methods used in the earlier project and sees Josephine discovering Gastronomy in each partner country as she wends her way towards the world of work.\r\n\r\nThe results include the production of new literary works in each country, written and illustrated by the project participants. Using and developing skills that include communication, imagination, writing, number, photography, art and illustration as well as ICT skills, participants work on collective publications that bring high levels of pride, achievement and empowerment at individual level. Workshops also identify skills and talents that are then encouraged through local mentoring with progression towards further training.\r\n\r\nThe community books that result from this project will be a mixture of fact, fiction, reference and biography. Some will be based on food and cooking but others will result from creativity discovered during the life of this project. All forms of reading and writing are encouraged with coaching sessions and specific writing workshops that are open to all.\r\n\r\nCommunity Enterprise and self-employment are included in subjects covered by workshops in each country. Empowerment is the key to success.\r\n\r\nMulti-national participant workshops last 5 days and are held in each partner country. Each workshop underpins the previous one and also focuses on an important element of employability within the overall project. Starting with health awareness, healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, food preparation, cooking skills, economies and budgeting, employment and self employment options. All this is achieved through practical training involving food preparation and meal production. Once confident and able to communicate well, participants begin their pathway to employment. They develop their CV, undertake interview practice, follow job-search sessions and take part in training on how to create and run a Community Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Job Coaching workshop takes place in Belgium where staff and contracted volunteers are able to learn how to extend their role as social workers to include employment-specific coaching.\r\n\r\nLiteracy and numeracy skills are a vital ingredient in a healthy and fulfilling life. This project demonstrates, through practical hands-on sessions, the relevance of reading and writing. It encourages creative writing and rewards achievement with empowerment and independence. It reinforces the need to provide simple, nourishing and health-aware family meals within a tight budget. Making learning enjoyable and relevant and open to all, at local level, is the overall aim of this project. \r\n\r\nThe project runs for 24 months from 01.09.2018.", "http://www.keen2cook.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA204-047867_2"]]}}, "7DP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1298937600000, 1456704000000, "The Open Pharmacological Concepts Triple Store", "Connected Discovery Ltd", "Drug discovery is data-hungry and all major pharmaceutical companies maintain extensive in-house instances of public data alongside internal. Analysis and hypothesis generation for drug-discovery projects requires assembly, overlay and comparison of data from many sources, requiring shared identifiers and common semantics. Expression profiles need to be overlaid with gene or pathway identifiers and reports on compound pharmacology. Alignment and integration of internal and public data and information sources is a significant effort and the process is repeated across companies, institutes and academic laboratories. This represents a significant waste and an opportunity cost.\n \nTo address these challenges, the Open PHACTS project will develop an open access innovation platform, Open Pharmacological Space (OPS), via a semantic web approach. OPS will comprise data, vocabularies and infrastructure needed to accelerate drug-oriented research. This semantic integration hub will remove key bottlenecks in small molecule drug discovery: disparate information sources, lack of standards and common identifiers, guided by well defined research questions from drug discovery. \n\nWorkflows for data capture, processing, interoperability, visualization, and chemogenomics will be developed creating a comprehensive Systems Chemical Biology Analysis Network. Security issues around proprietary data, shared via the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform and accessible for safe querying and reasoning will be properly addressed with expert trusted parties.\n\nThe Open PHACTS consortium comprises 20 European academic and SME partners, with leading experts in the fields of data mining, annotation, small molecule data storage and manipulation, target bioinformatics, RDF information handling, massive in silico reasoning and chemical biology.

We the volunteers of the foundation participate in youth work. We run project focused on the youth, aged 13-19, to give the support to become mentally and physically healthy adults, representing their interests. The Foundation supports sport activities and tools, like sport stacking, a sport, which also serves as creative educational tool, especially by children with disabilities and fewer opportunities.\r\nWe also organise gratis life-skill trainings and training for school groups how to react on cyber bullying, and other harassment.\r\nIn line with these, the goal of our project is to give the children, participating at Youth Exchange, possibility and support to become globally thinking, locally active and effectively communicating citizens.\r\nOn first 3 days participants explore their own persona, participating in a basic life-skill training. We promote the development of the young personality based on long prven theories, implementing non-formal learning scenarios, creating spectacular actions using an innovative sport and educational tool. Here they face their needs and competences, strength and weakness. This experience contributes to the achievement of their mental health, help them to decide properly, and find their role.\r\nIn the second part of the week, participants will learn basic management skills to be able to plan and realise and evaluate a project, and manage their resources.\r\nGood communication skills are vital. We show positive verbal and non-verbal communication patterns to succeed in their private life, at school and later at work.\r\nThey also accomplish their own mini-project to represent their Erasmus mini-group and Smart Stacks Programme to a spontaneous audience anywhere in Szeged (Hungary)\r\nTo achieve above mentioned goals we use in the first line sport cups. Speed Stacks Hungary representatives invented a new, more complex way to use sport cups. It is called Smart Stacks Programme. Different  learnt and new skills (i.e. oral tasks, physical exercises) are to be done, while placing the cups in different formations, specific sequences to assist learnt skills to become applied skills with sensor-motor learning and improvement of seriaslity.\r\nDuring the week the participants will also contribute to the development of Smart Programme as creative educational and recreational tool, and find the way to implement this tool and therapy in the education of persons with learning and social difficulties.\r\nWe enhance the usage of other creative methods (music, poem, photography) to express their creativitiy and feelings.\r\n55 participants will represent 7 organisaition from 6 countries. 10 participants with fewer opportunities and one disabled will also be in the team.
