D.I.C.K. was born after a careful analysis of the needs expressed by the members of the partnership and the examination of potential economic growth that Calabria territory could enable through a better training of its human resources and a better  marketing action for the positioning of food products in international market.\r\nThe Calabria region ( especially the territories  represented by the municipalities that are project partners) is characterized by an important agricultural and touristic potential. These territories despite their cultural and natural heritage, and the development of enogastronomic sector have been experiencing high rates of unemployment .\r\nThe region and the province of Reggio Calabria are not sufficiently able to enhance and promote their products. The high quality of products is not enough for the development if a marketing strategy is not implemented and  human resources are not really qualified.\r\nStarting from these considerations, MOB.Y. DICK was born to train adequate resources who can help face the challenges and opportunities coming from the global market and bring attention on agricultural and agri-food enterprises management. The objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To encourage a greater awareness of the opportunities that food industry can represent for territorial development;\r\n2.To train human resources able to answer global market modern needs;\r\n3.To work for a gradual and progressive adjustment of training systems according the real business needs, starting from the international experience and taking into account the European ECVET system of skills certification;\r\n4.To learn, through cooperation with foreign partners, good practices in the field of business management and marketing;\r\n5.To stimulate a greater dialogue among all stakeholders involved in the field of agribusiness and territorial development.\r\n\r\nMOB.Y. D.I.C.K. proposes a mobility period in Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland for 100 recent graduates who graduated in the following addresses: services for agriculture and rural development; or administration and marketing; or graphics and communications; and or tourism.\r\nBefore  their departure, participants will receive a pre departure preparation: \r\n- Support for the use of the linguistic platform;\r\n-identification of an individual professional development plan for each participant;\r\n- Cultural preparation and explication of the Erasmus+ Programme;\r\n- Presentation of the local area and its entrepreneurial and development opportunities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will improve technical knowledge and language skills, increasing their level of employability. Coming in contact with foreign companies and with different working styles, they will have the possibility to internationalize their curriculum and to acquire  knowledge for entering the European labor market . Their curriculum will be enriched by the Europass Mobility and other foreign certifications. Locally, the project will be an important opportunity for a territory that is characterized by an high level of youth unemployment. For recent graduates, it will represent an opportunity to apply the knowledge they learnt at school in a real labor experience functional to their career development.\r\nMoreover, the cooperation among various stakeholders involved in the area, will create greater synergy in order to join efforts in the promotion and commercialization of food and agriculture products. The comparison with the learners, once they get back, will represent a unique opportunity to compare different practices and to learn how foreign companies and territories have worked for the promotion of their own brands.\r\nMOB.Y. D.I.C.K. represents an opportunity to reflect on the professional figures that local territory needs. The cooperation between different partners (representing the field of education and training, institutional entities as employer realities) will allow to reschedule the training system so as to make it more suitable for local requirements.  The project aims to ensure that a 30% of the trainees will be offered an additional six-month internship in Italy. Of this 30%, it is estimate the recruitment of 20% of them. For 10% of the total of trainees, the project foresees the achievement of a contract abroad at the same companies that hosted them or in other realities. 10% of the beneficiaries are probably going to work on their own. For the remaining trainees, the project expects that a good number of students (at least 20%), will continue with their university studies. A further 10%, will are likely to continue their studies abroad. The project estimates that 15% will further participate in training courses in Italy.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005888_5"], [2017, "ME.M.O.R.Y. - MEditerranean Memories and mObilities foR Young learners", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 505366.0, 5, 17, "ME.M.O.R.Y. - Mediterranean Memories and mobilities for young learners \u2013 was born from the analysis carried out within the context of Puglia region , from the recognition that the Mediterranean diet received from UNESCO in 2010 as heritage of humanity and the potential that such recognition may represent for the promotion of the territories in which it was born.\r\nAt the base of this project there is the idea that a full appreciation of the southern Italian regions of Puglia cannot be possible without an adequate training of human resources, both as regarding more traditional professionals as well as those emerging professional profiles\r\n\r\nHence, the proposal of a mobility experience abroad. This opportunity will be open to 100 young graduates (who graduated within a year from their application) residing in Puglia and specialized in vocational and technical sectors such as: tourism, hotel hospitality, agro \u2013 food industry. They will carry out an internship in the following  countries: Spain, Belgium ; Malta; UK. The mobility will last 122 days and will take place in European companies operating in the abovementioned economic sectors.\r\n\r\nThe desire to promote such a project comes from the awareness that the local labor market has little space for  developing  and \"engaging\" one\u2019s own professional potential and knowledge acquired during the school years. The project aims at encouraging the revival of the local economy and the labor market in Puglia in relation to the agri-food sector and cultural tourism, considered through a proper European perspective (dissemination and visibility of the Mediterranean Diet as a dietary pattern) and in a bottom-up development. The project will involve a local partnership of schools, public and private institutions, SMEs and associations operating in a territorial context, which is rich in traditions. These same traditions in return will get in contact with many other local communities outside the national borders, so as to\r\nstrengthen the European ideal against the relentless defense of national identities.\r\n\r\nMain purposes:\r\n-to promote and implement a transnational mobility project aimed at a target (graduates) aspiring to work in agribusiness, tourism and cultural sector;\r\n- to Identify new emerging professional profiles in the agri-food sector related to the Mediterranean diet;\r\n-to create the right conditions for a new economic model based on the philosophy and values of the Mediterranean spirit and in support of European planning.

There are two partners in two of the countries involved because we want to optimize and enhance the opportunities that each of them offers in terms of placing young people in companies.This project will include four different kinds of training programs. The first one is aimed at vocational school graduate students completing their vocational courses; the other one is for students who are attending the second year of their vocational courses; another program is available for young graduates who have completed their courses; finally, it is also expected to carry out internships in companies and schools, involving teachers, technicians and managers of the entities that are part of the Consortium.In what regards the different mobilities, the linguistic and cultural preparation will occur before, during and after the mobilities, through face-to-face training in a classroom context and using the OLS platform.The traineeships with the duration of 6 and 10 weeks are part of the courses\u2019 curriculum and will enable these students to carry out their training in a real context of work in an European country where they can perform experiments in different contexts.The 10 months\u2019 traineeships are avalilable to graduate students, in order to create new opportunities to these young people, making their integration into the labour market easier. These trainships will shorten the effects caused by youth unemployment - a serious social problem in Portugal and in the European Union.Developing these traineeships and simultaneously implementing an individual technical project, is a way to contribute to the implementation of two challenges that are essential to fulfill the students\u2019 plan of studies.We would like to highlight that the beneficiaries of this project live and study in a disadvantaged rural region in the interior of Portugal where an infrastructure and development deficit is clear.The traineeships will occur in different phases, with different flows, starting at different times; they will be held in each of the school years, from the beginning of the 2nd school quarter (end of January) until the end of July.This mobility project is aimed at 87 young people and 12 teachers/technicians from a school population of 1865 students who attend all schools which are part of the Consortium.

Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill. The project also intends to use the methods and tools for skill and credits recognition through the use of Unit of learning to be capitalized and converted into the school  and / or training credits  by measuring, recognizing, validating the LO through linear and transparent procedures according the indications  of the ECVET.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS80 STUDENTS.

Project activities are following:- Project management (divided into 4 main documents, which contain 4 main  aspects of correct project management: Coordination and Control Plan, Plan for Learning and Evaluation, Plan of Management of the Communication,  Dissemination and Valorization)- Preparing for the internship (linguistic, technical, educational, cultural, digital preparation)- Identification and activation of interns (following the selection of participants, the MATCHING of the candidate-company will be held  in collaboration with foreign parties who will evaluate the profiles according to the availability of the enterprises)- Accompanying of the participants under 18 years and disadvantaged persons (mainly by professors of the institutes involved) adequately prepared.- Monitoring during and ex post- Final evaluation (outcomes, project, good practices)METHODOLOGY. The used methodologies are  practices to achieve effective, efficient and repeatable activity.RESULTS AND IMPACT. In general, the project will have the main impact in education and training (VET) sector thanks to: training results  of mobility participants; acquired skill (soft skill, professional skill, personal, cultural and ethical skill); recognition of training credits. The dissemination strategy will support the global objectives and specific project activities, in particular the publication of the project OUTPUT (materials, in particular the video made by the participants), but also the OUTCOMES (results) and OUTREACH (impact).LONG TERM BENEFITS. In the long term, we expect: greater involvement of Italian partners (institutional or non), the extension of the partnership abroad, from territorial and skill point of view; the possibility to carry out exchange projects and cooperation also thanks to the participation in other European programs (as COSME and other instruments that finance the social and wellness tourism etc.); the opportunity to become (as the Consortium) a prestigious partner in mobility management and the adoption of the logic EQAVET  nd of the system of recognition of the credits ECVET.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005267_15"], [2015, "TRAIN -  Trainings in Europe for a sustainable development of the local areas", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 269758.0, 9, 14, "The project is one of the initiatives promoted from the large local network, of which the Applicant is part, made up of public and private entities, which has among its objectives the development of the economic system of Brescia in a context of sustainability, local enhancement, development of employment, training and qualification of human resources.\r\n\r\nTRAIN is addressed to students attending 3rd, 4th and 5th 5th classes of VET institutes specializing in International Relations and Marketing, Tourism, Construction Environment and Land and Agrarian, Agribusiness and Agro-industryThe project provides 180 individual internships abroad for 2 or 4 weeks in the field of heritage promotion with particular attention to the development environmentally sustainable activities.\r\n\r\nTRAIN is a result of a thorough analysis of the needs of the market and of the professions required, conducted by the members of the consortium through the direct comparison between the teachers of VET institutions, students, companies and organizations.The analysis reveals a gap between the skills required by the market and those actually possessed, both technical and lingual as well as a widespread lack of knowledge of the business world.

Entrepreneurship can be seen as one of the solutions to combat youth unemployment. Cultures, that value and reward entrepreneurial behavior such as calculated risk taking and independent thinking promote a propensity to develop new solutions to social challenges. In this regard, entrepreneurship education needs to be increased and underrepresented groups need to get special attention and be given help in order to start, run or grow a business or enterprise. On the other hand, the harmonious co-existence of many languages in Europe is a powerful symbol of the EU's aspiration to be united in diversity, one of the cornerstones of the European project. Languages define personal identities, but are also part of a shared inheritance. They can serve as a bridge to other people and open access to other countries and cultures, promoting mutual understanding. A successful multilingualism policy can strengthen the life chances of citizens: it may increase their employability, facilitate access to services and rights, and contribute to solidarity through enhanced intercultural dialogue and social cohesion. The EU now has 500 million citizens, 28 Member States, 3 alphabets and 24 official languages, some of them with a worldwide coverage. Some 60 other languages are also part of the EU's heritage and are spoken in specific regions or by specific groups. In addition, immigrants have brought a wide range of languages with them; it is estimated that at least 175 nationalities are now present within the EU\u2019s borders.Objectives: The project will promote the world@words results as tool to work with young people, promote their foreign language skills (business English) and foster entrepreneurial mind-set, particularly for youth.Number and profile of participants:7 partners from 6 EU countries (UK, GR, ES, IR, BG and BE) -Schools, NGOs, Consultants, European Youth Centre, Platform of Pan-European organisations and research centre have come together to develop \u201cworld@words\u201d, an innovative online Business English vocabulary tool targeting youth who wish to fortify their competitive advantage, learn business English as well as promote their entrepreneurial mind-sets and acquire skills and competences that will help them. The tools will also target teachers of Business English that are looking for an efficient, interactive way to teach Business English Vocabulary online. In world@words, youth can learn and enhance their vocabulary skills, according to their level in English, using both/either their mother tongue (Greek, Spanish, Dutch & Bulgarian) or just the English language, either by personally exercising and monitoring their progress or by connecting and interacting with their physical English teachers. They can also entertain themselves, while simultaneously further enhancing their knowledge, with real-time on-line vocabulary gaming.Description of activities:During the 28 months of the project\u2019s implementation, the partners will carry out 4 Intellectual Outputs together with the management and implementation phases. During these IOs, there will be many activities, such as studies, researches, development of world@words system, translations (En/Gr/En, En/Bg/En, En/Sp/En, En/Be/En), various activities regarding dissemination & use of world@words and pilots in 6 EU countries.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project:The methodology is based on research, testing and validation of the whole system.

The European Commission has actively been seeking to promote work-based learning through high-quality apprenticeships and traineeships as an effective tool for integrating young people into the labour market. Empirical evidence suggests that a stronger cooperation between the world of education and training and the world of work would be beneficial to fight high levels of young people\u2019s unemployment, by contributing to the acquisition of work-related skills and experience in close alignment with employer requirements. Indeed, students spending a training period in another country as part of their education are more prone to work abroad when they enter into the labour market.\r\nIn order to support innovation and modernisation of vocational education and training institutions, and to meet the needs of youth and employers, the partner organizations intend to develop and manage a transnational mobility project, lasting 35 days, for 60 VET learners (students in vocational training schools), in the area of sustainable tourism. In particular the abroad training content would seek to help learners acquire the full set of knowledge, skills and competences required for a specific occupation, the ecomuseum guide. The competitiveness of the European tourism industry is closely linked to its sustainability, as the quality of tourist destinations is strongly influenced by their natural and cultural environment and their integration into the local community. The ecomuseum is ascending to the European scene as one of the most innovative formula able to balance conservation and development, culture and landscape, local identity and turistic flow. In order to endorse its own heritage the Puglia Government has recently approved multiple and effective actions.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nBriefly, the proposed project aims to:\r\n\u2022 support learners in the acquisition of the competences, knowledge and skills required to become a ecomuseum guide, as well as intercultural competences;\r\n\u2022 ensure a formal recognition of competences gained through the learning periods abroad;\r\n\u2022 enhance technical skills of learners by emphasizing on practical knowledge within training programmes;\r\n\u2022 improve learners\u2019 employability and personal growth;\r\n\u2022 improve the participants\u2019 foreign languages competence;\r\n\u2022 raise the participants\u2019 awareness of European citizenship and identity;\r\n\u2022 reinforce synergies between vocational training and employment in the field of sustainable tourism and ecomuseums.\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nBeneficiaries of this mobility project will be 60 students attending a Tourism Course at a VET school.

In a new strategy internationalisation is not mentioned as a focus point, but it takes in the account of changing needs of workers\u2019 skills and competence due to the e.g. digitalisation, urbanisation, climate change and globalisation. Hyria strategy is not set for the specific timeframe, but it can be modified if necessary due to fast change of the operational environment.\r\n\r\nInternational activities at Hyria are aiming to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The evaluation system of international activities will be improved. \r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved. The implemented periods are compared with the estimated ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- The organisation of international activities at Hyria (better involvement of adult learners).\r\n- Inclusion of international activities into implementation plans of the new curricula.\r\n- Developing an international learning pathway for students.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n- Updating the programme for international activities. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities the mobility periods are implemented according the ECVET procedures, the procedures of international activities are improved, internationalisation at home is expanded, internationalisation is spread into the different departments and students.

The mobility periods will commence in the autumn of 2017 through staff mobility periods. The purpose is to carry out all staff mobility periods before the student mobility periods take place. The staff will travel as teams of 2-4 people, with members of the various network colleges comprising each team. The goal of the staff mobility periods is to find out in a concrete way about the possibilities and work practices offered by each on-the-job training place and to develop the supervision practices in the on-the-job learning periods both abroad and in the home country.\r\n\r\nThe student mobility periods will be carried out after the staff mobility periods. In the student mobility periods, individuality and flexibility are emphasized in all stages, starting with the learning agreements.\r\nThe project makes it possible to develop a close cooperation between the colleges and the working life. As the result of the project, we conform the practices used in our national network, export good and functional practices abroad and develop the supervision of on-the-job learning periods in the home country based on the good practices obtained abroad. We also develop the eTaitava online guidance portal to support on-the-job learning taking place abroad.  We can share the knowledge obtained from the use of the eTaitava application after the project both in the home country and abroad in future projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, we produce professionals who can answer more effectively to the needs of the working life around Finland, and we educate qualified personnel both in the colleges and in working life who will form national and international networks during the mobility periods. The personnel that has participated in mobility periods understands the significance of the on-the-job learning periods as part of the qualification and they are able to recognize the skills and the knowhow acquired by the students during their mobility periods.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034525_5"], [2014, "European Mobility: Key Opportunity for a New Generation", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 125370.0, 12, 30, "The goal of ADICE, and of the project, is to ensure the social and professional development of the learners (including those with fewer opportunities), by participating in a valuable mobility experience.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centres. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally.  The development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities.  The aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce.  Objectives and expected resultsThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning. The exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country. In addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  With the help of this experience the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. The second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. This time the development activities are focused on the following issues: - Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI)- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. - Formalise a model and a structure of an international study path for Hyria\u2019s students. MobilityThis application comprises 42 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. In 2017 there will be 5 students from fewer backgrounds (economical) selected and granted an additional support for living and cultural expenses.Teacher and staff mobility (20 persons) is connected to work life periods, visiting new partners in Sweden, Italy, Portugal and Poland, and visiting Norway to learn more about revolution of the automobile sector. In the future the majority of cars are assumed to be electric ones, and this change will have an effect on an operation of garages. In Norway every fifth new car is and electric car already now.

In addition, 10 pupils from the AV department are sent to the UK for the very first time.\r\nStudents get the opportunity to carry out this internship in companies and educational institutions of the EU to broaden their horizan but also to open up the European dimension to them regarding Europe as potential workplace. Professional experience abroad is particularly important in the IT and media sector for qualified specialists. This project also intends to improve the use of English as a \"technical language\" in the IT - and also within the media environment. Most of the facilities, which take on apprentices are selected by the sending agencies, whose suitability has already been demonstrated in past projects. In addition, one can say that all the institutions being involved in this project, already have several years of experience with our trainees. It is therefore fairly easy to define most of the learning arrangements for the stays of our trainees. The applicant institution knows most of the responsible persons personally and there is mutual trust.\r\nStudents of the AV-department will do their internships in Plymouth and London to the following dates:\r\n2.07.- 29.07.2017 (London), 10.07.- 29.07.2017 (Plymouth), 18.06.2017- 30.07.2018 (London) and 18.06.2017 - 15.07.2017. \r\nThe activities have started by informing possible participants in the summer of 2016 and have carried on until the beginning of 2017. After their application, preliminary contracts are concluded. For the students the process of applying has started in 2016 and will  continue in 2017 for the year 2018. (The target period for the AV-internships in 2018 are also the months of June and July, depending on the offer of the partner institutions.) From January 2017 the linguistic and cultural preparations will begin. The participants then apply to the partner institutions. As soon as a commitment is made, the participant contract is concluded and the first part of the grant is passed. Learning arrangements between the project partner, the partner institution and the participants will be  coordinated. At the same time the participants organize trips and accommodation with the support of the partner institution. The implementation of the business practice is continuously evaluated by the partner institutions and the project executing agency.\r\nThe intention is to deepen the knowledge acquired in the area of IT,  media design/ egineering and event technology by the students abroad as well as to gather practical experiences in this field of work. It is also intended to apply action-oriented self-controlled learning methods within this project.\r\nThe participants have the following targets set:\r\n- to expand their professional competence\r\n- to acquire intercultural competence\r\n- to broaden personal competences, especially in the area of self-organisation\r\n- to improve their language competency in English\r\n- to acquire basic language skills in the language of the country", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003941_3"], [2018, "Integrated Services for Active Ageing - jobs and innovative entrepreneurship", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 76288.0, 2, 3, "\u03a4he elderly care as an economic field\r\n\r\nThe care of the aging population of European countries is emerging in an area that is developing economically. The European Union calls this economic growth a Silver Economy.\r\n\r\nThere is a increase in the activities of small and dynamic businesses, and new jobs are created with fairly good wages. The reasons are many and well known. Among them, we will highlight the fact that older people are not meant to be patients but citizens who want help and care so that, despite their chronic illness, they remain active in social and economic life. This is the importance of active aging.\r\n\r\nIn order to finance care, they do not resort to their insurance funds, but to their own pensions, which come from earlier periods of economic blossom. The services are not limited only to the medical aspect of the issue but also to its technological aspects. We see smartphone applications, sos buttons, geo-fences,\r\n\r\nEuropean policies on active aging\r\n\r\n\u00a0The EU institutions therefore support active aging so that health problems do not automatically lead to the exclusion of the elderly and its excessive dependence on third parties. (Charter of Fundamental Rights, No 21.1 and 25). They also apply economic policies, especially for elderly people with chronic diseases such as Horizon2020, the InCasa (ICT-PSP) network that has developed an ICT-based system that integrates health and environment monitoring with a focus on the elderly person himself.\r\n\r\nAims \r\n\r\nWith the main aim of expanding the professional opportunities of our graduates in this quality field, we ended up submitting this project to the subject of integrated care for the elderly with chronic conditions. Our school is located in western Thessaloniki and its students are stuck in a vicious circle of unemployment because they come from social strata hit by the country's economic crisis.\r\n\r\nWe aim to increase our professional qualifications to integrated care services for the elderly with chronic conditions. We chose the United Kingdom where health-care is one of the comparative advantages of the country's economy. Vocational training at British Institutions providing health education is recognized as a major asset throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nDuring the placement phase, the beneficiaries will be taught theoretical subjects at seminars, will be trained in vocational training centers, will be guided in laboratory and professional settings, to companies providing comprehensive care services for people with chronic illnesses.

The selection criteria are as follows: reliability, independence, self-initiative, consistency, meeting deadlines, practical class evaluation, willingness to cooperate, communication skills, flexibility and knowledge of English. We think that a comprehensive insight into a student is essential and that excellent school results  are not the most important evaluating principles. We have also included another criterion according to which students from underprivileged families  should be given  precedence.

The general aim is to give the students an international survey on the  world of work in the three participating countries. As the three languages Englisch, French and Spanish are taught at school, it is evident that they are not only prepared for job qualifications but also linguistically.An international work placement is a good occasion to get to know how business works in these three countries and to improve their intercultural competences.Also the employers have acknowledged that language skills are very important for their trainees and ask the school to provide international work placements.The participants schould be given the opportunity to enlarge their business knowledge and to put it into practice.

The project comes out of significant needs of school, which are met by its implementation.The offer of educational programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased to the current 880. To meet the educational needs of our students, we extended the number of cooperating organizations in this project up to the current 9 and we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. Apart from several school educational programmes under Applied Chemistry there are some other programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, Cosmetic Services and apprenticeship Hairdresser. We plan mobilities into six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Our project partners are vocational schools, technical colleges and businesses. With four of our partners we realize reciprocal mobilities.The receiving organizations for students in chemical branches are vocational schools (SBG Dresden, IIS Scalcerle Padova, SOS Chemical Bratislava), two technical colleges (University of Plymouth and the University of Nicosia) and a Spanish pharmaceutical company BIOT Microgen, mediated by Europroyectos LdV Granada.Students in the branch of Fire Protection will participate in an internship at The Secondary School of Construction in \u017dilina, which disposes of excellent technical background in the fire fighting equipment and works closely with the Secondary School of Fire Protection, which will also partake in our students training.Students in the field of Security and Legal Studies pass their practice at the Faculty of Safety Engineering University of \u017dilina, namely the Department of Safety Engineering and the Department of Emergency Engineering.For students of Cosmetic Services and Hairdresser we secured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Secondary Vocational School (Beauty and Care School).Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET. Some units of learning outcomes have been created in previous projects and some new are just being created.Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Safety Engineering, and vocational teachers in Applied Chemistry who will complete training programme at IIS Scalcerle in Padua.On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical skills, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the requirements imposed on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment on the European labor market.  Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).On the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science.

Siauliai VET centre strives to increase the motivation of students, to develop the gained professional practical skills, to develop their entrepreneurship by participating in the mobility project: Siauliai VET seeks that the mobility of learners, their practical working experience in foreign VET centres (practical professional training) and organisations (practical training in the workplace) encourages the educational motivation, increases interest in the profession, develops practical \u2013 professional skills, intercultural as well as interpersonal features so that this all complex of developed skills and competences helps a young person to get ready for the work in a contemporary labour market better. \r\nUnder conclusions of the Board of Europe (meeting of Board for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport in Brussels, 20 May 2014), it is possible to state that the entrepreneurship is an important driving force for the economic growth and new workplaces: it encourages the establishment of new workplaces, opens new markets and possibilities, increases the productivity, and develops the wellbeing. Educating of entrepreneurship increases the employment possibilities for youth. Educating of entrepreneurship, especially in small and medium enterprises is the backbone of the European Union economy. At the same time it is possible to state that education of entrepreneurship as well as its promotion is an important factor, influencing the personal development of youth. It is important to encourage the work of youth, their practical experience in the workplace (together with informing, advising, counselling),  because it helps not only to get new professional skills, but also forms premises for the youth to plan the future career or even develop plans for the own business. How can Siauliai VET centre help the learners to get ready to enter the global world of business environment? How are they prepared to participate in the development or even the creation of business? Community of Siauliai VET centre perfectly understanding the importance of this seeks for new ways to include new aids and tools into VET as well as to offer possibilities for learners to develop not only in the professional sphere, but also to develop their perception of entrepreneurship, its importance upon integration into the contemporary labour market not only on the local, but also on the international level. \r\nSiauliai VET centre aims:\r\n1) To increase mastery in VET as well as the quality and relevance, to increase motivation of learners, to develop their practical professional skills though international mobility, practical learning within intercultural environment by developing working skills.\r\n2) To promote innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship by forming premises to work in an international business environment with encouragement of imitativeness, creativity and activity. \r\n3) To develop competences of the foreign language.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-LT01-KA102-013139_5"], [2015, "Fit f\u00fcr IT in Europa", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 53880.0, 5, 6, "In our vocational school we train in a three year full-time school course in secondary education students in vocational training and for the entrance to universities of applied science.

Student mobility can be a life-changing experience and a student's statement  \"Sara, since you came back from Spain, you are much friendlier and even fun\" testifies to a profound transformation that this particular student underwent. A teacher that categorically refused to go anywhere because she could not speak the language is now asking when she is finally going to travel somewhere. International cooperation and student mobilities are one of the few project that really work and that keep us going despite the paperwork. What is more, our school is one of very few vocational schools that still manages to fill up its classrooms despite the dropping numbers of students enrolling in vocational schools. This is the context that keeps inspiring us and makes us persistently participate in transnational mobility.Main goals are to :- enhance the number of students involved in mobility projects- improve the quality of cooperation between institutions and organizations providing education, companies, social partners   and other European organizations- develop innovative solutions, subjects and services in the field of hairdressing- promote mobility as a part of lifelong learning process- enhance the students' confidence regarding their professional knowledge and skills- improve their command of English and enable them to practice and use vocabulary related to hairdressing- contribute to school's good reputation - establish a long term cooperation through yearly student exchanges- encourage the promotion of intercultural dialogue- commitment to constant upgrading of quality of student mobility.The expected outcomes are as follows:- improved quality of education- application and integration of new experience, knowledge into the process of vocational education- highly motivated students as well as teachers- increased number of students who enroll in our school- better possibilities of employment for students at home as well as abroad (Europass mobility)- better command of English and increased confidence in communication in English - established professional and personal contacts- yearly student exchanges including work placement- increased level of intercultural tolerance.

As a component of the course, internships provide an answer to the need to create working conditions for the knowledge and skills acquired at school to be tested and assessed in a real working environment. The project aims at broadening the range of this critical part of the students' studies, providing  working placements with an international context. These participants will therefore do their curricular internship period at British companies located in the area of Plymouth, for 10 weeks.\r\n\r\nBy testing and evaluating in a real working environment, internships buffer the transitional impact from school to work. If that is attained at an international level, with the appropriate linguistic, cultural and social preparation, then the skills obtained to prepare professional life acquire an added value as new opportunities arise in the European labour market. The project also provides these pre-working youngsters a solution that makes up for the saturation of the small and economically recessive Portuguese market in their professional areas, thus providing a widening of their professional expectations. \r\n\r\nThis project combines three needs that must be addressed together in order to achieve an integral and encompassing training that fully prepares students for a truly European experience:\r\n- proficiency in the \"techspeak\" of the student's area of work;\r\n- bridging the school environment to the employment environment;\r\n- providing a broadened international experience, qualification and validation that may extend the professional prospects of vocational students.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the students' linguistic skills will not only improve in the scope of the project, that is, in the specific jargon of their working area, but also in the daily use of the language, thanks to the immersion during the 10 weeks of the project.

Finally, there will also be an English course during the mobility, organised by our partner AVL; \r\n- Social and cultural preparation through a number of meetings/sessions with the participants to enrich their knowledge of the host country (U.K.) - habits, traditions, lifestyle to prevent a big cultural clash.

For a greater impact of the project (both in schools and at the county level) in order to provide a wider context for the exchange and transfer of the best practices, ISJ Tulcea constituted a national consortium, which includes secondary schools with a similar profile of the school population, with common needs and challenges. The consortium was formed on the premise that changing the culture of the organizations should not occur in a singular way, but in a pluralism of ideas, actions and actors of change.Thus the three educational institutions have more chances of succeeding to integrate the European values in order to become inclusive schools, schools open to all children, schools open to the local community and Europe.Through the plan for European development, in the consortium has been identified the need to increase social inclusion of pupils aged between 5 and 14 years old, Roma children, children with special needs and children from disadvantaged groups identified in the three schools.The aim of the EVIS project is to train a total of 18 teachers from pre-school, primary school and secondary school in developing modern integration strategies in order to increase the inclusion of children aged 5-14 from disadvantaged groups.The objectives are:- Continuing professional development of 18 teachers through training in the field of inclusive educational practices during the school year 2016-2017;- Involving a total of 18 teachers in the implementation and promotion of inclusive and non \u2013 discriminatory practices favouring the access to education and equal opportunities in school and in the community, during the project and on the long term;- Participation of 18 teachers to the monitoring and assessment of the impact of the inclusive educational practices on the school teams from pre-school, primary and secondary levels and in particular of the 203 Roma students, 25 students with SEN and 352 pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.The participants at the mobility are 18 tenured teachers in the schools of the consortium working with students from different backgrounds, students with special educational needs and Roma students. They have skills in foreign language communication and team working and their needs for professional development training are similar to the development needs of the school.In order to meet the need identified by the European development plan, the project management team has selected three training courses that provide the participants the development of modern integration strategies for increasing the inclusion of students in pre-school, primary and secondary levels.

Description of the activities:The principal mission given to volunteers is to share the lives of people with disabilities (residents). Alongside these, the volunteers contribute, via the larger purpose of the institution, to the protection of the environment (workshops related to organic farming) and to the development of activities in the cultural and artistic realm as well as sports.Methodology for conducting the project / support:Each volunteer is part of a team of four employees (educators) and a second volunteer. Volunteers participate in regular activities in the workshops (garden, farm, herb workshop, cooking), alongside the workshop master, residents and other volunteers. They are always under the responsibility of an employee.Each volunteer is accompanied by a tutor with whom he meets twice a month for one hour.

While thousands of refugees/immigrants flow into Europe, the extremism rises even to the extent of using terrorist violence against fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nYoung people become an easy victim of these behaviors. Lacking their own critical thinking and inner motivation for being active citizens, they indulge into manipulations and threads starting from violent behaviors in school. School crime, bullying and violence are major concerns and pose an increasing challenge for the European Union authorities. School bullying is a nowadays a widespread phenomenon which takes many forms, such as discriminatory bullying against minority groups, homophobic bullying and bullying against students with special needs. It can also concern any other students who seem vulnerable for or different from their peers.\r\n\r\nIn this context, there is a need to strengthen the common European values of freedom, tolerance, respect for diversity and non-discrimination. The 2015 Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education comes to light the way to deal with them: education. Knowing though, that school system is overloaded with strict curriculum goals, out of school learning (Non-Formal Learning) can play a key role in this! Youth work can have a significant impact in cultivating critical thinking and fundamental values among young people, preventing extremism, violence and radicalization. In fact, the Youth Work Report 2014 has identified that youth work can result in a range of positive effects for youth which enable them to enhance competences, reinforce their network and social capital, improve particular behaviors and develop positive relationships. Given this, we want to develop this project in order for youth workers of today to acquire additional competences and methods that prevent the violent radicalization of young people, especially among to the hard to reach young people (minorities, migrants etc.).\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is thus to develop the competences of youth workers for preventing violent radicalization of young people, particularly to the hard to reach young people \r\nIts objectives are: \r\n\u2022\tTo develop understanding about the common reality all over Europe regarding violent radicalization\r\n\u2022\tTo raise awareness about the reasons for radicalization happens among young people in different parts of society\r\n\u2022\tTo increase the knowledge/awareness of youth workers regarding what young people need to develop fundamental values.\r\n\u2022\tTo develop skills to prevent violence and radicalization of young people, particularly to the hard to reach youth.\r\n\u2022\tTo equip with innovative methods and tools for working with hard to reach young people\r\n\u2022\tTo increase the fundamental values on youth workers themselves and motivate them to work for strengthening these values with their target groups\r\n\u2022\tTo develop follow-up activities targeting hard to reach young people\r\n\r\nThis project supports the professional development of youth workers and significantly improves the level of their key competences. Using methods from non-formal and experiential learning and innovative concepts in youth work, it aims at achieving a better future society, infused by human rights respect, active citizenship, intercultural dialogue, social inclusion and solidarity. In the end of the project, youth workers will have improved competences and better quality in their work and activities in favor of young people.\r\n\r\nBuild Inner Peace - Bring Outer Peace project has one activity - a learning mobility of youth workers from the Programme countries. 31 people will participate in this mobility, 27 of which will be participants (learners), 3 will form the trainer\u2019s team and 1 person will be administrative and logistic support. The training will take place from 06 - 14 November 2018, at the educational center \"School in the Nature\", Gudevica village near the town of Smolyan in the Rhodope Mountains. The main activity in the project is a training course for Youth workers. The TC will contain of 7 full training days. The participants will be from 9 countries \u2013 Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, UK, Italy, France, Greece, Hungary and Estonia.\r\n\r\nThere are four competence areas that the learners (Youth workers) will develop through this project:\r\n1.\tAddressing the topic of violent radicalization\r\n2.\tDelivering workshops/activities against radicalization\r\n3.\tWorking with hard to reach target groups (NEET, youth with fewer opportunities, refugees, and migrants)\r\n4.\tPerforming high quality youth work based on professional expertise", "http://www.amber-initiatives.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BG01-KA105-047569_2"], [2016, "Your Space!", "Amber  Initiatives", 18002.0, 4, 4, "The project called \u201eYour Space!\u201d is and EVS project organised by \u201eThe House of Children and Youth of the Capital Prague\u201c in the Czech Republic and is planned  for three volunteers with fewer opportunities, one coming from England, one from Bulgaria and one from Slovakia.
