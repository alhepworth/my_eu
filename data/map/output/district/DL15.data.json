Leonard Cheshire Disability has grown to have over 200 services throughout the UK over 65 years. We support over 21,000 disabled people in the UK, providing innovative services that give disabled people the opportunity to live a life without barriers. We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society. The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. \r\n\r\nThe EVS project will take place in three Leonard Cheshire services, located across the UK: Fethneys, Bradbury House and Arnold House.  The project involve 6 volunteers, 2 volunteers per every service and will last 12 months with starting dates in March and May 2016. The volunteers are aged from 22 to 29 years old and  come from Egypt, Germany, Greece and Spain. \r\n\r\nVolunteers selected for this project have background in social work, psychology, education or engineering and logistics and have previous personal or professional experience supporting people with disabilities. They are great candidates with the right among of experience and interest in disability issues, and they all express their wish to continue working towards bettering the conditions and rights for people with disability and interest in developing their personal competences as well as in the field social care and working with disabled people as well as gaining international experience. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is goes in line with our organisational goal: to ensure that residents are provided with the opportunity to live their lives the way they choose - with the support to live independently. This is achieved through the following objectives:\r\n1. To introduce new, diversified activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective\r\n2. To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals and with accessing local community services and leisure activities\r\n3. To promote local and international volunteering\r\n4. To raise disability awareness for the volunteers and in the local community\r\n5. To support fundraising efforts to raise funds that will support the above mentioned aim\r\n\r\nOur members of staff provide the necessary care and assistance to enable residents to live as independent and full a life as possible.  However, it is the volunteer who can give extra time and attention to the residents. Our volunteers are actively involved in shaping their EVS experiences by developing the activities plan with residents and staff. Volunteers bring their own ideas, skills and passions to share with residents. As a result, the role is varied depending on their own skills and interests, and the needs of residents and the activities they like to engage in. \r\n\r\nActivities take place either in the home or in the local areas, and the delivery of activities is heavily influenced by the skills and motivation of our volunteers to design a creative and fun activity programme. Activities include but are not limited to: arts and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, movement, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraising, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes.\r\n\r\nDiversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community. This will improve residents' confidence which we envisage will lead to long term benefits of getting residents to do things like volunteering, organising events, talking about disability issues in the local community and be more involved in decisions made locally and nationally in regards to the care sector and disability issues.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally. In addition, participants will improve their life skills and key competences through working and communicating with diverse people and gaining a better understanding and solidarity with people who face barriers to participate in society. The placement will provide the volunteers with the opportunity to gain insight into the social services sector, which may help them decide on a career path.\r\n\r\nThe project will also have a positive impact on our staff, and LCD as a whole. It opens a dialogue between people from from different countries about how different societies and cultures work with disabled people and works towards Leonard Cheshire Disability's goal of challenging perceptions of disability.", "http://www.leonardcheshire.org", "Leonard Cheshire Disability", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035287_2"]]}}, "8QG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "DIGITAL GRIOTS", "Crook Primary School", 103044.0, 7, 8, "In the 21st century, the use of technology and being online are a way of life. That is why, being good digital citizens and coaching students to model good digital citizenship and safe online behavior takes on greater importance. The Internet is becoming a primary hub for everything from communication and education to commerce and social networking.  For each of these venues, we must strive to agree upon  consistent values and limitations which will prevent people from being exposed to content such as extreme violence, pornography, gambling, or illegal downloads. As we move forward into an era driven by the capacities of online media, the issue of access must be addressed. This is the world we live in. We need to be ready for it - that\u2019s why digital readiness isn\u2019t just about deciding when or when your child shouldn\u2019t have access to smart devices. It\u2019s about how and when you to teach them to protect themselves long after you lay down the parental controls. Too often we are seeing students as well as adults misusing and abusing technology but not sure what to do. The issue is more than what the users do not know but what is considered appropriate technology usage. The purpose of this project is to equip the technology users with vital skills to survive in the digital world.In order to develop digital literacy, the following topics will be studied during the project;\r\n- Information Literacy\r\n- Communication Literacy\r\n- Visual Literacy\r\n- Social Literacy\r\n- Technology Literacy\r\n- Media Literacy\r\nThe project's objectives are;\r\n-develop digital literacy skills of the participants\r\n-develop a strategy for using skills in information literacy over an extended period of time;\r\n-teach students about both the benefits and risks of the online world and help students stay safer there\r\n-monitor progress and adapt  strategy as necessary, to achieve the quality of outcomes required.\r\n-evaluate  overall strategy and present outcomes from your work, including citations and a bibliography.\r\n-become a confident \u201cDigital Citizenship Champion\u201d in their community.\r\n-recognise where there is a knowledge or information \u2018gap\u2019, and identify what type of information you need to fill it.\r\nThere are partners from Turkey,Bulgaria,Greece,Poland,Portugal and England.

It is the development a novel low cost, high efficiency linear generator for marine wave energy extraction, (Snapper). Initially embedded within \u2018Point Absorbers\u2019 and then transferable to other marine energy type capture devices, both wave and tidal, with energy efficiency of the generator of between 75%-80%. The primary advantage of the Snapper technology extending it beyond the state of the art is its ability to act as a magnetic gearing system. This leads to a significant reduction of the mass of the materials needed within the electrical generator, especially rare earth magnets. This will result in a cost saving, based on the raw materials from over \u20ac40k to under \u20ac7k for a 175KW electrical machine. This will enable a step change in the economic potential for the conversion of wave energy into electricity.

Results for \"CINEMA EDUCATIONAL: FROM NON-FORMAL LEARNING ADAPTATION TO A CURRICULUM\" can be a first look at the upcoming adaptation of educational curricula to promote ICT and digital competence.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of this methodological tool is essential in learning, as the educational film offers an insights into the study of society, promoting interculturalism through knowledge of different cultures, form views about our history and future events, contact values, ideas, thoughts, attitudes, norms ... \r\n\r\nThese and other aspects make the educational film a resource that should be promoted among teachers, but also integrating them into the curriculum at all levels.

Divisions were highlighted by increased number of migrants and refugees in Europe in recent years. In the context of information wars the manipulation of information, biased coverage stoke negative attitudes not only towards refugees, but also towards other people of ethnic or religious minority backgrounds.\r\n\r\nIssues of division and lack of tolerance are recognized by young people as well. Young people from Durham County and Lithuanian ethnic minority communities are both vulnerable to marginalization and discrimination, but they themselves often can have negative attitudes towards others who are different. At the end of the youth event that took place in 2016 in Lithuania, young people expressed interest in exploring these issues, its reasons and effects, and their own personal responsibility more in depth. These young people formed youth initiative group. This project was prepared according to its ideas and proposals.\r\n\r\nYoung people involved in this project usually do not have many opportunities to travel outside their communities, meet peers from different cultural backgrounds, they often do not have sufficient skills to analyze and critically evaluate public information. The experiences of young people in UK and Lithuania are similar in some ways and different in others, so they have an opportunity to learn from each other. UK has more experience in dealing with issues faced by LGBT+ community, people with mental health issues, immigrants. Lithuania is heavily influenced by information wars, its experts have extensive knowledge about manipulation, distortion of information, and have experience in developing critical thinking skills, which are key in promoting tolerance and respect for others.\r\n\r\nProject goals set by youth initiative group: 1) to better understand issues regarding discrimination, division, alienation, refugees, their causes, one\u2018s relationships with others, ways to change; 2) meet peers, learn about their culture, make friends; 3) become more tolerant and open, learn to analyze information critically, get rid of stereotypes. \r\n \r\nTarget group: 13-30-year-old (the majority being 14-19-years old) young people from UK and Lithuania. Total: 60 participants. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of 3 main activities:\r\n1. Preparatory meeting, where organizational and other issues related to the exchange will be discussed by participating organizations and youth initiative group members.  \r\n2. Exchange meeting (9 days). Taking into consideration suggestions of young people, participants of the exchange meeting will engage in creative artistic activities (as previous experience with vulnerable youth shows, art is a helpful tool to explore sensitive, difficult issues, such as discrimination, bullying and so on). By using interactive methods - role plays, forum theater, good examples studies, etc. - young people will examine behavioral patterns, roles in the community, construction of identity and will search for positive forms of civic action. By exploring mechanisms of creation of different messages and images in the media, young people will develop critical thinking skills, resilience to manipulations, stereotypes and labels. Participants will learn more about each others culture, by, for example, preparing traditional national dishes, learning national dances, going on an excursion, etc.\r\nYoung people will actively participate in all stages of the project: propose topics, facilitate activities. Professional artists, human rights, tolerance experts, journalists will be their advisers and act as consultants. \r\n3. Distribution of aquired knowledge and experience to the communities. 4 events planned by young people will be organized in order to present project results, share experiences, initiate discussions.
