Our school was judged to be \u2018good\u2019 by Ofsted in January 2014 and was described as a \u201cvibrant community school\u201d. We are continually looking at ways to improve and becoming an outstanding school. Our staff team is dedicated and share a common vision for achieving the best outcomes for our children. We are proud of our positive working relationships with parents and place great emphasis on working together to support their child\u2019s learning.  We benefit from close partnerships with our local high schools and cluster schools.\r\n\r\nWe currently deliver French in KS2 and have just commenced basic Spanish in Reception. Early evidence suggests this is already having a positive impact on language development in early years. Our plan is to incorporate languages across all age groups for the first time from September 2015, enhance our innovative teaching and resources techniques across the curriculum, and increase our use of ICT and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in language teaching.\r\n\r\nWe would like to share our expertise with parents, through basic language workshops and further develop our supportive role as a \u201chub school\u201d, offering support and encouragement to other schools within our local authority and enabling them to make links with French and Spanish schools.\r\n\r\nWe are applying for structured training courses which include a school link. The courses provide intensive language training, cultural immersion and activities, teaching methodology focused on primary languages teaching, ways of using ICT to support language learning and the opportunity to spend time in French and Spanish schools, making lasting links with staff and pupils and gaining an understanding of their culture and education system.  \r\n\r\nWe plan to use 8 mobilities in France and Spain over a two year period:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Spain \u2013 attendance will include; MFL co-ordinator, EYFS teacher, teaching assistant, head and deputy head. \r\nThis course will focus on the language, intercultural and teaching skills required for commencing delivery of Spanish from September 2015, teaching methodology and a lasting link with the Spanish school.  Senior staff involvement will focus on subject management such as timetabling, continuing professional development, progression, strategic school inclusion, school partnership project opportunities, longer term language developments and International Schools Award criteria.\r\n\r\n\u2022 France \u2013 attendance by Y5 teacher. To develop language skills, intercultural knowledge and methodology so he could lead delivery of French in Y4, 5 & 6, establish a link with a French school and share learning within our school cluster.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why we wish to carry out this project is to develop new, stronger links with schools in Spain and France to reinvigorate language teaching in school, bring language to life for pupils and support staff and pupils\u2019 intercultural understanding through the opportunity to engage regularly with children in other countries. Our objective is to make use of the opportunity to take part in the mobilities in Spain and France and to ensure that these links are long-lasting and beneficial to all schools. We want our pupils and staff to be excited at the prospect of language learning and to take opportunities to communicate with French and Spanish staff and pupils regularly using the technology available to them. \r\n\r\nThe linguistic confidence of all 8 members of staff attending the mobilities and their understanding of the culture of the country they are visiting will have a significant impact on the school as a whole.", "http://www.brindlegregsonlane.lancs.sch.uk", "Brindle Gregson Lane Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013225_coordinator"], [2017, "Spanish Language Development at BGL", "Brindle Gregson Lane Primary School", 11226.0, 1, 1, "Brindle Gregson Lane Primary School in Lancashire is an average sized primary schools .

Our healthy school status, the range of physical activity we offer combined with giving children additional jobs and responsibility means that individuals\u2019 personal development is of the highest priority.  \r\n\r\nWe are involved in a 2015 Erasmus + project (2015-1-UK01-KA101-013225) which will terminate in summer 2017. As a result of this project, our subject leader is now training staff through INSET and staff meetings in language skills in Spanish, our Teaching Assistants are now delivering Spanish sessions in certain year groups in school, and Spanish is now embedded throughout school as main language of learning. \r\n\r\nThe confidence of staff involved has increased through the teaching ideas learned and good practice shared.\r\n\r\nLanguages are a key element of our school development plan and we intend to use this experience to drive our school forward both in terms of our own language teaching and also in the support we will offer to other schools. \r\n\r\nWe need to build on the success of our current project. We don\u2019t want to lose the impetus begun and want a second project to begin straightaway leading on from the first. Our new project will enable us to introduce Spanish in KS2, and further develop language capacity across our school. \r\n\r\nBased on the success of our previous project in taking forward our teaching of Spanish we have decided to move from teaching Spanish at KS1 and French at KS2 to a more coherent strategy whereby Spanish is taught across the whole school and learning is progressively built on from Reception to Y6.\r\n\r\nWe would like to develop a second project that will lead seamlessly from our current project, furthering our aims and building on our success. This will involve six members of staff (one of which will be our languages coordinator) taking part in 8 day structured training courses in Santander, Spain. \r\n\r\nThese will be for immersion courses in Spain incorporating intensive language training, cultural immersion and activities, teaching methodology focused on primary languages teaching and the opportunity to spend time in the Spanish link school. This will be with the same course provider as our original project. We are confident that the courses will be of high quality and suitable for our needs.\r\n\r\nWe have already begun self-teaching Spanish to revise some basic skills. We have also enlisted some local authority CPD to further develop our language skills. We have already employed a \u2018language specialist\u2019 teaching assistant so we have greater provision on delivering languages from September and will use this member of staff's language skills to help prepare us for our visits. We have planned some staff language courses, primarily for staff involved in the courses  but also the for whole school staff to enhance the profile of languages in our school. Our intention is to roll this out to parent beginner language sessions.\r\n\r\nThere will be a great impact on our curriculum as Spanish will be taught more consistently throughout the school, rather than just in KS1. This will impact on progression and long term attainment.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to disseminate the results of our project to our pupils through the changes we make to our teaching. We will have greater confidence in our linguistic and cultural knowledge and will also have lots of new teaching ideas. We will timetable special sessions in order to disseminate information about our courses and the project as a whole to all of our pupils. We will also have whole school assemblies at regular intervals during the course of the project and will use display areas to inform pupils and staff about what we are doing.\r\n\r\nThis project will follow on seamlessly from our current project. We will make good use of the final evaluation data from project 1 to give us a strong baseline to measure the impact of our second project.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the project, we will review our objectives and assess where we are already. We will then measure our progress against this. For example, we will audit the language knowledge of all our staff and pupils.

Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery. The course, once developed, will be deployed to 45 trainees each in UK, Spain, Norway and Denmark over 4 days during a 7 month period. In parallel, the eCourse will be deployed in one region to test the right balance for blended learning and assess the most suitable platforms for its deployment. The toolkit will be built on the project website.\r\n\r\nThe third phase will focus on evaluating the course and assessing its impact on the target group and external stakeholders. During this phase, the curriculum and course will also be tested in a Central and an Eastern European country with differing cultural and health and care system characteristics. A sustainability plan laying the foundations for the future of the project and its intellectual outputs will be delivered towards the end of the project.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and impact: The ALTAS project will deliver a fit-for-purpose standards and curriculum, assessment framework and course materials for  health and social care professionals. These deliverables will be supported by an eCourse, a course deployment toolkit and a comprehensive evaluation report. The ALTAS project is expected to (1) raise awareness and increase knowledge of ALT for front-line health and social care staff and their managers, (2) increase motivation in staff to take ALT courses, (3) increase staff willingness and confidence to promote ALT, (4) increase interest in the ALT workforce to exchange and share good practice across Europe and (5) increase collaboration and cooperation between training organisations and ALT suppliers.", "http://www.lancashirecare.nhs.uk", "NHS Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013710_7"]]}}, "6BL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1238544000000, 1317340800000, "Non-toxic and Cost-Effective Essential Oil-based Nematicide and Soil Delivery System", "Plant Impact Plc", "Nematodes or roundworms are one of the most common soil-borne parasites that feed on plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds - constituting a major contributor to agricultural crop losses.
