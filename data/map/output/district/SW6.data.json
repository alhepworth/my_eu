Though Gender Equality is more than ever becoming reality we are not there yet. Women continue to earn and decide less and there is only one area where women count more than men - in the records of victims of violence. Women are still underrepresented, they earn less, and, worst of all, one in three women in the European Union has experienced physical and sexual violence. Also regarding the rights and acceptation of homosexuality and transsexualism there is still a long way to go. \r\n \r\nEuropean Union and the UK deserve credits for having tackled gender issues for a long time, however, gender equality situation both in the EU, the UK and the Neighboring countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Caucasus remains unsatisfactory. Conservative, discriminating values are hard to tackle, with clearly defined roles for men and women, gender stereotypes and issues with the expression of gender identity and sexual orientation. It is very important to enable youth workers and young leaders to feel and reflect about the power of gender and gender roles by giving them space to discuss, debate and learn more about the topic that often remains undiscussed. That is why we have designed this 2 stage project that envisages a Training Course for youth workers in Armenia as well as a Study Visit to the United Kingdom. With the project we tackle gender issues and look for solutions in our organizations, societies and daily lives.

Though Gender Equality is more than ever becoming reality there is a long way to go. Women continue to earn and decide less and there is only one area where women count more than men - in the records of victims of violence. Women are still underrepresented, they earn less, and, worst of all, one in three women in the European Union has experienced physical and sexual violence. Also regarding the rights and acceptation of homosexuality and transsexualism there is still a long way to go.  The European Union deserves credit for having tackled these issues for a long time, however, the gender equality situation both in the EU and the Neighboring countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Caucasus remains unsatisfactory. Conservative, discriminating values are hard to tackle, with clearly defined roles for men and women, gender stereotypes and issues with the expression of gender identity and sexual orientation.

Though Gender Equality is more than ever becoming reality there is a long way to go. Women continue to earn and decide less and there is only one area where women count more than men - in the records of victims of violence. Women are still underrepresented, they earn less, and, worst of all, one in three women in the European Union has experienced physical and sexual violence. Also regarding the rights and acceptation of homosexuality and transsexualism there is still a long way to go.  The European Union deserves credit for having tackled these issues for a long time, however, the gender equality situation both in the EU and the Neighboring countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Caucasus remains unsatisfactory. Conservative, discriminating values are hard to tackle, with clearly defined roles for men and women, gender stereotypes and issues with the expression of gender identity and sexual orientation.  It is very important to enable youth workers and young leaders to feel and reflect about the power of gender and gender roles by giving them space to discuss, debate and learn more about the topic that often remains undiscussed. That is why with this Training Course we would like to tackle these issues and look for solutions in our organizations and daily lives. We would like to develop and improve our participant\u2019s knowledge and understanding on various concepts related to gender issues, analyze traditions, roles and perceptions of gender in different countries and societies. It's obvious that there will be huge differences as participants will come from different realities and different corners of Europe. The Training Course \u201cChallenge 2 Change: Gender Perspectives in Europe\u201d will bring youth workers together from the EU (The Netherlands, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom) and Neighboring Partner Countries (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russian Federation, Ukraine). It will take place in Tatev, Armenia. Through the participation in different scale of activities as discussions, presentations, field visits, participants will exchange their skills and experiences on gender mainstreaming, gender discrimination, gender violence and gender perspectives in different parts of Europe and will know more about realities in Eastern Europe and Caucasus region. This will be unique platform for sharing practices and exchanging realities. Developing further projects and strategies for the promotion of Gender Equality on European and national levels will be the main outcome for the organizations involved in the project. Furthermore, we will discover what has been done so far and the role of youth work and youth organizations in the promotion of Gender Equality. Also it will be interesting and useful to discuss gender related challenges in Europe and Eastern Europe and Caucasus, sharing and comparing the realities of gender issues and best European practices as well as exploring which are the most vulnerable groups that suffer from gender inequalities and gender based discrimination. The main aim of the Training Course is to increase the awareness of youth workers and youth leaders about gender equality issues and perspectives in Europe and to provide the participants with skills to develop good quality projects locally and under the \u201cErasmus+\u201d programme focusing on the topic of Gender Equality. The objective of the Training Course are following: - To learn about gender equality issues and share / compare the realities in the European Union and Neighboring Partner countries;- To exchange experiences between youth workers and youth leaders on the difficulties to find a gender balance in terms of participation of women;- To develop participants knowledge and understanding on various concepts related to gender issues and emphasize the importance of gender equality in youth work and other areas;- To promote gender equality in youth work and international youth projects;- To facilitate networking process among participants and promote new common projects related to gender equality;- To develop the quality of support systems for youth activities and capability of youth organizations to create new partnerships. The Training Course will have also a practical side. In order to practice newly gained knowledge, the participants will plan concrete non-formal learning activities for concrete target groups (school leaders, youth with disabilities, etc.) that later can be implemented as project on their local levels or European level.

The unprecedented technological development and increased inter-dependence that the world is experiencing have not provided a solution to ones who are left outside the system, especially the young people with fewer opportunities who find it more and more difficult to meet the ever-changing labor market demands.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been aggravated given the current context concerning young migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Europe. The frustration and disempowerment of the disadvantaged youth in general and these young migrants and asylum seekers in particular can breed low self-esteem, low motivation, cynicism and radicalization.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of potential efforts and strategies to boost employment and job creation for young people, entrepreneurship is increasingly accepted as an important means and a valuable additional strategy to create jobs and improve livelihoods and economic independence of young people.

Extremist ideologies are not exclusively spreading in Europe but also in its Neighbouring countries. The EU is surrounded by number of countries that it has strong connections with through culture, language, religion and shared historical heritage. Recently the world has been reminded about the threat of extremism. This phenomenon is on the rise in Europe. Extremist movements, ideologies, parties and individuals present some of the most pressing challenges for European democracies. They continue to gain large levels of support from different segments of the society, even among some of the most economically secure and highly educated regions of Europe. Many young people are affected by populism and anti-immigration sentiments and fall into a very dangerous rhetoric.Taking into account those extremist movements in Europe, raising xenophobia and Islamophobia, we consider it highly important to gather active young people, youth workers and activists to discuss questions of multicultural society, interreligious and intercultural dialogue as well as to think about some practical tools how to fight discrimination and combat extremism. It is our belief that it is quite important to have a cultural and social connection with the neighbours around the EU in order to contribute to more understanding. Thanks to the meetings between young people and active youth workers, they can learn about the ways of living in other countries and different ways of thinking. In this way we can overcome differences and fight together against prejudice and xenophobia. That is why with this Training Course we target both the EU and non-EU countries. The training course will take place in Yerevan, Armenia and will involve 34 youth workers from Programme Countries (Lithuania, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom) and Neighbouring Partner Countries (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine). During the Training Course we will look deeper into the issues of extremism, migration, discrimination, nationalism, intolerance and intercultural misunderstandings. The Training Course will support young people and active youth workers to learn about the ways of living together, accepting differences and fighting together against prejudice and xenophobia in these turbulent times. In all participating countries, xenophobia and discrimination form a big problem. Especially economic crisis contributes to this situation, when immigrants are blamed for stealing jobs, etc. The refugee crisis even further complicated the situation. However, it doesn\u2019t matter if you come from the EU or non-EU country, what language you speak or which religion you follow, there is discrimination and extremism everywhere. This project aims at finding ways to combat it, by sharing experiences and by learning new tools. Our working methodology will be based on non-formal education.

It can also impact on person\u2019s ability to join in everyday activities. Communication is the main way we interact and express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, it can be very frustrating for the person and may result in challenging behaviour. Challenging behaviour is often seen in people coming from a difficult background  or in people with conditions that affect communication and the brain such as learning disabilities and mental health problems.  \r\n\r\nA person with challenging behaviour is not a \u2018problem\u2019 to be fixed and is not doing something \u2018wrong\u2019. However, behaviour is a sign that something is not working. It shows that there is some unfulfilled need or a problem with communication. It is not always easy to identify this lacuna making it difficult for the professionals working with them. In fact, the issues of challenging behaviour and how to deal with it were continuously brought up during our last project. The youth workers and youth leaders expressed the need to be given a new and fresh approach on how they should tackle young people with challenging behaviour. Often, the youth workers and youth leaders are faced with questions such as Are there new ways to include our young people with challenging behaviour? Can we find an alternative to exclusion? and How should a relationship with young people with challenging behaviour be?\r\n\r\nIndeed, FABRIC: Fresh Approaches to Behaviour and Relationship when working with young people with challenging behaviour aims to provide a practical guide to successful innovative strategies for improving behaviour and strengthening relationships for young people with challenging behaviour. What this training course aims to achieve is to equip youth workers with new skills that go beyond a rewards and sanctions approach to behaviour. In fact, our focus will be on those young people for whom rewards and punishments do not always work and who, most of the times, confuse those that work with them. We aim to take a relationship-based approach and to give participants an opportunity to think more deeply about why young people do the things they do and what our parts as adults is in creating, sustaining and changing these behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe training will thus give participants opportunities to reflect on their attitudes and practice in relation to young people\u2019s behaviour and relationship-building. Through innovative tools and methods, the participants will understand positive behaviour change and how this can be used to work with young people who are normally difficult to work with. Our aim is to empower youth workers and to inspire and uplift them through practical tips and techniques. This will be done by addressing the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- Reinforce and affirm good practice\r\n- Re-energise, stimulate and challenge thinking about inclusion of young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Increased understanding about behaviour and emotions\r\n- Increased confidence in managing young people with challenging behaviour\r\n- Access to a wider range of practical strategies to impact on behaviour challenges\r\n- Opportunity to  reflect on professional attitudes\r\n- Learn new skills and processes\r\n\r\nThis training course will take place in Malta between the 5 - 11 November 2017.

We will invite a total of 13 countries from Europe, including partners from Mediterranean Area\r\n\r\nThe prevention and decoding of attitudes and behaviours connected with religious fanaticism among young Europeans, the exchange and development of good practices creating a network of international associations with different competent bodies that could serve as a multiplying effect will be promoted.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nTo promote reasonable judgments and objectivity against religious fanaticism, promoting peace, harmony and respect between different cultures.\r\n\r\nTo improve and disseminate proposals on the risk posed by the radicalization of the European youth and to inculcate ideas that prevent these young people from being captured and recruited by extremist networks.\r\n\r\nTo learn best practices for the drafting of new projects aimed at young people at risk of being radicalised, with the support of the Erasmus+: Youth in Action programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a network of organisations to work together, both in the long and in the short term, from an anti-religious perspective. The goal will be starting a multiplier effect in order to strengthen and improve their role at the local, national and international level.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the democratic thinking and behaviour among all young Europeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these objectives are among the priorities of the Erasmus+ programme, which supports hate speech initiatives that are essential for living together in a peaceful and harmonious society.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be based on interactive learning, as well as in personal and social autonomy skills, together with a mix of theoretical contents and practical exercises, evaluations, group and plenary debates, video presentations, informative talks, documentaries, personal experiences, brainstorming, etc. Learning will come from the experience and reflection of each participant, as well as from the group work. This project will be structured on theoretical and practical contributions according to the experimental learning, supported by different sessions in which the competences acquired will be evaluated - i. e., the participants will receive feedback. At the same time, we will share tools and establish foundations to make an impact at the local, regional, national and European level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course activities will be based on the principles and values of non-formal education taking into account the needs, motivation and experience of the participants. The expected result is the establishment of an international network that works and collaborates in the creation of new values and attitudes against religious anti-radicalism among young Europeans. The level of involvement of participants and partners will be actively stimulated in all phases of the project through the \"give and take\" principle and through participatory learning methods of non-formal education. The communication will be made possible through social networks and will last after the completion of the project. The main language to be used during the project will be English. We hope that the long and short term benefits will be beneficial for the construction of a democratic society that lives in peace and harmony and develops new attitudes and behaviours against religious radicalism to endure in time.", "http://www.nicolaarts.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES02-KA105-009158_9"], [2017, "Our Voices on The WALL!", "NEW INTERNATIONAL COMPANY OF LIVE ARTS", 16564.0, 6, 6, "The project \u201cOur Voices on the wall\u201d is a youth exchange, that will be held in Lucena, Spain.

The training course will bring together 24 participants from Sweden, Malta, Finland, Slovakia, The UK, Czech Republic, Belgium, Italy, Estonia, Greece and Austria. The profile of the participants are youth workers from Ngo\u00b4s and public bodies who are involved in sexuality/relationships issues and advising all kinds of youngsters. \r\nThe training course is the developed further from the first edition of the training course Navigate your inner compass that was implemented in Munkviken, Sweden between the 3/ 4-10/ 4-2015.  we want to offer this developed version of the training course to more youth workers who wants to work around sexuality/norms and identity as a youth worker. \r\n\r\nInformation and facts about sexuality and the human body are essential for young people and play an important role in the learning process of sexuality. Nonetheless, information is not enough. Questions and issues regarding sexuality and relationships are essentially a question of identity. With this training course we want to extend the subject of sexuality beyond information and widen the perspective of the matter and connect sexuality to identity and discover values and norms in connection to sexuality on a societal, European, national and personal level. It is important for youngsters to think about and process their values, thoughts and knowledge in the area of sexuality and relationships. Further youth workers can play an important role in establishing a context and making life comprehensible for young people. From our approach a positive view on sexuality is crucial. Youth workers should avoid stigmatizing youngsters questions and concerns regarding the topic. In order for youth workers to create the safe environment were young people dare to ask questions in connection to sexuality, youth workers need to reflect on their own values. In addition, youth workers needs to try to be conscious about the messages, norms and moral stands which are given to young people in the topic of sexuality.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\nThe overall aim of the TC is to increase awareness among youth workers of the inner process and inner compass from a holistic approach (body, mind and heart) in connection to sexuality and identity, and to develop the capacity in supporting young people to explore this.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n-Discover which norms we have in connection to sexuality and identity  \r\n- Investigate how society and myself sees sexuality and how it influence young  people\r\n- Raise awareness of your own identity and your body in general and resources\r\n- Learn how to express  sexuality in words/communication and attitude\r\n- Explore how sexuality is seen in different European cultures\r\n- Share knowledge  and experience within the group about methods and tools for sexual education for young people.\r\n\r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach. The training course will be developed from the expectations and needs of the participants and the experience and knowledge from the trainers. The training course will be characterized by highly participatory, interactive and experiential methods. The activitied  will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, nature-based activities, team building activities, discussions, workshops developed by the participants, reflection and self-assessment.\r\n\r\nAfter the first edition of this training course, we are convinced that this TC can really make an impact on the participants both on a personal and professional level. Further, after the TC the participants will be better prepared for questions from youngsters about sexuality/identity and relationships.The participants, will provide better guidance and support for young people and will become more resource from themselves, from their own feelings and experiences without the urge of telling about their private lives.

Tutorfair has proven the concept of a full lifecycle platform for the tutoring sector which is open, disruptive and innovative:\n\u2022 For tutors, AIMS makes it easier to start and build their business, with opportunities for networking, training and observations to continue development;\n\u2022 For clients, AIMS makes it easier to find good tutors in a transparent and fair way;\n\u2022 For the industry, AIMS opens up access to industry wide accreditation and collaboration; and\n\u2022 For society, Tutorfair brings a one-for-one promise to give tutoring to children who can't afford to pay.\nThe results of this project will meet objectives for the Open Disruptive Innovation theme by creating a new paradigm on the fast-growing private tuition market, lowering barriers to entry, empowering local agencies and widening access.\n\nWith support from the SME Instrument Phase 1, Tutorfair will undertake a technical feasibility and commercial viability assessment of AIMS in the EU28, testing the likelihood of commercial success and potential impacts, on this \u20ac14Bn market.\n\nTutorfair\u2019s 15-strong team aims to make tutoring accessible to everyone, impactful, measurable and socially responsible.
