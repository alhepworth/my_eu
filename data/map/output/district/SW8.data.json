This is achieved through the following objectives:\r\n1. To introduce new, diversified activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective\r\n2. To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals and with accessing local community services and leisure activities\r\n3. To promote local and international volunteering\r\n4.

Activities include but are not limited to: arts and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, movement, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraising, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes.\r\n\r\nDiversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community. This will improve residents' confidence which we envisage will lead to long term benefits of getting residents to do things like volunteering, organising events, talking about disability issues in the local community and be more involved in decisions made locally and nationally in regards to the care sector and disability issues.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally.

In order to achieve this, we rely on well-trained, committed volunteers to provide high quality support to the people we work with. \r\n\r\nThe EVS project at St Anthony's is expected to feed into the above mentioned greater organisational goal through the 2 full-time volunteers attached to the project. The objectives are a) to provide our residents with the opportunities to live an active life, b) to assist residents in fulfilling long term personal goals and c) to educate European youth and our local community on disability issues.\r\n\r\nSt Anthony\u2019s is a care home for 35 adults with physical disabilities including MS, stroke, brain injury and cerebral palsy. The majority of residents have acquired their disabilities which means that they previously lived independent, active lives, and wish to continue as best as possible with that type of lifestyle. The core value of St Anthony's is, therefore, to promote independence and provide excellent care in a person-centered approach where the wishes and needs of the individual guides the support delivered. The service strives to reflect a home from home feeling and put residents in control of their own lifestyle to the best possible extent.\r\n\r\nThe main role for the volunteers is to support the social aspects of the residents' lives. By using the person-centered approach, St Anthony's has identified two social areas where extra support is needed to accommodate the wishes of the residents, namely communication and occupational/physiotherapy. The project activities will therefore be centered around these two areas with special focus on assistive technology. Through assistive technology, the residents will become more independent and better able to express choices and wishes. Assistive Technology is any device that helps a less able person do something that more able people can already do. The volunteers will work with at least 4 service users on a daily basis to improve their communication and/or to help them get the most out of the communication tools they are already using. Simultaneously, the volunteers will also support the daily occupational therapy activities such as art classes, IT classes, cookery classes, reading group, seasonal activities and trips out of the care home. This will train the residents in a range of skills and increase their self-confidence and independence. The one-to-one support the volunteers can offer will allow for individual attention that will enhance the process, and accommodate to a higher degree for individuality.\r\n\r\nSt Anthony's is a lovely single storey house in the area of Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The volunteers will live in a newly decorated accommodation suitable for two people. Volunteers will have their own bedroom and shared use of bathroom and lounge in a detached house a stones throw away from the service. The accommodation is of a very high standard with stunning vista of farmland and greenery. Three meals a day will be provided in addition to free access to snacks from the kitchen such as fruits, yogurts, salads, cold meats etc 24hrs. All bedding and towels are supplied and Internet access is available. The volunteers will receive \u00a3200 in pocket money.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of project on the residents is that the enhanced individual support during activities will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community.

They will be a team of entrepreuners and they will agree on their business ideas, procedures and paperwork. They will plan and distribute the work: the launch,  design of the logo, dissemination, accounting, etc.\r\nStarting a business involves risks and failures, so educating them to have determination will help them deal with the challenges along the way. This is the reason why our partnership from eight different European countries want to cooperate in order to foster a better understanding of what entrepreneurship means, what skills are necessary to become a successful European entrepreneur and what competencies need to be developed. \r\n\r\nTo be successful as an entrepreneur,  they need to be able to communicate well and get along with people so they will improve the Linguistic competence.

In this way, children are taught to evaluate right from wrong as well as the consequences of their actions.\r\nWe will design real learning of situations where each value will be developed in each one of them. We will use interesting resources for children as the core of a cross curricular work . \r\nThe use of the ICT will be very present along the two years of the project and it will be an indespensable mean of communication.

Intensive treatment (Intensive care medicine or critical care medicine) is a branch of medical science that deals predominantly with the treatment of patients with acute threatening diseases for life. It also includes the recovery and transport of critically ill or trauma patients, either from another part of the hospital, or from outside. The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a specially equipped and staffed part of the hospital dedicated to treating patients with life threatening diseases, heavy injuries or complications. The ICU is a very demanding field, both from an employment point of view and from the aspect of education and training of its staff. The nursing staff of this unit is a key factor of its operation and also determinant of the clinical outcome of patients. The type, size and position of the ICU, is based on health policy, the structure of the hospital and the geographical data of the area. With the exception of coronary units and neonatal ICUs, the critically ill patients are admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital and treated by expert intensivists. The quantity, type and complexity of the monitoring devices is affected by the size and role of the ICU. Regarding treatment, there are machines that should be available immediately. The staffing of the ICU includes qualified medical staff that has specialized in emergency and intensive care. The nursing staff are experienced nurses with monitoring capability of vital functions of the patient, execute urgent interventions (intubation) and collecting hemodynamic parameters. The therapists, clinical pharmacists, technologists medical instruments are also integral to the proper functioning of ICU. This program is designed for Nurses - participants who want to work in intensive care units and have not received any special training.

Telecommunications and IT technologies are now used to provide remote health care. In our country, the need for telemedicine services is imperative because of the geomorphology of Greece, which has many islands and border areas, makes it difficult to have equal access to quality health services by all population groups. Moreover, on the basis of the fact that the resources of the health system are significantly reduced, efforts are being made to find efficient and effective health care solutions, one of which is telemedicine.\r\n\r\nHome care concerns an increasing number of patients with chronic and acute conditions. Modern technology, new pharmaceuticals, and the continued desire of patients and their relatives to remain home-grown have set a new policy line in the treatment of chronic and acute illnesses, with the tendency to move away from hospital care and transportation their treatment in the patient's environment.\r\n\r\nHealth services include the provision of equipment and services to the patient's home in order to cope with his / her condition, ensuring a balance between patient comfort and the treatment of his / her illness. Home hospitalization is appropriate when an individual prefers to stay at home but needs constant care and cannot easily or effectively be provided by his or her family and his or her environment or cannot cope with the needs of his or her own illness; even in simple daily actions. More and more patients choose to live independently at home by taking home care services as long as their physical capacity begins to decline. Elderly or younger adults who have a health problem or are in the recovery or recovery phase of an acute illness choose home care when possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the education of EPAL students in the field of health and welfare is restricted to theoretical training and does not have practical applications in the school environment, it is of particular importance to practice the knowledge in real working conditions. The aim of the project is to acquaint students with the effective management and provision of social care and health care through ICT and to improve the quality of life of elderly and disabled people with mental problems or chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, we look forward to the 34 participants of the 2nd EPAL of Agrinio, through the project \"New Technologies in Home Health Services\", to acquire specialized knowledge and enhance skills to:\r\n- be aware of tele-monitoring, teleconferencing and counselling, tele-rehabilitation services, as well as devices for promoting self-management of health.\r\n- implement health and data services with the use of the Internet and related technologies.\r\n- handle the telemedicine equipment required.\r\n- handle medical equipment.\r\n- know patient file management.\r\n- save, update, and navigate medical information.\r\n- seek information quickly and easily.\r\n- analyse data for producing statistical results.\r\n- monitor the progress of patient health.\r\n- create a patient's health file (clinical data, test separation, laboratory results, correlations, etc.).\r\n- understand tele-health applications and to be able to operate them.\r\n- identify the patient's data and to make the classification. \r\n\r\nEngland has already reached a very advanced level of home care with ICT, which is why it has also been chosen as a host country for the training of this subject. Additionally, London First Aid Training has specialized departments dealing with the telemedicine industry.\r\n\r\nBased on their program structure (which combines theoretical training with practical training in a laboratory environment, as well as visits to technology companies and institutions providing home care services), it will offer the maximum possible learning outcomes. Thus, after training, trainees will be able to deploy remote management of chronic diseases (e.g. chronic cardiac patients, chronic patients with respiratory problems, oncology patients, diabetics, asthmatics, etc.) and elderly people.   \r\n\r\nWith the proposed project we believe that its implementation will contribute to the exchange of experiences between participating organizations and will provide the basis for networking on a range of issues related to the educational community and its link to the labour market. At the same time, it will bring significant results both at the individual level and in general at the development level, which will correspond to the real needs of the participants and in general the needs of the Greek labour market.", "http://www.londonfirstaidtraining.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-EL01-KA102-047006_1"], [2016, "\u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u039d\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019 \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b1) \u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae", "The London First Aid Training Company", 78067.0, 3, 3, "Demographic, epidemiological, social and cultural trends in European countries are changing the traditional ways of treatment. In the coming decades we will see increasing numbers of elderly people where most will be fully dependent on medical and nursing care. The dissolution of the traditional family as a group and urbanization creates gaps in care for the elderly and care for people with disabilities. These changes in needs and social structure require a different approach in the field of health and social policy as an approach based exclusively on \"disease\" is no longer appropriate. One answer to these issues may be the home health services and in particular the home care as a viable approach to maintaining the privacy of patients in their homes to avoid the need arising for institutionalization. Training needs we seek to satisfy through the project \"Education in nursing at home (palliative care) following a broad international\" practiceare:1. Acquiring competences and skills in nursing issues at home.2. hiring of specialized knowledge in nursing to gain increased job possibilities,3. practical application of their knowledge in real working conditions because their training is limited to theoretical training and applications only in laboratories at the school,4. workplace experience.Through the mobility program students of the specialties of Health and Welfare and Nursing will be able to experience the technological innovations along with new and modern ways of organizing services for a sustainable solution to home care. They will understand how to provide quality health services and how it should be in home care for patients, elderly and people with disabilities.  \u03a4he program will enhance the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the participants in their placement in enterprises and organizations with respect to the home care and care by performing the following.:1. Nursing assessment: detection and assessment of the patient's needs and his relatives.

Carrying out simple operations such as measuring blood pressure and blood sugar, blood sampling, placement or change catheter, pressure ulcers care, home treatment (e.g. injection therapy) etc.3. Recording history and information of the physician: for test results and for the image of the patient.4. Planning imaging examinations: by checking the patient under medical directives.5. Moral and psychological support of patients with chronic health problems and their families.6. Educate patients about proper receipt of their medicines.7.

There is an objective need for education of students attending health professions because the vast majority of migrant people (migrants, economic migrants, refugees or asylum-seekers) comes from countries that have a high prevalence of infectious diseases, some of which are absent or have a low prevalence in host countries such as Greece. Based on the above challenges, the educational community of 8 EK ATHINAS TAVROU proposed the program \"EDUCATION ISSUES IN SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND CARE OF IMIGRANTS\u201d with the ambition to help students attending the Health and Welfare department to specialize:(a) Prevention - promotion - restoring health and treatment of infectious diseases of immigrants,(b) The provision of holistic health care, in accordance with professional codes of ethics and conduct, and laws that concern the cultural particularities of these populations. The Educational needs of students, which are in direct relation and relevance to labour market needs, focus on:1. The basic knowledge of holistic health care processes2. to respect the ways of prevention - promotion - rehabilitation of the health of immigrants to real or potential health problems,3. The participation in decision making, planning and programming of therapeutic procedures in cooperation with the individual or his environment,4. Knowledge and handling of emotions of migrants.   The two main pillars of the program, as mentioned above, are 1. treatment - rehabilitation of immigrants and the knowledge of students on basic infections for which they should take control measures in relation to migrants in accordance with international data: tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (HIV / AIDS, etc.), viral hepatitis, malaria and rabies. 2. Transcultural Nursing that will take into account cultural values, beliefs and practices of different cultures to provide culturally sensitive nursing care and communication with patients.Through the project, the beneficiaries are to gain valuable experience and important skills, which is expected to help develop the ability to reclaim and adapt their knowledge on the particularities of this period after graduation. Expected results for the participants is to:1. be able to apply the basic and specialized treatment techniques regarding infections of immigrants in order to treat them and to protect themselves,2. Understand and handle the emotions of patients who have another culture, customs and habits, treating immigrants with different cultural backgrounds with professionalism and understanding.3.
