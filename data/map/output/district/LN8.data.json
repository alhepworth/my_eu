Sustainable biogas technologies have been extremely slow in catching up with community energy developments, failing to benefit from their undeniable potential. ISABEL aims to remove the obstacles and to promote community biogas in the EU by bringing out its societal relevance and by joining forces with a major revolutionary movement \u2013 Social Innovation. To achieve and sustain this transition, ISABEL employs modern marketing research to understand the needs and cultural diversities of the communities, fuses Social Innovation to reposition Biogas from an economic bio-fuel carrier to a social good, to come up with new community concepts and to build a stronger and wider community engagement in support of biogas. We zoom in on specific areas with diverse interest and we support communities on the ground to realize community biogas plans in coordination with all the stakeholders, slashing transaction overheads. We bring communities together to exchange and inspire each other as we carefully steer them towards quality sustainability and impact assessment principles. We zoom out to inform the policy world about what works and what does not, what should change and how we can scale-up, replicate and innovate in order to make investments more attractive. We envision a more innovative, better connected, less sensitive to policy and more transparent community biogas movement which will serve as a spring of ideas for other renewable energy technologies. \nBut we start simple \u2013 we want more ideas, more and deeper public involvement, more responsible community biogas plans and more bold and fair policies; and we bring along a highly complementary team of practical minded people to do it.", 173622.0, 1619351.0, 5, 8, "ISABEL", null, null, null, "h2020_199959_932044483"], [1514764800000, 1640908800000, "EC-Asia Research Network on Integration of Global and Local Agri-Food Supply ChainsTowards Sustainable Food Security", "Global Biotechnology Transfer Foundation Limited", "The proposed research will bring together researchers from a number of disciplines to address a global challenge in achieving sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. The research targets solutions to the challenge related to a food security strategy debate on global sourcing and self-sufficiency. With increasing concerns about climate change and environmental impact and associated risks, further complexity has been brought into this argument on the supply and sourcing strategy issues and a number of key questions need to be answered urgently. From the business perspective, whether promoting the practice of local agri-food systems indicates efficient and sustainable resource use? From the geographical supply market perspective, whether diversified sourcing and international trade have promoted sustainable and resilient agri-food supply? These arguments should not merely lead to options of the geographical focus of agri-food production and sourcing strategies. Instead, the solutions require in-depth understanding of interactions and trade-offs amongst different locally characterised options and should lead to place based ecologically harmonious local agri-food systems demonstrating the sustainability value and contributing global agri-food supply chains. For this purpose, this project aims to identify place based policy and solution framework to support local ecological system and sustain agri-food production, meet bioenergy needs and reduce waste, while best interface food and non-food input and output to global markets. Effective approaches will be developed to leverage the benefits in the context of Multi-level (geographical scale), Multi-dimension performance measurement (sustainable and resilient agri-food supply) of agri-food supply chains (MMAFS).
