The project's aim is to increase the staff's competencies in order to:\r\n- contribute to the development of their own organizations\r\n- increase and improve their international work\r\n- contribute to the department developing towards a learning organization\r\n\r\nThe activities in the project will be job shadowing, structured courses and participatioin in a multiplier conference. The project will be carried out during two years. The mobilities  will be handled as follows:\r\n- discussions before and afterwards among the whole staff in the orgaizations\r\n- discussions between the head of the organization and each participant about expectations and personal goals for the mobility/courses/conference \r\n- self-estimation of the participants' knowledge and skills, before and after the mobility\r\n- documentation of the experiences\r\n\r\nThe project's participants in the project consist of heads of the different organizations, school and preschool teachers, school developers, special needs teachers, psychologists, councelours and schools nurses. All of them work in M\u00f6lndal.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, we expect an increased individual learning and a initiated/continuous development of the organization, and internationalization. In the long run we expect the department to develop to an attractiv working place for both staff and students, with a high development will, competent staff and happy students with good learning result.", "http://www.tgsonline.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA101-012041_6"], [2017, "Modernising the teaching of Spanish", "Beckfoot Thornton", 3742.0, 1, 1, "Beckfoot Thornton is a secondary school with has 1500 children on roll.  \r\n\r\nWe currently teach French and German and plan to introduce Spanish from .......\r\n\r\nThis Project will; \r\n\r\n- improve our participant's teaching of foreign languages within the school through developing her professional knowledge, skills and experience.

Yet at these festivals, diesel generators are still the most employed source to provide electricity due to a large amount of power needed. Using diesel to generate electricity has big disadvantages: substantial CO2 emissions, noise annoyance of droning generators, and bad smell. With the latest developments in renewable energy, for instance vertical axis wind turbines, more efficient solar panels, improved batteries, now allow for an efficient and economically attractive approach to produce large amounts of power from sustainable resources only.\nPowerVIBES aims to reduce festivals\u2019 carbon footprint by 20% by making diesel generators superfluous. Instead, affordable and reliable energy is produced from renewable resources wind, biomass, and solar power. To illustrate, if the Netherlands\u2019 summer festivals cut their diesel consumption by 10%, over 1.000.000 litres of diesel and over 3,000 tonnes of CO2 is saved annually.\nThis project combines a vertical axis wind turbine, PV panels, and a battery, all customized in a containerized unit and with a bio-fuel generator as backup. All are connected in a smart grid. Two of such transportable units (with smart grid) will be built and tested on in total 16 festival sites. This extensive testing regime is essential as of large differences among festivals, as they operate under significantly different legal, technical, seasonal, locational, and environmental conditions. This process of reflection and feedback (with a loop of testing-analysing-adjusting-implementing after each test) leads to a (practically) universally applicable system, to be used in all countries of the NWE region.\nThis energy production is completely clean. Therefore, the unit can be clearly visible on a festival site to reach an audience of millions that experiences this sustainable energy concept.", 1483228800000, 1609372800000, 50826.0, "nweurope_39_7"]]}}}}
