Development of media literacy and critical thiking is crutial in order for us to be good citizens, who are making wise choices for our future. We want to teach people how to check information to base their decisions on truth facts and not lies and propaganda. To make this democratic decisions, we need to enhance critical thiking and media literacy of the whole population. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is to empower people to make better decisions and help others to make them as well. We want to acoomplish this be fulfilling the objectives of the project:\r\n1) Develop media literacy amongst youthworkers \r\n2) Transfer critical thinking skills to enable citizens to make the best decisions in democratic system\r\n3) To discover and prevent results of media illiteracy\r\n4) Promote EU values by including people with fewer opportunities\r\n5) Give participants skills of presentation, argumentation and debating to share all the knowledge futher in the most effective way\r\n\r\nWe would like our project to have as much impact as possible. That\u2019s why we are addressing youthworkers, who can bring the message to their countries and spread it even more. We will be bringing 24 participants from 7 programme countries. Age limit is 18+ with no upper limit. We look for youthworkers, teachers, trainers who are eager to include the topic of media literacy in their teaching repertoir, because they see the importancy. 1 out of 3 people will be person with fewer opportunities, facing difficulties. For this person, we will provide maximum support. We will ask all participants to host workshops after they come back, which will give our projects a huge multiplicating effect.\r\n\r\nThe main activity will be a training course hosted in Kolin, Czech republic. It will be led by two experienced trainers in fields of critical thinking (Lukas Hana, Growjob institute) and media literacy (Katerina Krivankova, Zvol si Info).\r\n\r\nAs for methodology, we will focus mostly on non-formal education. Also, for some imput parts, formal approach will be used and many skills will be of course gained by doing \u2013 the informal way. During the project, we will combine different approaches in order to keep audience engaged \u2013 we will be working in big group, small groups, in pairs, individually, giving participants space to speak and discuss, share their knowledge and experience, we will also encourage them to speak publicly and most importantly \u2013 get out of their comfort zones. Because that is when you get to learning zone \u2013 where getting experience and knowledge, skills and competences happen.\r\n\r\nThe results and report from the project will be published on the internet for everyone to access. Our immidiate results of the training course itself would be for participants to develop:\r\n1) critical thinking skills and competences, such as: analysing information, decision-making , making qualified and quality predictions, cognitive biases identification.\r\n2) media literacy skills and competences, such as: fact-checking, finding alternative sources, propaganda/fake news identification, manipulation prevention, direct and indirect marketing understanding, financial literacy (marketing resistance, saving approach)\r\n3) communication skills and competences, such as: communication in english, presentation skills, debating and argumenting, self-confidence, teamwork, international and intercultural cooperation\r\n4) will and motivation to start writing new, follow-up projects right on our training, where they also create the international groups to do it in. In fact, this is how this projects was created, so we can show them the best example.\r\n\r\nThe impact will be on local, regional, national and international level. Localy and nationally, we want to mostly break stereotypes in Czech republic, educate people on the topic of the project and get local people involved with our participants. It would be great if they can get interested in Erasmus+ Programme and participate in it in the future. Internationally, each partner organisation will host a workshop for youth in their communities to enlighten them in the topic of media literacy, critical thinking and other results of this project which will allow everybody in their communities to get some wonderful information, skills and knowledge for free. Hopefully, it will motivate them to continue futher in media literacy and critical thiking education, which is our goal.\r\n\r\nLongterm benefits of course include happier future for all of us. If people are making good decisions, it makes like better for them and for everybody around. This can stop the late rise of euroskepticism and populism that only blames. Having responsible citizens will lead in long term into having responsible representatives for all of us.", "http://www.nocollective.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA105-047805_4"]]}}}}
