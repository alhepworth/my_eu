The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_5"], [2016, "Vocational training abroad \u2013 Learning for the future", "Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership", 193211.0, 8, 11, "Internationalization is very important for the municipality of Eskilstuna, Sweden, and its schools.   For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.  This is very important to prevent segregation and racism.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA102-021979_3"], [2014, "European network of youth work research TRI Network", "NEWMAN UNIVERSITY", 155261.0, 6, 7, "The partners that represent youth organizations have for many years been seeking knowledge about new models describing how organizations, youth services and research work together and develop services for youth. Some of the partner countries have broad experience in bottom-up processes where youth play an important role in decision making within youth clubs. Others are more guided by science. Regardless of the basis, the partners have different points of view, and all have something to learn from each other. The initiative to this project comes from Norwegian youth leaders, who see that the English approach to youth work, is focused on social work and they have a tradition in the youth fields that goes back 150 years. The Norwegian youth work has its\u2019 strength in the emphasis on inclusion of young people in the management of the youth clubs, and the \u201csoft\u201d approach to youth clubs, youth clubs are youth-governed places where youth develop constructive cultural activities in order to grow as a human beings.\r\n Research and education within the youth field is a growing academic field, though the differences between countries in both academic input and the development of youth services represent a wide range. Education and research within the youth field in Norway, consist of contract research, often financed by the government to serve as a tool for a better understanding of the needs of the youth population. Studies of youth phenomena is therefore random. Until recently, there were no broad interdisciplinary arenas for youth research in Norway. In 2010, a Nordic network of National youth club organizations therefore established a Nordic network of researchers. In Norway, there is no specific education for youth workers on an academic level either.\r\nThe situation in other Nordic countries is different, Sweden, Iceland, Finland all have a nationwide education in youth work, and the universities also offers research. There is close contact between the professionals and the research/education field.\r\n  Once the researchers network was established, participants from the Nordic countries initiated several meeting points such as conferences and seminars. The content has been focused on the development of youth services, and youth policies, and the goal has been to strengthen the link between education and practical youth work. Even though the development of research, education and youth work, is more mature in Sweden. Swedish academics have planned and implemented conferences for the network as well. The link between the Nordic countries and the Baltic countries, has been strengthened over the last years, as a result of both Nordic and European political policies. The Baltic countries has also taken steps to start up a pan-baltic research network which was established in 2014. In Lithuania, politicians have seen the need for a development of social services, particularly towards youth. Lithuania are developing arenas for non- formal learning for youth in order to ensure the well- being of the youth population. As a result, new youth centres are established all over Lithuania.\r\n\r\nNorway has a small research field, but has long traditions within the professional youth field. Still, we have some development in the services that is steered from a governmental level.\r\nDuring several meetings in the Nordic research network, we have gained a partner from Newman university college in UK. Newman is one of 8 universities in England that offers both a BA and MA in youth work. UK has also a long tradition in the field of professional youth work, with vast experience in social work. In a Nordic context, the challenges youth in UK faces seems severe. Youth violence, poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, teenage pregnancies are some issues that in Norway would be handled by the child welfare and care services, while the British youth workers, as a result of National policies, have seen a shift towards a social work approach which needs to deal with these issues.\r\nThe partnership seeks to publish an academic journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\n- To create an arena for peer reviewing and development of research\r\n- To offer a channel for implementation of methods and models for youth work\r\n- To give voice to youth workers in political issues\r\n- To enhance systems for the education \u2013 policy \u2013 best practice triangle\r\n\r\nThe project support education and training systems.

Under programme development, the project understands the overall design of the study process, the choice of the grounding values and theories, pedagogies, course structure, role of theoretical and practical component, etc. \r\n\r\nOverall, the project aims at improving the quality of youth workers' training in Europe.\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n1) to work out a model for comparative approach on youth work programmes;\r\n2) to initiate European level dialogue on the challenges of youth work programme development.\r\n\r\nThe project partnership proposing this project are all involved in youth workers training: University of Tartu from Estonia, Newman University from the UK, Humak University of Applied Sciences from Finland, and Estonian Association of Youth Workers. The project team is formed of 12 experts from the partner universities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the project objectives, the team carries out the following activities:\r\n- delivering 1 intellectual output: a book about curriculum development and based on the comparison of the programmes of project  partner universities (named intellectual output book in this application, no better title yet)\r\n- 1 international conference at the end of the project to introduce and disseminate the intellectual output and initiate a discussion on youth workers training in Europe among European youth work community;\r\n- 4 international project meetings;\r\n- 1 staff training event for the project team in preparation for writing the intellectual output;\r\n- 2 round table discussions with policymakers and key stakeholders to benefit from the context of Estonian and Finnish presidency of the Council of EU to draw attention to the project and broader area of youth workers training;\r\n- 1 information dissemination seminar in the UK to introduce the intellectual output;\r\n- 2 sessions of smaller events for local stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the project is most anticipated on the European and possibly international level.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.

They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.

Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.

Youth organization may run beautiful projects with young people and youth workers, having great impact on their personal and professional development. But if they don\u2019t spread the word, the results and the benefits for society, the chances are high that due to lack of information and understanding, funders, society, stakeholders and even in their own organizations, the projects lack support. Its a reality that most of the youth organizations face in Europe. At the same time it\u2019s up to those organizations to create a solid and broad foundation among funders, stakeholders and in their own organization. We strongly believe that visibility of youth projects and the dissemination of the project results matters, and this is why we are going to \u201cBump It Up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBump It Up!\u201d means formulating a communication strategy, means making your work visible and share your results. In other words, share what you are proud of!  Because this is what we are, we think that youth organizations make a huge contribution to society and now we will make you think the same! \r\n\r\nJoining forces with youth organizations in Europe is thus also an important objective of this training course. In practice this would mean that we spend a substantial part of the programme to  developing strong  partnerships and carry out quality projects. We will  offer  time and  space  for the participants to explore future collaborations  for short term mobility projects and we will strongly support ideas for longer term strategic partnerships. The topic of this training course is par excellence a matter about which we need to formulate long term strategies for our own organization and in collaboration with other youth organizations. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start to \u201cBump It Up!\u201d together with 33 participants from Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy, Hungary, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, The Netherlands, Georgia, Ukraine, Belgium and Lithuania. Training course is designed for youth and community workers, volunteers, trainers, project managers, community media representatives and any other people who are directly involved working with Erasmus+ projects and/or other type of international collaborations.  Developed a communication strategy that will improve quality, impact and foundation of their (European) youth organization and community projects;\r\nDeveloped new cooperations with youth organizations throughout Europe. We trust that this training course will contribute to improving quality of Erasmus+ projects and development of competent youth and community workers internationally.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to explore the concepts and benefits of working on the visibility & dissemination  of (European) youth and community projects by means of a well elaborated communication strategy and to build network between participating organizations. The participants and their organizations as a result:\r\n\u2022 Know how to define visibility and dissemination;  \r\n\u2022 Know how to analyze why visibility and dissemination is important in international youth and community work; \r\n\u2022 Got acquainted with good practice examples of visibility and dissemination in European youth and community projects;\r\n\u2022 Explored different tools and methodology for addressing issues of visibility and dissemination;\r\n\u2022 Developed a communication strategy that will improve quality, impact and foundation of their (European) youth organization and community projects;\r\n\u2022 Developed new cooperations with youth organizations throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nTraining programme consists of 6 different types of activities:\r\n1.

The aim of the meetings is run intensive workshops and hold study visits to the partner organisations. The 12 participants, forming the Project Team, are all programme managers and key decision makers in developing the youth work studies in their organisations.

The goals is to create more knowledge about open youth work, about youth, and to disseminate this knowledge. The purpose of this project is to build and establish solid and sustainable arenas for a functional interaction between the system of education and representatives of the field of practices. The partnership seeks to publish an academic journal. \r\n\r\nThe academic journal came out of an international working group of youth workers, those that work with young people, NGO\u2019s and academics. The starting point is to explore, research and share youth work philosophy and methodology from both the youth worker and youth work academic perspective.  Its further purpose is to establish a grounded body of knowledge that is based in practice and research, both of which should and could be used to inform social policy makers. \r\n\r\nYouth workers should be able to share results of their work, and also be have a critical view on their work. In order to have a a high quality content of the academic journal, we want youth workers to be involved in writing articles for the AJ, as well as being peer reviewers. For an academic journal, peer reviewing is a sign of quality, and we will aim at a high academic level. Still we want the perspectives of youth workers to be represented, also as reviewers of the academic articles. The peer reviewer role is a process that lasts more than a year, and requires commitment from both writers and reviewers. We will use academic peers as reveiwers. In addition we will strongly support that youth workers have a peer reviewer role, and they also should be writing articles, or be represented by the support of co- writers. Co- writing is  a process where a researcher cooperates with the youth worker, in order to develop research which reflects the reality of the youth workers. Youth workers have normally no experience in peer- reviewing and co - writing, we will therefore implement training in order to prepare them properly for the task. The training course will also have participants from other countries in the Baltic area, and through this extension we will be able to enhance and expand the network. The  training course topics will be about the two different roles in developing the academic journal, peer reviewing and co- writing\r\n\r\nThere is normally no requirement for youth workers that they should master the peer reviewing role, and there is certrainly not any written recipe for how to review with the eyes of the youth worker. The second part of the traning course, will be about co writing. Youth workers are not necessarily trained in cooperation with researchers in a co writing process. Whereas youth workers must create a language for their experiences, researchers must adapt their vocabulary and models of analysis to the youth worker's realiy. Hence, the training course will be for both parties, but the majority of participants will be the youth workers that are recruites as peer reviewers.", "http://www.newman.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-NO02-KA105-000582_7"], [2015, "YE-Leirb\u00e5l og Legender del I", "NEWMAN UNIVERSITY", 17358.0, 4, 5, "\"Legends and camp fires - part I\" is a cultural exchange project for young people from Norway, Sweden, Poland and United Kingdom with an interest for theatre and history.

The Dutch Member JONG Rotterdam is takin a next step with applying for this seminar to contribute to the following debate:\r\nProfessional Open Youth Work faces sometimes diverse circumstances in different Europen countries. This includes expectations of  youth work that might change significantly over time but also from one country to the other. On the other hand the expectations that young people themselves express seem quite coherent and stable - as for exampla a youth exchange in Croatia during summer 2014 called \"The Big R\" and working with the young people on their expectations towards  professional open youth work  confirmed:\r\n- a safe place where to explore own interests and feel respected and encouraged\r\n- concrete help & support on practical and emotional issues\r\n- a meeting place to have fun, but also to learn how to interact (interpersonal/intercultural skills)\r\n- a space that provides access to opportunities, possibilities and tools\r\njust to name the most important.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand youth work is also named quickly by policy makers and society when it comes to dealing with actual problems within society e.g. nowadays the radicalisation of muslim young people and it is expected from professional opne youth work to propose action and solution for contributing to solve those problems.\r\n\r\nContent/methodology\r\nThis seminar strives to discuss and exchange among pracitioners, researchers and policy makers in the field of youth work:\r\nto which extend professional open youth work nowadays can meet the expectations of young people themselves under these circumstances.\r\nWhat measures, tools, ressources do we need to implement to meet those expectations of young people.\r\nHow do we match those expectations with sometimes (slightly) different expectations of politics and administration of professional open youth work such as safety, employability,..\r\n\r\nThe seminar will provide key note speeches/lectures looking at the topics from different angles, workshops, field visits and space to exchange experiences and good practice.\r\n\r\nResults/Impact\r\nParticipants and partner organisations will gain knowledge and know how and be able to transfer those into their own context on local, regional and national level.
