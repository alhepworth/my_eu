This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_11"]]}}, "6DT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1349049600000, 1435622400000, "Economically efficient biogas production from manure fibres and straw", "Enzyme Supplies Ltd", "Energy produced from biogas is a key renewable resource in the transition from a fossil fuel driven energy sector towards increasing use of green energy.\nA successful and sustainable growth of the biogas sector is conditioned by a supply of substrates and waste materials compatible with responsible use of arable lands, and safe food and feed production.\nAmong the vastly available but at present under exploited resources are cattle slurry and straw. Due to the character of the biomass it is difficult to achieve sufficient biogas yield without some kind of pre treatment. Recent year\u2019s development in enzyme technology and physical pre treatment technologies may open up for the possibility of running biogas production solely on slurry/ manure and straw on the condition that technology and strategy for proper use of enzymes is developed. Key research questions include temperature control and management during pre treatment, biological inactivation during pre treatment, post digestion enzyme treatment on the degassed fiber fraction and the re-injection into the fermentor.\nBIOMAN will for a series of SME\u2019s develop physical and enzymatic pretreatment strategies and technology for biogas plants.
