The work placement will last for either four or six weeks and will be organised with our European partners in currently six countries. The students do not only experience and extend intercultural, social and language skills but additionally achieve and broaden job related knowledge and skills in the field of social work.\r\n\r\nEvery day, the future educators and child care assistants are challenged to perceive multicultural situations with positive and negative effects in their daily actions and to react sensitively and respectfully accordingly. They have to be open for intercultural learning processes and encourage and assist in intercultural learning processes. The mobility project helps the participants to experience the situation of \u201cbeing foreign\u201d firsthand. Furthermore, the professional experience is important: in every country, care, education and upbringing of children and young people are organised differently, and different educational attitudes and their corresponding concepts and frameworks are to be experienced. The differences can be dealt with personally and can be integrated into the professional work instantly. By organising the work placement for at least three weeks in institutions of social work and youth welfare services and the intensive reflection it is guaranteed that the students gain more than just superficial impressions that might be based on prejudices. They are forced to deal and cope with incidents intensively, ask questions, perceive and solve conflicts and question their own (pedagogical) posture.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the stays in currently six different countries are organised and attended by the  Team Europe of the Anna Warburg School in Hamburg and the locally in a cooperating country. Supported by our partner institutions in Europe, the matters of accommodation, applications for work, the attendance at a language course and mentoring are dealt with by a local partner in the foreign country. In a preparatory seminar in Hamburg (in cooperation with \u201cArbeit und Leben e.V.) the trainees are briefed for their stay abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, expected results are that the participants get to know the culture, the daily life and in particular the daily child care system in a foreign country. They will know the training and different work fields of another EU-country and compare them to German standards; additionally they reflect their own views and attitudes. The participants are going to experience certainty in using another language and discover new ways of communication. Another goal is the Europeanisation in the participants\u2019 minds.\r\n\r\nSix stays abroad are planned for the participating staff of the Anna Warburg School. While being abroad, the focus is put rather on the organisation of the students\u2019 stays, needs of the employers, the daily life in the social and welfare institutions than to work directly in the childcare institutions. The staffs\u2019 experiences have to be reflected with own ideas and attitudes. Beyond country borders contacts are made and maintained. The aim for the educational staff is to motivate young adults to experience the European idea and occupational mobility on basis of their stays. They also should be able to answer any question in regard to the given conditions in different countries.", "http://www.musicalous-languageservices.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001725_5"], [2018, "Mobility in Pastry & Bakery III", "Musicalous Language SchoolUnited", 28120.0, 4, 5, "The project focusses 16 apprentices in the 2nd and 3rd year of voactional dual system training and 8 VET-staff persons in the baker and pastry handycraft.
