The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.", 63241.0, 3079332.0, 6, 12, "iCIRRUS", null, null, null, "h2020_194215_954758488"], [1356998400000, 1475193600000, "COnvergence of fixed and Mobile BrOadband access/aggregation networks", "Adva Optical Networking Limited", "Fixed and mobile networks have been subjects to significant technological and architectural evolutions in the past years, with e.g. deployments of 4G mobile networks and FTTH fixed networks, as well as significant increase in traffic demand and access bandwidth both in fixed and mobile access networks. All these network evolutions lead to enormous investments in independent network infrastructures (billions of \u20ac). In terms of usage, the difference between fixed and mobile access tends to diminish with more and more video streaming and the willingness of users to use fixed (Wi-Fi) interface on their mobile device. All these elements strengthen the motivation of operators to integrate fixed and mobile networks and make them converge in the perspective of 5G networks.Today, Fixed and Mobile Convergence (FMC) is mainly implemented at service level with all IP services and IMS, allowing a converged service control layer. Fixed and mobile networks themselves have been optimized and evolved independently from each other and the current network deployments are still reflecting this independent evolution.In contrast, COMBO will allow the convergence of fixed and mobile networks themselves. To achieve this objective, COMBO will define, develop and technically assess network scenarios organized around the concept of Next Generation Point of Presence (NG-POP) and which embody the most promising directions for FMC at network level. These proposals will lead to networks with a more effective distribution of essential functions and improved utilisation of equipment and infrastructures. So as to show experimentally the high potential of FMC for future networks, COMBO will develop proof of concept demonstrations including both a unified access / aggregation network and a Universal Access Gateway (UAG), the key elements to implement NG-POP concept.

There are multiple elements directly related to this objective. We believe, though, that some of them are perhaps the cornerstones to achieve these goals, assuring full personal growth of our students. Among them we can highlight god coexistence plans to improve positive environment at schools deeply rooted in inclusive values, the importance of spaces as learning scenarios and the choice of the most suitable methodologies to foster experiential and meaningful learning, capable of developing student key competences.\r\nDeveloping school strategies from pedagogical and management leaders becomes a top strategic objective. The fact of being able to get acquainted with successful practice in this context, helps not only to build European citizenship and a spirit of collaboration and temwork, but also enables all institutions -both sending and host ones- to mobilize and develop key professional competences, absolutely essential for teaching performance. At the same time, all these experiences promote innovation, educational research and  boost institutions to assume new collective challenges to improve their quality.\r\nMost of the staff that will take part in the mobilities belong to school management teams. We have also incorporated a teacher and an in-service teacher advisor to the group in order to have a entire range of teaching representatives in our project.\r\nFor all mobilities, we have chose job shadowing activities at institutions whose identity and strategic action lines are directly related to our project objectives and observation goals. Two features have been relevant in our choice. Firstly, we would their geographical disparity, through which we have tried to cover a wide variety of cultures and realities to enrich our experience and, secondly, the different nature of the institutions themselves, including both schools -Primary and Secondary- and a training centre similar to ours. \r\nProviding a common ground framework before, during and after the mobilities, and doing so in a standardized and systematic way in all the member centres, will be decisive in methodological terms within the consortium. Thus, in order to achieve the highest levels of coordination we will hold regular face-to-face meetings where all members can share their progress.

Being researcher is exciting and amazing\n\nThese five messages will be central to our Awareness Campaign and our Activities on the Night. YorNight will specifically target young people and seek to influence their perception of researchers and promote scientific careers. The team has received special permission from the UK Scouting and Guiding movement to design a new two-part occasional badge to celebrate European Researchers\u2019 Night. In 2014 and 2015 YorNight will pilot this badge with the aim of expanding the innovation across Europe as part of future Researchers\u2019 Nights, where the Scouting and Guiding movements actively engage an estimated 2.4 million young people.\nAs the UK\u2019s only Heritage and Science city, York is a relevant and unique Researchers\u2019 Night host. The project\u2019s Work Programme will celebrate and explain the depth and breadth of this research across the two years in the theme York: City of the Past, City of the Future. The Work Programme seeks to deliver its key messages through an integrated programme encouraging participants to \u201cDiscover and Explore\u201d the research that is all around them, and to meet the researchers who helped bring it to life.", 24592.0, 118483.0, 1, 2, "YorNight", null, null, null, "h2020_193218_946571688"], [1459468800000, 1585612800000, "Archaeology on the Edge: Northern Europe and the Circumpolar World", "York Museums and Gallery Trust", "ArchSci2020 will provide structured state-of-the-art doctoral training to the next generation of archaeologists and biomolecular scientists forging a new generation of biomolecular archaeologists. Few other academic disciplines have been so transformed in the last decade as Archaeology. ArchSci2020 meet the need of a new generation of researchers. International, intersectoral and interdisciplinary training will equip its early-stage researchers (ESRs) with specific research-related and transferable skills, in order to provide enhanced career prospects across academia, industry and the third sector. The proposed ArchSci2020 network will bring together four leading research clusters each with complementary expertise to deliver an integrated, flexible training package that will provide a sound basis for academic independence and preparation for vocations in the archaeology, heritage and beyond. ArchSci2020 will combine (i) a common purpose, (ii) an unconditional commitment to the student experience, (iii) a pro-active stance towards international, inter-institutional research support and interdisciplinary study, (iv) a simple but effective management structure provided by a Management Team, Supervisory Committee and the Work Package leaders, (v) and an established academic infrastructure and reputation.\nKey features of ArchSci2020:\n1. ArchSci2020 will create a multidisciplinary training environment that brings together archaeologists, biologists, mathematicians, analytical chemists, and policy experts around an archaeological hub.\n2. ArchSci2020 priorities and cross-cutting training themes align closely with \u2018Grand Challenges\u2019 across its themes of Health, Diet, and Environment and incorporates the important current skills and future training needs in archaeological science. \n3. Each participating institution will make a unique and distinct contribution to the experience of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in a partnership formed from existing strong environments.", null, 3521696.0, 9, 20, "ArchSci2020", null, null, null, "h2020_198321_946571688"]]}}}}
