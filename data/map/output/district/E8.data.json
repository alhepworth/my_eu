Three of the students are from the fashion department. As our students are trained in modern languages, we have chosen the following countries for the internship: Italy, France, Malta, Ireland, Spain and Great Britain. Our students will be trained in theory (language skills) and in practice beforehand. Additionally, they will be supported by the Erasmus+ team (contact via WhatsApp/facebook) during the internship.After the internship an evaluation will be carried out by the partner hotel. Means of evaluation will be the ECVET \u2013 form and the Learning Agreement.Students are encouraged to gain further practical knowledge and skills in hotel industry which have already been provided in theory in order to be well-prepared for their future working life. Therefore our students should be given the possibility to work in fields like:restaurant, reception, bar, administration, room service, housekeeping, concierge, seminar and conference area. From our point of view, there will be a noticeable increase in the employability because of the internship.Besides improving their practical skills, our trainees should strengthen their social skills and their self-confidence (personal capabilities), which means that responsibility, independency, self-confidence, ability to work on their own, team spirit, ability to listen, friendliness, ability to communicate with their superiors, colleagues and guests. Moreover, our students should encounter the differences of various cultures and traditions and their characteristics to develop an open-minded tolerance.Another important aim is to improve language skills. Students should be able to use their acquired language skills in order to broaden their communication skills in daily work life.Furthermore, we would like to stress that the sense of belonging to the European Union should be created and increased to make the EU be realized as a chance for personal and professional development. Employing foreign students in their hotels, people show interest in different nationalities and also in the willingness to train and support the young. This will be documented by using the following tools: Letter of Intent, Learning Agreement, Personal Transcript, Europass and ECVET. The hotel is not only a working but also learning place.We are primarily looking for hotels in the 4 or 5 stars category to ensure a high standard not only concerning the working but also the learning conditions. In cooperation with the Erasmus+ Team the students work out tasks of the Learning Agreement and the results will be discussed. Teachers will visit their students at their hotels to deepen the personal contact and to assure the quality of the internship.For school, this project is evidence of a professionally grounded education, which will finally be documented by annual reports, parents\u2019 evening, Erasmus+ Day, personal diary entries of the participants as well as broadcasts in the media (local TV, newspapers, websites).The aspired project goals are assured by a professional quality management team (G. Malle, B. Potz, M-A. Schwarz) and teachers working in the fields of economy and modern languages.ECVET elements will be used to emphasize comparison and sustainability of the project. Using these tools, the cooperation with the hotels will be intensified. That\u2019s why increased action of the accompanying teachers will be necessary especially at the beginning.Apart from the EU aspect, long-term impacts on the participant, school site and the Austrian educational system are stressed. Our participants will be able to profit from their work experience in the long run, school site will face an enhancement of the public image and finally, it has to be mentioned that these projects are vital for the Austrian educational system to broaden the horizon of the participants in order to appreciate the importance of the EU.", "http://www.rebeccagladstone.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016376_18"]]}}, "1AJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Frelsun / Salvation", "E8FILMS", 18932.0, 2, 2, "Project Summary: \r\n\r\nCONTEXT AND BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe project \"Salvation\" is a 20-25 minute short film that will be produced by two different groups of filmmakers in two different countries. The pre-production and shooting of the film will be conducted in Reykjavik whilst the post-production of the film will be done in London. The film is about a young religious woman who belongs to a small religious group in Iceland where, amongst other things, blood transfusions are strictly forbidden. After suffering serious injuries in a car accident, she is accidentally given such a transfusion and wakes up to find that her body has been contaminated. The film observes the woman as she tries to save her soul and win back the trust of her fellow parishioners and family members. A small sliver of doubt enters her mind and she starts questioning the rules by which she has chosen to live her life. We observe this young woman as she stands on a crossroad, uncertain as to whether she should commit to her faith or turn her back on everyone she knows. \r\n\r\nMembers of both our groups have religious backgrounds and as a group we have had many discussions about religion. We wanted to further explore the subject of faith and after researching small religious groups and cults, we decided to use the Jehova Witnesses' ban against blood transfusion as a basic premise for our film. We want to elevate the discussion though and focus more on what happens when someone is thrown out of their comfort circle and isn't sure whether he wants to go back inside it? The theme of blindly adhering to social pressures and norms and realizing only too late that your heart lies elsewhere is a universal sentiment and we want our film to reflect that. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY \r\nThere will be four main activities. The pre-productions, the shoot, the post-production and the film festival. In each department the members of both groups will have specially designed tasks that they will have to commit to and deliver before a special deadline. \r\n\r\nPRE-PRODUCTION : \r\n\r\nWriting: \r\nMembers of the group will have to brainstorm ideas and comment on script drafts until everybody involved agrees on overall story. The screenwriter, director and producer will have the final say but a clear focus is set on developing the story as a group.  \r\n\r\n\"Making-of\": The director of the \"making-of\" film will start filming as soon as the pre-production starts and capture the whole process on film. \r\n\r\nLocation Scouting and Casting: \r\nWhen the script is ready, the producer in Iceland: Anna S\u00e6unn, and director will arrange for location scouting and set up auditions for actors. \r\n\r\nCREW AND EQUIPMENT: \r\nAnna S\u00e6unn will get a crew together and rent the needed equipment. \r\n\r\nART DEPARTMENT: \r\nOnce the location and actors have been decided upon, the production designer, Sn\u00e6d\u00eds, will start renting props, furniture and costumes. She will send pictures to both groups so that everyone can capture and understand the general atmosphere and artistic feel of the film. This is something that will help all the other departments when preparing their work. \r\n\r\nSHOOTING SCHEDULE AND FRAMING  \r\nThe 1st AD, Bylgja, the DOP, \u00de\u00f3r, and the producer, Anna S\u00e6unn, will set up a shooting schedule with the director. \r\n\r\nACTOR REHEARSAL AND DRESSING \r\nEverybody in the Iceland group will assist the rehearsal and dressing for the actors. The 1st AD, producer, DOP and director will go over the details of each scene.  The production designer will set up a list of costumes needed for each scene, each day. The Sound Engineer and producer from London will fly over to assist the rehearsal and shooting of the film. \r\n\r\nDuring the pre-production the music composer will have sent over some samples of music which both groups will be able to comment on. \r\n\r\nSHOOTING OF THE FILM \r\nThe film will be shot in 6-7 days. \r\n\r\nPOST-PRODUCTION: \r\n\r\n1st DRAFT OF EDITING: \r\nThe footage will be taken to London and the producer in London, Sophie Brooks, will oversee and manage the overall procedure. She will create a time frame for a first draft of the movie to be sent to everyone so that both groups can comment and bring their ideas to the mix. The director and producer will have the final say.  \r\n\r\nMUSIC COMPOSING / SOUND ENGINEER\r\nWhen the first draft has been completed the music composer and sound engineer can start working on their craft. During the course of the production they will have prepared and so will not be working from scratch. Samples of music and sound will sent to both groups. \r\n\r\nPR\r\nA strong online presence will be created for the film. \r\n\r\nFESTIVAL SEASON \r\nBoth groups will participate in applying for festivals that particularly apply to the project and subject matter. We will attend the festivals when possible, participate in classes and lectures and try to create a lasting international network for both groups.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-2-IS02-KA205-001580_1"]]}}, "1DU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "CU@ARCUS!", "CHK Design", 109060.0, 7, 22, "Arcus College is a vocational institution which is located at short distance from Germany and Belgium and because of the geographical location of Arcus we can act as a hub for educational institutions within Europe. With knowledge of the Euregion, we are able to place trainees from various countries at companies in the region and intensify an exchange of knowledge between schools. The Internationalisation department of Arcus aspires to build an identity of an international and innovative community to enter into partnerships and long-term relationships between educational institutions and companies. \r\n\r\nWhich objective do we have for this project? \r\n\r\nOur goal for this project is to offer opportunities to our students and staff to gain as much international experience as possible in their profession or education. In addition, we want to offer the teachers and students of our partner schools the same opportunities. \r\n\r\nWhich methods will we use to achieve this? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Agreements with partner organizations \r\n\r\n\u2022 Exchanging and deploy each other's internship network \r\n\r\n\u2022 Helping each other with housing \r\n\r\n\u2022 Strong commitment to job shadowing \r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus on social inclusion (students with different backgrounds, profiles, educational level or physical disability) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus on mastering a foreign language  \r\n\r\nFor this project there is a need to facilitate 190 students who differ in level 2, 3 and 4 to have a short or long-term internship in Europe. In this group, extra attention is paid to level 2 students and students with a physical disability. \r\n\r\nIn the context of professional development, there is a need to offer training, seminars and job shadowing for 86 teachers. \r\n\r\nDue to a promotional campaign from the internationalisation department, there is more demand from students and teachers to go abroad. In order to guide this increase in the right direction, it is important to offer good support in the form of information and organizing activities. \r\n\r\nWith this support, various activities have been set up so that departments engaged in contact with various schools in Europe over the past year. \r\n\r\n\u2022 That resulted in an idea from the hairdressing department to organize job shadowing at Coleg Cambria with several teachers and to exchange traineeships between each other. \r\n\r\n\u2022 With CEF Mallorca we agreed to set up a study program to exchange students and teachers. \r\n\r\n\u2022 School workers who are deployed at Arcus have applied for the Emotional Intelligence training that is given in Barcelona. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Several schools from Spain have asked us to help find suitable internships in the region and offer support in exchange programs, they are also committed that they will offer the same service for our students and teachers. \r\n\r\nThe result we strive for with this project is that after completing an international internship, a student will become wiser, more responsible and more independent and thus more likely to enter the labour market. This international experience should also ensure that a student becomes more understanding with other cultures. For teachers we strive that they share their gained experiences with colleagues and use them during lessons. \r\n\r\n The impact which we want to achieve is that teachers and students take on an ambassador role when they return and motivate others to think and act without borders and broaden their horizon with a European mindset. \r\n\r\nOur long term aim is to: \r\n\r\n- build strategic partnerships. \r\n\r\n- Bring students and teachers within the European Union closer together. \r\n\r\n- Let the students experience that the European Union knows no borders \r\n\r\n- and that all the students with their international experience can be of added value for the companies in the region.  \r\n\r\nWe as Arcus College are convinced that with our enthusiasm, motivation and passion we will ensure that this project will be valuable, sustainable and the necessary impact for all parties for the European Union.", "http://chkdesign.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038808_6"]]}}, "1DY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "ECO - Environment lCooperation Opportunity", "London Borough of Hackney", 23821.0, 4, 4, "Project type: Youth exchange\r\nDate: 4 - 14 July 2014\r\nPlace: Navacepeda de Tormes (\u00c1vila)\r\nParticipants: Asoc.

First point of contact (what is the best way to approach an employer, what type of employer is more receptive to what type of approach, how to reach decision makers within a company).\r\n\r\n2. Persuasion (how to most effectively change perceptions and improve knowledge regarding capabilities of disabled people in the workplace across an entire company organisational structure).\r\n\r\n3. Getting the disabled person into work with due support (how can employers provide due support within the working environment in an effective way and optimising the time spent by internal resources, how youth workers can support young people effectively into employment, how youth organisations can support employers to engage with DDYP).\r\n\r\n4. Gradual withdrawal to allow the disabled person to continue working independently (how long does it take for the person to work independently, what are the steps, what means of verification are needed).\r\n\r\nThe project will achieve the following impact:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improved capability of organisations to test and implement different practices to engage employers.\r\n\u2022 Changed perceptions and knowledge of employers regarding disability in the workplace, improved use of equipment and understanding of appropriate technologies (if needed); improved capability to integrate DDYP into the workplace.\r\n\u2022 Improvements in the way employers support beneficiaries in delivering tasks, improved understanding of the benefits of employing a DDYP; employers are better equipped to hire disabled young people.\r\n\u2022 DDYP are more empowered in the workplace; have improved their interpersonal skills and are more effective in the workplace.\r\n\r\nProject findings and good practices will be adopted by each of the partner organisations by capacity building staff to implement the identified best practices.

The  learning process should be focussed on competences and not just in contents.\r\nThe project plans  build up a Community of Practice to improve the quality of teaching in participant schools. In a world of continuous  social, cultural, economic and technological change, teachers themselves need to reflect on their own teaching practice in the context of their particular school environment and share these thoughts with other teachers. Teachers will be able to learn at  school (through teacher trainning sharing practices, action research, and new educational methods-related planning teams); From this process teachers will be able to enrich the curriculum  in Kindergarten and Primary.\r\nWe plan to build up a partnership among schools in which through the collaboration will promote among teachers professional values and attitides like  reflective practice, autonomous learning, collaboration with colleagues and parents,  engagement in research and innovation as a way to acquire new skills , and an involvement in the development of the whole school.\r\nPartners plan to  support innovative teaching and learning environments on curricula contents, at the same time learners will acquire competences, basic transversal skills, knowledge and attitudes. Teachers will  be trained to  work with new  methods and tools and to create learning practices/e-learning materials that can be used by other schools  in participant countries and other  European countries.\r\nTeachers will draw up  a model for students\u2019 learning that through the national curriculums context will develop transversal skills neded.

First, there is a growing consensus that the social and economic models that have served us for decades are no longer fit for purpose. The \u2018crisis in Europe\u2019 has led to calls for radical new approaches that support \u2018socio-ecological transitions\u2019 for a new sustainable Europe, enabling the EU to cope with pressing problems of climate change, an aging population, pressures on welfare budgets, massive immigration and a growing disillusion with established democratic institutions. Second, there is widespread agreement that a sustainable future cannot be achieved without the active engagement of the individuals who will be forming the core of our future society - European youth. Thirdly, however, there is also widespread agreement that current systems, structures and models are failing young people. Fourthly, set against the trend of a growing core of marginalised and at risk youth, the social inclusion, education and training models that are currently being applied to improve the life chances of young people are also not fit for purpose. \r\nSet against this background, KEYSTONE's main aim is to develop, implement and evaluate an innovative approach to delivering interventions aimed at the socio-economic inclusion of marginalised young people, based on 'Community Lablets'. These Lablets aim to explore how at risk young people can play a pivotal role in creating socio-ecological innovations for a sustainable model for change in the EU. Project strategic objectives are: to identify the key drivers and constraints to young people's participation in interventions; to set up Community Lablets in four EU cities that enable young people  to become co-producers of social innovations; to conduct one action research experiment in each to develop and evaluate a co-produced social innovation;  to share innovation using a \u2018benchlearning\u2019 methodology; to use replication analysis to assess the replicability and sustainability of the Lablet approach at the wider EU level.\r\n\r\nThe partnership is composed of 5 partners from 5 EU member states: Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK.\r\n\r\nThe project overall methodology is based on a \u2018Theory of Change\u2019 framework. The overall methodology incorporates four inter-related components: i)  a research methodology based on \u2018lifeworld analysis\u2019; ii) a \u2018socio-technical\u2019 methodology involving developing ICT-supported \u2018Community Lablets\u2019; iii) a \u2018learning and behaviour change\u2019 methodology to support young people in self-development; iv)  an \u2018action research\u2019 methodology to apply the support programme.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned to implement the project methodology combine: Activity 1: Lifeworld Analysis;  Activity 2: Development of Technical Platform, tools and Knowledge Space;  Activity 3:  Development of KEYSTONE Community Lablets; Activity 4: Development of KEYSTONE Collaborative Support Programme;  Activity 5: Support Programme Implementation and Socio-ecological experiments;  Activity 6: Evaluation;  Activity 7: Dissemination & Replication;  Activity 8: Project Management. \r\n\r\nThe key expected short term results of KEYSTONE for participating young people are:  acquisition of digital competences across a range of ICTs; increased skills in problem solving, creativity, entrepreneurship, communication and teamwork; increased skills in ideas generation; increased critical thinking and evaluation skills; increased capacity to 'read the world' - better understanding of their realities and the communities they live in; increased capacity and skills for joint working and action planning. \r\nIn the long term the potential benefits of the project for participating young people are: re-engagement and retention in education and training; improved digital and media competences; improved transitions into education; more opportunities to apply knowledge in practical and/or novel ways; increased employability and access to labour market opportunities; improved social and personal development; increased social and civic engagement\r\nThe potential benefits for participating youth organisations are: the integration of good practices and new methods into professional activities; more coordinated and better targeted service provision, improved application of ICTs to deliver quality services. Improvements in service delivery will lead to benefits for clients.    \r\nAt the societal level, the project will make a contribution to increasing the quality of youth work in Europe and beyond, better alignment of youth systems to the needs of and opportunities offered by the labour market,  closer links to business and the community and more strategic and integrated use of ICTs and open educational resources (OER) by youth systems.

In the past the project has run from its own premises but due to funding cuts is now run by voluntary staff in a variety of settings. They run one social group every week and support young people on a one-to -one basis when they are refereed from an educational establishment or other youth agency.

This is done by offering individual support and guidance, developing peer led activities and working closely with schools and other agencies to effect increased awareness and support to young people at a critical time in their learning. Our activities are heavily based on informal educational principles and we use experiential learning methods, otherwise refereed to as learning by doing.

The partner projects will be WOW Project from Slovakia and Cazalla from Southern Spain.\r\nThe Inspired by North of the Sun project came about as the young people wanted to create more structure to the group and have the opportunity to increase their employability or access to education by achieving some validation of their work and the inspiration came last year when we went to the BANFF film festival. They  wanted to achieve this in three main ways by gaining certification, by creating an individual project about nature and by learning new skills.\r\n The members wanted to have an opportunity to do something that they had previous never had access to  and that was to travel and visit new places this they felt would help in them making new friends and experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. After researching on the web we came across the Erasmus + programme and read that this could give us the chance to travel to mainland Europe as part of a bigger project. The young people started to talk about ideas and what theme they wanted the project to have and they finally decided that they felt the Environment and Sustainability was a subject they knew little about and wanted to understand further about in relation to themselves and others.\r\nThe project will be split into three main areas a self development section where the young people will be prepared and focus on gaining the required skills necessary to take part e.g linguistic skills, and basic horse riding. They will also decide on an individual project, group project, and create an individual learning plan with their objectives and aims for the project time and into the future.

Part of this learning will be achieved by the young people being involved from the very beginning of the project through to the final evaluation stage.\r\nWe envisage that the project results will include the young people having raised their self esteem, self confidence, they will learn new skills, develop a portfolio of work, had their work validated through the Youth Pass scheme, made new friends from different cultures and backgrounds, been challenged as an individual and as a member of a group, visited new places, done things they never thought they would have the opportunity to and importantly increased their future employability.

These aspects are an important ground on which to focus, not only by the construction of the identity of the individual, but also within the formation of relationships and peer groups of a young person. Today in Europe, the need to maintain an open debate on these issues is all the more evident as one is confronted with the negative consequences of the absence of solid education on the latter topics.  Therefore, our project proposal is focusing on the daily work needs of youth workers, as well as a need for the exchange of practice and a professional debate taking into consideration the latter topics. \r\nThe primary purpose of this project is the construction of a space for dialogue between youth workers and other practitioners from different countries. As well as sharing of their knowledge on the subject of Gender and Sexuality in order to develop an overview of the status about the core topics of the proposed project in Europe. During the course participants will:\r\n- Share the problems and difficulties they are facing about the issues connected with the topic during the course of their daily work activities as youth workers;\r\n- Using elements of non-formal education develop appropriate methodologies to promote the youth culture that respects gender and sexual orientations; \r\n- Reflect and search for means and approaches on fighting stereotypes and inequalities and will provide critical tools of deconstruction of harmful media messages;\r\n- Work on the spread of safe sex and healthy embracing the broad interpretation of sexuality proposed by WHO in \"standard for sex education in Europe\" understood as an area of human potential, which includes in itself the themes of body, identity, affectivity and respect for differences;\r\n- Visit organisations and initiatives to increase awareness of the daily practice on the topics of gender identity, sexuality and gender violence of local surroundings and find more about the issues from the practitioners working daily with the youth. \r\n\r\nThe project methodology is designed in order to create a space for the practitioners within the youth work to exchange, share and reflect on the practices, challenges and obstacles they face regarding the topics of gender equality, equal opportunities; sexual orientation; sexual security, sexual health; gender stereotypes; sexualisation of the media, advertising and objectification and pornography.\r\nDuring the training, a non-formal education methodology will be utilised: groups work, multimedia usage, pop songs analysis, role-play, using cards and board games, creating visual materials, producing informative messages, expressing opinions via physical activities.\r\n\r\nThe main impact on the participants will represent the enrichment of their skills and competences on the topics covered by the training. During the project, youth workers will also enrich their social skills, develop their personality, they will emotionally and culturally grow as they will increase their autonomy and build new relationships. The impact on the participating organisations will consist of sustainable network for exchange, support and development of new ideas, as well as for future collaborations regarding the topic. Moreover, the project will be beneficial due to the increase of knowledge and skills of the organizations' key personnel with regard to the planning, management and evaluation of projects as well as the increase of their experience in working with the youth and sharing of knowledge and information.\r\nFor the target groups, we believe that the greatest impact will be made up of a direct benefit in terms of skills and abilities due to transferred lessons learned to daily practices of the youth workers participating in this training. Additionally, the target groups will benefit from a positive input to the design of daily activities of participating organizations based on the project results and the visibility for the youth organizations and the emergence of good practices.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-SI02-KA105-012777_7"]]}}}}
