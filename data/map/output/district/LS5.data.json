Children in Permaculture (CiP) is a unique, highly innovative project based on a genuine needs analysis about how to teach those values to children from an early age.\r\n\r\nWe have carefully selected an enthusiastic and dedicated team to take forward our application, some of whom have worked together in EU projects, and some have never met before, and yet have found over the last few months developing this project, how well they work together. With NGO partners from Romania, UK, Slovenia, Italy and Czech Republic, a UK state school and a kindergarten & after-school centre in Romania - the diversity which we bring will enable the CiP partnership to blossom and bring quality fruits to the education table.\r\n\r\nThe CiP partners will engage a variety of organisations to improve the education of children in formal, non-formal and informal learning through the development of Children in Permaculture Best Practices Resources which will enable school and kindergarten teachers, leaders, parents and other educators to engage in a holistic, sustainable education with the children they are working with.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives are:\r\n1. To identify, develop and test CiP best practices resources (curricula, lesson plans, activities and other resources) with 17+ educators of children aged 3-12 years in the 5 partner countries. \r\n2. To improve competences and skills in outdoor permaculture education, intercultural awareness and sustainability of up to 150 school and kindergarten teachers/assistants.\r\n3.

Permaculture, a powerful tool for ecological resource building and for societal integration and citizenship practice, needs to be practiced not just by the landed, but also by the landless \u2013 students, school children, youth, apartment-dwellers, itinerant travelers, migrants, those suffering forced displacement and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nWe have made some strides towards these goals.

Permaculture is a holistic design science built on ethics and principles focusing on taking care of nature, people and a fair share of resources. With this point of departure and understanding of the educator's role, learning and training in all sustainable and regenerative practices from nuts as a niche production to transition of local communities is performed.

It will primarily be integrated through the LAND network. LAND centres are training and education places centering on pratical application and real life sustenance, typically located in marginal areas - the islands Fej\u00f8, Bornholm, \u00c6r\u00f8, Sams\u00f8 and Northern Jutland. However, there are also locations in and near Copenhagen. The LAND centres organises training, courses and tours etc and they play a pivotal role in the local networks. They are publically available and spread knowledge about sustainable solutions and local entrepreneurship. They counteract centralisation and unemployment and they strengthen responsability towards local resources, both human, economic and environmental. This approach to marginal areas can give new life and regeneration which in the long term can stimulate societal development at large.\r\n\r\nThe collated experience of this capacity building project can be integrated in the European cooperation and inspire countries that also experience a  growth in permaculture.

These diploma holders also supervise teaching on other PDC courses, where the course-holders themselves have not yet completed their diplomas and been certified. Permaculture Denmark aims to improve this situation, by certifying more qualified teachers at diploma level.\r\n\r\nThe diploma system has traditionally been governed by the three Nordic permaculture associations. The system is still not up-to-date and needs clear learning outcomes, especially since permaculture has been greatly developed in the last few decades. The English system is thoroughly thought-out and much further developed than the Nordic system. We are seeing a rise in the number of diploma students in Scandinavia, who take their diploma with the British Permaculture Association as the qualifying body. Permaculture Denmark would like to integrate the best-practices from the two diploma systems into the Nordic cooperation, but this task is not without its challenges. As a result we are experiencing a bottle-neck effect, where not enough certified courses are offered to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nPermaculture is a holistic design system, that addresses all areas of human needs, but there is a particular importance placed on caring for the earth, caring for people and a fair sharing of resources. This is permaculture\u2019s ethical foundation. The word permaculture comes from \u201cpermanent culture\u201d, and \u201cpermanent agriculture\u201d. The permaculture movement is rapidly growing all over the world; and is a reaction to climate-change, pollution, economic crisis and increasing global pressure on food-production and biodiversity. The LAND network (Learning, Activities, Network and Demonstration sites for permaculture) has been created to meet the need for practical demonstration of permaculture and give course participants the opportunity to combine theory with hands-on learning.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nPermaculture Denmark wishes in particular to educate more permaculturists to meet the growing demand for permaculture courses. This education will take place through: \r\n- Training of new teachers\u2019 professionalism and/or didactic skills; \r\n- Continued development of the diploma system; \r\n- Quality control of certified courses; \r\n- Increased number of diploma holders; \r\n- Development of the LAND network in the Nordic and Baltic countries.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nWe expect that the cooperation with the English association and the associated course providers, as well as the Nordic permaculture associations will continue to heighten the quality of the Danish teachers and their teaching. This project will offer: \r\n- New technical/professional knowledge to 2 teachers;\r\n- New pedagogical competences to 6 teachers, through training of teachers and job-shadowing;\r\n- Perspective and professionalism through Diploma Gatherings to at least 5 diploma students;\r\n- Increased cooperation of European countries, and the opportunity for the collective creation of courses and job opportunities with other permaculture associations through the European Permaculture Convergence;\r\n- Improved qualifications for new teachers and the strengthening of the LAND network around the Baltic sea by holding a teacher training course in Finland.\r\n\r\nLong-term results: \r\nThe technical knowledge brought home, is one part of our plan to demonstrate a truly sustainable and profitable alternative to modern farming. The course provider we have chosen, Ridgedale Farm in Sweden, is possibly the most successful in Europe in relation to economical, ecological and social sustainability. Every year we send a few students to Ridgedale, in order to support the practical and theoretical use of regenerative farming and permaculture.\r\n\r\nOur focus on development of the diploma system and our focus on the training of teachers will greatly streamline our organisations education system and will mean a greater capacity and quality overall. At the same time the basis for a productive European cooperation with greater mobility of teachers and a nuanced and sufficient array of courses, education, practical experiences, demonstration sites and strong organisations, that can offer sustainable solutions in the climate crisis.\r\n\r\nWe do our best to increase the capacity of the Baltic organisations.

The continuity of the collaboration with these partners is important, especially for the development and strengthening of the diploma system in the Nordic countries and the LAND network, as well as participation in strategic planning for the development of permaculture in Europe. One partner is new and brings new knowledge and new methods into cooperation, \"Regenerative Agriculture\", which is a discipline that is highly relevant in the world, and not least in Denmark.1. 2 LAND teachers in large-scale permaculture are to attend a course in England on RegenFarm for practice and demonstration of the concept \"Regenerative Agriculture Practices\" - a form of agriculture that builds up the earth's resources instead of depleting them. The teachers will immediately apply and disseminate their new knowledge, partly through their own LAND center, partly through cooperation with other educational institutions.2. 3 Participants with an interest in strategic planning and international networks participating in the \"European Permaculture Convergence\" (EuPC) which this year is hosted by the Italian Permaculture Academy. Long-term plans are created and harmonised across European countries at the convergence, especially within education, research and the LAND network. Permaculture Denmark both influences the decision-making through our strong contribution and will also be affected by any decisions made here in the future.3. 2 LAND educators attend Cultivate in Ireland to cultivate their facilitation skills. Their new skills are immediately put into use in teaching at LAND centers and they will organize a seminar to demonstrate good facilitation within the LAND network.4. 1 diploma holder and 1 diploma apprentice will go to England to obtain deeper knowledge of the English diploma system at their National Diploma Gathering. Contributions from the gathering will qualify the Nordic diploma system. An appropriate diploma system is necessary for permaculturists in the Nordic countries to have an effecient framework for training and contemplation of their action learning pathways.5. 2 LAND educators travel to Norway to assist the development of the Norwegian LAND network. Sharing experiences and best solutions to some of the challenges which LAND Denmark have had, will help to focus on solutions and their dissimination both in Denmark and Norway.Capacity building efforts have already yielded tangible results. The number of courses held in Denmark with success has increased as well as the diversity of the educational options. The demand for expertise in permaculture is soaring as permaculture is essentially concerned with sustainable solutions in response to climate change.
