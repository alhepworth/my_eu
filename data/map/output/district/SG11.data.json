In brief Dga is about improving students' skills through a professionalisation of all levels of upper secondary education in Akershus. One of the main intitiatives is the \"professionalisation of teachers' through incorporating common core competencies and common attitudes in the upper secondary schools of Akershus. To \"have a culture of sharing of good practice\" and to be \"able to reflect upon their own teaching\" is among the core competencies expected of the teachers in the Akershus schools. We believe a relevant contribution to achieving these goals will be to have teachers complete staff mobility activities. \r\n\r\nThe project involves sending 40 teachers from seven of the 34 secondary schools in Akershus on staff mobility activities in various European countries. Akershus County Council has formed a \"consortium\" of these seven secondary schools. The activities consist mainly of job shadowing at a partner school and participation in structured courses, in addition to some who will teach at a partner school abroad. The activities last from three days to two weeks and will take place at partner schools and professional course organisers in various European countries. The teachers will be representing disciplines such as history, foreign languages, social sciences and Norwegian.\r\n\r\nWe want the teachers who participate in the project to be more reflected towards their own and others' teaching practice in addition to: \r\n- learn about other schools assessment practices and forms of cooperation between teachers and students\r\n- learn about class management\r\n- examine various forms of collaboration among teachers and between teachers and management\r\n- be updated on their discipline in cooperation with partner schools or course providers in Europe\r\n- be more motivated and knowledgeable staff that can spread good practice in their own school and in the county as a whole\r\n\r\nWe expect that this leads to a general increased awareness and openness about teaching and other relevant topics at each school. We also believe it can have a positive effect towards internationalisation and that it can lead to increased international activity by the schools involved. Ultimately this will benefit the pupils. Having motivated, dedicated, skilled, knowledgeable and updated teachers is the best starting point for pupils to learn more, to have more pupils complete upper secondary education and a high quality of the teaching, which are all among the main strategic goals we are working towards in upper secondary education in Akershus.", "http://www.stedmundscollege.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NO01-KA101-013182_2"]]}}}}
