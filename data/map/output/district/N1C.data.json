Our aim is to lead inclusive debate and action which promotes the role of women in music and the potential creative and economic contribution they could be making to Europe\u2019s music industry.Showcases, networking events and a Creative Lab Capacity Building programme will give a new network of 60 women the chance to build a sustainable international profile and extend their reach to audiences in Europe and beyond. The Lab provides opportunities for music creators to connect with the pioneering work of artists and entrepreneurs from tech, design, AV and other sectors which shape change and new business models. These activities will be backed by a dynamic web/social media platform that offers learning opportunities to hundreds of women from beyond Keychange\u2019s network, raising awareness of the music gender gap through targeted stories, case studies and tips.  Keychange activities will be devised, run and hosted by 6 European music festivals and an associate festival in Canada to extend the project\u2019s sharing of European values. To maximise new thinking, our Creative Lab will include an \u201cinnovation fund\u201d which offers small bursaries to Keychange participants to test new ideas and ways of working. A bold communications strategy backed by high profile artist ambassadors, pioneers and executives will maximise the project\u2019s impact. Through Keychange we tackle discrimination whilst enabling more women to develop new skills/business models and realise their potential as catalysts for creative change. Longer-term, partners will continue to collaborate on Keychange\u2019s manifesto, social media platforms and innovation fund. Keychange alumni will become role models for next generations.", "http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com", "THE PERFORMING RIGHT SOCIETY FOUNDATION", "creative_583777-CREA-1-2017-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Growing great teachers", "Camden Learning Limited", 198867.0, 1, 1, "Camden is proud to have a school system that enjoys a high reputation and delivers results for Camden learners. The aspiration in Camden now is to move from good to great by working in the ways that the very best systems work. In September 2014 Camden schools and the Council created the Camden Schools Led Partnership (CSLP), now superseded by Camden Learning, to build on the successes of Camden schools and create a system designed to deliver excellence for every pupil and the best schools in the country.\r\nCamden Learning is therefore a not for profit company formed by the Camden Schools Led Partnership (CSLP). It is managed by a borad of 7 directors.\r\nCamden Learning aims to ensure that every child achieves the best possible educational outcomes in all areas of life through developing growth mind sets, having high aspirations and learning well both independently and with others. We believe that this can be achieved through working together in partnership to secure sustained educational improvement and innovation.\r\nCamden learning includes all of the schools in Camden including: primary, secondary, PRUs and social schools.\r\n\r\nAround 1 out of 4 newly qualified teachers drop out of teaching by the second year in post, it is paramount that we provide these individuals with with a high level of support and inspirational opportunities. \r\nWe have therefore, identified that NQTs and RQTs are those  who are at the heart of the future of our education. Therefore investing in their development will not only impact on their own ability to deliver excellent education but also on pupils who will be more inspired to continue their learning journey.\r\nTo implement strategies that allow schools to be effective in their practice and work towards modernisation and innovation of teaching and learning within a  European context to the curriculum,  we have identifies some key areas of development across all schools members of the consortium and also common to the Camden schools  as a whole:\r\nArea 1:\r\nPedagogy  ( Developing teaching and learning of teaching and non-teaching staff)\r\nArea 2:\r\nSEND ( Develop understanding of special education and disabilities in order to develop appropriate strategies to make learning more effective)\r\nArea 3: \r\nInternationalisation of learning (Developing a curriculum that allows for collaboration, exchange and sharing of practice with peers in Europe)\r\nThe opportunity to take part in this project would highly impact on the work across not only the schools part of this project but also on all of the schools part of Camden Learning as a partnership.\r\nTherefore the  Growing great teachers project main objectives are:\r\n* Enhance teaching and learning  of staff \r\n* Enhance the teaching and learning through the use of outdoors and forest schools\r\n* Enhance and develop the provision for SEND\r\n* Internationalisation of the curriculum through observation and evaluation of  curriculum models in other countries \r\n* Develop a global curriculum\r\n* Develop links with schools in Europe  to broaden cultural understanding\r\n* Strengthen research and development\r\nGrowing great teachers include staff from 10 different primary and secondary schools, a special school and a hospital school.\r\nThe project Growing great teachers foresees attendance at 6 structures training courses in Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Spain where we envisage 120 staff attending across 10 schools. Growing great teachers aims specifically to address the needs to those who are new to the teaching profession  and their mentors as well as a range of teaching and non teaching staff.  They will be selected based on motivation, personal development needs and plan for integrating and disseminating new skills, competencies, methods and experiences. \r\nGrowing great teachers project will impact on a number of areas:\r\n1. Pedagogy  ( Developed teaching and learning of teaching and non-teaching staff)\r\n2. SEND ( Developed understanding of special education and disabilities in order to develop appropriate strategies to make learning more effective)\r\n3. Internationalised learning (Developed curriculum that allows for collaboration, exchange and sharing of practice with peers in Europe)\r\n\r\nThe target audience are:\r\nStaff who are new to the teaching profession and need continuous support to develop teaching practice and ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to experience excellence\r\nMentors as those who would  also be key in innovating practice as their role is key in guiding and developing those who are in their first years of teaching.\r\nStaff ( teaching and non-teaching staff)\r\nPupils in all schools ( consortium and outside of the consortium)\r\nThe project produce a best practice tools kit which will distribute to staff within and outside of the consortium.\r\nThe long term benefits will be on the development of a workforce that is able to inspire learning, break down barriers to learning and provide all pupils with high quality teaching to develop their thinking as global citizens.", "http://www.schoolsupportservices.camden.gov.uk/Camden-Learning/", "Camden Learning Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036417_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "THE PERFORMING RIGHT SOCIETY FOUNDATION", 95704.0, "Culture -programme \u2014 Supporting cross-border actions and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (15.04.02)", "fts_2017_39861"]]}}}}
