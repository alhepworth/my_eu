Their primary motive is the mobility within and for Europe.  The five students are not ready to do their internship in a foreign speaking country yet.\r\n\r\nFor 20 students the third school year ends on May 31st, 2017 and the following school year starts on October 2nd, 2017. \r\n\r\nIn the curriculum of the five years of education at the HLW it is written, that a compulsory internship with a minimum duration of three months between the third and fourth school year is part of the school education. The internship may be completed in an economic and administration business, but preferably in hotel and gastronomy businesses.

The European Social Pedagogy model will be the approach that will be studied, both academically and in practice.  This model has been proven to improve young people's outcomes, particularly those who live in the care system.  \r\n\r\nThe project will offer:\r\n\r\n- new professional opportunities to understand, learn and share best European Social Pedagogy working practices, across a range of European settings;\r\n- improved working practices in youth work settings across the UK and Germany;\r\n- networking and job shadowing opportunities for youth workers; and\r\n- opportunities for young people in the UK and German care systems, to share their experiences with the visiting professionals.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated project impact will be that all the participants will improve their theoretical and practical skills in Social Pedagogy, in relation to supporting Europe's most vulnerable young people.  This will enable the sharing of the best practice and will contribute to the transformation of the way we support children and young people living in care.  This will provide them with a much brighter future with vastly improved life outcomes. \r\n\r\nBreak and Elisabethheim Havetoft have been partners since 2009, since a Norfolk County Council social pedagogy research visit took place.

The exchanges will offer a range of activities to: provide the young people with experience living in new environments; develop their skills and expand their horizons; and improve their European citizen and cultural awareness.\r\n\r\nThe young people taking part in the project have very high levels of need.  They all come from difficult and challenging home lives (most having experienced abuse, and parental mental health and drug and alcohol issues).  All of them have Special Educational Needs: either in terms of learning difficulties and/or disability, or in terms of mental health or behavioural disorders.\r\n\r\nThere will also be staff exchanges for 4 youth workers at Break and Elisabethheim Havetoft, to enable them to share social pedagogy best practice and so that they can learn from the different approaches in supporting extremely vulnerable young people at each Centre.\r\n\r\nThe project impact anticipated is that all the young participants will improve their skills in areas such as communication, sense of initiative, and cultural and European awareness.  This will provide the young people with invaluable experience that they can bring back and apply to themselves in their home environments.  Staff undergoing exchanges will also be able to exchange their professional skills and then apply this new knowledge to their work environments on their return.\r\n\r\nBreak and Elisabethheim Havetoft have been partners since 2009, since a Norfolk County Council social pedagogy research visit took place.
