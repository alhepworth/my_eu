Dr Inventor is built on the vision that technologies have great potential to supplement human ingenuity in science by overcoming the limitations that people suffer in pursuing scientific discovery. It presents an original system that will provide inspiration for scientific creativity by utilising the rich presence of web-based research resources. Dr Inventor will act as a personal research assistant, utilising machine-empowered search and computation to bring researchers extended perspectives for scientific innovation by informing them of a broad spectrum of relevant research concepts and approaches, by assessing the novelty of research ideas, and by offering suggestions of new concepts and workflows with unexpected features for new scientific discovery.<br/>Dr Inventor is an attempt to understand the potential of technology in the scientific creative process within current technology limitations. It represents a sound balance between scientific insight into individual scientific creative processes and technical implementation using innovative technologies in information extraction, document summarization, semantics and visual analytics. The outcomes will be integrated into a web-based system that will allow evaluation in a selected research area under real-world settings with carefully designed metrics, benchmarks and baseline for creative performance, leading to tangible measurements on the performance of the technologies in enhancing human creativity and a blueprint for future technologies in computational creativity.<br/>Dr Inventor has huge implications for scientific innovation in Europe, as it has the potential to change the way in which scientific research is undertaken. The acceptance of the system by general research communities will open opportunities for many industrial sectors, leading to reinforced leadership of European industry.<br/>", 229239.0, 2686733.0, 5, 9, "Dr Inventor", null, null, null, "fp7_111242_957192412"], [1317427200000, 1380499200000, "A General Toolkit for \u201cGPUtilisation\u201d in SME Applications", "Ansmart Ltd", "The recent explosion of GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) power has not been fully utilised by many SMEs, possibly because GPU programming requires specialist skills different from those of conventional programming. GPSME will provide the SME participants  with a simple route to accessing GPU power.\nEach of the SME participants is facing increasing competition in the market and GPSME will allow them to greatly improve their products in terms of speed and quality without major overheads. By involving close cooperation between the SMEs and RTD performers, GPSME will develop a toolkit to automate the conversion of existing sequential CPU code to an optimal GPU implementation. With such a toolkit, the SMEs will be able to convert their existing CPU code without committing significant effort and time. It will also support the execution of advanced techniques within acceptable runtimes and hence allow the SMEs to use more complex computing models in their new products. This will bring them major commercial benefits and significantly improve their market positions.\nTechnically, GPSME features techniques to adapt automatic parallelization to the latest GPU compute architecture to deliver optimal performance. This is expected to greatly improve on traditional CPU-based automatic parallelization. The literature review has suggested that the techniques in this area are still very much in their infancy and that there is no existing toolkit that can benefit the SMEs immediately.\nThe application areas of the SME participants are widely differing, so GPSME will produce a breakthrough that will open the door for great performance gains across many areas of application. This development will be particularly suitable for SMEs that focus applications on moderate platforms. In the long term, the outcomes of GPSME will benefit many companies and improve industrial competitiveness across the whole European Union.", 181008.0, 1245333.0, 5, 8, "GPSME", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111921.jpg", "fp7_100608_957192412"], [1362096000000, 1456704000000, "A Demonstration of 4D Digital Avatar Infrastructure for Access of Complete Patient Information", "Ansmart Ltd", "Owing to the highly fragmented health systems in European countries, gaining access to a consistent record of individual citizens that involves cross-border activities is very difficult. MyHealthAvatar is an attempt at a proof of concept for the digital representation of patient health status. It is designed as a lifetime companion for individual citizens that will facilitate the collection of, and access to, long-term health-status information. This will be extremely valuable for clinical decisions and offer a promising approach to acquire population data to support clinical research, leading to strengthened multidisciplinary research excellence in supporting innovative medical care.<br/>MyHealthAvatar will be built on the latest ICT technology with an aim of engaging public interest to achieve its targeted outcomes. In addition to data access, it is also an interface to access integrative models and analysis tools, utilizing resources already created by the VPH community. Overall, it will contribute to individualized disease prediction and prevention and support healthy lifestyles and independent living. It is expected to exert a major influence on the reshaping of future healthcare in the handling of increased life expectancy and the ageing population in Europe. This complies with the priority and strategy of FP7 ICT for healthcare, and constitutes a preparatory action aiming at the grand challenge on a 'Digital Patient', which is currently the subject of a roadmap in the VPH community.<br/>MyHealthAvatar places a special emphasis on engaging the public. It has huge implications to the society both socially and economically. The initiative of designing a personal avatar can potentially change the way we think, communicate and search for information.

Market analysts estimate a compound annual growth rate of 18,7% and a total of 5,4 GW installed worldwide between 2013 and 2019. One of the main drivers for BIPV market growth in the EU is the increasingly demanding legislation related to energy performance in buildings. The large potential for energy savings in buildings led the EU Commission to adopt the 2010/31/EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings with the objective that all new buildings are Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) by 2020. Renewable energy technologies, and in particular the integration of photovoltaic systems in the building environment offer many possibilities to play a key role within the NZEB scenario. \n\nDespite this favorable framework for BIPV technology market uptake, initial estimations of BIPV market growth have been subsequently overestimated in the past few years. A series of demands from the stakeholders which have not been properly addressed by the BIPV value chain are the cause for this deviation. These key requirements are mainly related to the flexibility in design and aesthetics considerations, lack of tools integrating PV and building performance, demonstration of long-term reliability of the technology, compliance with legal regulations, smart interaction with the grid and cost effectiveness. Within this context:\n\nThe objective of PVSITES project is to drive BIPV technology to a large market deployment by demonstrating an ambitious portfolio of building-integrated solar technologies and systems, giving a forceful, reliable answer to the market requirements identified by the industrial members of the consortium in their day-to-day activity.
