This will required scale up from our current >20-50 Litres per hour systems to those capable of processing >1000 in line with customer demand.  This will enable us to sell into both single line and  full site effluent treatment, ranging from small meat rendering plants up to full scale municipal waste water treatment.\nThe original system treats fluid in quartz tubes supplied with sufficient UV-C light to operate.  A TiO2 photo-catalyst coated auger causes oscillation and scrubs tube walls clean.  Conventional systems immerse single lamps in fluid; we use multiple high powered UV-C lamps around tubes to achieve higher volume kill ratios making iPURtech uniquely suitable for scale up.\nTiO2 reactors are well researched yet little large scale commercial delivery has resulted.  To succeed commercially this must be practical.  Direct linear scale up is not possible, issues such as coating light weight auger materials over greater surface areas, UV dose, system size and weight and must be addressed.    Over summer of 2014, testing was carried out with a range of meat renderers and with the input of a range of technical and commercial specialists.  This has resulted in the development of a very strong research, development, supply and sales team and we are confident of our combined abilities to deliver at commercial scale immediately post this demonstration.", null, 1501245.0, 1, 4, "iPURXL", null, null, null, "h2020_198239_934380146"]]}}, "1RS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Startup Master and Advanced Reflective Tools by Universities & Partners", "TOTEM LEARNING LTD", 560531.0, 10, 11, "SMARTUP is the result of a smart cooperation effort between higher education institutes, companies, the EU Crowdfunding Network and business foundations from nine EU countries and Stanford University. The aim is to develop an innovative Startup Master & Advanced Reflective Tools through cooperation between Universities and companies belonging to innovative sectors, based on the idea that students need entrepreneurial competences to succeed: both hard about management and innovation, and soft and transversal skills, including those  for self-awareness and resilience. SMARTUP offers wide-ranging support to face the challenges inherent in the entrepreneurial process, by providing a smart way to become a startupper in work and life. The project will build offline and online tools to support students in the early stages of enterprise development, from crafting their idea to accessing finance. A smart open space will be provided where would-be entrepreneurs can share knowledge and know how - but also tricks and tips \u2013 to face the challenge of creating a successful start-up; the community will be animated by students, startuppers, teachers, mentors, entrepreneurs, and investors. A key component of this supporting path will be a Master programme \u2013 developed and tested by participating universities in close cooperation with the other partners - linked to online instruments and contents, including serious games, coaching apps, and mentoring and mindfulness tools. SMARTUP will therefore integrate the different contributions of participating academic institutions and business organizations by means of new methodological approaches, in order to produce two main outputs: an innovative Master on entrepreneurship and an inclusive web portal for students and startuppers willing to improve their entrepreneurial knowledge and mindset.", "http://www.totemlearning.com", null, "erasmus_575662-EPP-1-2016-1-IT-EPPKA2-KA_3"], [2014, "Initiative to foster Social Entrepreneurship Experience for Youth", "TOTEM LEARNING LTD", 139019.0, 7, 8, "The I SEE YOU project is an initiative of 8 partners from 7 countries (AT, ES, IT, SK, IRL, RO, UK) addressing the critical issue of youth unemployment (YU) in the European Union placing a special emphasis on migrants. \r\n\r\nYU has become one of the most pressing labor market issues in Europe since the economic crisis. Entering the labor market poses major challenges for young people in many European countries such as Spain, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, UK, Ireland and Austria, which manifests itself in a high YE rate. An even higher unemployment rate is faced by migrants and minority group members, who have to battle social exclusion. Many European and national initiatives or programs aim to tackle the problem, however, focusing on isolated aspects and with limited success. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA key way out of unemployment for many young people is entrepreneurship. 40% of European youth have indicated an interest in self-employment, as it provides them with independence & self-determination. They are highly interested in IT-focused as well as social businesses, which are observable trends in many European countries. Studies show that many young people lack skills, networks & received inadequate entrepreneurship education. Nurturing entrepreneurial attitudes and skills is in the focus of I SEE YOU. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI SEE YOU aims to offer a flexible, integrative approach to train & capacitate young people to become skillful social entrepreneurs in IT by developing the capabilities & skills of young unemployed people (18-24) with an affinity for IT & interest in creating their own social businesses. I SEE YOU provides core results: targeted activation,  training modules, international collaboration, creativity workshops, business model & plan development, mentoring and a business simulation tool. A special focus will be put on migrants / minority youth. The first year of I SEE YOU is dedicated to the activation and capacitation of youth through trainings and intercultural experiences, while the second year will focus on implementing the acquired skills by writing business plans and using a social business simulation tool in a competitive setting. The youth will constantly be accompanied, mentored and brought in contact with key stakeholders from the business world (start-up centers, Business Angels etc.) to establish valuable networks for their future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main activities are:\r\n\r\ni) Development and Execution of Entrepreneurship Trainings based on 10 essential key competences \r\n\r\n   At least 105 participating young people from 7 countries will be capacitated (over 500 will be reached through dissemination).\r\n\r\n   The OERs will be translated and made available in all 7 project languages\r\n\r\nii) Mentoring of business creation process\r\n\r\n    7 Creative Workshops (transnational teams of 15 young people)   \r\n\r\n    7 business plans connected to social entrepreneurship & IT\r\n\r\niii) Creation of a Social Business Simulation Tool\r\n\r\n       Allow youth to apply learned concepts in a virtual setting\r\n\r\niv) Involvement and Capacitation of Migrant / Minority Youth\r\n\r\n     At least 35 migrant / minority youth members will participate in the project (over 100 will be reached through dissemination).\r\n\r\n     A Migrant / Minority Inclusion Strategy will be developed and distributed to decision- & policy-makers\r\n\r\nv) Community building / Connecting youth with youth and key stakeholders\r\n\r\n    Building transnational teams to foster intercultural skills & create a European identity \r\n\r\n    Involvement of multipliers (start-up centers, labor market agencies etc.) and financiers (Business Angels) \r\n\r\n    All produced outputs will be provided as OERs to the public and disseminated according to a detailed strategy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will implemented by a consortium with a strong background in EU-project management and a wide range of expertise from developing a needs analysis to training providers, migrant support experts, IT game developers and business creation support organizations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impact of I SEE YOU will be created through massive dissemination and multiplication of activities. The participating youth will be capacitated and their skill sets on entrepreneurship increased, which will enable them to open their own business. If they do not follow an entrepreneurial career after the end of the project, they have gained all relevant competences enabling them to act as intrapreneurs and will therefore be in high demand and possess a competitive advantage at the labor market in the IT sector.
