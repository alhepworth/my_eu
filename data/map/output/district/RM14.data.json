There are 335 students and 40 teachers here. The Erasmus Plus Project is for us the answer to all questions related to quality and methods of teaching in the modern world. While teaching we connect knowledge, education, culture and creativity. But we know, that innovations based on modern technologies motivate students learning, reduce school failures as well as enhance the teacher\u2019s profile. \r\nDoing the project we are going to: increase our ICT abilities using modern technology in the classroom, make our curriculum innovative and  learn foreign languages.  Our aim for the future is to continue the school partnerships and work together on a new project connected with job market, unemployment and career awareness. We are planning to exchange ideas that will be helpful for our students concerning the job market. The course, that we are going to attend, will help to improve our ICT abilities and enrich our school\u2019s strategy plan with innovative methods of teaching. \r\nThe aim of the project is to develop our students\u2019 intellect and their communication skills. We are sure that using modern technology changes the way they see the world. The project\u2019s participants are 6 teachers (two foreign language teachers, two ICT /Math\u2019s teachers, a science teacher and a polish teacher) who will spread the ideas to the rest of our school staff.
