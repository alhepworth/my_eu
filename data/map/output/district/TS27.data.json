Unfortunately, most mycotoxins are known to hazardously contaminate crops and consequently animal feeds and animal products, causing significant economic losses associated with their impact on animal and human health, animal productivity and domestic and international trade. While the economic effects are not easily calculated due to the several participants in the grain sector, European Union is setting stricter and stricter limits of mycotoxin concentrations. Deoxynivalenol also known as DON or vomitoxin is one of about 150 related compounds known as the trichothecenes that are formed by a number of species of Fusarium and some other fungi. It is nearly always formed before harvest when crops are invaded by certain species of Fusarium such as F. graminearum and F. culmorum. Our goal would be twofold: -developing a new sampling technique guaranteeing a 95% bulk transparency, -adapting a biosensor technology for the detection of deoxynivalenol. The electrochemical detection was selected as the amperometric sensor technology using a special biorecognitive layer proved to be the most reliable, low-cost method to be used in an on-site operating device. Our proposed solution will provide an easy-to-use, environmentally friendly, continuously operating system to fight against the mycotoxin infection.", 248510.0, 3032421.0, 10, 19, "MYCOHUNT", null, "http://www.electrosensortech.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112116.jpg", "fp7_95606_974308450"], [1362096000000, 1425081600000, "Saponification pre-treatment and biosensors based control system for slaughterhouse waste anaerobic digestion improvement", "Electrochemical Sensor Technology (Est) Limited", "Slaughterhouses (mainly for pigs, cattle and poultry which make up almost 93% of the total world meat production) produce large amounts of different wastes and wastewaters. Direct disposal of highly polluted wastewater and organic residues into the sewerage system without prior treatment on the other hand is mostly not acceptable due to resulting environmental and ecological problems and the risk of clogging in the wastewater piping systems. By banning land disposal slaughterhouse waste management, the European Regulation led to a drastic limitation of their management options, and an increase of total slaughtering industry costs. Incineration is recommended for high risk animal waste but the investment and maintenance cost makes them not suitable for the treatment of non-risk animal waste. Slaughterhouse waste is characterised by high content of lipids, which difficult other treatment strategies, like anaerobic digestion (AD). Current AD technologies for biogas production are still suffering from technical and economical obstacles, which are limiting its use as an energy source. Therefore, EU slaughterhouse holders need new solutions with improved cost-efficiency that permit them to treat the waste and accomplish with EU regulations (Directive 1774/2002) without compromising the margin of benefit.\nThis proposal will look for an improvement of biogas technologies by development a post-treatment for the recovery of Nitrogen for fertilizing processes.\n-Improving biogas yields by advance control system for real time monitoring\n-Improving biogas yields by using a saponification pre-treatment. Research is being done to use a saponification pre-treatment but more research is needed to optimise the process.

The main pest insects causing crop losses in Europe are Sciarid flies, whereas the main diseases are the fungus Verticillium, Mycogone, Dactilium and Tricoderma. Many chemicals are no longer approved for use, and with an increased demand for reduced pesticide use. Mushroom growers have an increased pressure to implement these alternatives on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and Directive 2009/128/EC. Quick actions and IPM solutions are therefore urgently needed for mushroom growers as reported by their national associations in order to adapt to a stringent legislation to reduce pesticide use.\nThe main aim of BIOMUSH project is to help European mushroom growers to implement IPM as part of their growing activities both to comply with the upcoming legislation and to reduce crop losses and production costs by efficiently manage pests and diseases. The main objectives: -Develop a tool for early detection of mushroom fungal diseases in situ to facilitate the control of competitor fungi and fungal diseases increasing productivity by 4%; -Provide novel biopesticides for the treatment of pests and diseases in mushroom; -Develop crop specific guidelines for Integrated Pest Management in mushroom crops in Europe; -Training to professional users and distributors.\nBy facilitating the implementation of IPM techniques in mushroom, growers will be able to comply with the upcoming regulation which encourages natural pest control mechanisms reducing pesticides use per farm by at least 70% (3,472 Tons in Europe after 5 years).

A recent survey indicates that half of people do not understand the differences between date labels and 40% of consumers are skeptical to the traditional label system. As a consequence, tons of unnecessary fresh meat wastes are produced every day.\nThe aim of TOXDTECT project is to develop an Intelligent Packaging solution for fresh Bovine meat products. The proposed system will consist of a passive array of sensors easily embedded within the package at low cost via printing. An external reader will power the sensors and will correlate the different parameters measured in the headspace in order to determine the real state and properties of the meat. Using this information, the system will be able to determine the remaining shelf life of the product according to existing safety regulations. . Compared to existing test methods like sensory and microbiological analysis which are costly and destructive, our solution will offer a non-destructive, accurate and cost-effective method to determine the integrity of packed meat and predict its shelf life.
