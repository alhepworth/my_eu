They mainly comprise a mosaic of two Annex 1 Habitats Directive woodland habitats: \u2018Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles\u2019 and \u2018Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines\u2019. However, the conservation status of these two habitats is \u2018unfavourable-bad and declining\u2019 and \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019 at the Atlantic biogeographic level. The primary cause is invasion by non-native plant species, especially the shrub Rhododendron ponticum, which alters light and soil conditions, outcompetes native flora and suppresses regeneration. Among the other threats are over- or under-grazing, a lack of management, and atmospheric nitrogen pollution. The UK holds around 95% of the old sessile woods and 70% of the Tilio-Acerion forest habitats, and therefore has a particular responsibility to return these habitats to a \u2018favourable\u2019 conservation status.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6690", null, "life_4"]]}}}}
