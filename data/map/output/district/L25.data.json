Our proportion of pupils with special educational needs is twice the national average.\r\n\r\nSt Francis Xavier\u2019s offers a rich and varied curriculum to students of all abilities. It is designed to stretch the gifted and to encourage those who require additional support.\r\n\r\nLatin and Greek, Modern Foreign Languages, and the separate Sciences are all taught at GCSE. A range of options is available to the students which compliments the traditional subjects and provides a broad and flexible curriculum.\r\n\r\nAs a language department, we strive to have a broad international outlook and be actively involved in international activities. \r\n\r\nWe are currently completing a small Erasmus+ project, and have been delighted with its outcomes.\r\n\r\nThrough evaluating our current provision and examining the current needs and issues of our department, we have devised a series of objectives for a new Erasmus+.project We have worked closely together as a department to establish these objectives and have also discussed them with the senior management team. Our objectives take into account our whole school aims and priorities.\r\n\r\nWe plan to develop a further two-year project involving 13 mobilities; 5 to France and 8 to Spain to;\r\n\r\nincrease the confidence of new members of staff to deliver outstanding lesson in their first and second target languages, and equip them with the skills to offer support with department and beyond. The skills acquired will support our aim to work more closely with other departments cross curricular projects\r\n\r\nfurther improve the Spanish of our new Head of Department. allowing him to deliver high-quality teaching across Key stages and offer professional development to colleagues. He will be a source of support and reference for other teachers and will take a lead in developing new materials. He will develop a CPD sessions for the rest of our department which will lead to a more confident staff in general.\r\n\r\nWe want to continue to show our boys that language learning is important and relevant to them now and in their future lives and careers.

We feel that the way forward is to integrate communication and joint project work with French and Spanish schools into our everyday teaching to make language learning more relevant, interesting and motivating for pupils. This will support not only our high achievers but also reluctant learners and those students who could drop MFL during their GCSE years. We will develop our skill and confidence to deliver outstanding lessons in French and Spanish, so that all staff can teach both languages to higher levels.We will increase the European dimension within our day-to-day teaching and the life of our school, and develop even better international links to allow us to bring French and Spanish language and culture and contact with native speakers into our classrooms every day.We plan to share these benefits with colleagues within the department, those within other departments in our school, our partner primary schools and other partnership schools, and participants will develop a training programme to support this.. We plan to develop a two-year project where we would send our Spanish and French Heads of Department and another French teacher on immersion courses in France/Spain. The French specialists would go to Spain and vice versa in order to allow them to consolidate their second MFL. These are a series of two progressive courses, the second building on the first.Participation in these courses will lead to a great improvement in participants\u2019 Spanish/French language skills and understanding of contemporary French and Spanish culture.This improvement in language skills will mean that participants have greater flexibility about which classes they can teach and are able to perform their jobs to a much higher standard.Other outcomes for staff will include increased motivation, enjoyment of their work and ability to perform their jobs better, improved professional profile and better future career prospects.Through developing these links, we want to create a strong basis for future partnership work and further international activities.  The improved management competencies of participants will also contribute to increasing our capacity for future international projects.Our pupils will be more motivated. They will enjoy their learning more and will find it more relevant to themselves and their interests. There will be a particular impact on reluctant learners and pupils with low basic skills as we will focus on finding ways to support them in their learning and suitable resources. This will improve their general attainment and contribute towards our whole school objective of increasing uptake in our sixth form.We will ensure that the impact of our project is sustainable and that we produce outputs that can be used and adapted by others for years to come, leading to potential for much greater impact.", "http://www.sfx.liverpool.sch.uk", "St. Francis Xaviers College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023329_coordinator"]]}}, "7TN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "INTEGRATED LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AT ST JULIE'S", "St Julie's Catholic High School", 5195.0, 1, 1, "Our school needs to develop more Spanish teachers from our existing linguists in the MFL department and refresh and strengthen the existing language skills of our staff in order to improve access to languages for pupils.

Other priorities are developing cultural understanding, improving literacy across the curriculum,  language teaching methodology and engagement.\r\n\r\nWe want to develop our strong link with a French and Spanish school with a view to developing an exchange programme.  This would improve our profile as a department especially in sixth form- it would encourage more students to continue their studies beyond A\u2019 level. We also need to improve our Year 7 transition and engage more with the primary curriculum. \r\n\r\nWe plan a project that will last two years and will bring us towards achieving our aims as set out above. This project will involve four mobility activities, 3 to Spain and 1 to France.\r\n\r\nThe participants in these activities will take part in training courses which will include, intensive language learning, cultural immersion, teaching methodology and activities, a placement in a Spanish/French school to observe best practice and develop a link, and opportunities for professional discussions.\r\n\r\nThe project will lead to us having a better skilled staff with increased capacity to teach different languages, better teaching, more enjoyable lessons, better use of different teaching methods and more integration of literacy across the curriculum. There will be increased intercultural understanding within staff and pupils, better support of children with lower ability, more uptake of languages and links developed with Spanish and French schools (eventually leading to exchange visits).
