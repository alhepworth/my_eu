The main theme chosen for this project is to \u201cdeal with customers\u2019 and clients\u2019 greeting procedures\u201d. The targeted public is students in Bac Pro in sales professions (Retail studies, Reception, Sales and trade). We want to give them an International experience on their CV, which will be a great asset for their professional future and recruitmentThe Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon, the GIPAL, 15 French vocational high schools and 80 receiving partners in Europe are involved in that project. Motivation and involvement of all them show their willingness to work in team and share skills and practices. It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus and a new dynamism in the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Reiterating this initiative, we confirm our commitment to International Mobility of young people and staff with the support of Erasmus ProgramThis innovative consortium reflects the variety of our Acad\u00e9mie with a representative panel of 15 schools in the field of \"sales professions\". Supported by the Rectorat, this project aims at enriching the professional skills of the staff and the students. It also aims at strengthening the European dimension of this Baccalaur\u00e9at which needs to improve its image and which has developed very few mobilities so far. This internship abroad will give an international dimension to the participants\u2019 CV, a genuine added value when they look for a job in the near future. Within two years more than a 340 students aged 17-19 will work in 12 European countries. These students will be selected on their motivation to invest themselves in their formation. They will receive a linguistic and cultural preparation, which will be evaluated by CERL test on OLSThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their EU recommendations. All of them are eager to discover new cultural and professional horizons. We have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving company lists, this is a real asset because it will create an efficient partnership network and give a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the local and European scenesThe content of the working program has been agreed on by all the partners and they are committed to respect the stages of the project: selection and common preparation of the participants, mobility and internship and finally evaluation and sharing of the impacts and results. These stages will imply a vast panel of people: staff, high schools, companies, academic authorities, families, associations, consulates, language assistants in France but also abroad. Each of these step is essential so that the impact felt by all of actors is in line with initial objectivesThe role of each partner is perfectly clear. The GIPAL carries the project. The Acad\u00e9mie manages the project with the members of the consortium. The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants. All French and European partners have an experience in placements since most of them have already used Mobility programs. So, each one knows one\u2019s mission and it will done seriouslyThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous. The partners will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices and give a new image to vocational schools. The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and knowledge and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills of the teachers. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2018-2020. These impacts are tangible and easily measurableTo conclude, all the partners will be asked to transmit and promote the Eramus program in addition to proceed at the global evaluation of this program.

ROC WB has about 25 000 students and 2500 staff members.\r\nIn the past 10 years ROC WB has focussed on Internationalization of the curricula, encouraging students, teachers and trainers with new approaches in teaching and learning. In this project ROCWB further implements the European instruments for lifelong learning, makes further use of the transparency instruments EQF, ECVET and Europass to improve the quality of (international) mobility and to stimulate and facilitate lifelong learning of individuals. \r\n\r\nROC WB has built up a sustainable network of international partners which offers options for both work placements and further study.  Together with these partners ROCWB implements the European instruments for lifelong learning in order to create transparancy.

Working together in a consortium for the second year,all three schools want ,with the 'ALLIER MOBILITY PLUS'project,to improve students' employability chances through work placements in European companies and to enhance the European dimension of their schools by receiving young people from European partner schools for work placements in French companies and by staff training in European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur schools are located in a region ( Allier) where employment is limited and (high youth unemployment rate). Our students,because of the location of our region  are seldom in contact with other European young people. Besides,as they lack information and self-confidence,they are not likely to leave our area even if they can't find a job here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe positive impact former projects have had on the students in terms of linguistic benefits,professional skills and above all personal skills ( self- esteem,adaptability,independence,self-confidence)but also the interest and desire to work abroad born from the communication on past  work experiences abroad and the dissemination  of the results of these experiences lead us to consider enlarging the training and work placements funded by the Erasmus + programme to all our students whatever their level of qualification.Considering the fact that past mobilities limited the possibility to go on work placements abroad to students preparing for an industrial NVQ level 3 certificate and even for one school to the sole Euro -Electrotechnics CLIL class,we come to think that enlarging the possibility to all our classes requires 81 training grants (about 13 per year per school). This enlargement would give the possibility to maximize the training of all the students whatever their academic results ( this is not a selection criterion) and to boys and girls alike without discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development  of the European dimension involves receiving students from our partners and sending 26 of our teachers on professional training periods abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students ( sent and received) will be placed in companies in strict compliance with the training framework as work placements are an integral part of the training ,are assessed and taken into account for the Diploma.The work placements will be adapted to the students' skills ,in particular their language skills. They will be carefully selected in order to avoid the risk of a failed mobility but make the experience  a complete success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers selected for a mobility will be received by our partner schools abroad  for observing activities,mostly but not only as the final objective is the enrichment of their practice ,other activities can be considered (team teaching).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each school  mobilities will be managed by the steering committee and the teachers concerned by the mobility in close and regular  relationship with the inter-schools steering committee. The steering committees will see to the regular assessment of the project within their school as well as within the consortium and with their European intermediary or host  partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the project will be made before,after and during the mobility abroad.\r\n\r\nWe expect this project will allow us to send all the motivated and selected students and teachers on training and work placements abroad, that they will improve their language skills,acquire new skills which  for students will result in   better  results at their examination  and in the long run better employability. We expect  students will gain confidence and awareness that it is possible and necessary to  be mobile to find a job and that mobility can be a driving force for ambition.\r\n\r\nConcerning staff mobility we expect the dissemination of their experience and new  pratices acquired or observed.\r\n\r\nReceiving young Europeans will allow the students who haven't been on work placement abroad to benefit from the exchange.\r\n\r\nAs far as our schools are concerned we hope to increase the number of students who want to attend the CLIL class and /or apply for a mobility.\r\n\r\nIn the long term ,we expect our schools will gain in reputation so that it will be students' choice to enroll in our school and not the result of a lack of possibilities.

MAIN GOAL:The main objective would be to improve our teaching practice focusing on two issues:1. The use of ICT in the teaching-learning process, including  iPads or similar devices.2. Cooperative Learning.Guilford School has iPads as an everyday  tool in the classroom. Thanks to this advanced device, students access at all times to lots of educational contents, they can search different resources on the Internet, using tools that enhance their knowledge and creativity. The access to these tools allows students to prepare class assignments, analyze and solve problems more easily, being in charge of their own learning process. The use of these devices offers and individualization of the teaching-learning process.METHODOLOGY used to carry out the project:We believe that we must look at other educational experiences for a later implementation in our own school. This will allow us:- to promote the development of digital competence, with particular emphasis on the competence of learning to learn.- to observe how different European centers work with cooperative methodology and how do they integrate ICT tools in a cooperative way in order to take into account the diversity found in our classrooms.- to implement  inclusive dynamics through ICT .RESULTS, IMPACT and long-term benefits:The education and the observation that members of our staff will receive thanks to this project will allow us to continue implementing cooperative learning and teaching with iPads in our center. We will be able to carry out the implementation of innovative methodologies that will integrate personalized learning, and a better attention to our students.Using these tools through an interdisciplinary approach and the use and creation of digital learning resources, will develop the linguistic competence in communication, social sciences, mathematics, etc. of our pupils.The relationship that may come along as a result of this project would also enable future projects and activities.Finally, our students would be the maximum beneficiaries of this program as last innovation methodology receivers.", "http://www.htpd@holytrinity.surrey.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024289_1"]]}}, "4LZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1472688000000, 1535673600000, "Common Framework for a European Life Cycle based Asset Management Approach for transport infrastructure networks", "Highways England Company Ltd", "Achieving a well integrated, optimal performing transport infrastructure network in Europe is a key element in the White Paper on Transport\u2019s overall ambition for a single European Transport Area in 2050.
