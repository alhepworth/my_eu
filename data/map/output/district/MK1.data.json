Especially when it comes to real world applications. As a matter of fact where teaching coursework exists, it fails to successfully stimulate the individual to link the theoretical approach to real life scenarios.\r\n\r\nWith the upcoming Europe 2020 targets, the partners believe that a shift is required from text to deeds. It is crucial to target the young adult market since otherwise many school leavers will  never have the opportunity to orient themselves in a Europe (and ultimately a world) where the word sustainable is becoming increasingly common without however the skills and actions to back it up sufficiently.\r\n\r\nYETI requires a mix of technical experts in the field of environment and energy, with a mix from the academic and the manufacturing scenarios to incorporate the best of both worlds into the final project deliverable. Moreover for the project to be successful institutions that are proficient in pedagogical field need to be on board for further enhancement and delivery of the coursework being developed. Finally YETI takes a totally unique and different approach to any other project in the sense that it goes a step further by recruiting a municipality amongst its partners to ensure the practicality and real world applications of the material being developed. Moreover, the municipality also ensures maximal target reach of youths in their regional area. All partners have been carefully selected in order to fall into one or ideally more of the above categories. The partner selection gives a perfectly balanced mix to the equation in order to achieve an international panel of skilled experts across the required board. Such a strategic choice is also the key behind our confidence and commitment that the project has the right ingredients to be successful on all proposed grounds. \r\n\r\nThe partnership aims to be clearly and logically structured with Partners divided into 3  specific sub groups being: Technical experts, Teaching institutions and Municipalities. Thus the role of the partner is carefully orchestrated from the very beginning and is not a matter of random allocation, but a matter of categorizing available strengths and resources and making use of the latter accordingly.\r\n\r\nMoreover the project is well structured in Phases (1-4)  as follows: \r\nPhase 1 - Good Practice gathering exercise \r\nPhase 2 - Course work development phase\r\nPhase 3 - Practical testing phase\r\nPhase 4 - Dissemination phase\r\n\r\nThe project aims to deliver various concrete results including ready to use course work targeted to the youth population in Europe. YETI works with youths in piloting the training course and will tailor make the content based on feedback received from all the youths involved in the project. \r\n\r\nA clear ideology, structured and modular project phases and a balanced partner mix are the winning ingredients that aim to make YETI a recipe for success.", "http://www.juvenilejusticeinternational.org", null, "erasmus_2015-2-MT01-KA205-003762_2"], [2017, "Empowering who sees less; through intercultural exchange and new communication technologies", "VICTA Children", 28884.0, 9, 9, "Empowering who sees less; through intercultural exchange & new communication technologies is a youth exchange set up by a group of young volunteers (ICC Belgium) part of the association KVG. You can find us in Leuven, Belgium from the 23rd of July to the 1 of August 2017.

Increase their autonomy\r\n3. Increase and facilitate their integration\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives the young VIP\u2019s will prepare workshops or outdoor activities like: learn to use applications to get around in the city, use social media, learn how to speak in front of the public when you see very little or nothing at all, discover different adapted sports etc. We let the young people prepare all the activities so they will choose the methodology: brainstorming, debates and workshops will be mostly used, but learning from each other too. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the youth exchange the young VIP\u2019s will have created a blog where they can share their experiences and what they have learned. They will also make a podcasts and a radio programme to show the atmosphere of the event and to collect participants\u2019 experiences. A newspaper of the youth exchange will allow their friends and many other people to see what they have achieved and learned.

They will dare more to learn from their peers who dare already. The acquired knowledge will be used in their daily life and studies, making them active European citizens.

Almost all new entrants to Europe\u2019s market are microbreweries producing speciality beers, and globally craft brewing is growing at 79% a year.\nYet, whilst brewing is diversifying, the production of malt from barley remains an industrial, centralised process. As a result, craft brewers cannot access the local, speciality malts they need; and arable farmers get the lowest value for their crops and have to transport their grains vast distances to industrial maltings.\nTo overcome economic difficulty, Europe\u2019s farmers need innovative solutions to help them diversify, collaborate and grow.\nCustom Laboratory Products has identified a significant market potential for a craft malt system that is cost effective for on-farm use. CAPTIVATE harnesses our 30 years\u2019 experience to recreate \u2013 at small scale - the reliable, quality production of industrial maltings with high control suitable for non-specialists to operate effectively.\nIts scale is ideal for on-farm use empowering farmers to add significant value to their crop, counter the effects of increasing concentration at the processing and retailing stages of the chain, and meet demand for locally produced, high quality malt. CAPTIVATE gives arable farmers an opportunity to access the growing, global craft malt market directly. It will enable them to grow across traditional boundaries, empowering them to sell high value malt, rather than low value barley, directly to end users in the brewing, distilling and food sectors. Our project thus positions farmers as an integral part of a growing, global industry.\nThis innovation project will refine, scale up and commercialise a larger (2.5 tonne), modular and more cost effective version of our existing CAPTIVATE system to meet market demand.
