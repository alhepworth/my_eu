Also, the latest net migration statistics show that in the year ending September 2015, net migration to the UK was 323,000. Latest employment statistics from the Labor Force Survey show estimated employment of EU nationals (excluding British) living in the UK was 2.0 million in October to December 2015, 215,000 higher than the same quarter last year. Non-EU nationals in employment increased by 38,000 to 1.2 million and the total number of British nationals in employment increased by 278,000 to 28.3 million. Therefore, nearly half of the growth in employment over the last year was accounted for by foreign nationals. (These growth figures represent the NET change in the number of people in employment, not the proportion of new jobs that have been filled by non-UK workers.) There were 38,878 asylum applications (including dependants) in 2015, an increase of 20% compared with the previous year (32,344). This is the fifth successive year in which asylum applications have risen, although the number of applications is low relative to the peak in 2002 (103,081)As a solution to drop the unemployment rate and to provide better inclusion for migrants we would like to deepen the concept of apprenticeship; we believe that kicking off their career with an apprenticeship is a great way for young people to get to work. This will help them gain and develop professional skills and get experience in the work field while they earn  some money .We will organize a seminar that will help 24 youth workers from UK, Romania and Spain understand in a deeper, more meaningful way the concept of apprenticeship, share their experience, learn from good practice examples identify the challenges with regards to the topic etc. We believe that developing high quality, inclusive, apprenticeship programmes is providing young people with the right skills and experience for employment.The main objective of the project is to raise the employment rate among young people, with an accent on young people with few opportunities (migrants included).Specific objectivesO1 Support the understanding of the apprenticeship concept  and programmes in a deeper, more  meaningful way by the 24 youth workers from UK, Romania and Spain.O2 Raise awareness among employers and other social actors of the importance  of  apprenticeship as a method to increase employability.O3 Develop the necessary skills and competences to be able to bring together the unemployed young people and the local companies and develop better quality, inclusive Apprenticeship Program, by the 24 youth workers from UK, Romania and Spain.Improving the way of operating towards their target group in the 3 partner organizations: Tinevo, CREED and Building Bridges.Working methods used: open discussions, research, presentations, debates, open forum, open space, games, peer to peer education, Walt Disney Strategy, brainstorming,  SMART method, mentoring, role play, games, debates, public speaking, workshops, storytelling, open discussions, games, public cafe  etc. There will be a manual of methods used during the seminar which is going to be available online.The results and impact we expect consists in raising the quality of inclusive apprenticeship programme in Madrid, Neamt and South West England. We will achieve that by creating a database with companies opened to inclusive apprenticeships, raising awareness among young people, having professional youth workers that facilitate the process, creating a brochure that will help other stakeholders multiply the results of our EQUAL project .

In this context, special attention is paid to the social entrepreneurship model. The social economy further contributes to several key EU objectives, including the achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, high-quality employment, social cohesion, social innovation, local and regional development and environmental protection.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combatting unemployment ( European Parliament Resolution of 30 July 2015 (2014/*2236 ).\r\n\r\nAccording to the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan we need to reignite the culture of entrepreneurship in Europe and nurture the new generation of entrepreneurs and prepare them to be responsible and enterprising individuals. Investing in entrepreneurship education is one of the highest return investments Europe can make.

According to Migration Observatory, migration to the UK has increased significantly in last two decades. The countries that has been increased the number of the people that moved to UK in the \r\nlast 2 years are people from Poland (203000) and Romania (136000).

Unemployment is still high especially around young people and there are concerns \r\nregarding the young migrants. According to the Parliament, youth unemployment statistics in UK mention 573,000 young people  aged 16-24 were unemployed in September-November 2016.

What policies would apply to the EU Citizens after leaving from EU? It is hard to say and to find answer to a lot of questions that migrants are having in their minds.
