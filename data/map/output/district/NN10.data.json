The condition can challenge traditional parenting styles and cause parents to feel deskilled and disempowered.  The presence of autism within the family can negatively affect the educational achievement, employment opportunities and social inclusion of mothers, fathers, siblings and the individuals with autism themselves.\r\nTeaching parents to understand the condition, and to work effectively with schools and other professionals, has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for individuals with autism and their families. However, though such parent education programmes have been developed in e.g. Western Europe and the USA, there is little or no availability of such programmes or materials in many areas within Europe, for example in the Balkan/Eastern Mediterranean region.  \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn order to address this inequity, a strategic partnership has been developed involving universities, non-governmental organisations and the parents of children  with autism to:\r\n-develop an evidence-based model for delivering parent education in autism that can be used across Europe\r\n- develop a core curriculum and ecologically valid parent education training materials\r\n- use these materials to provide parent education to families living with autism in areas where it has been previously unavailable\r\n- evaluate the effectiveness of the materials and the impact of the training using quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis\r\n- share the model curriculum, tools and materials with stakeholders and make recommendations to policy- and decision-makers.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS\r\nThere are nine partners in the strategic partnership. These are:\r\n- the University of Northampton (United Kingdom)\r\n- the University of Zagreb (Croatia)\r\n- the European University (Cyprus)\r\n- Target Autism Training and Consultancy (United Kingdom)\r\n- Centar za Autizam (Croatia)\r\n- The Centre of Development and Support for Children and Teenagers - Autism  Assessment Support Practice (Cyprus)\r\n- Macedonian Scientific Society for Autism (Republic of Macedonia)\r\n- Autism Concern (United Kingdom)\r\n- Autism-Europe (Belgium).\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nEighteen parent training events will be held over the lifetime of the project, six each in Croatia, Cyprus and the Republic of Macedonia. Local trainers will be supported by experienced experts to develop their skills so that the training programmes can become self-sufficient and continue beyond the lifetime of the project. \r\n\r\nFour parent/professional conferences will be held  - in Croatia, Cyprus, the Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom - to share the teaching materials with and obtain feedback from wider groups of parents and professionals, as well as providing learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe partners in the project will also present at national and international conferences (e.g. Autism-Europe International Congress, 2016) as well as producing academic reports and academic articles.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe project undertaken by this Strategic Partnership will utilise a collaborative, action-based and stakeholder-empowering methodology, using mixed methods of data collection and analysis. \r\nThe project has been designed to use methods which will realise practical, real world outcomes.\r\n\r\nRESULTS EXPECTED AND LONGER-TERM BENEFITS\r\nThe final evidence-based model, curriculum and learning materials will be made available via the Erasmus+ dissemination platform, as well as via the individual partners and project website.\r\n\r\nHelping parents to understand their children with autism and to effectively manage their behaviour will have significant benefits regarding social inclusion, quality of life, educational achievement, employment and equality of opportunity. as such, this project will contribute to the development of a more equitable and socially inclusive Europe in both the short, medium and long terms.", null, "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013397_8"], [2018, "Increasing Competencies of Special Education Teachers for Teaching Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)", "Target Autism Training and Consultancy Ltd", 17264.0, 2, 2, "Project \u02ddIncreasing Competences of Special Education Teachers for Teaching Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)\" was initiated by Special School \"D-r Zlatan Sremec\" from Skopje with idea to create opportunities for professional development of our staff (special education teachers) through international cooperation.

The vision of our institution is based on encouraging our teachers to engage in lifelong learning and education, so we can strive as an institution to offer our pupils a wider and better educational opportunities.

Namely, 12 employees (teachers) spent 10 days participating in mobility at mainstream and specialized schools in Northampton where autistic students are taught. All of our expectations and learning outcomes have been achieved, to the satisfaction of all participants, and thus the CZA. \r\nEducation and training of students with autism is a complex task. Our students differ significantly from most of their peers by the way they learn and communicate, with pronounced social difficulties and often challening behaviors. Given these characteristics, teaching them requires a multidisciplinary approach, knowledge of different methods that have the role of facilitating the learning process and overcoming the obstacles that arise because of their developmental abilities, as well as the ability to evaluate each child effectively and to create an individualized program for students. The Center is composed of professionals from different profiles: special education needs teachers, art teachers, physical education teachers, music teachers,religion teachers, psychologists, social workers, sensory integration therapists, teaching assistants (educators, caregivers and medical staff). Our staff regularly participate in educational workshops and round tables as a lecturer, also as a trainee in order to increase their own competences and expertise.\r\nIn Northampton we had the opportunity to see how important the role of teaching assistants was and how much time they devote to their education. Teaching Assistants make an important part in the process of educational work with ASD students, and the main role of teaching assistants is to help and support ASD students to successfully overcome the educational challenges, together with the teacher, the teaching assistant creates an atmosphere in which children learn and develop to their full potential. The teaching assistants do not have the opportunity to have and an education outside the institution and, together with the teacher, they act as a bridge between the pupils and the curriculum, that is they contribute greatly to the children's learning of the contents provided by the plan and program. We want to provide professional development of employees at all levels to acquire better competences for working with children with ASD by accessing the modern specialized school in England. To make collaboration with schools as successful as possible, we plan to continue to work with Target Autism in England.

The host schools are a specialized Billing Brook School and Greenfields Specialist School for Communication. Mobility will take place over 4 days (two days in each school), where teaching assistants will observe the work of both teaching assistants and teachers. Their progress and learning will be monitored through the day-to-day fulfillment of systematized work diaries and work with the assigned mentor.\r\nThe mobility will take place through three phases:\r\n1. Before mobility \r\n2. During mobility \r\n3. After mobility \r\nWe expect that teaching assistants, who will participate in mobility, will increase job satisfaction and work motivation, improve their competences in applying the methods of which they have previously used and adopt new knowledge on methods they have not known so far in working with ASD students. We also expect assistants to improve their competence in teaching ASD students through the acquisition of new knowledge on the use and adaptation of different methods and techniques like (visual support, step by step and assistive technology as a means of communication) and to adopt new knowledge and skills related to the adaptation of teaching children with ASD with regard to pupils' cultural diversity. We expect this project to lead to better colaboration between teachers and teaching assistants, as new skills and competences will significantly improve the work of students and thus make the learning outcomes themselves bigger and more successful.
