The project provides pupils with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of their roles as European citizens and to a greater understanding of their democratic and environmental responsibilities. Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship is a cross curricular focus in all schools involved in this project. \r\n\r\nThe project serves three different levels: International, national and local. \r\n\r\nInternational: Understanding how the political agenda and process in the EU institutions affects the european, national and local environment. \r\nNational: Learn about the political environmental agenda in each of the participating countries, and the potentials of using the environment in a sustainable matter. \r\nLocal: Focus on what individuals can do in their local community to act in an environmental responsible manner.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project will be, that each school involved in the project, develops an environmental strategy for the school. \r\n\r\nThe knowledge the students gain throughout this project is used for evolving the environmental strategy at their own school.\r\n\r\nThis strategy will be shared with the local community by students in many different ways. They will for example host presentations at school, do a campaign in the surrounding area and deliver the strategy to the local politicians at the city council. Getting the local media involved during mobilities and when the strategy is done will also be a part of the project. \r\n\r\nAs teachers our focus will be on Project-based Learning which is a student-centred and meaning-oriented pedagogical method which will ensure that democratic practice are carried out throughout our project.", "http://www.bropedr.ceredigion.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA201-000690_3"]]}}, "7ED": {"esif": {"data": [[1446336000000, 1540944000000, "Growing Workforces Through Learning and Development (GWLAD)", "University of Wales Trinity Saint David", "Providing business with practical, flexible and achievable on-going staff development through specific courses at intermediate and higher skills levels to meet the needs of employers.", "ESF", 2037909.0, 3136745.0, "esf_wales_80911"]]}}, "7ND": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Natura 2000 Rivers  - Safeguarding Natura 2000 Rivers in the UK", "English Nature", 1819483.0, 909741.0, "The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.

Therefore we need to think \"Out of the Box\", tackling the concepts of personal identity and issues such as stereotypes and prejudices, being aware of a complex dynamic between two different cultures that can not be miscalculated in a simple problem.\r\n Integration is a manner of equilibrium between the recognition of identities,that is defined trough dialogue and acceptance of diversity that brings consequently to a pleasant cohabitation. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will gather 40 participants, balanced in the number of females and males, between 14 and 17 years old and 10 leaders from five different countries: Spain, Malta, Wales, Poland and Italy. Countries that have different policy in terms of integration and immigration also because of their geographical location in Europe and in these modern migration flows. \r\nIn the majority of the cases immigrants consider Italy, Malta and Spain as their first stop in Europe and their final destination are usually nations such as United Kingdom; in the other side Poland is considered as country of migrants. \r\n\r\nTherefore participants will have different thoughts about the issue of immigration as well as different opinions when speaking about integration.\r\n \r\nThe exchange's activities are divided into several parts facing different topics like: identity, different cultures, stereotypes and prejudices, the reason of migration, constructive dialoge. \r\nSingular parts that will be linked in the final days of the projects because they are necessary in order to analyse the concept of cultural integration The exchange will face all those topics using different methodology and tools like: workshops, brainstorming, role games, cooperation games  and non formal education activities, methods and tools that are considered by the leader appropriate in order to reach the aims of the projects. \r\n\r\nDuring the phase of debriefing and evaluation of the project's activities, the impact we expect to have is to make the participants more aware on the issue of immigration and more specifically in the issue of integration and social inclusion. \r\nWe also expect that the youngsters will develop a critical thinking regarding multiculturalism and integration less conditioned by thirds and we aim at the fact that they will be more interested to learn from those people that are still being considered different because of their culture, language and color of the skin. \r\nMoreover the participants will improve their skills of working in team as well as they'll recognize the crucial importance of the English language and generally speaking of foreign languages. \r\nAs conclusion we focus to make the participants improve both their relation and confrontational skills and assume an active role as citizen in their local community and school in order to promote multicultural dialogue within the organization they belong to at a local an regional level. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits for participants will be their permanent change of behavior in accepting immigrants in their daily life, understanding and sharing their habits and needs an they will become active citizens in promoting intercultural dialogue. \r\nThe organizations themselves will apply to create education paths about intercultural issues and will set up projects in a large scale supporting other organizations to exploit the project results building new Erasmus+ projects.", "http://www.ceredigion.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT03-KA105-013231_3"], [2015, "Healthy lifestyles and Sport", "Ceredigion County Council Youth Service", 18887.0, 5, 5, "40 young people, aged 16-18 will participate in a 'Sport and Healthy Lifestyles' Youth Exchange in Llangrannog, West Wales this summer.

They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure.

Education from a very early age must be a flexible tool and an on going process to nurture, develop and support strengths, talents and skills, while at the same time being a system  where individuals can satisfy their natural curiosity and hunger for learning and explore themselves further. Gardner's multiple intelligences provides us with the theoretical background and framework in order to plan, design and implement a holistic approach to delivering a broad balanced curriculum. The objectives of our B.L.O.S.S.O.M. project addresses the EU education target of early school leavers, creating high quality learning opportunities and strengthening quality through mobility and cross - border cooperation. The activities are very carefully selected according to the S.M.A.R.T. criteria to address each individual's potential and instill a thirst for life long learning. They are grouped under Gardner's 8 multiple intelligences making sure that throughout the 36 month period pupils will have the opportunity to immerse deeply into each one of them equally, thus allowing the development of the whole individual and the  stimulation of both sides of the brain (creative and logical) simultaneously.  Tasks include writing workshops, \"readathons\", illustrating, interviews, debates, storytelling, visit to the local library and printing press, conducting of scientific experiments, using the four rules in mathematics creatively, organizing a science fair, working with scientists, collecting data, playing outdoor games, creating music, international choir, planting and gardening, visit to botanical gardens, recycling, humanitarian work,  managing finance, working with emotions and feelings, visit to the Art Museum, art workshops, living outdoors during  an international camp,  movie making, use of digital competences and self evaluation activities, and communicating through the e twinning platform. These tasks  are designed in order to facilitate differentiated learning, working individually, in groups, cross culturally with access to different stakeholders, with planned visits to motivate and nurture an eagerness to develop further learning. The participant organisations cover a wide geographical area which is an add-on value in terms of cultural diversity and representation within Europe. The group consists of 7 schools and 6 different countries and is a mixture of small rural and large urban units from socioeconomic deprived areas facing new challenges with unemployment and immigration. The estimated number of people who will directly and indirectly benefit from this partnerships will be in the thousands.  We have a very clear structured achievable timetable of tasks to be carried out. Each term of this three year period will be dedicated to a different kind of intelligence (according to Gardner's categorization). The specific intelligence chosen will be thoroughly explored and pupils will work on several different activities which promote it and at the same time integrate all the other intelligences so as to achieve a holistic approach of the multiple intelligences theory. This well organized educational process  will lead our schools to tangible and intangible results. Our tangible results include an international book of short stories, an international musical cd, an international Erasmus+ banner, scrapbooks, power point presentations, e book with science experiments,  a dvd of outdoor games, a library of mood music, performances and concerts, an international  theatrical play, a movie about nature, bazaars and charity events, garden produce and reflective journals. During this period  of project work, all stakeholders will increase their cultural awareness and become partakers of an extended, borderless educational community which interacts cross culturally. People are empowered by other people and we become our best selves through unselfish interaction with others. In this framework, all participants  will have the opportunity to get involved in high quality life long learning since the aim is to guide all members smoothly and effectively to learning autonomy for life. Transnational cooperation will help our schools to establish their very important role in the process of the development of the whole area, their region and their country.

Our plan follows three basic directions: a)Learning of how to use  digital computer technology in everyday teaching and learning and through all the subjects taught at school, b) Learning of how to manage and coordinate  European programs, c) Opening up our school to Europe through collaborative European projects  with other schools abroad. We realised that even if our school  has  quite good technological facilities, our teachers seem a bit hesitant to use them everyday in class.  They also find that applying  for European programs is quite compex and demanding - a feeling that becomes more intense because of the lack of contacts with other colleagues and schools in Europe. We  find it necessary to address all these problems by choosing  a combination of seminars, job shadowing and follow up activities for our teachers to attend in order to achieve our goals.\r\nIn this framework, 5 teachers were chosen to be sent for the mobilities. All of them have a good command of English, they have good computer skills, they are interested in conducting projects in their classes and are very eager to improve their skills and knowledge on the sectors mentioned before. They are also very communicative people with intrinsic motive and a genuine care for the improvement of our school unit and the education it provides. Moreover, they are  an interesting combination of teachers and specialty teachers in order for us to achieve cooperation and integration in as many subject areas as possible. Last but not least, they all have excellent relationships with the other staff members something that will guarantee that the follow up activities will be a success. \r\nTaking all the above into consideration, 3 main activities were chosen: \r\na) Mobility of 1 teacher for job shadowing at Ysgol y Dderi in Wales. This school is an excellent organisation with huge experience in managing and coordinating European projects. It uses project based teaching and learning extensively. Moreover, it uses a big range of digital tools in its everyday classroom practice with great success. In our opinion,  this school is the best environment for us to observe in real conditions what we dream of achieving in our school environment and be given guidelines of how exactly to get there. \r\nb) Mobilities of 2 teachers and 1 physical education teacher for attending a seminar on how to use Web 2.0 digital tools in class and how to organise a digital classroom. With this seminar we aim at familiarising our teachers with information technology more and at acquiring the knowledge that is necessary to facilitate the rest of our needs. \r\n\u03b3) Mobility of our  English Language teacher for attending a seminar  on management and coordination of European projects in order for us to be able to succeed in applying for Erasmus+ collaborative projects and to expand our European contacts with colleagues and schools abroad.\r\nBefore the mobilities, our teachers will be prepared adequately in our own organisation and in cooperation with the courses provider in Spain and our partner school in Wales.\r\nAfter the mobilities and from the beginning of the new school year, follow up activities will be held within our organisation in order to transfer and propagate the knowledge acquired during the mobilities and with focus to all target groups (the rest of the school staff, students and parents). We will also proceed in starting new collaborative projects in order to practice all the things we've learned. \r\nWith the implementation of all the above we hope in the long run to become members of a school unit with up to date trained staff, which will be able to enjoy the benefits of European partnerships confidently and that will have the ability to bring changes and to promote innovations using all the latest technological advances in favour of our school community.", "http://www.ydderi.ceredigion.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EL01-KA101-013292_1"]]}}, "8RN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1398038400000, 1524182400000, "GMP Two Year Safety Testing", "Roger Alison Ltd", "G-TwYST will execute rat feeding trials with GM maize NK 603 based on OECD Test Guidelines and according to EFSA considerations.
