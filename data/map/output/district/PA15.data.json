FAB-MOVE will significantly improve the transfer of knowledge between academics and non-academics and thus increase the practical applicability of research findings.

Local eco-systems and traditions have a decisive impact on the wellbeing, growth and potentials for scaling-up of social enterprises. FAB-MOVE focuses on the embeddedness of social enterprises and its impact on their evolution. It identifies crucial success factors for a sustainable development of these new and innovative organisations in an internationally comparative perspective.\nThoroughly analysed case studies will serve as best practices by highlighting how social enterprises overcome crucial problems and manage to grow in different social areas and various regions around the world.

Within the staff, there are individuals with relevant and necessary experience and skills, however to meet the larger goal of embedding these languages across all teaching and learning at all stages, it is necessary for more staff members to develop skills and confidence in speaking French and Spanish, knowledge of the people and culture of both of these countries and techniques and methods for teaching these languages to pupils in an engaging and innovative manner.  The objectives of our project are therefore to expand and consolidate the overall competences of the staff in these areas by organising a mobility experience for five specially selected members of staff to participate in immersion courses in France and Spain, equipping these staff members with the necessary skills, knowledge and confidence to lead on the implementation of teaching and learning in French and Spanish and in the embedding of this in all aspects of school activities for all age groups in the school.  This will be achieved in part through the systematic and structured transfer of skills and knowledge between the staff members undertaking the mobility and the rest of the staff at the school upon the return of those participating in the immersion courses.  These five members of staff have been chosen in order to ensure sufficient representation of both the infant and senior stages of the school, as well as the need for members of the Senior Management Team to take part directly, gaining first hand experience.  All selected staff members already have a degree of fluency in the languages in question (in one case, the staff member has experience of teaching in Spain) or prior experience of such immersion courses in another language.  A further key aim of this project is to develop a methodology for measuring the degree of achievement of the objective to embed teaching and learning in French and Spanish.  It is expected that, through this project a certain amount of every day teaching and learning in the school will take place in French and Spanish, with activities involving both languages becoming a truly integral part of the experience of attending Whinhill.
