The lack of uniform requirements for defining, detecting and recording suicidality and the presence of disease related confounders create major problems. It is possible that Medication-Related Suicidality (MRS) differs from Psychopathology-Related Suicidality (PRS) in terms of phenomenology, clinical expression and time course, and may vary between children and adults. Unlike PRS, the time-course of MRS may be associated with possible differences in drug pharmacokinetics; abrupt onset; absence of suicidality prior to start of medication; and emergence of suicidality related co-morbidities after treatment.\nThis proposal will focus on developing a web-based comprehensive methodology for the assessment and monitoring of suicidality and its mediators in children and adolescents using the HealthTrackerTM (a paediatric web-based health outcome monitoring system), with the aim of developing a Suicidality Assessment and Monitoring Module, a Bio-psycho-social Mediators of Suicidality Assessment Module, and a Suicidality-Related Psychiatric and Physical Illness Module. The information obtained will be used to computer-generate classification of suicidality using the Classification of Suicide-Related Thoughts and Behaviour (Silverman et al, 2007) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment (C-CASA) (Posner et al, 2007). The existing Medication Characteristics Module will be expanded to allow documentation of pharmacological characteristics of medication, to explore whether they mediate MRS. The methodology will then be tested in 3 paediatric observational trials (risperidone in conduct disorder; fluoxetine in depression, and montelukast in bronchial asthma) and standardized, which can be used pharmacovigilance and in epidemiological, observational, and registration trials.", 253439.0, 3110783.0, 7, 19, "STOP", null, "http://www.healthtracker.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112455.jpg", "fp7_97369_953992479"], [1391212800000, 1548892800000, "THE MILESTONE PROJECT: Managing the Link and Strengthening Transition from Child to Adult Mental Health Care", "Healthtracker Ltd", "Transition to adulthood is the period of onset of most of the serious mental disorders that disable or kill in adult life. Current service configuration of distinct Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and Adult Mental Health (AMHS) Services is considered the weakest link where the care pathway should be most robust. Transition-related discontinuity of care is a major socioeconomic and societal challenge for the EU. The MILESTONE project is an EU-wide study determining care gaps in current services across diverse healthcare systems and robustly evaluating an innovative transitional care model.  In ten high-quality work packages we will map current services and transitional policies across EU; develop and validate transition-specific outcomes measures; conduct a longitudinal cohort study of transition process and outcomes across eight EU countries; develop and test, in a cluster-randomised trial, the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an innovative transitional care model; create clinical, organisational, policy and ethics guidelines for improving care and outcomes for transition age youth; and develop and implement training packages for clinicians across EU. The project will provide robust evidence for the most cost-effective way to meet the as-yet-unmet need of young people who fall through the CAMHS-AMHS divide; facilitate the development of integrated models of care and function; improve health care outcomes and system efficiencies; and ensure take-up of best practice. The project has active and intensive participation of young people, carers, advocacy groups and key stakeholders and involves two SMEs, Concentris and HealthTracker. Findings from the project will transform mental health care in EU for young people. Our results will assist policy makers in making informed and evidence-based decisions for improving health systems, enhancing patient outcomes, quality of life, service satisfaction, and improving health status at individual and population levels.", 250460.0, 6356533.0, 8, 12, "MILESTONE", null, "http://www.healthtracker.co.uk", null, "fp7_110200_953992479"]]}}, "6PA": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "ALL THINGS STUDIO LIMITED", 52335.0, "European Social Fund \u2014 Operational technical assistance (04.02.63.01)", "fts_2017_55112"]]}}, "6YA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Das Gymnasium Carolinum Ansbach in Europa: \r\nGCA Abroad - Individualisation - Differentiation - Networking Across Europe", "Caterham School", 29178.0, 2, 2, "Our development plan is based on 3 fields, which are all inter-related:\r\n\r\na) methodology (especially individualisation and differentiation e.g. inclusion or special offers for the gifted and talented)\r\nb) international networking (in preparation for developing into a UNESCO-school)\r\nc) consolidating of teacher satisfaction (improvement of language abilities especially in Modern Languages), quality of teaching, motivation and staff health.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of 17 \"mobilities\".\r\n14 mobilities are assigned to training courses for teachers in methodology, Education for Sustainable Development and teacher health.\r\n3 mobilities are assigned to job-shadowing (in the UK, Greece and France).\r\n\r\nAll measures and target areas will be evaluated.\r\nEach teacher training course will be followed by an internal workshop.\r\n\r\nThe following targets should be met:\r\n- improvement of methodology and language proficiency in modern language classes\r\n- strengthening of differentiation/individualisation to better meet the needs of all different kinds of learners, to achieve the best possible inclusion, to foster the gifted and talented further; lessons will be more focused on the individual learner so that they are more motivated and feel more responsible for their own learning process;\r\n- the co-operation across subjects within the school team shall be improved (also by the following internal workshops); the quality of teaching will be improved along with teacher satisfaction;\r\n- our existing European network shall be strengthened and widened with the view to further co-operation and new projects, which will also be motivating for students and teachers;", "http://www.caterhamschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035357_1"], [2015, "Das Carolinum \"PROFILiert\" sich - eine traditionsreiche Schule auf dem Weg zu einer modernen europ\u00e4ischen Institution: Bilingualen Unterricht vorbereiten, Differenzierung/Inklusion verbessern, mod.
