In this context,the project wants to represent a piece of the mosaic of the qualitative development of excellence of the territory, i.e. of all areas affecting the spinneret of the sea,focusing on what is defined Blue Economy then. The aim is to train experts that can focus on the above-mentioned setting, creating new opportunities for innovative and sustainable growth,through new standards and best practices.It is important specifically:\r\nTo enhance skills and competencies of learners in the following sectors: tourist, commercial and nautical,in the three macro-areas of the supply-chain of the sea, to cover the needs of the professional profiles that are  required in this field and to encourage a greater extension of the Blue Economy in Sicily;Strengthen language skills; Strengthen useful knowledge for the creation of new business realities.\r\n80 beneficiaries will be split into two flows of mobility and the mobility will affect  following countries:France,United Kingdom, Belgium and Malta,where indeed it will be possible to also improve their language skills, taking advantage of mobility in order  to learn two of the most spoken languages in the world:english and french. \r\nThe project,which last for 24 months and it will be oriented to new graduates of Technical and Vocational Sicilian Institutes,who will have  achieved their high school degree  in the following addresses: Tourist, Hospitality and Tourism,Transportation and Logistic Commercial.The selection will take place with the support of an examination board who will evaluate the profiles of the individual at first according to what concerns both the linguistic skills and motivation.

The project originated, in fact,from the desire to increase the opportunities for professional growth of learners through a working experience that can allow them to be in touch with the different social-cultural realities  but also with a concept of both living and working  in a different way.The intent is to let them get both a know-how and some good practices  to be internalized  and brought back when returnng in Italy,in order to use them then for their own professional future and for a greater development of the territory.\r\nThe project will have an impact not only on the current education of beneficiaries but also on the proponent and on members of the Consortium that will give life to new contacts with local and foreign companies and they will  both extend their network of schools and stimulate the staff to subscribe to European platforms in order to communicate with colleagues to share good practices and to increase the  visibility through the Erasmus mobility.\r\nIn a short term period  the project aims to generate,at least for the 70% of learners,the possibility to continue the work that  began   with the internship abroad and it wants to reserve a fast track because of searching  of employment for  beneficiaries,succeeding to ensure then some  proposals for further placements when returning from mobility abroad.\r\nIn addition,the dissemination step will alert not only the entire school community,but also families, institutions, agencies,local businesses and stakeholders,bringing the results in terms of learning outcomes and good practices in the tables of comparison and to the attention of professionals related to the world of education and vocational training, in order to match  more training courses with the labor market.", "http://www.idea-m.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA102-006280_6"], [2017, "Tarptautinis bendradarbiavimas, skirtas pagerinti ma\u017eiau galimybi\u0173 turin\u010di\u0173 ir ne\u012fgali\u0173 jaunuoli\u0173 profesin\u012f mokym\u0105", "Idea - M Ltd.", 218620.0, 8, 10, "This project is intended for RTVMC students, teachers and specialists, who works with disadvantaged youth and students with special needs.\r\nThere, in Radviliskis technology and business teaching centre, learns students with light mental disorder or complex disorder, also there learns disadvantaged youth.\r\nMany of them have learning troubles, health, behavior problems and harmful habits.

The basic tool for this change is the new and updated school educational program, which takes into consideration these requirements and also this year there is a possibility to complete vocational education by studying at FEC - Further Education College. \r\n We would like to concentrate on the multicultural differences within Europe by learning about them, and trying to understand and accept them.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the students' training the aims of our project are:\r\n-to introduce to the students the departments of the firms, and the agenda of each department\r\n-to enable students to consult with the professional workforce and with the management\r\n-to introduce to the students the work of the marketing department (marketing research, contact with clients, the preparation of catalogues and promotion materials, data processing, PR, the preparation and realization of meetings)\r\n- to introduce to the students the work of the HR department (training of the employees, types of contracts and  agreements, benefits, recruiting, job interviews, the preparation of a professional CV)\r\n-to introduce to the students the work of the economic department (budgeting, bookkeeping ,bookkeeping, reporting, statistics \r\n- to enable students and the employees to improve their communicative competence and professional vocabulary in English\r\n\r\nWe planned our mobilities as follows:\r\na/ students of the study field business academy - bilingual studies  - 10 students travel for three weeks to London, the mobility will take place either in May/June 2018.\r\nb/  students of the study field business academy  - 10 students travel for three weeks to London, their mobility will take place  in May/June 2018\r\nc/ managers (headmaster and 2 deputy headmasters - they travel for three days in different terms to Ostrava, their mobility will take place  from  October 2017 to March 2018.", "http://www.mapleestate.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK01-KA102-035258_10"]]}}, "3AQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Your Ticket for Europe", "Harrow College", 593366.0, 10, 22, "European policies allow people to move abroad more easily. This, and the fact that sometimes workers have greater possibilities of finding a job abroad, make that European Citizens today are more likely to leave their own country in order to study or work in other EU countries than before. People are often compelled to move in order to follow the changes in the labour market, as some fields of work may be better developed in another country or there may be a lack of workers in a specific sector. Therefore, workers specialized in those areas are more likely to be successful abroad.\r\n\r\nDriven by this necessity a person undergoing education or training should be aware of the situation and the opportunities of the European labour market. Teachers need to be able to transmit this new European dimension. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of the Consortium 'Your ticket for Europe' aims to facilitate mobility for learners, teachers and staff in VET in  order to give them an international experience of high quality.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that students involved in mobility  are provided with all the tools they need in order to explore their chances of finding a job abroad. Awareness of the situation in the EU Labour market is the first necessary step to raise students'  awareness of their professional chances around Europe partly due to the elimination of international boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers and staff should also be involved in mobility in order to exchange experiences and good practices with other teachers and to improve their skills and curricula.

This information is provided through formal channels (such as flyers, brochures, conferences...) but also by using multipliers. Teachers, trainers, students and young workers who have already participated in mobility projects inspire, motivate and encourage other people to become mobile.\r\n\r\nSeminars are organised in order to bring multipliers and possible participants into contact with each other. Multipliers will give their testimonials and mobility experts will help the participants with the required paperwork.\r\n\r\nWe ensure the quality of the mobility by establishing continuous dialogue and clear arrangements between the sending and the hosting institutions and by using learning agreements for the recognition of knowledge, skills and competences acquired (ECVET). In one particular case we want to organise training for assessors in the work field in Ireland and Spain in cooperation with Calibris (Dutch knowledge centre) so that we can ensure that in the future exams will take place according to Dutch regulations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, personal assistance will be given to mobility participants by providing convenient and affordable facilities.

Information Meeting, signing contracts, linguistic, cultural and professional preparation, OLS registration for students.\r\nE3- Implementation of mobilities. Follow-up, evaluation and certification of participants. Competences will be determined in the Learning Agreement and will be evaluated, using the ECVET instruments and will be certifies by Europass. \r\nE4- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the overall project\u2019s results.\r\nE5- Dissemination. The dissemination activities will be carried out throughout the project\u2019s duration. An extraordinary staff meeting will be held in all the consortium centres. A Final Conference will be also organized.\r\nIn addition to the impact on the participants, the project will also benefit all the partners, by fostering  European cooperation and the relationships between companies and educational centres. \r\nBoth dissemination activities and the mobility experience itself will produce an impact at local, regional and national level. \r\nOther local, regional and national entities will be able to to benefit from the project\u2019s results (even though they are not partners of the project):\r\n- Creation of a quality network that include educational centres and companies\r\n- Decrease in youth unemployment rate\r\n- Improvement of youth qualifications\r\n- Increase in VET enrolment \r\n- Creation of new collaborative networks at regional level\r\n- Widening the possibility of internationalization for other centres, and their chance to be part to other European projects\r\n- Better knowledge of the Erasmus+ programme and EU values (tolerance, equity, equality and inclusion).\r\n- Fostering the sense of European active citizenship and respect of other cultures\r\n- Possibility to create new companies and new business models \r\n- Promotion of social inclusion\r\nThe project is in accordance with the Strategy 2020, the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016 and the Erasmus+ objectives, improving the professional development of the students, their participation as active citizens in society and and their employability inside and outside the European Labour market", "http://www.redochre.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037021_9"], [2016, "Language Gateways", "Red Ochre Enterprises Ltd", 77672.0, 2, 6, "Language Gateways (LG) will provide mobilities for VET Learners in the vocational field of Teaching English, with a focus on teaching English to refugee, migrant and disadvantaged communities.  Learners will be placed in 60 day placements, hosted in six language academies in Seville in Andalusia, Spain. Our project will last one year.Language Gateways will support participants in developing their skills and experience so they can access  jobs and contribute to an equal society after the placement. We will have 21 participants leaving for Seville in three groups of seven. Participants will likely be:- Any age over 18- Based across the UK- Unemployed or in training who want to go into the vocation of teaching English.- Be motivated to use English to help integration in the EU, migrants, refugees and social cohesion.The objectives of LG are to:-Provide high quality vocational training placements to English teacher trainees and recent (within 1 year of graduating) qualified individuals-For participants to leave LG better able to secure employment in language work whilst improving their ability to work internationally and with different groups in the UK-Contribute to addressing the needs of all learners and also of refugee and immigrant communities across the EU-Use language training and dissemination of results to increase skills, cultural interaction and multilinguism in the EU.These 60 day placements are based on discussions amongst all our partners and our recent experience of what time frame allows learners to improve their skills, develop personally and achieve their objectives.In the UK and EU, the need for teachers with high quality, internationally recognised English language teaching qualifications has never been greater. 7.7 percent of the population do not speak English as a first language with 4.2 million people reporting another main language (Language in England and Wales,ONS,2015). Recent Census figures showed that across England 1.7% of the population (900,000 people) have either no, or poor spoken English (Bringing people together...DCLG, 2014). These people face significant barriers in participating fully in local, national and European life. Secondly, according to UNHCR, 1 million refugees arrived in Europe in 2015 alone, four times as many in 2014, with trends continuing in 2016. Learning English and other EU languages is an essential component of the EU's strategy on social cohesion (Social Cohesion in Member States, EU, 2014) and we need language teachers who are motivated to contribute to this issue. Furthermore, the EU has set the goal that every citizen should have the opportunity to acquire at least two foreign languages, from an early age. This project addresses that goal directly. The need for innovative ways to reach and teach all learners but also isolated people and new arrivals means the placement will also provide training for participants to experience a variety of ways of practicing their vocation that they could not get in the UK.  English academies in Andalusia are world class and have particular approaches for LG participants to bring back to the UK.We will recruit \"for attitude\" as well as experience, qualifications and skills and aim for a positive group in each flow who can inspire peer to peer learning.After recruitment has occurred, Language Gateways takes place over three main stages:1) Preparation - professional, linguistic and cultural2) VET Placement - orientation, initial shadowing of staff, work placement 3) Aftercare - development in placement and development of work related skills.Prior to their departure to Spain, participants will benefit from a range of training, information and and systems that aim to help them maximise the outcomes of the placement. Preparation training in London will equip them personally and professionally.Placements will enable participants to gain vocational and professional skills, broaden their knowledge of the sector and develop enhanced intercultural awareness, which, along with improved teaching and personal skills, will support them in accessing  employment opportunities in the UK and EU. We will provide them with post placement support  to help access employment, career progression or further training opportunities, on their return.Sustainability is very important to LG. One of the key ways in which we can have a national impact is firstly through dissemination of results. And secondly through sharing the learning of the teachers. We will work with them during the three flows to create a final toolkit which will share their learning so that it can be passed on to other trainee teachers at the UK consortium members schools but also to other schools and colleges throughout the UK. This toolkit will be an open educational resource.Placements start in October when the first group of 9 participants travel to Spain.

Learners will be placed in two-month long mobilities, hosted in three language academies in Seville in Andalucia, Spain. Our project will last one year with each mobility period lasting for 60 days. \r\nTiP will support a total of 21 participants.  Placement periods will be for two months from October 2015 when the first group of 7 participants will travel to Spain and January 2016, when the second group of 7 will have their placements. Finally in March 2016 the last group of 7 will start their placements.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n\u2022\tProvide high quality vocational training placements to TESOL Learners and recent (within 1 year) qualified individuals.\r\n\u2022\tEnable participants to leave TESOL in Practice better able to secure employment as a language teacher and be better teachers, more able to work internationally and with different groups in the UK when they do.\r\n\u2022\tContribute to addressing the needs of immigrant communities in the UK and those who do not have good English.\r\n\u2022\tUse language training to increase skills, cultural interaction and multilingualism in the EU.\r\nPromote language learning and linguistic diversity through the programme and in disseminating results.\r\nIn the UK, the need for teachers with high quality, internationally-recognised English language teaching qualifications has never been greater.  7.7% of the population do not speak English as a first language, with 4.2 million people reporting another main language (Language in England and Wales, 2011, ONS, March 2013). Recent Census figures showed that across England 1.7% of the population (900,000 people) has either no, or poor, spoken English (Bringing people together in strong, united communities, Department for Communities and Local Government, 2013) with the percentage of people who can not speak English well or not at all the highest in Newham in London (8.7%). These people face significant barriers in participating fully in local, national and European life. There is also a need for high quality, trained teachers who can think creatively in order to work as teachers in a TESOL class or company, but also with the ability to innovate and be entrepreneurial in how they teach, where and when. The EU has set the goal that every citizen should have the opportunity to acquire at least two foreign languages, from an early age. This project addresses that need in the Learners themselves as well as those they will teach in Seville and the UK afterwards.\r\n The project will also address the needs of the participants. For most TESOL trainees \u2018real world\u2019 experience is often isolated to \u2018on the job\u2019 progression. Our project would provide two months where participants can use their training and build their skills in teaching English to a variety of Spanish and migrant communities in Seville. The need for innovative ways to reach and teach isolated people means the placement can also provide training for participants to practice and experience a variety of ways of practising their vocation that they could not get in the UK, as Andalusian English academies have developed innovative ways of teaching not available in the UK.  This will give them the space, time and real world mentoring and training to become high quality teachers able to work in a variety of settings.\r\nPlacements will enable participants to gain vocational and professional skills, broaden their knowledge of the TESOL sector and develop enhanced intercultural awareness which, along with improved teaching and personal skills, will support them in accessing teaching English employment opportunities in the UK and other EU countries. We will provide post placement support to participants to help them access employment, career progression or further training opportunities, on their return.\r\nThe impact of the project will also be significant for the organisations involved. It will increase their capacity and impact nationally and at a European level, whilst building their credibility internationally. The final impact of TiP is on migrant communities in the UK. The project aims to improve the skills of TESOL teachers and when they return to the UK after the placement and get jobs in the field, we believe they will be better placed to help others learn English and in a small way contribute to reduced isolation across the UK.\r\nWe will disseminate our results:\r\n-Online and offline\r\n-Internally to improve the programme and provide accountability\r\n-Externally via our website, Tumblr, social media and direct to:\r\n\u2022\tPotential participants and current ones;\r\n\u2022\tIndividuals and organisations in the languages and TESOL sector as well as to wider media;\r\n\u2022\tNationally to teachers, who did not get on the programme, via a participant written Teacher Handbook.", "http://www.redochre.org.uk", "Red Ochre Enterprises Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012707_coordinator"], [2018, "Maximising Cultural Heritage: Educating and Growing", "Red Ochre Enterprises Ltd", 20174.0, 3, 3, "The purpose of Cultural Heritage - Educating, Growing and Digitising is to maximise the social, economic and educational value of European cultural heritage.

Being one of the first European schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, it has always been aiming at enabling all its students the realization of an internship in other European countries. The educational programme \u201cState-certified Commercial Assistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d had been acting as forerunner and was, thus, able to establish contacts and partnerships with business enterprises and schools in France, Great Britain, Spain, Malta and Cyprus in the past decades which every year provide placements to the applicants. This year, 41 trainees will realize an internship in the countries mentioned above as well as in Poland and Ireland. The internship lasting 8 or 11 weeks, respectively, serves as the practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge during the vocational training. It takes place in its last year when students already have acquired very good knowledge in foreign languages and MS Office. The participants of the internship project carry out commercial correspondence, translate texts into the German language, create customers\u2019 files, participate in customer acquisition, verify transport documents and carry out tasks of the front or back office in hotels. Five interns of the course of \u201cForeign Language Correspondence Clerks\u201d will realise their 3-weeks-internship in Great Britain  towards the end of their second year of traineeship. For these students there also exists a pool of partner companies which annually take new interns or help them to find a placement in order to apply and broaden their language skills. Moreover, the internships serve to gain new insights into the practical work of an enterprise. As a consequence, the participants support the employees when doing their daily work and \u2013 depending on the respective branch \u2013 carry out tasks like the re-organisation of a clients\u2019 file, the research of information about topics communicated beforehand or the assistance in an event\u2019s organisation. \r\nFurthermore, this year 10 trainees of the vocational courses \u201cIndividual Insurance\u201d, \u201cRetailers\u201d and \u201cPersonnel Service Providers\u201d will do their 3-weeks-internship in European countries, frequently in subsidiaries of their employing company, where they are offered the opportunity to work quite goal-oriented taking into account probable cultural differences. For the first time, two students of the educational programme called \u201cCommercial College\u201d are aiming at a 2-weeks-internship abroad. Within the framework of the college\u2019s strategy of internationalisation, it is planned to establish a pool of partner enterprises, too, in order to offer the possibility of taking part in the internship programme to even more students than those of the courses mentioned above. Without the financial support and the formal framework of the ERASMUS+, students of any of the college\u2019s educational programmes could hardly realise an internship abroad. All participants firstly apply in writing for a scholarship with the respective colleague in charge. \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201d has got an EU-Team which is led by a project coordinator. Two other colleagues are responsible for the financial processing and insurance matters. Additionally, in each educational programme there is a colleague who is familiar with its specific circumstances and supervises the trainees. Due to the high number of interns deriving from the \u201cAssistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d, there is a colleague responsible for English-speaking EU-countries, Spain and France each, whereas singular internships in Poland this year and the like are cared for by the project coordinator.

Moreover, language skills are intensified and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 improved. The personal maintenance of the contacts with partnership firms enabled by these mobilities, is a vital factor of the project\u2019s success and must not be underestimated. In order to take part in a personal mobility, the staff applies to the head of the college who - according to the qualification and demand \u2013 decides for the teacher to take part in the project.
