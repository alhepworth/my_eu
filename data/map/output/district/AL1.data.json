Our work has been vital in education and empowerment for these newcomers, thereby contributing to social cohesion and a sustainable society. However, the target group specifics are rather new to the involved staff in the parishes of the church. They have, to the best of their ability, faced the challenges by using traditional methods that they normally use when dealing with disadvantaged people or people at the risk of exclusion. This is not a sustainable way of handling this target group and the parish staff has therefore expressed a need of new skills and competences. equipped@StAlbans will address these issues. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the parishes in our twin diocese St Albans in the United Kingdom have a long experience of training and working with immigrants. Therefore we look to them as an important source to attain the desired new skills and competences. We count on the fact that their set of new and innovative methods, tools and approaches for training of immigrants will boost our staff in their work. Their methods when it comes to interfaith and intercultural methods in creating bridges between immigrants and the indigenous population, handling the challenges of cultural diversity, are also of great importance.  \r\n\r\nWe will select ten persons from Swedish parishes in our diocese to serve as key figures and learning multipliers to participate in the project. They will participate in job shadowing for five days, twice, and thereby learn from their peers in the British parishes. Each participant will have one particular parish designated for them, as well as a mentor in that parish. During these altogether ten days the participants will learn new methods, tools and approaches to be used in adult education for newly arrived and asylum seekers when it comes to active citizenship and intercultural understanding. Other benefits from the job shadowing will be a better understanding of how the church and its parishes can become active parts in the social economy, know-how on learning how to learn and higher proficiency of English language and culture.\r\n\r\nThe two periods of job shadowing will be framed with a thorough work with both an individual and a joint learning contract, ensuring that our objectives will be met. The progress will be monitored by the project management working in close relation to each participant, his or her local parish and the receiving diocese of St Alban.  The collected knowledge will strengthen our work with educating and empowering the newly arrived in their integration process. The project result will also affect policy work within the Church of Sweden, contribute to quality improvement of the church\u2019s work on migration and finally expand our local, regional and European networks.

Once animals move through different holdings, farms, or markets, it is very difficult to track where each animal is going without individual identification and recording. Should there be a disease outbreak the uncontrolled movement of animals could cause the further and rapid spread of disease over a large geographical area. Therefore the tracing of each individual animal is vitally important to control infectious diseases. However, compliance with the EC legislation for 100% assured tracking of livestock is difficult to deliver with the current mandated LF systems, having a reported recall of only 90% of tagged sheep in group movement situations.

Our focus is not only on European values and human rights but also on their personal values and goals (family, education, career). We want to know what really matters to the European youth. Developing key competences within the youth exchange will not only have a positive influence on their chances at the job market but will also strengthen their self-confidence.

The influence of stereotypes and social expectations, the handling of stress and pressure, the meaning of the need to self-realization and the discovery of their own strengths will be worked on with methods of non-formal learning.

The PRECISE device enables fast inspection of bond integrity, calculation of remaining wall thickness, examination of different pipe geometries, and inspection of non-steel and bare steel pipes. PRECISE technology eliminates the need to purchase multiple devices for inspection of pipeline assets, as the technology is able to inspect through every composite material used to reinforce pipelines. PRECISE will help prevent spillages from happening through early non-destructive detection; potentially preventing serious disasters and will reduce the negative impact of 280 gas leaks per year resulting in over \u20ac100 million in damages.\nThe objective of this project is to perform Phase 1 feasibility study will allow us to analyse the technical feasibility assessment and evaluate the commercial potential of PRECISE product that we want to commercialise and exploit in the NDT inspection market by taking advantage of already validated system at TRL6. During this feasibility study we will perform risk assessment, market studies, intellectual property assessment and business planning with the ultimate goal to commercialise and introduce PRECISE product on the market, through innovation in key enabling technology as Eddy current.\nOur targeted market of NDT inspection services sector generated \u20ac295.4 million in revenue in 2012 and is expected to generate \u20ac494.4 million in 2017 with a CAGR of 10.9%.\nRealistically, it is estimated that our turnover through PRECISE commercialisation will reach over \u20ac8.5M by 2023, generating profits of \u20ac6M in the same year creating 14 new jobs extra for us by 2023.Considering we are Eddy current based product specialist company, this product is aligned with our strategy of business growth and competitiveness.\nIt is our strong belief that the SME instrument is the ideal financial instrument for us to accelerate commercialisation of PRECISE.", 43346.0, 61923.0, 1, 1, "PRECISE", null, null, null, "h2020_208183_937057152"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "ETHER NDE LIMITED", 43613.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_58118"]]}}}}
