The application is for one primary teacher from Knowepark Primary School to take part in the immersion course to build upon the work started in schools to implement and fully embed French into the primary curriculum by 2020.\r\nThe participant will take part in their own professional development prior to the course (learning key phrases, background reading, learning about the geography of the area they will be visiting). Whilst participating on the course, the activities will include speaking in the target language with native speakers, gaining resources and strategies for cross curricular approaches to teaching languages, developing a modern cultural awareness for the country being visited.  All language skills learned on the course will be used to implement the national, local and schools plans for addressing the Languages 1+2 recommendations from the Scottish Government.\r\nThe aims of this project are to develop staff ability and confidence in the teaching of French. This will in turn enhance the learning experience of the pupils in our schools allowing them to access languages from an earlier stage in their primary career. ICT will be used to enhance and support learning at all stages and will form a key area for how resources are shared and disseminated amongst staff in the schools and learning community. Getting pupils using ICT to communicate with other schools in the UK and abroad will widen their own cultural understanding.\r\nThe long term objective is to equip our staff with the knowledge, confidence and skills to deliver an effective language progression for all pupils in our primary schools, raise attainment in languages and ensure that young people are able to access the best opportunities within language and the world of work beyond school.", "http://knoweparkprimary.wordpress.com", "Knowepark Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036086_coordinator"]]}}, "5LU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1354320000000, 1417305600000, "Robust Sheep Electronic Identification", "Roxan Developments Ltd", "It is clear that group (batch) identification is not an adequate method to trace sheep movements across the EU, as the Foot & Mouth outbreak in 2001 demonstrated. Once animals move through different holdings, farms, or markets, it is very difficult to track where each animal is going without individual identification and recording. Should there be a disease outbreak the uncontrolled movement of animals could cause the further and rapid spread of disease over a large geographical area. Therefore the tracing of each individual animal is vitally important to control infectious diseases. However, compliance with the EC legislation for 100% assured tracking of livestock is difficult to deliver with the current mandated LF systems, having a reported recall of only 90% of tagged sheep in group movement situations. This non-compliance could potentially result in financial penalties of up to 50% of individual farm subsidies. The ROSEI project will develop an RFID tagging system offering a robust & reliable solution enabling 100% recall of tagged sheep in flock conditions. The proposed LF & UHF dual band solution  will have longer range & faster read rates for seamless flock and herd scanning enabling the farmers to comply with the strict legislation for Sheep monitoring & tracking. ROSEI will permit the implementation of advanced livestock management systems that utilise EID to accurately monitor the husbandry of animals in the food chain and will contribute to the EU integrated approach to food safety, \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019.", 235570.0, 1161686.0, 5, 7, "ROSEI", "http://www.rosei.eu/", "http://www.roxanid.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725527.jpg", "fp7_106210_953590220"]]}}}}
