We have a link school in La Rioja, Spain which has been established for over 5 years.\r\n\r\nAlthough we currently teach language across the whole school, only our MFL coordinator is fully confident with the language. She currently takes the lead on all teaching, supported by four other members of staff none of whom are language specialists. They are lacking in the necessary skills so need to build their skills and confidence to take a more active role in teaching.\r\n\r\nWe need to allow key staff members to fully immerse themselves in Spanish language and culture and rapidly develop their skills and confidence so that they can deliver high quality teaching and support and encourage colleagues, increasing pupils\u2019 exposure to Spanish. We need high-quality, authentic, engaging resources to increase the European Dimension.\r\n\r\nWe are applying for 20 mobilities to send 10 colleagues on week long intensive immersion courses in Spain in 2018 with a second course in 2019.

We want to include both teaching and support staff as they have most contact with pupils and will be best placed to meet the individual needs of pupils and support those with SEN/EAL.\r\n\r\nWe will change our approach to language teaching. We will develop our staff capacity to teach Spanish to their own classes and move away from reliance on one or a small group of teachers, ensuring that languages are more embedded across the curriculum and daily routines leading to more exposure. Our staff will develop the language skills, cultural awareness and pedagogy to deliver outstanding lessons and maintain their language learning through in house training and finding opportunities to embed languages and culture throughout their teaching.\r\n\r\nOur MFL coordinator will continue to move towards a more strategic and supportive role.

It will strengthen the existing scheme of work, ensuring it fully meets the requirements of the National Curriculum. \r\nThrough the immersion course and with the help of E-Twinning, the school will develop their European dimension through linking with partnership schools in Spain. This will provide the children with a purpose for learning their language, as communication between Allerton and the partner school will be actioned via the use of ICT.\r\nThe immersion course is part of a wider and long term strategy of development of the teaching and learning of modern foreign languages throughout Allerton C of E Primary. We plan to develop professional dialogue between staff and cluster schools. Through the participation of the immersion course we hope to build knowledge and resources that we can share with colleagues and wider professionals. This would be actioned through the delivery of professional development sessions and staff inset days, with view to team delivering training to local schools in our cluster area. We aim to develop and establish a cluster format for evaluating attainment and progress in modern foreign language, enabling us to track progress of cohorts against others in the local authority. To ensure the staff competency in the delivery of our languages curriculum is maintained, we seek to participate in future immersion courses.\r\nThe expected impact on the participants will primarily be to increase confidence and ability to teach Spanish as part of the modern foreign language curriculum, as it will provide them with experiences and opportunities to practice the target language in a real-life context. It will improve the teaching methodology for languages within Allerton CE Primary and embed the language with school. A greater cultural awareness from the participants will be transferred to pupils therefore enabling Spanish to be fed into the curriculum in other opportunities outside of the weekly session.

The principal objective of Fortissimo is to enable European manufacturing, particularly small to medium enterprises (SMEs), to benefit from the efficiency and competitive advantage inherent in the use of simulation. However, the simulation of, for example, high-pressure gas cylinders, the moulding of plastics or the thermodynamic properties of hazardous materials requires enormous computing power and specialised software tools and services. Generally, large companies, which have a greater pool of skills and resources, find access to advanced simulation easier than SMEs which can neither afford expensive High Performance Computing equipment nor the licensing cost for the relevant tools. This means that SMEs are not able to take advantage of advanced simulation, even though it can clearly make them more competitive. The goal of Fortissimo is to overcome this impasse through the provision of simulation services running on a cloud infrastructure making use of High Performance Computing systems also making appropriate skills and tools available in a distributed, internet-based environment.<br/>Fortissimo will make advanced simulation more easily accessible, particularly to SMEs, through the realisation of a 'one-stop shop' where hardware, expertise, applications, visualisation and tools will be easily available and affordable on a pay-per-use basis. In doing this it will create and demonstrate a sustainable commercial ecosystem where actors at all levels in the value chain can realise sufficient commercial benefit to enable that ecosystem to persist independently of EU funding and continue to provide affordable services to manufacturing industry, particularly SMEs.<br/>Fortissimo will be driven by end-user requirements where (~50) business-relevant application experiments will be used to develop, test and demonstrate both the infrastructure and the 'one-stop pay-per-use shop'. The project participants represent all actors in the value chain. Not only will Fortissimo contribute to the increased competitiveness of European manufacturing industry through the innovative infrastructure that it will develop and test, but it will create commercial opportunities for European Independent Software Vendors, as well as for service and High Performance Computing infrastructure providers, through the creation of a new market for their products and services. Fortissimo places considerable emphasis on the exploitation of opportunities at all levels of the value chain ranging from the end-user to the High Performance Computing infrastructure provider.<br/>Fortissimo involves 1,948.5 months of effort, a total cost of \u20ac21.9m and EC funding of \u20ac16m over a duration of three years, commensurate with achieving its ambitious goals.", 9691.0, 17421765.0, 19, 124, "FORTISSIMO", null, null, null, "fp7_109893_949430472"]]}}}}
