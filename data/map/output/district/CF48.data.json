The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.merthyr.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_13"]]}}, "3TD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "SOCIAL ENTERPRISE SHARING BEST PRACTICE AS A TOOL IN YOUTH WORK", "Stephens and George Centenary Charitable Trust", 154340.0, 6, 8, "From European to local level Social Enterprise is recognised as having a valuable contribution to make in building social cohesion / wellbeing and economic growth.

This will be achieved through a programme of seven short-term training events attended by all partners, where the host will share their work and that of local stakeholders in the fields of social enterprise and youth work. With a diverse partner selection, we will have the added value of partners sharing their own expertise (NSHC - refugees and asylum seekers, AC Sportiv Experieta Multisport in using sport as engagement tool, AMACH!

From the programme of seven training courses we will identify examples of good practice and showcase the results in the publication of Good Practice Guide on Social Enterprise as a Tool in Youth Work.

Experiments will be carried out.\r\nTo document the project activities and to exchange this information amongst the project partners, we will use  printing and   graphical presentations.\r\nPupils will have an increased knowledge about the origin of resources. Pupils are aware of waste production ,  of the finite availabilty of resources, they are abel to use  the  resources sparingly and reduce their  waste production. Pupils will have changed their lifestyles minimizing their production of waste. They will have  a smart approach to sustainabilty.\r\nPupils will refrain from discarding items of negative enviromentel impact.\r\nThe pupils will be more open minded for the use of new technologies for contacts, researches and presentations. They will have  a willingness to share knowledge and skills. Pupils can use ICT effectivly in videoconferences, mails and use of internet research for information on the project topic. \r\nThey can use ICT to assist with language difficulties and raise language  awareness.
