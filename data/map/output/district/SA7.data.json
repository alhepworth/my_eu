The Graphene Flagship is a 10 year research and innovation endeavour with a total project cost of 1,000,000,000 euros, funded jointly by the European Commission and member states and associated countries. The first part of the Flagship was a 30-month Collaborative Project, Coordination and Support Action (CP-CSA) under the 7th framework program (2013-2016), while this and the following parts are implemented as Core Projects under the Horizon 2020 framework.\n\nThe mission of the Graphene Flagship is to take graphene and related layered materials from a state of raw potential to a point where they can revolutionise multiple industries. This will bring a new dimension to future technology \u2013 a faster, thinner, stronger, flexible, and broadband revolution. Our program will put Europe firmly at the heart of the process, with a manifold return on the EU investment, both in terms of technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo realise this vision, we have brought together a larger European consortium with about 150 partners in 23 countries. The partners represent academia, research institutes and industries, which work closely together in 15 technical work packages and five supporting work packages covering the entire value chain from materials to components and systems. As time progresses, the centre of gravity of the Flagship moves towards applications, which is reflected in the increasing importance of the higher - system - levels of the value chain. In this first core project the main focus is on components and initial system level tasks. \n\nThe first core project is divided into 4 divisions, which in turn comprise 3 to 5 work packages on related topics. A fifth, external division acts as a link to the parts of the Flagship that are funded by the member states and associated countries, or by other funding sources.

Despite intensive efforts, no disease-modifying treatments or preventive strategies are available. The lack of specific, sensitive and minimally invasive diagnostics to identify people with early-stage AD to be included in clinical drug intervention trials is among the main reasons for many notable trial failures. The main challenges in developing the required diagnostics are identification of AD biomarkers and development of their detection techniques. The complex and interdisciplinary nature of the research underlines the need for innovative training of a new generation of researchers in the field. BBDiag responds to such a need and establishes a much-needed ETN for blood based early-AD diagnostics to address these challenges. It brings together leading academic and industrial experts from five major consortia in Europe and uses their synergies to build a triple-i research & training platform with the required multidisciplinary expertise and cutting-edge technologies. BBDiag Fellows will be trained under the Vitae Researcher Development Framework innovatively combined with the BBDiag platform for gaining interdisciplinary scientific and transferable skills as well as personal quality, creative thinking and business mind-set. The ETN has a highly innovative research programme for the discovery of AD biomarkers, development of novel biosensing techniques and point of care tools, and for technological exploitation of the diagnostics. These advances will strongly support improved care provision and development of disease-modifying treatments and preventive strategies for AD patients. More importantly, BBDiag will deliver its first generation of 13 highly-skilled, creative and entrepreneurial Fellows, setting them on a path to successful careers in academia or industry to ensure that the medical and societal challenges imposed by AD are met.", 238393.0, 3023229.0, 6, 15, "BBDiag", null, null, null, "h2020_205430_941948377"], [1522540800000, 1585612800000, "Graphene Flagship Core Project 2", "Prognomics Ltd", "This proposal describes the third stage of the EC-funded part of the Graphene Flagship.

It involves 8 schools from Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Wales (UK), Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania and Czech Republic. The main priority of this partnership is supporting schools to address all students from the lowest to the highest end of academic spectrum, to maximize the learning and teaching potential in each of our schools and to deal with issues of underachievement in basic skills.\r\n\r\nThe teachers, in close collaboration with the educational community (researchers, parents, students and other members) are going to learn and develop new teaching methods: Visual Literacy (VL) and/in Differentiated instruction (DI). In the media age, children face reading literacy and VL challenges even at their early primary school age. The development of broad literacy skills, which go far beyond a purely text-based approach (e.g. critical and competent use of visual material, coding and decoding of pictures), would therefore appear necessary.\r\n\r\nThis project primarily addresses our need as teachers to adopt and share innovative methods in order to enhance and develop our teaching work in societies where cultural changes (multiculturalism, financial crises, immigrants) happen so fast that and formal, traditional educational systems fail to follow. It is crucial then to develop this project in diverse teaching contexts and environments so we would be able to come with positive lines of investigation in the new ways that education is adopting.\r\nOur innovative project is guided by the general principles of differentiation, which are respectful tasks, tiered lessons, flexible grouping and ongoing assessment. The methodology we intend to apply to work on incorporates a lot of the characteristics inherent in language teaching and looks into the potential of the Visual Literacy approach as a viable practice for Differentiated Instruction.\r\nOur aims:\r\n- To utilise the pedagogical teaching methods behind the theories of DI and VL in order to customise learning experiences, to adapt and differentiate teaching procedures and tasks according to the unique needs and learning styles of the students\r\n- Raise awareness among children and adults of the cultural elements around them and how these relate to their daily lives\r\n-  Sensitise children to collective processes necessary for decision-making and to foster the spirit of collective work and trust in the product of group work\r\n- Use tasks as \u201cresearch tools\u201d for cultural comparisons on a longitudinal basis and between communities of a different cultural, economic, social profile\r\n- to address our students\u2019 individual needs in terms of better understanding the learning process, the curriculum topics and contribute to the improvement of their school attainment and inclusion\r\n\r\nOur VL and DI project is less perceived as an isolated school subject and more as the combined outcome of educational activities incorporating other areas of knowledge (languages, art, music, drama, ICT, social studies etc)\r\nThe results expected during the project are the final productions of activities along with a final physical book with all our Project activities in different languages, the resources from teachers' co-training activities and a final guide about the whole project.\r\nThe project is expected to have impact on the school as a \u201cwhole\u201d as it affects students, teachers, parents, local community by supporting the overall improvement of the quality of the school and the cooperation in many levels and by disseminating the project practices and results (using various tools) to multiple target groups (local, regional, national, transnational level).\r\nFinally, the sustainability in this project is ensured as all partners are committed to building a network of stable relationships that can lead to future expansion and development of the project.", null, "Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Lon Las", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036691_coordinator"]]}}}}
