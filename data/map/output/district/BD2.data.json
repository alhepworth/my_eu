It should promote participation and democracy, equity and equality. There has been a lot of turbulence in Europe recently. There is an urgent need to strengthen our students\u2019 knowledge, skills and competencies to grow up as active citizens who value non-discrimination and equality, non-violence and peace. Such values cannot be taken for granted any more. \r\nThe participants of this project have different backgrounds and they come from different parts of Europe. They all have challenges in defining their identity. As educators we want them to learn to appreciate and respect diversity in society which is an important part of global competence. In our team of schools from Finland, the UK and Spain we decided that it\u2019s important to help the students to become aware of the things that affect their decision making and develop their thinking skills so that they can make measured choices that are not borne out of stereotypes, tradition or instinct. \r\nIn our project we will be doing this by using activities where the students use cognitive strategies whereby they become aware of their thinking process. This will encourage them to think critically of the binary world of social media where people just simply click \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018dislike\u2019 with very little consideration of \u2018why\u2019 or \u2018how\u2019 they have reached that decision. In our activities we will be using a variety of games, role play and storytelling.  To train the students\u2019 ICT skills and to motivate them we will be making use of gamification software by choosing tools such as Apps and a new innovative SOLOMO tool called Action Track. The students and teachers will be learning to use this tool together and sharing their knowledge with their peers. We will be taking steps in the use of the tool by starting with simple tracks where students learn about each other\u2019s countries and neighbourhood, cultures and traditions thus enhancing their knowledge. The next step is to incorporate more complex contents with pictures, sound and video into Action Track activities. The aim of these activities is to challenge the player to think about how they form their opinions about other people and how external markers are only part of who we are. Moreover, Action Track allows us to take learning out of traditional classrooms and use tracks as both mental and physical activities. The tracks can be anywhere: outdoors in the forest, in the school yard or in the school building.\r\nWe will produce an Action Track user manual to help and encourage other schools to design and use the tool in a varied way. We will make the Action Tracks with descriptions of the aim and contents of the activities available to all. We will evaluate the tool and give feedback on it to the company TAZ who has developed the tool and owns the licence. Moreover, we will make a collection of the conflictive cognitive activities we have used and present it as an ebook.\r\nWe believe that it is important for the schools to take action in promoting a better understanding of diversity and developing the students\u2019 ability to live in harmony with different kinds of people. To promote democracy we need to promote the positive change in the way our students think. That change starts on a personal level, spreads on a local level in schools and we hope that it ultimately brings along a positive change on a wider international level so that we get a lot of \u2018likes\u2019 for non-discrimination and equality, non-violence and peace.", "http://www.hansonacademy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA219-034744_1"], [2018, "Hanson School Italy Work Experience Scheme", "Hanson School", 36476.0, 2, 2, "This project is to train and take a cohort of students and accompanying adults to the winter sports resort of Folgarida in Italy to complete vocational work experience with the Hotel Luna group.  \r\nContext/ background:  \r\nThis project will build on the success of our first ERASMUS project in the 2017 call.  We are a large 11-18 school in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with below average outcomes and a high level of deprivation.  Hanson has a student body with a low mobility and many psychological and economic boundaries.  The school has 40% of its pupils from a range of ethnic backgrounds.  30% of the school population is highly deprived and eligible for Pupil premium funding at lower school and an academic bursary at post 16 education.\r\nObjectives:\r\nTo meet the main aims of the project which are to reduce the mental and cultural barriers to work in Europe. The project is designed to provide students who have limited social mobility and limited opportunity with valuable real world work experience in a range of areas in the winter sports industry that link directly to vocational subjects they are studying.  \r\nTo validate vocational qualifications by linking learning aims of courses with practical experiences.\r\nUp-skill students by developing personal qualities through a rigorous selection process, prior training, work experience and evaluation.  \r\nImprove European integration of our learners by breaking down perceived cultural, economic and aspirational barriers. \r\nEngage with the Strategic Framework for Education and Training 2020 by promoting lifelong learning and mobility,  equality, social cohesion and active citizenship. \r\nCreate a repeatable partnership to allow future waves of students the opportunity to gain work experience abroad. \r\nTo train staff so European mobility can be actively encouraged across our school via physical and electronic mediums. \r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nThere will be 15 participants on the project (with 2 students in reserve).  Students eligible for the project will be enrolled into Hanson Sixth Form starting September following GCSE results in August 2018.  Students will have the equivalent of 5 A* to C grades in Level 2 courses in a variety of subjects.   They will be 16 or 17 upon starting the project.   Participants will have shown a need for increased mobility highlighted by questionnaires to ascertain the current level of mobility and perceived barriers to work in Europe.   \r\nStudents will to study a vocational qualification to be eligible for the project, so the experience gained in Italy will be accredited to their BTEC qualifications and linked to the ECVET scheme for future mobility. \r\nDescription of activities:\r\nStudents will follow a strict selection process to ensure they are the right candidates for the program.  They will be enrolled on the European skills and European language passports, mobility supplement, and qualification supplements.  They will undertake Italian lessons with in school and undertake training from the Hotel Luna group via video link.  On the project participants will work alongside Italian employees in the day to running of the Hotel including catering, management, customer relations cleaning and  customer service where they will liaise with hotel clients and travel agencies.  Participants will take part in skiing lessons to gain a full understanding of the winter sports industry. \r\nResults and impact envisaged:\r\nThis project will reduce the number of students leaving sixth form without further education, training or employment.  Students will develop linguistic skills and gain experiences which will make them more employable in the domestic and European job markets.  Staff will be trained so they can be used in future projects.  Participants will gain self confidence and the outcomes of the students will be improved through higher grades in vocational courses.  \r\nLonger term benefits:\r\nThe project to be repeatable with future cohorts and allow younger students to aspire to join the program by seeing the benefits and outcomes.
