On completion of the PReDicT project, the P1vital PReDicT Test will be ready for market launch. Depression is a common, serious and in some cases life\u2010threatening condition, affecting around 350 million people in the world and 11% of EU citizens suffer from depression at some point in their life.

During this time a patients\u2019 ability to work and function socially is severely impaired, and they can spend many weeks or months absent from work placing a substantial burden on the economy and healthcare resources. The P1vital PReDicT Test addresses this problem by identifying within 1 week of starting treatment whether an antidepressant is working or not which can significantly reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment.

However, without a biological rationale for these disorders, drug development has dramatically stagnated in the past decades. In a coordinated effort encompassing academic experts, SMEs, patient and family organizations, regulators, ECNP and EFPIA partners, this project aims to develop a quantitative biological approach to the understanding and classification of neuropsychiatric diseases to accelerate the discovery and development of better treatments for patients. This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains.

MyOcean proposes to set an incremental logic and a governance to remain sustainable after the project and able to welcome new science and new services.  The project includes the following tasks: - The definition of a first set of operational Marine Core Services, first package of an enlarged MCS portfolio - The operational development of European upgraded capacities acting as a common denominator for Member States, EU needs for reference marine information - The pre-operational validation of these MCS infrastructures and services and their formal commissioning - The marketing and promotion of Marine Core Services for use widening - The elaboration of a committed organisation to support at long term MCS operations, evolution and research.  My Ocean inherits, benefits and pursues a European operational oceanography strategy started within EUROGOOS networks, and progressively implemented through subsequent projects: MERSEA Strand1, MERSEA, BOSS4. BOSS4 will provide a Version 0 of Marine Core Services fast tracks.

Sensor networks are and will continue to be important in environmental management. However, many scientific and technological challenges need to be tackled before sensor networks are exploited in their full capacity for aiding decision support for environmental applications. This project addresses two of these challenges: (a) the development of an integrated information space where new sensor networks can be easily discovered and integrated with existing ones and possibly other data sources (e.g., historical databases), and (b) the rapid development of flexible and user-centric environmental decision support systems that use data from multiple, autonomous, independently deployed sensor networks and other applications.<br/>To address this challenge, the SemsorGrid4Env project will investigate and develop technological infrastructure for the rapid prototyping and development of open, large-scale Semantic Sensor Grids for environmental management. In particular, SemsorGrid4Env will enable:1. A semantically-consistent view of several heterogeneous sensor networks as a global Grid data resource;2. Rapid development of Grid services that combine real-world real-time data, coming from autonomous, heterogeneous sensor networks, with legacy historical data;3. Rapid development of open, flexible, contextual knowledge-based thin applications (e.g., mashups) for environmental management.<br/>As more and more sensor networks are independently developed and deployed, the SemsorGrid4Env outcomes will leverage their use of sensor networks in environmental management scenarios that were not foreseen or that transcend their original purpose.

The aim of this project is to help students develop these key skills through a trans-european cooperation between 13 academic, research and industrial institutions in the UK, Greece, Italy and France. It will focus on the use and integration of terrestrial remotely piloted airborne systems (drone) imagery and submarine remotely operated vehicle data for the combined study of geohazards in terrestrial and marine environments, through a programme of data sharing, scientific and technical collaboration and ultimately curriculum development at postgraduate level to help students develop advanced skills in these areas. The aim of the project is to develop a series of very high resolution 3D virtual reality models of geohazards observed in the onshore and offshore environment using data acquired from airborne drone and submersible platforms that can be used in classrooms to teach about onshore and offshore environments as a continuum. To facilitate this, the project aims to develop a series of toolkits to allow students to navigate these environments using virtual reality headsets, map and measure features on the ground surface and seabed to simulate real field  mapping activities; and then export features they have identified for further analysis in other software such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). \r\nOur project will create a digital platform where terrestrial and seafloor data and virtual reality visualisation tools will be openly distributed to allow for the processing and visualisation of terrestrial and seafloor environment focused on natural hazards.
