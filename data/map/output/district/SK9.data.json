Within the DIGITgame community, learners and educators can adopt several roles: consumers of teaching resources and  producers of new learning materials. Scientists and other stakeholders (entrepreneurship, public bodies, etc.) are also invited to contribute to the creation of learning materials.\r\nSTRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP The project consortium is integrated by 5 partners from 3 countries (TR, UK, IT)\r\n\u2022 IBIMET-CNR, IT, the applicant, R&D entity, engaged in a lot of projects on activities of scientific and educational programs directed to/for adults and students, able to provide knowledge and expertise on climate, meteorology and their connection to the environment\r\n\u2022 TAGES, TR, a SME leader in preparing and coordinating R&D and innovation projects with a strong ICT curriculum in managing activities related with students and Smart Cities concepts\r\n\u2022 CLICKS&LINKS, UK, a company specialized in didactic visualisation and gamification including the creation of virtual worlds and VR applications\r\n\u2022 K12, TR, an innovative foundation expert in developing and using learning tools, resources and on-line collaborative platforms for students and teachers, able to learn, teach and co-create contents for STEM courses\r\n\u2022 SENSALE, IT, an high school science-based represents the perfect context to develop-with, apply and test the methodologies and strategies core of gamification in Smart City concept deepening\r\nThe collaboration of enterprises, research institution, innovative foundation and schools allows a multidisciplinary approach that encourages making the project outcomes suitable and useful to a wider range of users.\r\nDIGITgame project will have positive and long-lasting effects on participants, organizations, and people involved in the actions and target groups. Project educational modernization items and improvement of tools will develop key competencies and lead to more creative, innovative and competent students.", "http://www.clicksandlinks.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA201-036822_2"]]}}, "7QE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "European classroom", "Alderley Edge School for Girls", 276513.0, 7, 7, "European Classroom came into existence because of a desire to include as wide a number of staff and pupils as possible in an exchange of ideas and experiences. The aim of our project is to link classrooms from seven European countries in everyday lessons and to share examples of good practice between teachers and students. Although our national curricula differ extensively there are common general aspects in all of them and we believe that we can cooperate on and study this common ground. The seven participating schools come from eastern and western Europe reflecting the diversity of European cultures. Moreover they are different types of school; state schools and  private schools, primary and secondary, from as small as 600 students to as big as 2000 pupils.  \r\nWe aim to enhance the quality and relevance of the learning offered in education by developing new and innovative approaches, to foster the provision and the assessment of key-competences like entrepreneurship, languages and digital skills, to encourage collaborative learning in order to create open educational resources, to promote critical thinking  and  structured inter-regional and cross-border cooperation. Schools need to be open to internationalization, increasing the European dimension of the education they provide. This project could help each of the schools involved  to be more visible, to show their expertise and exchange good practices with EU schools.We are planning different types of crossborder mobilities. Teachers will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and compare curricula. Students will teach other students, organize workshops, present outcomes and finalize project work. There will also be individual long mobilities between the participating schools during which students will attend lessons at a partner school.\r\nAll the proposed activities have been selected as a result of consultation with colleagues who have an interest in sharing their methods with others and learning from the approach of their European counterparts. For each project a common theme and modus operandi have been established through communication by the interested parties. The means of communication between staff, pupils and staff and pupils have been agreed and the eventual outcomes anticipated. Work on each project will be a combination of work in national and international groups using all forms of digital communication. Lessons plans will be created and shared. Project progress will be assessed and evaluated on a regular basis.We will enhance the professional development of school staff through planning and evaluating lessons together with their European colleagues  \r\nThe results from the project will include a website which is to be the vehicle to disseminate the results of each individual project. Materials such as lesson plans, pedagogical materials, resources and the end results of our collaborations will be made available on this website.  Our results will be made available not just to the participating schools but also to all schools in Europe.  As such the impact of the project will be to raise awareness of the possibilty and success of cooperation and collaboration between European schools. Moreover the benefits for all the participants, but particularly for the pupils, will be increased self-confidence, better key skills such as language and ICT skills and greater awareness of European culture and diversity which will improve their lives, their relationships and the life-long learning process.  The successful relationships between the all the teachers involved will lead to future collaboration as a direct result of this project and the links created will encourage and foster the creation of new projects together in the future.", "http://www.aesg.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-008555_6"]]}}}}
