CollegesWales has employed a full time International Coordinator since November 2010 to engage the FE institutions in European funded projects such as Erasmus+.   One of the main reasons for carrying out this project is to raise the aspirations of young people currently undertaking vocational education and training in Wales by empowering them to participate actively in society, not just in Wales but further afield in Europe.  This experience will build their confidence, enhance their technical & soft skills and improve their employability.  This opportunity will encourage them to develop friendships & networks beyond their current comfort zone giving them opportunities to learn a new language & enjoy different cultural experiences.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to enable participants to:\r\n-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  \r\n-consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field \r\n-enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts\r\n- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualifications.\r\n\r\nFor the consortium members and the receiving organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners and apprentices to become more work mobile across Europe.\r\n \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere are 536 participants in this project - 520 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications (NVQs or BTECs) at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning. There are 32 apprentices in the project from Coleg y Cymoedd, Tata Steel and CELSA Manufacturing UK Ltd.  Across the whole project, there will be 19 curriculum areas with participants undertaking work placements in 12 European countries: Health & Social Care, Childcare, Travel & Tourism, Hair & Beauty, Catering, Sport, Outdoor Education, Business, Engineering, Agriculture, Equine, Agriculture, ICT, Interactive Media, Furniture Making, Plumbing, Construction, Public Services and Performing Arts.  The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and there are some draft training plans already in place for some organisations.  \r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe participants will undertake two week training periods in companies/businesses/primary schools in 12 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced jointly by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\nThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.  Returning participants who share their positive experiences with their peers, staff in their sending organisations and possibly with their employers will generate an enthusiasm for this type of activity and provoke others to consider participating in a similar project in the future thereby increasing the numbers of participants from Wales.

CollegesWales has employed a full time International Coordinator since November 2010 to engage the FE institutions in European funded projects.  Initially, the job was funded for one year by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome was the submission of a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011.  This funding enabled apprentices to undertake two/three week work placements in Europe.  Subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 were also successful and have attracted funding of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants to undertake short term work placements in European countries.  There was a successful consortium application for Erasmus+ funding in 2015 for 92 learners and two successful applications for staff mobility funding in 2014 and 2015.  The International Coordinator's role is now funded by the membership fees of the colleges and consortium applications for staff and learners will continue to be submitted under Erasmus+.  In 2016, CollegesWales is the applicant organisation  submitting a consortium bid on behalf of 9 FE colleges in Wales, 1 private training provider (ISA Training) and 1 large employer (TATA Steel). The objectives of the project are to enable participants to:-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  -consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field -enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualificationsFor the sending and receiving organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners to become more work mobile across Europe. Number and profile of participantsThere are 215 participants in this project - 197 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning.  18 of the participants are apprentices from TATA Steel, ISA Training and Coleg y Cymoedd.  The participants will be selected from the following curriculum areas:- Childcare, Travel & Tourism,  Hair & Beauty, Catering, Sport, Outdoor Education, Aerospace, Business Administration, Engineering, Health & Care, Leadership & Management, Creative Arts & Sport Therapy.   The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and some (those working with partners for the second time or more) have drafted sample training plans with the receiving organisations.  Activities The participants will undertake two or three week training periods in VET schools and/or companies/businesses in 8 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.Impact and longer term benefitsThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.

The challenge facing young people from Ethnic Minority and migrant populations is that in addition to more general social barriers they can also face further barriers to participating in recreational sport. There have been numerous studies and projects at an EU level highlighting inequality issues in governance of sport and also high profile campaigns in football, in particular tackling racism. The issue of participation is sometime less obviously addressed but is clearly an emerging issue for these communities as highlighted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).The objective of this Youth Sport Development Ambassadors (YSDA) project in relation to voluntary action is to identify they ability of young people to develop activity among disengaged social groups. The project will look at sustainable delivery models using young people as ambassadors in creating and delivering new activity for their peer groups. Young people from each of the participating countries will be recruited and trained as Youth Sport Development Ambassadors (YSDAs) who will create and deliver new physical activities for their peer groups in their own countries. The YSDAs will share best practice at an EU level for the first time in this field by observing and supporting each other in the planning and delivery of these activities in the other participating countries.

Raise employability of CFGM graduates and increase the number of students going on to study higher level courses (CFGS).\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n\r\n- Mobility of 62 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. \r\n- Mobility of 34 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 12 VT institutions acting as members, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VT institutions at their destination.

Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the language platform and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education.

CollegesWales has employed a full time International Coordinator since November 2010 to engage the FE colleges in European funded projects.  The job was funded for one year by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome was the submission of a centralised application for initially Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011.  This funding was to enable apprentices to undertake two/three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and VET learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short term work placements in various European countries.  The International Coordinator's role is now funded by the membership fees of the colleges and consortium applications for staff and learners will continue to be submitted under Erasmus+.  CollegesWales is the Applicant Organisation and is submitting a consortium application on behalf of 9 FE colleges in Wales. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to enable participants to:\r\n-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  \r\n-consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field \r\n-enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts\r\n- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualifications\r\n\r\nFor the sending and receiving Organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners to become more work mobile across Europe.\r\n \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere are 92 participants in this project - 84 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning.  Four of the participants from Gower College Swansea will be studying Modern Apprenticeships (Level 3) in Electrical Engineering and four of the participants from Coleg y Cymoedd will be studying Modern Apprenticeships (Level 3) in Mechanical Engineering.  The participants will be selected from the following curriculum areas:- Childcare, Hair & Beauty, Travel & Tourism, Hospitality & Catering, Sport, Outdoor Adventure, Built Environment, Business Administration, Mechanical Engineering and  Electrical Engineering.  The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and drafted sample training plans with the receiving organisations.\r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe participants will undertake two week training periods in VET schools and/or companies/businesses in 4 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility certificates will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\nThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.  Returning participants who share their positive experiences with their peers, staff in their sending organisations and possibly with their employers will generate an enthusiasm for this type of activity and provoke others to consider participating in a similar project in the future.

Staff mobility for 5 days in a job shadow in colleges: 12 teachers of the different fields studied at ECAM will pay attention to the differences between the way we work in Spain and the work in other European countries so that they can bring us the knowledge and methods to be applied in our school.\r\nBoth activities will be developed in France, Romania and Wales so we will promote the multilingualism. \r\nRegarding the staff involved, a well-prepared mobility team has been created and it is formed by a coordinator, the principle, two head teachers and an economic counsellor\r\nOur desire is both to open our school to the European dimension and to collaborate on achieving  some European objectives such as helping young people to be more qualified and answer qualified workforce demand of entreprises, to take part in an international experience and to enhance employability and improve career prospects at a local, national, European and international level, avoid the early school dropout and encourage students to go on studying a Higher Degree. The students must develop practical knowledge related to their field of study, acquire corporate culture and practical knowledge besides relate it to theory, develop autonomy, improve foreign language competences, enhance intercultural awareness, foster awareness of the European project, increase motivation to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improve learning performance, increase his/her sense of initiative, self-empowerment and self-esteem. This project will also enhance employability and improve career prospects. Moreover, this mobility project will strengthen cooperation between companies and schools and enhance social cohesion \r\nThe objectives staff mobility must achieve are the following: share teaching practice and improve the skills related to their professional profile, improve both their training  as well as the European education system knowledge, their language skills, their job opportunities, enhance intercultural awareness, promote excellence in teaching, develop innovative teaching methods, learn  how to fight against bullying and pass on what they have learned during the staff mobility period to students and teachers.\r\nThe programme will have an impact and some benefits on students, teachers and our school. The impact on our students is : motivation increase to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improvement of learning performance, reduction of school dropout, employability enhancement and improvement of career prospects, self-empowerment and self-esteem increase, personal and educational enrichment through the experience and promotion of the European values.\r\n The impact on our teachers is: enhancement of teaching practice, trigger changes in terms of modernization and internationalization in their educational organizations, motivation and satisfaction  increase in their daily work and broaden their horizons. Finally, the expected impact on our  school is: school education project enhancement, teaching quality improvement, school prestige with students enrolment increase and become better in terms of modernization and internationalization.\r\nThe Project 2017 will allow all the community to be better as workers and active people in the European society", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037738_3"], [2014, "DEVELOPING SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES IN VOCATIONAL TRAINING", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 87514.0, 4, 39, "Our proposal is a consequence of the results of an analysis conducted jointly by the three organizations IKASLAN, TKNIKA and the Deputy Ministry of Vocational Training and Lifelong Learning of the Basque government .

About 200 teachers take part in innovation projects developed in TKNIKA .They  work part-time at the center and half a day in TKNIKA in the development of these projects that  have an average duration of two years.\r\nThe projects developed cover a wide range of specialties. Some projects are technological, others are projects that have to do with management , others with teacher training and other tools for the development of e -learning and / or the Information Technology and Communication . The main objective of these projects is to reduce as much as possible the time between an innovation arises and access to vocational training schools . Teachers working in these projects design materials and training that teachers need to catch up in these areas for innovation.\r\nThere are two other very important needs that we meet with the development of this project: How does the design of technological following up system that can result in the development of projects and how you design system knowledge transfer emerged after project completion \r\nAnnually there are up an average of 45 projects under development in which the 200 teachers work .

We are in a position to claim that these kind of mobilities lead perfectly well those which are developed by intermediary companies or the ones with direct access through the companies themselves.    In february 2015 ,a group of teachers from CIPFP La Costera set out to develop a website based on the professional training aimed at fostering experiences of exchange with students from professional training.This ambitious proposal needs to be carried out through the international cooperation with other centres of Vocational Training and with other educative entities from the area.  Therefore, this KA 2 pretends to give a transnational boost  to the platform, adapting to  the real situation in other countries , improving some of the resources and above all spreading it out at European level.

To the same extent, a plan was also set out in front of the unexpected possible contingencies such as disagreements among partners or the impossibility of carrying on with it because of any member. At the begining of the activities of this project, an individual contract will be signed between the coordinator of the project and each member , where the assignation of the tasks and financial resources are clearly based , this should decrease the possibility of conflicts even more.

The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.

It shares its boundaries with the province of Madrid. Due to its geographical closeness to Madrid (roughly 35 kilometres away), it has grown a lot in the last years as a consequence of the housing boom whch took place in Spain some years ago. Lots of families arrived in the area looking for cheaper houses to live in than on the outskirts of Madrid. El Casar is a \u2018bedroom city\u2019 of Madrid where plenty of families commute to work in Madrid every day. The public means of transportation are limited, especially between the town and the capital city of Guadalajara. There is a high school-abandonment rate in the area. The educational and cultural offers are very limited and overtly insufficient. The extremely high unemployment rate has considerably increased in the last years and it has left plenty of families in economic dire straits. The school has got 594 students who study ESO (Compulsoty Secondary Education Stage), Bachillerato (School-Leaving Post-Compulsory Education), Basic Vocational Training, Middle Grade Vocational Training and Superior Grade Vocational Training. The whole vocational training stage is part of the profesional family of Administration and Management Some of the  students come from the very town El Casar but mostly do from neighbouring towns and residential areas, very badly connected with one another with public transportation and with inexistent cultural possibilities.Our school has offered the multilingual programme offered by the Regional Government of Castilla La Mancha since 2008. This linguistic programme has also been in existence for Vocational Training since 2011.Our school has recently started an internationalization process. The school received the ECHE letter for the mobility of students in 2013 and it is currently taking part in three mobility projects  (KA 101, KA102 and KA103). It has carried out 10 mobilities since 2014. All of them have been for FCT abroad and Dual Vocational Training abroad. Our school has got hosting partners in Italy, Wales, Croatia and Malta. Financing for the key action KA 101 was received in 2015. It comprises six mobility actions for the formation of teachers  including both courses for English teachers and for Teaching Methodology. Our school is involved in five eTwinning projects at the moment. We have been hosting partners of the LP Montgolfier Vocational Training Secondary School located in Annonay (France) since the 2015-2016 school year.b) Aims of the Project:The aims of the Project can be analyzed from a  threefold perspective: students, teaching staff and non-teaching staff.1. As for students this Project will inmensely help them in the following respects:-It will increase their learning opportunities abroad.-It will provide them with the necessary skills for the transition from the learning and academic world to that of learning in real-life labour market.-It will enable them to improve their learning of foreign languages, especially English.-It will promote their knowledge of other cultures within other European Union member states (remarkably the United Kingdom).2. As for teaching staff this Project will enable them to improve in many areas and respects, namely:-It will favor the Exchange of teaching experiences and the methodological innovation in the  vocational training educational stage.-It will Foster international cooperation among educational institutions in terms of the mobility of speacializaed Vocational Training teachers.-It will improve their learning of foreign languages, with special incidence on English.3. As for non-teaching staff this Project will also be of invaluable help since it will favour their improvement with respect to the following:-Their cooperation  in the internationalization of their educational and academic institutions in therms of a better knowledge of the management of similar mobility projects.- Their promotion of their knowledge of other cultures of other European Union member states, with special relevance of the United Kingdom\u2019s culture.c) Number and profile of the participants:-Eight Students either currently studying or who have recently finished their Middle Grade of Administration and Management Vocational Training studies.-Teaching Staff: One Vocational Training teacher.-Non-Teaching Staff: One office worker.d) Description of the activities. They can be carried out in any of the following institutions:-Practical learning for both students currently studying or who have recently finished their Vocational Training studies . This learning can be done either at the hosting partner\u2019s offices, at Vocational Training Secondary Schools within the network of the project\u2019s members led by our hosting partner or at a Vocational training school with the whole network of our project\u2019s partners.-Observation period for the teaching staff at a Vocational Training course with the p", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024697_1"], [2017, "EUROTRAIN: Euroform : LE TRAIN DE L'EUROPE !", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 9580.0, 2, 4, "Since 2010, Les Cordeliers School has been regularly involved in several European projects. Our school is located in the heart of Auvergne rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region very close to Clermont-Ferrand city centre.\r\nEurope is an integral part of our school project.\r\nOur primary school is currently involved in a Comenius project.  Our secondary school has a focus on Spanish language and every year plans a school trip to Spain or England. Within the High Vocational School, the implementation of a General Mobility Corrdinator and the opening of a Euro Section focused on English has improved the opening of students toward Europe.\r\nThe main goal of our project is to give our students more skills to help them develop autonomy and self-confidence but also develop essential linguistic skills which will help them continue in further education and get a job.\r\nOur project involves around thirty students over a period of 24 months. These students are either deeply involved in the European section or simply wish to do one of their training periods working for a European company. The students are preparing one of the 3 BTEC diplomas that were available in our school (Commerce, Hosting and Reception work , Health Care and Chils Care). These students are not used to travelling, living and working in a foreign country but they are extremely motivated to make the most of this experience. Students are selected by the Eurostaff of the school ( School Headmistress, the Chief Supervisor, the Information Officer, the Euromobility,Coordinator, the English teacher  and 2 trade teachers in charge of the European Section Course.\r\nThe strength of our partnerships with Scottish companies allows us to continue working with them and we now see them as solid partners. We have had a great feedback from them and we are therefore willing to strengthen our relationships. These companies truly get involved in the training of our students. Some of them have even offered summer jobs to our students.\r\nOur partners work with the national translated assessment grids and fully understand the purposes of these exchanges.\r\nThe students work on practicable activities. The idea for them is to live a successful experience and that\u2019s why the training objectives are explained in advance and the evaluation criteria are known well before the arrival of students. Each company tutor is involved, in collaboration with the teacher in charge of the student, in the validation of skills acquired. These evaluations are made during the last week of training when the teacher comes to take back the students back to France.\r\nExtra teaching hours are implemented for these students (2 hours per week) to prepare the trip. The preparatory work is educational, cultural and linguistic. Students take part in the full organization of their European experience. The work is done on the knowledge, knowhow but also life skills. \r\nOnce they have returned from their training period abroad the students have to write a placement report. They also write an internship report which will be their support for the oral examination in order to get the certificate Europro and the European mention* (*only for students who registered to the European section from the beginning).\r\nWe have had several articles in the local daily newspaper La Montagne linked to the European trip our students.\r\nWe also share all the information about our \u201cEuropean\u201d students on our website and during our open door sessions.\r\nWe have been engaged in European projects for several years now. Former students have learnt how to put forward their \u201cmobility\u201d skills and have used these new skills to continue their studies or to improve their CVs in the case of a job search. Some of them have gone for a new training period in the same companies and others, who have really enjoyed the time abroad, have decided to go and live 6 months in a European country, working in a restaurant or a pub.\r\nFrom 2017, we start experimenting a new project with a similar Vocational school in Wales.

The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector.

OSTEOproSPINE is a novel bone regeneration therapy composed of OSTEOGROW (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 6 [rhBMP6] delivered in autologous peripheral blood coagulum) reinforced with allograft (a compression resistant matrix). OSTEOproSPINE is designed to guide the formation of new bone at extra-skeletal site and replace autograft harvested from patient\u2019s iliac crest for the fusion of lumbar vertebrae. By generating new bone, OSTEOproSPINE will restore the spine\u2019s weight bearing function, reduce the severity of back pain and improve the success rate of posterolateral spinal fusion surgery. The program consortium of 13 partners from 6 EU member states has been assembled to conduct a Phase II, randomized, patient- and evaluator-blinded clinical trial of OSTEOproSPINE. Four clinical centers will enroll 180 patients suffering from degenerative disc disease to assess OSTEOproSPINE efficacy and safety in comparison with Standard of care (autograft) and Osteogrow. The Ethics Committee of the leading clinical site in Vienna has already granted a conditional approval for this trial. As the coordinating institution of the FP7 HEALTH project Osteogrow (Grant No. 279239), we have evaluated Osteogrow in Phase I/II clinical trials for distal radius fracture and high tibial osteotomy. Osteogrow exhibited excellent safety profile in these trials, supporting OSTEOproSPINE safety for administration in humans. A positive outcome of proposed trial will confirm OSTEOproSPINE potential to form a functioning new bone in human and by this restore the spine\u2019s function and improve the quality of life in patients with degenerative disc disorders using the ground principle of regenerative medicine: \u201cprovide the correct molecular signals to a population of presumptive cells in a permissive microenvironment\u201d.", 276713.0, 5232840.0, 6, 13, "OSTEOproSPINE", null, null, null, "h2020_215894_973926464"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "PAUL REGULATORY SERVICES LIMITED*", 272327.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_6197"], [2017, "PAUL REGULATORY SERVICES LIMITED*", 4612.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_49094"]]}}, "8ED": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "SPENCER DAVID*WILLIAM DAVID JENKINS WARREN SPENCER CARR", 33704.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_61076"], [2016, "SPENCER DAVID*WILLIAM DAVID JENKINS WARREN SPENCER CARR", 31372.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_61987"]]}}}}
