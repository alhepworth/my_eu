More than 75 years of visual and audio memories are in serious danger to be lost due to the natural instability cellulose acetate (CA) and Cellulose nitrate (CN) materials.\nThese physical media have helped to preserve the cultural material that is a real witness of socio-cultural European evolution in the recent era. It encompasses the possibility to understand the development of new arts such as cinema, photography or graphic arts and also the preservation of the socio-cultural memories of citizens located in major and local museums worldwide.\nConservators consider two approaches when planning treatments to extend the useful lifetime of cultural materials: preventive or passive and active or interventive. But in case of cellulose derivates and other components of the movie or photos, once initiated, degradation cannot be prevented, reversed or stopped, but only inhibited or slowed. Inhibitive conservation of cellulose derivates can either involve the removal or reduction of factors causing degradation including light, oxygen, acids, fungus and relative humidity among others, as well as cost-sensitive processes such as freeze. \nNEMOSINE improves the traditional storage solutions, such as freeze storage (below 5\u00baC), by developing an innovative package with the main goal of energy saving and extent conservation time.

The developmental goal of \u0112rgli High School is in line with European Union strategic development planning documents, which call for development of foundational skills for all pupils, for a reduction in the number of early school leavers and for a strong emphasis on teachers' professional development as a means of achieving these aims. It is impossible to create a modern school and facilitate the overall development of society without improving teachers' professional competence in modern pedagogy, the use of technology and international communication. Therefore one of Ergli High School's main priorities is \"Teachers' ongoing professional learning for the formation of 21st century skills in a modern school.\" Ergli HIgh School places a high value on the European dimension and international collaboration between educational institutions in teachers' professional competence development.\r\nProject Aim: To utilise international experience in the development of teachers' competence at Ergli High School in order to deliver a personalised education and 21st century skills for all pupils.\r\nObjectives:\r\n1.

These involve;\r\n-intensive language learning with native speaker teachers, \r\n-language teaching methodology,\r\n-professional discussion of aspects of language teaching such as improving literacy through language teaching, \r\n-ideas for supporting colleagues in partner schools, \r\n-use of ICT and new technologies to support language learning, and \r\n-supporting pupils with special educational needs and low basic skills. \r\n\r\nWe would like to involve two members of staff in these training courses. We intend that both members of staff will go to Spain and France during the length of this project. This will then mean that they are in a position to be able to establish a high-quality language provision within the MFL Department and disseminate skills and knowledge to other members of staff within the school. They will share the ideas, knowledge and resources gained with members of staff in other departments to share ideas relevant to them, and to develop more cross curricular work and cooperation across departments. \r\n\r\nParticipants will experience an improvement in professional development and teaching strategies and methods, in language competence, confidence in their abilities and in their future career prospects. They will have a greater inter-cultural understanding post-course, and we will be able to experience and observe best practice in other countries. They will improve their communication skills, both verbal and social, and their wellbeing and lifestyle as teachers will be improved due to an increase in motivation and confidence. They will be more confident to use language spontaneously in the classroom and will be in a position to be more flexible within their teaching role as they will be able to teach both languages to a high standard.\r\n\r\nAttainment will be improved; we will be able to hold more cultural and international events in school to inspire pupils, with better resources and a more positive and engaging learning environment. Pupil engagement will be improved due to better teaching strategies, use of the target language and a greater awareness of other cultures. Students' horizons will be broadened by real links with students abroad and they will therefore have more self belief in the possibility to travel in the future. \r\n\r\nThere will be an impact on the attainment of pupils with special educational needs as the courses will in part focus on how to best support these pupils through language learning. \r\n\r\nThere will also be a positive impact on our local community.

The vocational courses are the starting points to increase the standard and quality of floristry in Europe. The international learning units will allow students, professionals in training and adults to educate themselves to a minimum level throughout Europe by strengthening the vocational courses. Furthermore, these international learning units will be done in colleges, work-based and in MOOCs. This allows students mobility throughout partner colleges to be assessed in the same way in all partner schools through a transparent assessment system and through a quality certification system. The same applies to adults in training.
