It takes disasters as moments when the state attempts to reorder society and thus analyses the encounter between civil protection as state organisation and the population. What happens when civil protection encounters the population in case of disasters? How does civil protection conceive of the population and how does it influence what happens in case of disasters? How does the population conceive of civil protection in turn? By answering these questions the project reacts to omissions of both disaster studies and research on the state. Both of these research traditions tended to either look exclusively at the state or at resistant or subjected citizens. By drawing on Science and Technology Studies and the sociology of expertise these omissions are averted. This allows first looking at civil protection as a knowledge-based and organised attempt to order society. Second it allows understanding disasters as a process involving a reordering of society mediated by knowledge and objects. Combining these approaches allows to precisely analyse the relationship between experts and lay people, without focusing on either of these.\nThe project seeks to answer the above questions by combining a set of empirical methods, namely document analysis of civil protection manuals, participant observation and visual ethnographies of civil protection trainings and qualitative interviews in the aftermath of flood-disasters. The empirical fields chosen in this project are England, Switzerland and India, to allow for comparison of different forms of centralization and different forms of professionalization of civil protection organisations.\nThe empirical research progresses in three steps. First, a study of programmatic texts and training manuals of civil protection agencies looks at how civil protection conceives of the relationship between the organisation and the population on paper and how these views have changed along with organisational structures since the 1950ies. Second, ethnographic studies of civil protection training and narrative interviews with civil protection officers look at how civil protection currently conceives of the population in practice and how these views are mediated by recent organisational and technological changes.

There has been much progress towards the creative generation of artefacts of cultural value such as poems, music and paintings. Often, when produced by people, such artefacts embed a fictional idea invented by the creator. For instance, an artist might have the fictional idea: [What if there was a quiz show, where each week someone was shot dead?] and express this through a painting, poem or film. While such ideation is clearly central to creativity, with obvious applications to the creative industries, there have only been a few small, ad-hoc studies of how to automate fictional ideation. The time is therefore ripe to see whether we can derive, implement and test novel formalisms and processes which enable software to not only invent, but assess, explore and present such ideas. We propose to investigate the following model for creative idea generation: (a) collect and analyse some information about a domain, to form a shallow world view of that domain (b) form a set of what-if style ideas from the analysis using notions of surprise, semantic tension and incongruity (c) assess, rank and select ideas based on the quality and quantity of narratives that can be generated using each idea, and (d) use the world view, idea and narratives in linguistic renderings, taking into account notions of relevancy, expansion, obfuscation and affect. Given that ideas are for human consumption, we will also collect crowd-sourced data about how people value, appreciate and expand these ideas, and will machine learn predictors for how people will react to automatically generated ideas.

Putting entrepreneurial skills into practice- for example network building, fundraising, creating new ways to involve the public - is becoming increasingly important as a way to stay healthy. However, this cannot go against other core tasks like conservation; this  should go hand in hand. Hence the concept of \"cultural entrepreneurship\". \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThere is a distinct need of obtaining more cultural entrepreneurship skills in the sector and putting them into practice. Although training courses aimed at the heritage and museum sectors exist in most EU member states, their availability, take-up and accreditation is not widely spread. This project aims at giving cultural heritage organizations and museums possibilities to acquire competences and tools in the field of cultural entrepreneurship. \r\n \r\nThe specific objectives are:\r\n- to define the cultural entrepreneurship concept, contributing to the mutual understanding and recognition;\r\n- to research the topic of cultural entrepreneurship in the member states and in the European context, and build a long-lasting strategic partnership of key education and sector organizations around a common research agenda,\r\n- to contribute to the 'cultural entrepreneur' curriculum by agreeing on the specific elements / skills necessary and effective ways to obtain these skills; using innovative techniques within current established fields;\r\n-- to develop a cultural entrepreneurship VET training course pilot specifically aimed at staff of smaller museums and cultural heritage organizations, experiment with it in the field;\r\n- to exploit the training course and the project results, within the parter organizations, but also Europe-wide by means of the creation of a cultural entrepreneurship online platform and community that will live on after the project.\r\n\r\nPartnership\r\nThe partnership base is three higher education institutions that are experts in the field of culture, management and entrepreneurship, the Amsterdam School of the Arts, University of London and University of Bologna.

Despite the great potential of creative and cultural enterprises, some 900.000 in Europe that, according to the EU Commission, total 3 % of the overall European GIP (402 billion of Euros) and a relevant quota of jobs, those enterprises are widely undervalued. So, not only do they need support to the entrepreneurial component, but also the establishment of stronger relations with assets of consolidated manufacture.\r\nThe Smart Jump project intends to strengthen the links between training and labour environments, through the improvement of training offer (with the reduction of gaps of specific skills for entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship) and the support to the governance systems referring to education and training. These systems are nowadays ruled through interactions that are more and more complex, between training organisations, companies, policy makers, decision makers and society as such. More in detail, this proposal intends to strengthen the quality of learning offer linked to the entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship of women and young entrepreneurs who are active or have entered the creative industries sector. The starting point is a model - in this case developed in Sweden with the Women Resource Center - called Four Helix, that aims at developing female entrepreneurship through joint actions of Institutions, of companies, of university and society. Smart Jump will concretely operate to fine tune the training offer at local level and at partners\u2019 level with the strategies of economical development directed to growth and innovation. The project envisages the realisation of different activities and results, of sharing the Swedish practice, of joint development of training contents for female and young entrepreneurs, of transnational actions (mobility and training), of design of a community including entrepreneurs and professionals to dialogue with the Public, university and society. The strategic partnership is made of 7 partners from 5 EU Member states. It encompasses public bodies (such as the Veneto Region) and private organisations (such as Confindustria Veneto SIAV, WINNET) representative of enterprises, university (such as CUOA Foundation and Goldsmiths\u2019 College) and development of human capital.\r\nMain beneficiaries involved in the Smart Jump project are women and young persons who operate (or intend to operate) in the creative industries sector. On one side, female entrepreneurs or women who act as managers in Europe are less than 30 % and have limited access to high level interventions of managerial training. On the other side, the support to entrepreneurship, especially in emerging sectors and with high rate of development has been recognised as one of the possible answers to the dramatic situation of youth unemployment, particularly in Spain, Italy, and Hungary. As a consequence, 52 beneficiaries (women, young, staff of partners\u2019 organisations) will be directly involved in the testing phase of the learning model.\r\nThe work plan is articulated in three macro activities: a first step will deal with the analysis of the Swedish approach in order to design the structure of the cooperation model between actors. The analysis will integrate also existing practices in partner countries, and will set the training contents for entrepreneurial development. The second phase envisages the promotion of creativity, of learning to innovate, of entrepreneurship. The third step is about valorization and mainstreaming and the design of an international community to network stakeholders related to creative industries.\r\nIn terms of benefits and impact, the project will improve the training offer of partner organisations. It will develop high level skills to support entrepreneurial activity, and will support the organisation linked to the industrial systems.

By creating a transnational strategic partnership, built on different contexts and experiences across Europe, it will create a framework for the exchange of ideas and approaches and develop a Toolkit of resources for speculative design education. In the context of rapidly shifting social, technological, media and economic conditions an increasing number of designers are developing new approaches to design. These \u201cnew designers\u201d act on the borders of traditionally defined disciplines, blurring the distinctions between them. In their research, these new designers engage with diverse fields of science, primarily computer sciences and engineering, sociology, psychology, architecture, biotechnology, nanotechnology, etc., with the goal of critically reflecting on the development and role of technology in society. \r\nSpeculative design is the most significant example of these new design practices focused on \u201cproblem finding\u201d rather than \u201cproblem solving\u201d. It is a discursive practice, based on critical thinking and dialogue, which questions the practice of design. However, a speculative design approach takes critical practice one step further; towards new future imaginaries or alternative possible trajectories. Through a range of speculative methods, designers re-think alternative products, systems and worlds. Through its imagination and radical approach, speculative design forces one to think \u2013 raises awareness, provokes action, initiates discussions and perhaps even offers some alternatives that are essential for the world of today, and more importantly, the world of tomorrow.\r\nMain target audiences are educational institutions and PhD and master students (also bachelor) which are interested in investigating relationships between people, society and technology. However, speculative practice has a broader reach and influence. Namely, speculative design could be seen as a tool for society related practices which are important in raising awareness, initiating discussions but also taking actions, outside exclusively design context. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in speculative approaches within the wider design community that reveals the need for new designers in the industrial sector, i.e., in companies employing designers to consider scenarios for future trends and research into the adoption of emerging technologies.\r\nAlthough there are existing speculative design educational programs, regular educational practice is often slow to embrace new approaches and methodologies. There is a need for stronger institutional collaboration in strengthening these novel design educational approaches outside the regular curriculum (educational process). Multinational, multi-partner collaboration offers great context for developing, testing and disseminating novel educational content. In the regular teaching process, there is not often a chance to test new ideas and tools within an intensive context. From educational practice we experience an urgent need for a collection of resources related to this approach, accompanied by further reflective analysis and development. These resources, systematically structured and disseminated, could offer students new design skills for the 21st century, reflexive and critical toward their own practice in order to go beyond the limits of design definitions and to re-think the role of design and designers in today's society.\r\nThe main objectives of this project are:\r\n- to collect, exchange, reflect upon, develop and advance educational practice in the area of speculative design;\r\n- to create new (and strengthen existing) partnerships in the field of speculative design education with particular emphasis on forging interactions between designers and experts from other related disciplines;\r\n- to support and consolidate speculative design education;\r\n- to promote speculative design as educational approach and mode of critical thinking (to academic and broader audience outside design context).\r\nProject will organise these three events:\r\n- open discussion with experts (multiplier event);\r\n- international students workshop (multiplier event);\r\n- symposium (multiplier event with exhibition and final dissemination workshop).\r\nProject is going to produce three outcomes:\r\n- State of the Speculative Design Study: study will describe the current landscape of speculative design and related design practices at the European level - collection of best practices and case-studies;\r\n- Speculative Design Textbook: textbook for students but also practitioners, based on the Outcome 1 and reflections/evaluations from the discussion and the workshop.\r\n- Speculative Design Open Toolkit: open access online repository based on the Outcome 1 and 2 \u2014 to be freely used and maintained by the speculative design communities and networks.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HR01-KA203-047427_1"], [2015, "Creative Primary School Partnerships with Visual Artists", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 189027.0, 6, 7, "Teaching and learning in and through visual arts tend to simulate everyday life, connect school life to real-world issues, engage children in meaningful learning processes and provide in-depth experiences.

Furthermore, students\u2019 interactions with artists\u2019 processes offer a creative space for exploration with media and techniques, ideas, concepts and issues. \r\n\r\nThe proposed CREARTE project focuses on the establishment of creative partnerships between primary schools and visual artists in the framework of visual arts education. It draws upon the priority areas of the ET 2020 process and the target for reducing school drop-out rates, offering an alternative literacy for children of the age of 6-12 to get involved in experiential and cooperative learning by working with visual artists that could act, in this way, as significant role models to inspire creativity. Children's experiences from such cooperations could be transformative, leading also to the ET 2020 objectives for \"improving the quality and efficiency of education and training\" and \"enhancing creativity and innovation\". CREARTE also aims to meet the priority of strengthening the profile, leadership and research role of the teaching professions by providing teachers with new methods, tools and resources so as to design collaborative projects that meet the needs of their students. Additionally the project aims to strengthen education and training paths of educators by delivering high quality training to in-service teachers and build effective partnerships between training providers (advisors, academics, trainers), educational institutions (pedagogical institutes, universities) and policy makers (inspectors at the Ministry, European Chapter of an international association). The project's direct participants consist of 28 experienced educators from 5 countries (Portugal, Spain, UK, Cyprus, Sweden) that are professionally involved with visual arts education for many years. They teach at various levels (universities, in-service professional development, primary schools) or are policy makers. Most of them have participated in EU projects in the past, are involved in academic writing and curriculum development, and belong to visual arts organisations. A number of them hold doctorate degrees and some are visual artists as well. \r\n\r\nAs a number of EU visual arts curricula encourage cooperations with visual artists, CREARTE suggests the development of a European network of professionals that will facilitate the construction of partnerships between primary schools and visual artists' communities. To achieve this, it is proposed to establish a network that will:\r\n- develop communication channels and foster professional enhancement for the design and exchange of good practices that involve primary school partnerships with visual artists\r\n- establish cooperation between educators, students and visual artists through the development and implementation of school programmes in the framework of visual arts education\r\n- develop OER produced during and after the conclusion of the project\r\n- design an online artists\u2019 database that will serve as a resource and contact point for schools and artists seeking cooperation across Europe\r\n- design a professional development course that will be offered through Key Action 1.\r\n\r\nCREARTE targets to primary school teachers of the involved countries, as well as teachers of the rest of Europe and the world.

The separation between Anglophone and Francophone literatures, and between classical and contemporary literary and cultural studies are examples of how connections can be lost.  \u2018Mediterranean Imaginaries: Literature, Arts, Culture\u2019 presents the particular space of this sea as an area of study, thereby providing a platform where scholars with different specialisations can meet.  The Intensive Study Programme (ISP) is highly innovative in studying not only how literature and other art forms are produced in the Mediterranean, but also how the Mediterranean has been represented and \u201cproduced\u201d by other \u201cNorth European\u201d cultures, historically and more recently. The ISP takes account of very recent literature and films that feature current forms of migration as well as developments on the Southern Mediterranean shores (the so-called \u201cArab spring\u201d and the recent waves of migration ), and their representation. The two week ISP  features lectures given by specialists in the field and these are followed by all the students. While attending all the lectures and their discussion, the specialist workshops,  organised in two series co-ordinated by the academic advisers to the project, allow students to choose between the two different workshop series, so that  students can achieve more focused specialisation on particular areas of the curriculum. Seminar A concentrates  on classical representations of the Mediterranean while Seminar B has a more contemporary focus. The students all attend a number of joint seminars (A+B) that allow them to share learning and research. Students from Malta, Goldsmiths, Nova Gorica, Minho, Cagliari, Florence and Carthage will benefit from the large pool of experts lecturing in the Intensive Study Programme. Students will achieve knowledge of a range of texts and films representing aspects of the Mediterranean, they will learn to identify literature and cultures from different periods and different areas, as well as influences between texts. Students will study how different works construct Mediterranean culture, history  or geography, how cultural encounters, clashes or exchanges are represented in various texts, and how these, in turn, impact on their national literatures.The syllabus of \u2018Mediterranean Imaginaries: Literature, Arts, Culture\u2019  enables students who are at a distance from the Mediterranean sea to study literature and culture from this region. The topic will draw scholars and students working in comparative, Anglophone and Francophone literary studies as well as others from disciplines such as history , cultural studies, film studies, visual arts, and philosophy, thus presenting a strong multidisciplinary approach. Through the ISP,  important cross-cultural perspectives and opinions will be shared amongst participants and students. This would not be possible if the module was run separately at the 7 universities. The follow-up events  - the post-graduate conferences organized by the UOM's Department of English - at the end of the ISP in  2017 and 2018  give opportunities to all the students to present their collaborative work to a wider audience. As these conferences will also include  literature culture related to the Mediterranean, the students extend their knowledge of  these subjects even further. The follow-up events in London in June 2017 and 2018 again call for collaborative work from all the students. The work will be presented by 4 of the Maltese students and by the 6  Goldsmiths students who have attended the ISP at the conference of the London Intercollegiate Network for Comparative Studies or of the Goldsmiths Literature Seminar. As the Maltese students do not benefit from mobility for the ISP,  it is appropriate that they should have the opportunity to go to London to work in a different academic environment.The Strategic Partnership as a whole widens the horizons of the students and academics taking part and makes them more aware of the wealth of knowledge on Mediterranean affairs harboured in 6 European and 1 North African university.

In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?

Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.  They will also form the foundation of our final year training event  following our last transnational meeting\u2014a trial run for an ongoing in-service course offer for school staff across Europe, to be offered year on year following the project's end.  This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.  This will initially be within the organizations in the partnership, but over the life of this project, should spread locally via local dissemination activities and finally, across a wider European area as the end products are disseminated via our ongoing delivery of our  European in-service course for school staff.  \r\n\r\nMethodology  will be scientific and rigorously tested.   Meanwhile, the results of our project will be apparent early on in the practice of  the institutions collaborating.  Curriculum changes in our partner Universities and a whole school focus on Pupil Health in our partner schools will  develop rapidly.  Longer term change in other institutions and regions will cascade for many years as future (and current) teachers benefit from the training developed and the innovative and inclusive approach to whole school engagement with Health and Well - Being which we believe our focus and our end product outcomes will support.", "http://www.clubpulsegoldsmiths.co.uk", "John Donne Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013732_1"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 123212.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047207_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 92271.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-036033_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 74018.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023618_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 68139.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000373_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 67915.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012620_coordinator"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 49397.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
