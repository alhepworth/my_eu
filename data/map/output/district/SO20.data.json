Bathymetry is the measure of the water depth similar to underwater topography. BASE-platform has the ambition to establish a commercial service platform for bathymetric data, which is sharpened to user needs and provides most easy access. Its impact is expected to significantly influence the current market, its survey methodologies and the way bathymetric data can be accessed and used. \n\nUp-to date bathymetric data are essential for multiple purposes such as navigation, port and offshore construction, security, coastal zone management, fishery, cruising and tourism and required accordingly by various user groups. Conventional survey methods are either ship or airplane based and costly and time consuming. For these reasons, extended areas of shallow and deep water areas in Europe and worldwide are not mapped within an adequate accuracy or existing data are out of date. \nEarth Observation data, especially the Copernicus mission will play a key role to overcome this lack of data. BASE-platform focuses on Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) as an innovative, rapid and cost effective approach to determine bathymetry from space. SDB in combination with hydrodynamic models to minimize tidal effects and crowd sourced bathymetric for validation purposes will provide those data. The BASE-platform service will be accessible through a commercial platform, which includes relevant components for a sustainable and client focused business. The services will be demonstrated, validated and improved in use cases. Relevant key players are involved for this purpose. \nThe economic benefits of this new EO service will be analysed in a business analysis and model. Finally several dissemination actions will race awareness and increase the potential client group.", 231423.0, 1854221.0, 4, 7, "BASE-platform", null, "http://www.smartcomsoftware.com", null, "h2020_200490_996283315"], [1388534400000, 1514678400000, "Synergistic Fouling Control Technologies", "Smartcom Software Ltd", "Marine biofouling, the unwanted colonization of marine organisms on surfaces immersed in seawater has a huge economic and environmental impact in terms of maintenance requirements for marine structures, increased vessel fuel consumption, operating costs, greenhouse gas emissions and spread of non-indigenous species. The SEAFRONT project will aim to significantly advance the control of biofouling and reduce hydrodynamic drag by integrating multiple technology concepts such as surface structure, surface chemistry and bio-active/bio-based fouling control methodologies into one environmentally benign and drag-reducing solution for mobile and stationary maritime applications. In parallel, a combination of laboratory-based performance benchmarking and end-user field trials will be undertaken in order to develop an enhanced fundamental/mechanistic understanding of the coating-biofouling interaction, the impact of this on hydrodynamic drag and to inform technology development and down-selection of promising fouling control solutions. This project aims to facilitate a leap forward in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from marine transport and the conservation of the marine ecosystem by adopting a multidisciplinary and synergistic approach to fouling control.", 200597.0, 9062818.0, 8, 19, "SEAFRONT", null, "http://www.smartcomsoftware.com", null, "fp7_111293_996283315"], [1260748800000, 1323734400000, "Coastal Surveying of Depths with EGNOS to Enhance Charts", "Smartcom Software Ltd", "The objective of the project is to create a system for enhanced surveying of coastal waters through using standard navigation equipment, as an alternative to the standard approach of using specialist Hydrographic surveyors and high precision instruments. Instead, we use a large amount of data logged by vessels carrying out their normal business, and later uploaded to our server for processing. By using a large amount of data, the errors from using less accurate instruments can be remoed. We believe this can be developed to provide a cost effective system that will enable much of the shortfall in surveys to be made up.\nThe benefits of this are safer navigation to all vessels in coastal waters, in particular to the leisure, fishing and workboat sectors, and also greater information for the GIS community, coastal engineers, port, harbour and waterway authorities, and applications such as tide power or offshore wind farms.\nThe system will use GPS receivers equipped with EGNOS to provide the required level of positional accuracy, and will use statistical techniques to remove errors from depth measurements from echo sounders that cannot otherwise be resolved.\nThe data logged will be available both as survey data and as chart data. It will be made available in the IHO S-100 format, which is suited to chart creation by Hydrographic Offices and to the wider GIS community, including use in OGC Web Map Servers and Web Feature Servers.", 159006.0, 395269.0, 3, 4, "COSUDEC", null, "http://www.smartcomsoftware.com", null, "fp7_206633_996283315"]]}}}}
