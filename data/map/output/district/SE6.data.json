The two foreign languages taught in the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool are English and French. The first foreign language is taught within two hours a week during the four years of highschool, the second language is given, beginning with the superior cycle, which is from the 11th and 12th grades, only one hour of study. The students who choose to take the certificate which allows them to teach the foreign language (they may choose the first and/or the second foreign language, or both of them) are allocated, according to the present curriculum, only half an hour. This means that during one half an hour a week of pedagogical practice we must achieve the teaching of the foreign language didactics (French or English) as well as the accomplishment of the foreign language practice stage. Therefore, it is obvious that the foreign languages teachers, methodologists of the pedagogical practice, make huge efforts to raise the students\u2019 language level within 2 hours or even one a week, same time which is also allocated for teaching the foreign language didactics.  This project was designed as a consequence of our needs, thouroughly analysed and researched, and it aims at completing students\u2019 education in the field of acquiring linguistic knowledge, abilities and competences in order to teach foreign languages at primary level, education which cannot be achieved under best circumstances currently, at the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, only because of the allocated time of teaching within the present curriculum (half an hour a week) for the pedagogical practice and the teaching of the foreign language methodology.    The objectives of this project are the following:1. To acquire specific methods and strategies of teaching-learning the foreign languages at primary level: teaching the vocabulary items, the phonetics, the grammar, the communicative structures. 2. To develop the competence of speaking and writing in the foreign language, of socially interaction with the pupils. 3. To develop the competence of writing the didactic project in the foreign language, according to the curriculum and the study level.  4. To develop the competence of intercultural communication in professional context. The target group is made up of 32 students of the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, pedagogical profile from 10th and 11th grades, registered at pedagogical practice of a foreign language, who are going to take the foreign language certificate for teaching at primary level, at the end of 12th grade.  The certificate of foreign language teaching at primary level is taken, each year, by students who choose either French or English. Thus, the project takes into account the students\u2019 training for the two languages: a first flow of 16 students for english and a second flow of students for taking the french certificate. In order to accomplish these objectives, the students will perform the following activities:1. Acquiring the foreign language methods and strategies of teaching at primary level: teaching the phonetics, the vocabulary, the communicative structures by solving the work tasks during the training. 2. Taking actively part to workshops, having as themes methods and strategies of teaching foreign  languages at primary level.  3. Noticing and writing down in their training notebook the demands expressed by the teacher using the foreign language, the social interaction phrases in the classroom, during  watching the lessons at primary level.  4. Writing the didactic projects for different activities using the foreign language. 5. Performing a lesson sequence using the foreign language.  The students will speak and write in the foreign language under authentic learning contexts. During the first week, they will acquire foreign language teaching methods and strategies in the group workshops, they will have the opportunity to practice their knowledge by making didactic projects and solving practical tasks.  During the second week, they will have a practical stage at primary schools, where they will watch the foreign language activities, they will make up didactic projects and they will perform sequences of foreign language activities, they will interact with the pupils, the tutor and the mentor using the foreign language. The results of this project concern the development of knowledge, abilities and competences to teach a foreign language at primary level, for a group of 32 students.

We will encourage young people to become active members  of their community and develop awareness of their urban spaces and their local context using creative, collaborative and imaginative spatial symbolism in their art expression. The project will also consider the wider perspective of European citizenship and community engagement and sharing of methods and ideas by young people and the role they play in their one communities. By offering them  framework for self-reflection, we aim to encourage and support active and positive engagement with urban space, as well as future employment and self-employment.\r\nThe project aims to strengthen involvement and will allow young people to creatively experiment their art in urban space while allowing them to identify common spatial values of their community.  We will ask our participants to consider the idea of sustainable community development, to demonstrate the essential elements of  their neighborhood now, and  then to imagine how it could look like in fifty years from now. Participants will be asked to share their experiences of co working and collaboration in arts, urban sports and cultural activities. The project will also create a platform for each national group to address these topics at a local level, as well as within a European context. The project will support peer to peer learning and mentoring by creative and cultural professionals.

First workshop is photo, sound and street art  organized by UK partners. Young people will use their mobile phones to record, photograph and film a visual map/landscape of designated urban spaces. In this way they will develop IT skills.\r\nSecond workshop will be organized by Croatia with sensory mapping and model expression. Young people will discover Zagreb and will give us their viewpoint, their thinking by the mapping which will use their feelings and their senses. As new architects, they will give us their vision of a dreamed urban space with this work of model making. In this workshop we will develop their social skills as well as language skills.\r\nThird workshop will be organized by France and will include photography, video making & editing. Participants will be supported to develop their thinking around urban clusters by seeing the city from a different perspective and  problem solving as well as innovation in the development of their visual ideas.
