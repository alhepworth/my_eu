The gold standard in clinical diagnostics is based on the cultivation of bacteria and their phenotypical characterisation. However, these methods are labour-intensive and time-consuming lasting in some cases up to a few weeks. Thus, faster diagnostic techniques are necessary to ensure an immediate and targeted treatment of the patient. DNA-based diagnostics can provide the relevant results within a few hours.\nThe requirements for a clinical DNA-based characterisation method are high; more than 1000 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, a few hundred phylogenetic marker genes and virulence factors have to be targeted (including SNP detection). The limit of detection has to be low because a few 100 bacterial cells in the blood system can lead to the death of the patient. It should be possible to analyse a wide range of clinical sample origins such as stool, blood, urine and saliva using the same test. In addition, the results have to be obtained within a single working day. \nIn our project, we will develop two diagnostic systems that can be with direct sample material from patients. Thus, the time-consuming cultivation of pathogens will be avoided. Additionally, the test will be more sensitive, specific and faster than any other test on the market using an innovative DNA probe concept.", 651350.0, 5037018.0, 7, 10, "FAPIC", null, null, null, "h2020_193272_938693542"]]}}, "4DT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "F\u00f6rderung der Europakompetenz der Sch\u00fclerinnen und Sch\u00fcler in der Aus- und Weiterbildung als Teil der Europaschule", "Menter Fachwen", 14417.0, 5, 9, "The project \u201eAdvancement of European competence of students in vocational education and training as part of being at a European school\u201d is supposed to set the course for the future work of our school in respect of enabling more students to pass part of their training in a foreign country. The contacts gained and experiences made within this project shall be the foundation for other projects within different departments and types of educational qualifications which are offered at our school. This project is based on experiences that have already been gained in running and previously executed European activities but is also supposed to be a pilot project for the delegation of students, doing an apprenticeship or further education, to foreign countries. What must be organized beforehand? How are the students to be prepared? Which partners and what kind of support is required? How are mobilities organized and executed? How are students taken care of and coached? How can the experiences made be included into the daily life at school and at work? How are the mobilities going to be evaluated and deliberated? How can consequences be drawn and how can processes be optimized for following projects? All these are questions which can\u2019t be answered but during and after the project and which are intended to lay the foundation for all coming activities which are concerned with sending trainees to a foreign country as part of their regular formation \r\nThe set up of this project is in its third year still rather small but growing.  After the positive experiences of this year's project it is carefully extended by including students of our school for curative pedagogy. \r\nThose participants going to a country where a second language is needed have already proven to have acquired a fundamental knowledge of English. All possess good professional and personal skills and have already shown interest in projects of this kind. Here in Germany they are going to be prepared profoundly within the areas of self-awareness, cultural knowledge, professional skills and language and communication competencies. They learn, in collaboration with the foreign partner institutions and enterprises, to independently live and work in a foreign country and are going to acquire personal and professional skills and faculties as well as new language knowledge.   The project is going to be executed in close collaboration and coordination of all involved parties (apprentices, their employers, foreign partner institutions and cooperating enterprises as well as our school). For the exchange of information, especially for the communication with our foreign partners, modern communication devices and platforms such as Etwinnings are going to be used. A special focus is on avoiding disadvantages of any kind for the involved parties. Everybody will benefit by this project and all requirements of the concerned institutions and individuals will be taken into consideration. This includes aspects such as insurances, boarding and accommodation as well as travelling. All these points have already been thought about and are organized or prepared. Partnership mandates or a Memorandum of Understanding is going to be agreed on and signed by all partners. This obligates all institutes to do everything they can to organize, execute and evaluate this project. By the usage of Etwinnings and Email communication is going to be institutionalized so that a permanent exchange about the development of the trainees is secured. The process is going to be monitored permanently and evaluated at the end. This will mainly happen by the students\u2019 reports, questionnaires and SWOT analyses. During the placements, contact will be held by Etwinnings but also email and telephone are possible means of communication to be able to act quickly and be able to react spontaneously in cases of emergencies.  Extremely important for the success of a mobility is its preparation. These are going to be mainly proceeded by the employees of the vocational school in Oldenburg. The short-, middle- and long-term results are going to be most fundamental for the trainees concerned. Through the vast extension of social and professional competences as well as the development of further language and cultural skills this is going to have a huge direct and long-lasting impact on many aspects of their future personal and professional lives. The experiences made will also result in an enormously high additional value for the concerned institutions which is going to have consequences which reach far into the future and will give the opportunity to many more apprentices to collect experiences in foreign countries for being more open for Europe and to gain better career opportunities on the European labour market.", "http://www.menterfachwen.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003808_6"]]}}}}
