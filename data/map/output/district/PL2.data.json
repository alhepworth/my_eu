Our school is situated in a deprived area, and so many of our learners have never had the chance to experience another culture or language. Our project aims to broaden the horizons for these pupils. Our project has clear objectives. Firstly, we intend to raise the confidence in the delivery of Spanish in our school. Despite many courses having been attended, the majority of teachers in our school still struggle with  the teaching of Spanish, citing it as being the subject that they are least confident in teaching. This is due to a range of factors including their own Spanish speaking ability, as well as lack of ideas in how to make Spanish lessons as enriching as possible. The second aim of the project is to provide teachers with pedagogy, skills and ideas that will enable to school to adapt the curriculum and the way in which we teach MFL. By providing a more enriching curriculum, rather than following a scheme as we currently do, we hope that children will be inspired by the new immersive way of learning. Our next objective is to provide children with a greater understanding of other cultures. Through members of staff visiting Spain, we can roll out a school wide focus on exploring the Spanish culture. We hope to provide our learners and the community new experiences and understanding of different cultures and to raise aspirations. Finally, we hope to extend our new learning and share best practice, not only across our own school but with other schools in our trust. The project will involve a 5 day trip to Spain. This trip is clearly structured and ensures that our time in Spain is used most effectively. The project will focus on sessions to improve language and cultural knowledge through evaluation of teaching techniques and methodology. This will focus on constructing sentences using familiar vocabulary, addressing how to encourage learners to produce spontaneous language, story telling and books to promote cultural understanding and reading skills, using ICT and other materials including short and long films as a didactic resource, using songs to develop listening and comprehension skills and exploring how art work can be used to develop language and writing skills. As well as this, the course will offer the opportunity to visit local schools to observe best practice, networking opportunities, meeting and sharing ideas with other participants from the UK and exploring the local area. The participants will be 2 teachers from the school who teach Spanish weekly. They will be teachers who are identified as lacking in confidence and being the most receptive to the training opportunities provided. Alongside this, we will be ensuring that those who are selected will be the most suitable candidates to deliver training to our school and our trust schools upon return and oversee the implementation of a new, immersive modern foreign language curiculum delivery. During the project, participants will be completing daily reflections on their learning and any new skills acquired, and upon return to the United Kingdom, will be completing a Europass Mobility form to ensure that all new skills and evidence of this is documented more officially. We envisage the project having a great impact on the teaching and learning of Spanish in our school. We expect to see an impact with the participants themselves, who will become much more confident in their understanding and delivery of the teaching of Spanish and it's application within the school. Delivery of their learning to the rest of the school staff, both teaching and support staff will ensure that there is an understanding of the teaching of modern foreign languages and that new ideas, pedagogy and curriculum coverage can be implemented throughout the school.  This in turn will lead to greater Spanish learning in our organisation and a school of learners who are confident and excited Spanish speakers. This will be achieved through the new ideas and the new immersive curriculum that will be extended in the school.  We hope to see the impact on the local community and also on the wider school. We hope to encourage an understanding and acceptance of other cultures, as well as a curiosity that we hope will be harboured by our pupils and by extension the local community to extend themselves further than the perimeters of the city that they already know. We have a great vision for the long term. We envisage our pupils being confident Spanish speakers who are excited to learn a new language. Most importantly, we are aiming to have a school of learners who have had their aspirations raised and their understanding and curiosity of the world widened. We hope to raise a school, and Trust, of internationally minded children with enriching and varied future careers.", "http://www.westonmill.plymouth.sch.uk/website", "Weston Mill Community Primary Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023252_coordinator"]]}}, "3DL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "SOCIAL ENTERPRISE EUROPE (THROUGH HEALTHY LIFESTYLE)", "DEVONPORT HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS", 117689.0, 3, 3, "The SEE partnership developed in part from a previous Comenius multilateral project and from an eTwinning website partner search, to establish a balance between experience, fresh ideas and a variety of cultural and educational backgrounds.  The plan  to create a platform where students will set up a social enterprise company, will raise awareness of business opportunities across Europe & develop the necessary skills for employment using face-to-face or video conferencing interviews, visits to relevant companies/organisations,  surveys etc.   After consultation across the three schools it has been decided to work on a theme of Healthy Lifestyle for the social enterprise company.  Each school will head up a department of the SE company with a board of management involving student leaders and staff from each department/school., so that discussions, research, meetings and activities will be continuously interdependent and transnational.   As well as looking at enterprise both commercial and social, with their relevant aims, the project will raise awareness of entrepreneurship skills for those who chose to be self-employed.  In this way students and staff will have a clearer idea of the whole process of enterprise learning and adopting this in a practical environment - creating ideas, team work, implementation, monitoring progress & assessing effectiveness & dissemination.  With a developed sense of the different types of enterprise and therefore employment opportunities, students in particular will gain a greater knowledge base from which to pursue their future careers in the wider European market.  \r\nEach partner school will research a particular type of enterprise locally & compare with similar enterprises in the other three countries, depending on the focus and priority as the project develops.  During mobilities the host school/company will organise an Enterprise Fair and project Exhibition where they will invite speakers from a local/international business and employers' organisations such as Chamber of Commerce, and social & commercial entrepreneurs to speak about their companies, the skills, qualifications and cultural differences.  In this way the company, SEE,  would build up a data base about the skills, qualifications & workforce in all 3 partners countries, through the initial research carried out to lead into the functions of the Social Enterprise project based on Healthy Lifestyle.  On another level, students could use the links with partner companies/organisations to learn how to prepare themselves for interview and record role plays where they show how to and how not to prepare.   As a social enterprise company, involved in charitable work dealing with the socially disadvantage, unemployed, the elderly etc. it will also highlight how one can reconcile ethics & commercialism particularly in market research on Healthy Eating - again providing students with a choice of future career paths.  During the interactions between schools staff will learn about adapting teaching methods which are more in line with the world of future business through videos, interviews & teacher team work and positive and controlled use of ICT/social networking as developed by the students eg. blogs, Skype, email and video-conferencing.\r\nOn a practical level students will collaborate to produce a company logo, a mission statement, to discuss company policies, and where necessary to produce video clips on these - e.g. hiring, training and firing employees.  Apart from the Enterprise Fairs they will also organise on-line debates about the value of an ethical focus in both social and commercial businesses taking into account local culture and background.  Where possible students will also tailor their work experience placements which is part of the school curriculum, to feed into the project so that everyone gains from these experiences.\r\nThe activities will be planned over 24 months including setting up a project website to showcase the development of the project, operating regularly on Twinspace to record the outcomes of meetings and discussions.  Each mobility would involve 3 schools with approx. 12 students and 2 teachers from each visiting school visiting a host school for a period of 10 days  and during that time there will be events such as workshops, interview and career surgeries, opportunities to share expertise and upgrade skills.  Included in the programme will be an opportunity to effect some charity work (social enterprise) for disadvantaged people, workshops, visits to local/national enterprises, interview techniques, mock interviews etc", "http://www.devonportgirls.plymouth.sch.uk", "DEVONPORT HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013523_coordinator"], [2015, "The Magic of Sound", "DEVONPORT HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS", 80274.0, 4, 4, "The partners are four grammar schools from Germany (Neus\u00e4\u00df), Romania (Arad), United Kingdom (Plymouth) and Croatia (Zagreb), among the best in their countries.\r\nWe want to create and test the \"Ode to Joy of Science and Art\", as an example of teaching/learning materials which will make education more interesting for all, even for less motivated students with lower achievement. It comes from the existing curricula of all participating schools, so it will be applicable in different EU countries, independent of their school systems, and it will be shared and further developed on a broad base.\r\nAs ICT has a great potential in enrichment of ways of teaching and learning and making them more efficient, we want to get a full advantage of it. We generally want to enhance digital integration in learning and teaching.\r\nWe chose sound as a topic because we found that it can be perfectly integrated in the subject curricula of physics, mathematics, music, languages, biology, history and psychology in all four countries. Our organizing the sub-topics in four groups around the main subjects (Magic of Music, Sounds in Nature, Sounds of Europe, Theory of Sound) allows us to establish a good basis for the exemplary interdisciplinary teaching. Finally we will show the techniques and examples to recombine the materials and give the teaching an arbitrary context, according to teacher wishes and student needs. Magic arises from sudden understanding of apparently totally different points of view, all describing the same thing and presenting the same truth but only when put together inevitably giving deeper insight. The activities are so designed that even prejudices about physics and mathematics being absolutely rational can be broken as they are connected to emotional experience.\r\nThe point of the project is not only to give strategies of teaching to reach the objectives in all covered subject, but more to present strategies how to give simultaneously our students deeper insight in the global image and provide them with the tools to interconnect their knowledge and apply it in different fields, which is still one of the biggest problems in education.\r\nEach context will be approached through the same implementation phases. In each phase we will organize particular learning activities which will help in gathering corresponding knowledge and skills to be used. In Zagreb the curricula and strategies will be examined in more details, the necessary ICT knowledge will be exchanged and acquired, academic honesty will be discussed. In Plymouth the communication skills will be discussed in more details, using different media to communicate and collaborate (deepening of ICT skills addressed in Zagreb and solving possible problems). The next phase (Neus\u00e4\u00df) stresses dispute settling and coordination of ideas, putting ideas together to produce the new quality, going in the direction of interdisciplinary teaching and learning, which will be fully addressed in the last such session in Arad.\r\nOne part of the learning activities will be connected to the collection of materials needed for specific contexts, exploring of cultural differences and similarities and employment possibilities and one part will cover general knowledge and skills needed independent on the context. The knowledge and skills acquired in these activities will be disseminated, developed and applied in the work according to the project objectives and individual responsibilities at home in individual schools. Our activities will include visits to relevant institutions, factories and other places of interest, as well as presentations of cultural heritage connected to the project. It will allow students to see the opportunities for future employment within the EU in the context and in the same time to realize that being a part of Europe does not mean losing their identity, but can enhance it in positive way.\r\nEvaluation activities will be implemented during the project meetings, which will be used to discuss, evaluate, modify and finalize the prepared materials. We expect new ideas to be born and followed during these activities.\r\nWe will end our project with the big international exhibition \"The Magic of Sound-Ode to Joy of Science and Art\" in Zagreb and the section of International Mathematical Conference with the same name in Arad, with promotion of our new methods and materials, and by the general evaluation and sustainability reflection meeting in Plymouth.\r\nPossible trans-national discussions and exchange of best practice will support not only teachers' competencies but as well their enthusiasm and encourage the further development and implementation of modern, intriguing and innovative teaching/learning methods on all levels. On e-Twinning and other collaborative platforms (OER) students and teachers will be able to learn, discuss, co-create materials and exchange the examples after the project has been finished. The materials and experiences will be included in the taught curricula.", "http://www.devonportgirls.plymouth.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HR01-KA219-013043_2"]]}}}}
