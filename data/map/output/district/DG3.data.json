By having them work together in mixed groups on joint subjects, and by incorporating the help of universities, high schools and commercial companies, by developing digital, language and social skills we want to orient the students towards an enhanced entrepreneurship in order to prepare them for their future studies and jobs. We will research the current situation of the well-being, living and working conditions in schools in the different countries involved. We will research the potential opportunities for young people of studying and working abroad with a view to promoting mobility within a united Europe. By enhancing the responsibility of the students for their own learning we want to promote leadership, entrepreneurship, creativity and life orientation in a process of mutual collaboration. The project will give the students the experience that working as an international team facilitates better results than working alone. \r\nWe will promote  problem-based learning: groups of students are given well defined tasks to solve; by establishing this project we will have students from different backgrounds and experiences (rural vs. city, countries with different teaching methods, school systems, history and background, different ways of coping with learning and behavioral disorders) meet and work together in an international context. Working across borders in mixed groups will be quintessential to this project, as its very aim is to step away from the classic teaching method to a more project-oriented open space .\r\nAmongst other things we will provide practical and realistic learning environments by including the students into the planning of a new school building for the Belgian partner school and by inventing a new type of wind turbine for the German partner school. The students will have to research the different topics involved in the project in all partner countries and then work together in transnational groups to set up a working plan for their field of focus. They will have to set up business groups and each group will focus on one aspect that directly corresponds to the building projects at hand. They will get support from professionals in the fields they are working on in order to complete their part of the project. Their ideas will be incorporated in the final stage of the school building and the wind turbine.\r\nThe focus on MINT-skills and the incorporation of ICT in the approach to the project will further heighten the students\u2019 focus on working in mixed groups towards a joint outcome, a system they will need a lot in their future studies and career. This new focus  alters the role of teachers and the need for non-formal education furthermore corresponds to changed curricula and different approaches in focus in the different countries involved. As we are going to cover a variety of topics with different approaches from building models to setting up a business plan all students willing to take part can be included into the project regardless of their grades. We aim to increase their motivation for their daily work by exposing them to new ways of learning and working together.\r\nThe students will experience the European dimension by working together with different people from different countries towards a common goal. Another positive impact is that they will learn about the culture of the host country - not as tourists do by watching from the outside- but as an integrated member of this society while living in the host family. The students will learn to cope with individual challenges and will gain a better understanding and responsiveness to social and cultural diversity. So their social skills will be developed in addition to the improvement of their language and digital skills.\r\nThe teachers involved will get advanced training in corporate planning, terminology, marketing and  digital competences, all of which they can disseminate amongst their colleagues and furthermore train others in their regular classes. The surroundings of the new school building in Belgium, built especially with a view to these altered teaching conditions, will focus on these new capabilities.\r\nEvery country involved was handpicked because of their relevance in the project, so students will have to travel to Estonia for a deeper look into the sociological aspect, to Germany for their knowledge on the ecological side, to Scotland for their expertise with wind energy and the inclusion of the Queensberry Initiative in their curriculum, to Belgium for their many links with business life and to Hungary for their expertise in the field of languages and entrepreneurial skills.\r\n\r\nThe number of the indirectly benefiting persons is quite high (2000) as the participants in the project will produce outcomes that will be used by the whole school communities e.g. the new school building (Belgium) and the wind turbine(Germany).", "http://www.walacehallacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013570_2"], [2015, "Schule als zentrale Institution f\u00fcr nachhaltige Bildung", "Wallace Hall Academy", 8813.0, 6, 7, "The new implemented year 10 + is meant to provide a link between the year 10 (General Certificate of Secondary Education) and the beginning of the advanced level education (year 11 and 12). This additional year is going to be split into modules to come to an improved individualization of teaching and learning.\r\nMany studies, e.g. the new Jako-o-Study 2014, show  a distinct dissatisfaction with the G8-system and all the dishonored promises that the political parties imposed on themselves when changing from G9 to G8.\r\nNone of the involved groups: students, parents, teachers, the educational unions as well as the receiving institutions like universities and academies of applied sciences, are able to recognize the formerly paraphrased outlines of that success model.\r\nThe consequences of this critically monitored reforming process are an increased number of early school drop outs, diffuse education biographies and an uncertainty felt by nearly everyone involved in the process. The background of that failed educational reform is where our \u201cOption 10+\u201d starts.\r\nThe aims for the students are amongst others:\r\n- reducing the number of school drop outs,\r\n- increasing competences on all levels necessary for higher education,\r\n- sovereignty and self confidence  for their personal plans for the future,\r\n- preparation for a successful life after leaving the school with the Abitur. \r\nFor the teachers the main aims will be:\r\n- improving the methods being used in classrooms,\r\n- modifying the traditional role of teaching,\r\n- benchmarking.\r\nThe aims for the organization/school are amongst others:\r\n- responsible handling of the educational biography of the students\r\n- enhancing the school's performance by reinvigorating good methods and by new implementation of constructive elements,\r\n- pedagogical diversity and potentials of education,\r\n- schools as a room of new learning experiences including non formal education such as special projects,\r\n- evaluation of educational biographies (G8 in the classical way versus G8 with the inclusion of the year 10+ as a modified way of learning).\r\n\r\nThere will be ten colleagues taking part in the training activities. Concerning the organization of teaching in modules we will send two colleagues to Iceland and Estonia for learning and training how to implement and modify the systems for the needs of our school (especially year 10+). Two colleagues from the school\u2019s management team will work together with members of the school management teams of the Belgian, Scottish and Estonian school for evaluating and guiding the process. Six teachers from the departments of social sciences, natural sciences and the artistic department will go to the partner schools in Scotland, England, Hungary and Belgium for team teaching experiences and to improve their linguistic skills in the subject they will be teaching  bilingually at our school. They will work on joint projects with their respective partners.\r\nTogether with our partners we will develop a program sequence which will be constantly evaluated. By using the GAP analysis readjustments will be made if necessary. It is of great importance for us that our partner schools will also benefit from the joint activities and that we as a group of European schools work towards the same standards. \r\nAfter the realization of the project we expect for the participants an improvement of their linguistic, organizational, methodical and digital competences. A further enhancement of the competences of teachers and students will be achieved by working with cross curricular and bilingual approaches in the modules.\r\nThe  participating teachers will be the multipliers for new methods and teaching approaches and thus all teachers will benefit from the implementation of a new role model for teaching. The results achieved for year 10+ will improve teaching at all ages in our school.\r\nWorking together with partner schools from all over Europe will not only allow a view beyond one\u2019s own nose but it will also bring Europe and European cooperation as a real and joint experience to everyone involved in the project. The results of the project will become part of the school\u2019s curriculum and thus be available in the future for all colleagues. We\u2019ll attach special importance to a sustainable development beyond the completion of the project for collaborating with our partner schools.\r\nThe focus is on a creative interpretation of educational barriers also defined as curricular guidelines;\r\nwe are discussing open and self defined arrangements for times and locations of education. The schools will be moving towards opening themselves in the direction of think tanks for innovative ideas and learning  and we are discussing the core of education,  the development of the system immanent power of self education of our students beyond the existing educational structures. Thus we will release the creativity and the innovational potential  within a successful and future orientated European Union.", "http://www.walacehallacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA101-013251_5"]]}}}}
