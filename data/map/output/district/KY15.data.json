In the past, a teacher was employed to teach French to all classes during RCCT.  However, due to changes in staffing as well as recommendations from Scottish Government in the delivery of the 1+2 programme this has resulted in the expectation that all class teachers deliver the programme regardless of their own language learning.  Therefore, the immersion courses will enhance pupil learning as staff willl be more confident in using French across the curriculum opposed to simply set lessons.\r\nIt has been highlighted on our 3 year school development plan that all staff should be implementing 1+2 language learning as indicated above.  Therefore, the immersion course will support all stakeholders in engaging in this programme.  At present, Lisa is involved in a group which includes all feeder schools and our local High School developing strategies to implement 1 +2 in a cohesive manner across the cluster group.  The immersion course, will enable Lisa to bring new insights into how 1+2 can move forward in all of our primary schools with a clear programme of study and suggested activities/resources to use.
