It will address lack of confidence, reduced motivation and a lack of appropriate qualifications. By bringing together best practice from organisations across Europe with a wide range of knowledge and experience in these areas, ARTS will explore how the arts can be used to overcome these barriers by providing accessible routes to learning and employment based on equality. The objectives of the project are to: \r\n\u2022 give recognition to the achievements of people who are disadvantaged through disability through the development of  a framework for a new and innovative accreditation tool which is accessible, relevant, transferable and equal to mainstream qualifications.\r\n\u2022 develop the evaluation and self-evaluation techniques required to measure and recognise skill development\r\n\u2022 provide training for adult education staff which will improve their skills and competencies\r\n\u2022 raise the profile of disadvantaged adults locally regionally and nationally\r\nThe project will target adults who have learning disability, mental health issues and/or life limiting health problems with the learners on the project being the adult educators who work with them.  \r\nThe project will adopt a methodology whereby all participants will work together through a series of creative arts workshops and activities gaining practical experience and knowledge. Learners will work with their groups in their own institutions, exploring and developing ideas generated.  The project will involve disadvantaged people at its core and will involve learning processes which  grow from an exploration of their differences and experiences. \r\nIn order to develop an accreditation framework we must first explore evaluation methodologies that allow people to see what they have learned through creative explorations.  The main vehicle for these explorations will be the transnational learning activities which will take place in each partner country. Each meeting will explore a different strand of evaluation and accreditation and will involve a combination of seminars, practical creative workshops, skill shops, focused conversation and evaluation.\r\nThe project will indirectly reach approximately 890 people (of which approximately 325 will have special needs) and will result in:\r\n\u2022 A framework for developing an accreditation which recognises the learning disadvantage adults in the arts.  The accreditation framework will form the basis for development of  a qualification that is accessible, relevant and equal to mainstream qualifications. The framework will be published on-line, and will be available in the languages of all partners and through their websites. In UK the framework will be adopted and accredited through One Awards (Open College Network) complementing an approach currently being developed to by the organisation to increase their capacity to offer lifelong learning to people.\r\n\u2022 A toolkit of resources and techniques available on DVD and online that will enable arts workers, disability workers and others to learn and develop techniques for evaluating, and facilitating the self-evaluating, of skills learned through practical arts activity, in such a format they can be measured and recognised.\r\nThe project will impact on a variety of levels:\r\n\u2022 enabling disadvantaged adults to be more active both within the partner organisations and within their communities\r\n\u2022 creating new opportunities for both learners and staff through the learning of new skills and working practices\r\n\u2022 developing the confidence and self-esteem of disadvantaged people, increase their motivation and understanding of what they can achieve.\r\n\u2022 adding value to the existing work of the participating organisations through exploring best practice, inspiring learning and motivating staff and learners and through the development of a European accreditation which will raise their profile within the local and regional community \r\n\u2022 challenging preconceptions of disadvantaged people\r\nThe project will embed new approaches in the partner organisations which will, through dissemination, cascade through other organisations bringing about longer term benefits to disability and arts organisations and disadvantaged people, and influencing policy makers.", "http://www.headwayarts.co.uk", "Headway Arts", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013736_coordinator"]]}}, "1DX": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTF", "Blyth Community Hospital", "nhs_RTFDX"]]}}, "1LZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1498867200000, 1656547200000, "Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal", "Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult", "In this flagship project, the EnFAIT (Enabling Future Arrays in Tidal) Team, a partnership of leading European companies, will demonstrate a grid-connected tidal energy array that: \n\n- demonstrates a step change in the lifetime cost of energy for tidal power; \n- proves that high array reliability & availability can be achieved with best practice maintenance regimes; \n- captures and disseminates substantial learning on fundamental issues for the ocean energy industry; \n- builds investor confidence; \n- takes a huge step towards creating a commercial, bankable tidal energy sector; and\n- at 6 turbines, will be the largest number of devices ever deployed in an ocean energy array. \n\nThis project will build upon an existing operational site, minimising development risk and allowing the generation of real-world results from day one.

Accordingly, strain selection will be governed by the growth rate, oil yield and lipid composition achieved under local conditions.\n\nThe project will select algae species and cultivation technologies to attain an algal oil with a suitable lipid profile for biodiesel production and will validate this selection through conversion of the extracted oil into biodiesel to meet standard specifications.\n\nThe sustainability of this demonstration, in terms of both economic and environmental (closed carbon loop) implications will be considered across the whole process;  including optimum use of algal biomass resources to enable commercialisation.\n\nThis project will closely address the requirements of Topic ENERGY.2010.3.4-1, aligning it to the wider European requirements recognised by the EC; to increase security of energy supply, specifically for transport use that can be readily integrated into existing vehicles and infrastructures from indigenous sources and, to help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", null, 7033801.0, 6, 11, "INTESUSAL", null, "http://www.narec.co.uk", null, "fp7_100473_998811620"], [1375315200000, 1469923200000, "Demonstration of methods and tools for the optimisation of operational reliability of large-scale industrial wind turbines", "Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult", "The power output from wind turbines has increased dramatically over the past thirty years from 50 kW to 6 MW, while 8-12 MW turbines are in the stage of design. State-of-the-art condition monitoring systems, such as vibration-based systems and temperature sensors, are able to monitor and evaluate the current condition of components of interest. Nonetheless, varying wind loads can result in the generation of false alarms or even misinterpretation of the data collected. In addition, commercially available condition monitoring systems offer no or very limited prognostics capability with regards to the remaining lifetime of a component before a serious fault occurs. Therefore evolution to predictive maintenance strategies is currently impossible. Experience has shown that by combining disparate data sources wind farm operators will be able to move from common reactive maintenance approach to a more cost effective risk-based operation and maintenance strategy with a high level of predictive maintenance scheduling. OPTIMUS will develop and demonstrate in the field novel methods and tools for prognosis of the remaining lifetime of key components based on data acquired by a cost-effective wind turbine condition monitoring system implemented by custom-designed dependable computing systems. This technology will reduce the total cost of energy and advance the deployment of large scale offshore and onshore wind energy by increasing availability and reducing downtime due to unplanned maintenance. Predictive maintenance will also reduce costs incurred from secondary damage to components and enable maintenance activities (and the associated costs) to be optimized with respect to forecast revenue from power generation.

We are located at 10 universities in the UK, France, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Israel. In addition, we have four partner universities in Canada, China, USA and France and 11 prestigious industry partners, mostly from Europe. We believe that our backgrounds and skills are sufficiently close so that we can (and do) communicate with ease, but also sufficiently distinct so that we can cover many aspects of this field, and hence (as a consortium) offer outstanding training to young researchers. We believe that this area will have a great impact on the technology of the future, as well as on our understanding of nature, and we are eager to train new\nscientists and engineers in this broad field. We believe that Science and Technology in Europe will greatly benefit from this research, and from the education and and knowledge that we will impart to a new generation of researchers.
