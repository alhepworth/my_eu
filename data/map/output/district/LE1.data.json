Common themes of expertise within the consortium apply to the fields of Traffic, Health and Environment (THE); the objective of the project is to apply this research base to achieve Intelligent Solutions for Sustaining Urban Economies. (ISSUE). This proposal truly addresses THE ISSUE.\nSeveral research areas are identified that deal directly with headline themes of this FP7 Call, namely:\n-transport impacts on urban mobility,\n-transport greening;\n-health, safety and security of citizens,\n-associated economic impacts.\n\nDiverse technologies and research applications will be brought to bear on the above issues, including:\n\u2022\tComputer intelligence solutions and real-time satellite navigation data integrated into existing operational urban traffic management systems.\n\u2022\tSpace and in-situ measurements to help mitigate risk to citizens\u2019 health from traffic-induced air pollution.\n\u2022\tTechnology demonstration and pre-operational real time trials of a hydrogen fuel cell powered car operating in a city environment (2012).\n\nTHE ISSUE programme will create a vibrant partnership of regional research clusters to bring together and coordinate already-existing and projected RTD programmes relevant to Traffic, Health and Environment both within the clusters and more widely in the broader European research community. In parallel, consultations will be held with participating regional and local authorities to identify economic priorities of those regions, specific to the themes of Traffic, Health and Environment. Tensioning RTD actions against regional economic objectives will be the next step. This approach paves the way to shape the application of research outputs towards delivery of regional strategies by developing a framework for coordinating research actions and exploitation. The coordination process requires proactive knowledge exchange between core partners through a focussed dissemination programme and a structured approach for mentoring and knowledge transfer to regions with less well developed research structures.\nThe core partners are East Midlands, UK, Mazovi Region, Poland, MOLISE REGION, Italy, Midi Pyrenees and Aquitaine regions, France. In each case we can identify active regional research clusters with programmes and expertise in relevant thematic areas. Each core partner can satisfy the \u201ctriple helix\u201d requirement. A wider network of new regional clusters will also be built up. Their regional representatives and research teams will be encouraged to participate in THE ISSUE\u2019s series of workshop and dissemination events and to become active partners in downstream RTD actions that THE ISSUE will be seeking to develop. Promotion of the new cluster programme will be facilitated, in part,  through nationally-based knowledge transfer and innovation networks as well as the transnational NEREUS regional network.\nThe expected outcome will be a Europe-wide research forward look and implementation plan for the exploitation and further development of relevant economy-driving, environmentally-sensitive traffic and transport initiatives for more sustainable transport economies in the cities, towns and regions of Europe.", 314907.0, 2643511.0, 4, 13, "THE ISSUE", null, "http://www.leicester.gov.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141124132438.jpg", "fp7_101329_962800467"], [1448928000000, 1575072000000, "Political and sOcial awareness on Water EnviRonmental challenges", "Leicester City Council", "POWER is a user-driven project to share knowledge and experience of water related issues in different EU local authorities to create a tool for EU water policy.

In 2010, the Riders formed a partnership with Charnwood Community College to provide the Charnwood Riders Academy, and became one of the first institutions in the UK to deliver the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) framework on behalf of Basketball England. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at the Charnwood Riders Academy. Working with Obradoiro in Spain, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the Charnwood Riders Academy programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be selected from the circa 50 (male and female) Apprentices undertaking the Charnwood Riders Academy programme in the 2015/16 academic year (i.e. the 2014 and 2015 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at Obradoiro, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Spanish youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nObradoiro has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable Leicester Riders to enhance the work placement activities of participants.

Solutions need to be found to make work more sustainable, and to extend working lives in order to avoid old-age poverty and to reduce state expenditure on pensions and welfare. (Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, Eurofound Report January 2017)\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research has highlighted that there are many millions of adults in Europe with low levels of functional literacy and/or numeracy skills and that the majority of these are in employment (OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2016). This has negative implications for their employment potential and longer term career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the Mid Life Career Review (MLCR) is one which is gradually gaining favour in many countries and the role of social partners in both lobbying for and delivering elements of this is one that could be critical to its success (Eurofound 2017). A MLCR is a holistic engagement designed to cover many topics such as retirement planning, finance, pensions and central to all models of a MLCR - skills. \r\n\r\nIn the UK John Cridland\u2019s very new report on pensions (published 23 March 2017) includes a recommendation to have a mid-life 'MOT' at 50 for skills and pensions. L&W Institute and TUC can take some of the credit for their campaign for everyone to have this mid-life entitlement at 50. This is the perfect time for this project, which can make a real and lasting impact.\r\n\r\nOur project will develop a suite of new materials to support the delivery of a Mid Life \u2018Skills\u2019 Review \u2013 with the emphasis on reviewing skills and competences and targeted at adults (at or around 50 years of age) with low levels of basic skills in literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. We will create new materials specifically designed for use both by Europe\u2019s social partners and others in the workplace carrying out similar 'skills review' functions. These materials will include new online \u2018gamified\u2019 skills assessment tools in a variety of languages and new online learning modules for the reviewers/assessors. Where there is a learning need identified, learners will be signposted to existing training materials. A platform for hosting these materials will be developed and the materials themselves translated into partner languages. We will also explore with partners how these new resources can be combined with the kind of holistic offer needed for a full MLCR. Further, the reviewers across the partnership will be encouraged to become \u2018mid-life skills champions\u2019, with the support of online tools and a virtual e-network. This network will support its members and share ideas and experience.\r\n\r\nAs well as a new suite of materials and in keeping with the European priority for prioritising the recognition of skills and qualifications, we will accredit learning through a new online digital badge and explore linking this into the Europass CV Programme. Badging of this kind is increasingly valued and is an innovation which the lead partner has some existing expertise in using. \r\n\r\nWe will gain further sustainable impacts by: delivering a series of events in each partner country to highlight the new materials and support available; developing a series of employee case studies to highlight some of the positive outcomes from the mid-life skills reviews e.g. progression, promotion, career change etc; and building on or utilising existing learner tracking systems to carry out a longitudinal study of the impact of mid-life skills reviews (going beyond the length of the project) which will focus on 3 key perspectives: workplaces/reviewers/employees.\r\n\r\nThe partners have been selected as all have existing close working relationships with trade unions and all have significant experience in working in the adult education and skills sector. The TUC, as lead partner, have considerable experience through unionlearn and TUC Learning Services of managing large, successful EU projects and were a core partner (alongside the Learning and Work Institute) in the recent successful Mid Life Career Review project funded by the UK Government and whose approach was described as both \u2018good practice\u2019 and \u2018affordable\u2019 within the 2017 Eurofound report.", "http://www.learningandwork.org.uk", "Trades Union Congress", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036618_6"], [2014, "OER uptake in adult education institutions", "NATIONAL LEARNING AND WORK INSTITUTE", 153547.0, 6, 6, "OERup! takes up the need of promoting and fostering successful implementation of practices with OER in adult learning institutions in Europe, with the aim of raising awareness of the value to be derived from OER, as well as supporting an OER-friendly environment in education institutions to increase participation in Open Education. The core of OERup! will be the development of a training package consisting of a blended-learning training concept and material on the topic of OER, addressing European adult education institutions (its management, staff and teachers). This training package will inform about the general principles, and new developments of OER with a special focus on pedagogical concepts on how to integrate OER production and use in the lessons plan, take up necessary specific tools and skills needed to create OER, and explain on the basis of practice examples how OER can be successfully integrated in the business concept of an adult education institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComplementing many current EU initiatives that focus on the uptake of OER by policy means (e.g. POERUP, OEREU), OERup! will take this approach one step further and address its target group directly hands-on. Adult education institutions (with or without experience in the uptake of OER), Adult education stakeholders, but also Higher education institutions will be integrated in the development of the training in three steps: First of all in the regional need analysis, including desk research and particularly round table workshops; secondly in the training-review meetings; and finally through the uptake of single OER business model cases, developed and implemented in selected institutions and supported through online coaching by the consortium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMain results of the project will be an in-depth need analysis, summarizing the state of the art, best practices, existing policies and current use and development of OER in adult education on the regional and European level, a training package consisting of different relevant modules, delivered in a blended-learning concept and explained in a guideline, and finally a collection of good existing practice examples. All these results will be presented and discussed with relevant stakeholders from the AE and HE sector during different multiplier events organised by the partners on local as well as on international level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium that will take up this ambitious task came together from five different European countries bringing different valuable angles and perspectives on the uptake of OER to the table.

Many disadvantaged people have few possibilities to escape the low skills trap, and they often lack the know-how to access social services, proper health care that goes beyond urgencies, and democratic participation. Refugees need to learn the host language, but also acquire the knowledge on how to make a home in their new countries. Additionally, too many of the native population of Europe respond aggressively to refugees through xenophobic and violent actions.The learning of these groups should combine basic and digital skills with problem solving, critical thinking and interaction with other people as well as information and support on how to access health and social services, developing family competences and fostering intercultural dialogue and active citizenship. The project has the following objectives:\u2022 Improve life skills provision in Europe\u2022 Provide tools and recommendations that can be used for and with the three target groups \u2022 Develop an overarching framework and modules that are transferrable across Europe\u2022 Support people from all target groups to access learning and other services; increase their participation in a democratic society and develop greater intercultural understandingThe project aims at reaching adult education providers and networks through the multiplier events (at least 500) but also policy-makers and stakeholders working in other educational sectors and in life skills areas (e.g. health, social issues etc.).  The project will produce several concrete outcomes:- a 'glossary' of 'life skills' based on a survey among adult education organisations, desk research and interviews, to clarify the terminology across Europe. - a collection of good practices and an analysis of the practises to help understand what works and how to make it work. - a collection and analysis of tools that are being used across Europe in order to promote life skills and intercultural understanding, used as basis of very concrete recommendations to other organisations on how to strengthen their non-formal approaches with the three target groups- a provision framework and transferable modules to create an indicative framework for life skills provision, incl. modules on, e.g., language & literacy & numeracy skills, financial, digital, health and civic capabilities. - an Awareness Raising and Strategy toolkit that will not only provide summaries of the lesson learnt through O1 and O2, but also contain recommendations as well as proposals for life skills strategies at different levels.Four partner meetings will allow the consortium to work on these outcomes. Two multiplier events will ensure a wide and in-depth dissemination of the project outcomes. The project will have the following impacts and results:- Effective tools for better intercultural and life skills learning- A more comprehensive and relevant life skills learning framework- More and better inclusion into job opportunities and community life- Improvement of basic skills provision in the adult education community- More and better tools for the work with low-skilled people, refugees and people with low intercultural understanding- Acquisition of concrete advocacy tool to target regional, national and European policy-makers- Increased recognition of the role of non-formal (adult) education in achieving social inclusion in the EU- Closer cooperation between agencies and stakeholders dealing with refugees on the one hand and the low-skilled on the other hand- Better referrals of people in need between these stakeholders- For the beneficiaries, a targeted life skills initiative also means improved health situations, better school attendance of children, more chances for employment \u2026- Concrete proposals how to devise and implement a life skills strategy on the local / regional / national levels- A better understanding of the overlaps of learning needs between low-skilled 'native' people and refugees / migrants but also the differences - In the long-term, the adoption of the life skills approach in national policies and initiatives- A close connection with / integration of the life skills approach in both in the European Agenda for adult learning and the upcoming Skills Agenda- Increasing the participation rates of adults in lifelong learning- Contributing to ET 2020, but also the post-Paris declaration process- The integration of the life skills approach in future policy strategies The intellectual outputs developed in the project will continue to display project results after the project lifetime has finished.

Firstly, there is a clear need to increase participation in adult education across Europe; and secondly, new ways of sharing best practices among European adult educators must be found. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want to address this need in an innovative way: through the medium of videos. We will produce professional high-quality videos on adult learning that target adult educators, general public and policy makers.  A video aimed at the adult educators will tell the story of an adult educator and offer practical ideas and share good practices for professional development for European adult educators. The video for the general public and policy makers tells the positive growth story of an adult learner, inspires to learn and freshens the image of adult education and furthers knowledge about its benefits. The videos will be produced in five partner countries with partners experienced in video production: Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Portugal. The sixth partner, EAEA, will lead the dissemination activities of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHD video are an effective, time-economical medium speaking to both people\u2019s intellect and emotions. For example, showing good educational practices instead of writing about them is much more effective. Another example: a European citizen is much more likely to be inspired into adult education through the filmed story about a fellow learner than a brochure on learning benefits. Also, videos reach that segment of the population who, for various reasons, do not like to engage with written text. This includes for example special learners such as dyslexics.  In other words videos fulfil accessibility criteria better than text. Our project would pioneer and pilot cross-European video production in the adult education sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduction team, consisting of a camera man, sound operator and a journalist, will travel to each selected location and shoot material based on the research and script developed by the partners. After shooting the material will be edited and post-produced by the production team. The videos are disseminated as an open educational resource in adult education media (LLinE, website of EAEA, with social media sharing options), Erasmus + dissemination platform, and potentially in European national television channels. In adult education media the videos will be complemented by written analysis of the methods and practices filmed, with the possibility to comment and discuss the content online. This analysis, written by education experts and scholars, is, on its part, a bridge between education research and practice.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will produce innovative adult education promotional material for the use of adult educators and adult education advocators. It thus aims at bringing positive and long lasting effects to the adult education professionals to support their work and also bring adult education closer to the general public in an understandable and easy-access form. The videos produced will be integrated into project partners\u2019 existing communications and they will be made available for different advocates of adult education throughout Europe. By introducing a variety of European examples of adult education issues the project outcomes, the videos, can be utilized in countries with different adult education history and perspectives. The videos produced in this programme will serve as advocacy and training tools for many European organisations. Through the dissemination networks of EAEA (an umbrella organization for 116 adult education organisations in Europe) the videos will reach the main European adult education organisations and policy-makers on education.

Daily practice shows that the structural embedding of the Literacy houses concept requires an extension of the concept to include not only language skills but all essential skills. Essential skills are the skills needed for life, learning and work. They provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve and adapt to change. \r\n\r\nOur main question is: 'How can we extend our current Literacy houses concept to include all essential skills and transform it into a centre of development?' We will focus on participation in its broadest sense. In doing so, we have selected two main themes which are relatively new to the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nCreation\r\nBesides the more classical methods for the transfer of  knowledge, we intend to research other - more creative - methods of acquiring language and  essential skills or methods that lead to a better embedding of lessons learned.  \r\n\r\nEmployment\r\nOver 50% of the people in the Netherlands with low essential skills is employed. Consequently, employers are a very important partner in the improvement of essential skills. In practice, however, they are hardly ever involved in our current Literacy houses concept. Secondly, Literacy houses can play an important role in helping people with low essential skills find a job. Within this project, we intend to research which approaches, styles and methods are possible. \r\n\r\nThe following partners will take part in the project: Cubiss Brabant, Public Library Breda, ROC West-Brabant, Stichting Lezen & Schrijven, Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek, Ulmer Volkshochschule, Learning and Work Institute and SPK vzw. They will all bring their specific knowledge, expertise and experiences related to the abovementioned themes to the project. All partners have also submitted their own learning questions and desired outcome of the project in order to further develop their own approach. \r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that everyone can successfully participate in our society. In order to be able to do so, they need to be equipped with certain essential skills. The proposed activities are directly related to the main challenge of the consortium in West-Brabant to extend its current Literacy houses concept so that it can become the centre of development that our society so desperately needs (a centre of life long learning). \r\n\r\nThe project will be kicked off during an international conference in September 2017, during which we will share the results and experiences of our KA1 project 'Extending the Literacy houses approach'. The day prior to the conference, we will plan a transnational project meeting with all new project partners to make further arrangements relating to our KA2 project. The results of our KA2 project will be presented to a wide audience during an international conference, which will probably take place in June 2019. Again, we will plan a transnational project meeting with all project partners on the day prior to the conference in order to evaluate the project and determine possible follow-up activities. All Dutch project partners will make study trips to the project partners in Norway, Germany, Wales and Belgium. During these study trips, we want to learn from their specific knowledge, expertise and experience.\r\n\r\nWe will process our findings in a case study concerning creation, a case study concerning employment and a toolkit related to Essential skills houses. The obtained  insights will be translated to fit the specific situation in West-Brabant; how can they successfully be incorporated in our current approach? \r\n\r\nThese intellectual outputs will be shared both nationally and internationally, e.g. through the existing networks and communication channels of all project partners as well as networks such as the Erasmus+ Project Results Platform and EPALE (online platform for adult education in Europe). We believe that all stakeholders that operate in the field of essential skills will be able to benefit from the insights we will acquire during this project.\r\n\r\nOur project strongly focuses on the long-term sustainability of our current Literacy houses concept.

In this matter, LFL works closely together with Learning & Work and CINOP. Recent policy developments form the basis of this application, in particular the decision to expand the Festival over the next two years, towards strong regional educational partnerships who organize Festival activities and establish strategic links also beyond the Festival. The national coordination from LFL will be designed in a new way, in consultation with the regional and national strategic partners. In addition, the Foundation will continue her efforts to strengthen the support for non-formal education at the national (policy) level. We are looking for new ways to influence, inside and outside the framework of the Festival.\r\n\r\nThrough this EISEL-project, the foundation aims to acquire expertise from European countries in the field of regional strategic partnerships, including: key conditions for a sustainable partnership, organization of cooperation at management level and at the level of concrete work practices, expected bottlenecks and how to handle these.\r\nIn addition, LFL wants to gain expertise to better strengthen the position of (non-formal) adult education, bringing results of (non-formal) adult education to the spotlight. LFL wants to learn from good practices about policy influencing and recognition & validation of non-formal learning.\r\n\r\nThe expertise gained by employees through EISEL has a dual purpose: renewal of the Festival through the formation of sustainable regional strategic partnerships and strengthening the position and support of non-formal education at national level (due to greater visibility of work practice and greater clarity about the contribution of adult education to central 21st century issues). Via EISEL, the participants will reinforce relevant competencies, which will enable them to work better on these two goals. In the end, this should lead to reach adults for who learning is not obvious better in the region and should lead to improvement of the conditions to participate in lifelong learning for employment, social inclusion and personal growth.\r\n\r\nBased on previous international cooperation, we know that we will find relevant expertise in Ireland, Slovenia and Wales.

From this year we have been building up the project under new financial conditions (without national subsidy) and with the cooperation of a group of enthusiastic volunteers. \r\n\r\nAs a national coordinator we have the possibility to give the Festival a new boost in terms of strategy, content and organisational structure. We are ambitious and we want to innovate the Festival in the coming years in several areas. \r\n\r\nBased on our previous international contacts and cooperation, we know that we can learn a lot from the expertise gathered in \u2018example countries\u2019 that already count with many years of experience with the Adult Learners Week: Ireland, Wales and Slovenia. The national coordinators in these countries (AONTAS, SIAE and NIACE DC) have outstanding experience in the areas we want to learn about during the coming project year, namely\r\n- Encouraging businesses and labour & learn offices to take part in the Festival\r\n- The use of role models or learning ambassadors during and beyond the Festival Week as part of a strategy to motivate specific target groups to join adult learning and/or to keep learning\r\n- Strategies for involving politicians and policymakers in lifelong learning and in the Festival, in order to make lifelong learning and (non-formal) education more visible for them and to put this issue on the political agenda \r\n- Offer professional development to educational workers from the local lifelong learning communities through the Festival, for example by offering seminars\r\n\r\nIn this project three groups of four persons each will follow a staff training in the countries mentioned above. The training sessions will take place during the Adult Learners Week in the country, which offers our staff, board members and volunteers who are already working for years for the Festival, an excellent opportunity to learn \u2018on the spot\u2019. During three or four full working days our workers will follow an intensive training consisting of study visits, presentations and structured discussions with local and national festival organisers, learning ambassadors, employers, politicians and other stakeholders. \r\n\r\nDuring the preparation period, personal learning objectives and organisational targets will be described in a learning agreement. The progress of the whole project will be followed using a monitoring and evaluation document, designed for this occasion. For the participants, the project will provide a rich and varied learning process, in which they obtain concrete knowledge and tools they can use in their daily work. The acquired expertise will lead to innovation of local Learning Festivals and national activities in the coming years: more businesses and labour & learn offices will take part in the Festival, learning ambassadors will play a significant role during and after the Festival, more politicians and policymakers will be involved in the Festival and local educational workers will be able to increase their expertise. Through this project the Learning Festival will get a significant impulse, that will be beneficial to people for whom learning is not obvious. \r\n\r\nThrough this project, Learn for Life also wants to contribute to the implementation of a number of European and national policy goals, namely: new challenges in a changing world and demonstrate that learning not only takes place at school (Europe 2020 Strategy), making lifelong learning and mobility a reality, creating creative and innovative learning surroundings and promote social cohesion, active citizenship and equal rights for everybody (European Agenda for Adult Learning and the Dutch SER document Making Work of Education).", "http://www.niace.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA104-000183_3"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1441929600000, 1483142400000, "Festival  Learning", "National Learning and Work Institute", "The Festival of Learning builds on Adult Learners' Week\u2019s 25 year history, establishing a targeted national/regional promotion and engagement campaign, fostering partnership across City and LEP boundaries to promote and publicise ESF funded provision and outcomes achieved by learners and employers.

Typically, the wind around buildings is too turbulent and slow to be of much use. Normal turbines need to be placed high above them which is expensive and attracts planning objections.  If buildings could be used to augment turbine airspeeds, it\u2019s estimated that the potential for energy capture in the built environment could exceed 10 TWh, creating CO2 savings of approximately 4 Megatonnes by 2020.   We will develop a retro-fittable roof-mounted module that will be almost invisible from street level. It will accentuate the low pressure zone over a flat roof parapet and link it to high-pressure static air beneath using a tapered duct. The air speed in such a duct has been shown to exceed the free wind by more than 30%. Power increases with the square of air velocity, so a turbine in this region will generate more than double the power of a conventional turbine, and as a ducted fan it will cause significantly less noise and vibration.  Further, we will use passively-warmed air injection to create a vortex in the duct, raising generator output by another 40%.  The vortex can heat or chill air directly which, coupled to powered passive ventilation, might augment a building\u2019s air conditioning and offset power consumption, cutting payback time still further.  The potential EU market for building integrated wind turbines is \u20ac345m and we believe that we can capture a high proportion (20%) of it.

In order to shape cultural policy for an expanding European Union the understanding of one of its most enduring institutions for creating and contesting political identities is necessary. The focus is on understanding the conditions for using the past in negotiations that recreate citizenship, and on the understanding of layers of territorial belonging beyond the actual nation-state. The research is pursued through multi-disciplinary collaboration between eight leading institutions and a series of work packages studying institutional path dependencies, the handling of conflicts, modes of representation, cultural policy and visitors experiences in national museums. Understanding the cultural force of national museums will provide citizens, professionals and policy makers with reflexive tools to better communicate and create a common understanding of diversity and community in developing cultural underpinning for democratic governance.", 562082.0, 2800930.0, 8, 8, "EUNAMUS", null, "http://www.le.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-08/56848.jpg", "fp7_94002_999985514"], [1291161600000, 1417305600000, "PREvention of Late Stent Thrombosis by an Interdisciplinary Global European effort", "University of Leicester", "According to the European Society of Cardiology there has been an increase in the life expectancy at the age of 65 of the European population from 15.0 to 17.0 years in the years since 1980.

Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4).

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

The participating organisations aim to improve language teaching and the assessment of linguistic competencies in primary schools by producing an assessment tool in the format of a computer game. The game will use a common core of curricula from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as its foundation and \u2013 with its seven language versions - create opportunities for converging standards on a European level. \r\n\r\nThe ten partner organisations were chosen for their expertise in promoting languages, research, teaching primary languages, assessment, translation, e-learning and language games. The Goethe-Institut London, a supporter of language teachers in the UK and all EU member states, is project lead. Together with its British and other European partners, it identified and developed the project idea. Both the Spanish Embassy in the UK and the British language teachers network, ALL, have been extremely helpful and influential in discussing the need to address the imbalance of language learning in the UK and other member states. The Universities of Reading and Leipzig were identified as leading primary language research experts while the University of Perugia was chosen as assessment expert. In order to ensure the necessary practical focus, the Education Ministry of Tenerife supports the development of the tool for Spanish and together with the Education Ministry in Rioja will conduct the piloting in its regions. The University of Siena with its e-learning centre  joined the partnership to provide the basis for the development of the language game for Italian. The University of Westminster will add it translation and localisation expertise for French in the UK. \r\n\r\nAs the project progresses, this tool will to be tested in schools in four countries and the outcomes will be evaluated using standard quality criteria. In order to support the anchorage of the assessment tool in state schools, a specific training of teachers is required which will be done exemplarily at the Education Ministry in Rioja. Teachers can take home course methodology to be implemented in their schools. Project partners taking part in the course will draw on this experience for their own teacher training courses.\r\n\r\nThe design of the game will be based on intensive research to provide insight into assessing progress in language learning. Parts of the programming of an existing computer game developed by the GI's headquarter in Munich in cooperation with the software company OVOS will be used to develop the new tool. The game will then be piloted to calibrate the e-learning content to ensure validity of content and construct. The feedback of pupils, teachers, parents and external educators will be recorded, analysed and implemented. Once the game is used in various classroom situations, the obtained data will show the pupils\u2019 progress. The results will be compared with traditional pen and paper tests.\r\n\r\nThe project benefits all participants. Schools and teachers will become \u201cinnovators\u201d. Students will find language learning more enjoyable. Their learning outcomes will be better and their acquisition of transversal skills will be enhanced. Teachers will be able to develop their professional skills further using innovative methods and digital integration. They will derive great personal and professional satisfaction from improving their students\u2019 learning outcomes. Universities will benefit from research and data analysis from the assessment tool. The GI and the public authorities will be strengthened regarding their work to promote languages. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term, this project should yield strong evidence to convince national authorities to endorse the assessment tool and actively promote it. At European level, the results can be used to promote the launch of pilots for more languages in more countries.

Evaporative cooling utilizes an ambient energy (latent heat of water evaporation) to perform air conditioning of buildings, and is therefore a potential replacement of existing systems. However, evaporative cooling has several technical difficulties that impede its wide application. Direct evaporative cooling adds moisture to room air which causes unpleasant thermal comfort. Indirect evaporative cooling limits supply air temperature to some degrees above the wet bulb of the outdoor air, which is too high to perform air conditioning of buildings. The dew point (evaporative) cooling breaks the limit of wet bulb, and allows the supply air to be cooled to a level below the wet bulb and above the dew point of the outdoor air. However, the existing exchanger for dew point cooling is still less efficient to perform air conditioning of buildings in Europe regions. The proposed research aims to optimise the design of the exchanger in terms of its material, structure and geometric sizes, and to develop a new polygonal-sheets-stacked exchager. The new exchanger will be 15 to 35% higher in cooling effectiveness that allows the dew point cooling become a widely applicable system for building air conditioning in most regions of Europe.

The term \u201cflight upset\u201d indicates a situation when an aircraft in flight unintentionally exceeds the parameters normally experienced in line operations or training. Loss of control due to unsuccessful upset recovery is considered an important factor in civil aviation accidents. There is a clear need for the simulation of unusual flight attitudes, as a means to train pilots recovery procedures. Exercising these conditions in the real world is unsafe, expensive and, if performed in smaller aircraft, not representative of the situation in transport aircraft. Therefore, ground-based simulation of these extreme conditions is the only viable option for pilot instruction. However, at present, hexapod-based flight simulators used for pilot training are not equipped for this purpose, due to limitations of the mathematical aircraft models, and restricted simulator motion capabilities.  We believe that ground-based simulation of upset recovery is feasible when innovations in different research areas will be adequately combined. To demonstrate this, real flight tests will be performed with transport aircraft in unusual attitudes. The recorded motion profiles will serve to extend mathematical aircraft models with engineering tools. In addition, current motion cueing software will be innovated to reproduce the high G-loads and extreme attitudes representative to upset recovery. Then the simulator concept will be evaluated on a new generation flight simulator (DESDEMONA) with advanced motion capabilities, and compared to hexapod-based flight simulators. The final outcome will be a set of requirements for successful ground-based simulation of upset recovery, which will contribute to better pilot training to identify and recover from flight upsets.
