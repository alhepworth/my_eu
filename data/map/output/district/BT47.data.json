The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models. This widely supported project, provides the basis for a comprehensive investigation into the problems facing salmon at sea. It will also act as an important model for understanding the factors affecting survival of many other important marine species.", null, 4833604.0, 9, 20, "SALSEA-MERGE", null, "http://www.loughs-agency.org", null, "fp7_87925_998794451"]]}}, "2BD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Modern teaching practice for quality education", "CHAPEL ROAD PRIMARY SCHOOL", 190186.0, 2, 17, "This project has been designed not only to meet an institutional  need  but also a national one strictly concerning the conduct of teaching practice for students of pedagogical profile .The target group consists of 90 students from the Romanian and Hungarian pedagogical profile section preparing to become teachers at pre/primary school.This project wishes to offer the opportunity to 90 students to participate in teaching practice in a modern European environment, European schools and kindergartens in Northern Ireland.The group of 90 students is divided into groups of 15 students to participate in flows of six according to their study level.The two-week teaching practice focuses on modern teaching and assessment methods which will improve participants\u2019 teaching /methodological competences and skills.\r\n\r\nObjectives are projected as : \r\n\r\n -the 90 participants to acquire modern teaching methods and tools , assessment at primary and pre-primary groups. \r\n\r\n -the 90 participants to use modern North Irish teaching methods and means.\r\n\r\n -the 90 participants to acquire IT means and methods of teaching and assessment.\r\n\r\n-the 90 participants to learn to work in an intercultural context, inter-ethnic .\r\n\r\n the 90 partcipants of the target group to gain experience in the workplace in the European area \r\n\r\n -the 90 participants to be advised regarding the transition from training towards the labour market through teaching practice in a European country.\r\n\r\n- students in the target group will enrich their knowledge about the pre/primary  Northern Irish education system.\r\n\r\nAll participants will improve their professional performance in the field of didactics, networking, activity organising, differential work duties according to the type of each participant and the overriding intelligence type of each student.What is more, participants will perfect their communication skills in English language and IT .\r\n\r\nPractitioners will have a tutor for the teaching practice who will oversee the entire assisted learning practice, experimental teaching and preparation of documents, materials and worksheets that will represent the portfolio.At the end of the internship, each participant will be assessed based on NW Academy\u2019s set of criteria.The practice portfolio, individual teaching practice sheet supervised by the tutor; all these will be supporting document for the running/ evaluation of the teaching practice stipulated in OMEN 4927/2013 which regulates the organisation and conduct of teaching practice in accordance with the subject matters.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results. But they also reflect the determination to pursue a process of continuous improvement, and to take decisive steps towards the effective implementation of the ECVET system in some of the curricula of the participating organisations, an ambitious aim we are determined to achieve.", "https://www.fleming-agri.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA102-022405_27"], [2017, "Bio Economy and Strategic Training", "FLEMING AGRI-PRODUCTS LIMITED", 148147.0, 5, 39, "Some agricultural and tourist actions have revealed an important combination with the Consortium background. For this reason the project stems from the activities already designed and developed by some Consortium members last year. The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship. An individual plan will be prepared for each participant, on the basis of their professional paths and not forgetting their entry level competences and the defined learning outcomes. Skills and knowledges are relative to the Regione Toscana directory, in particular to the ADA 377 \"Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans\" or to the ADA1492 \"Analysis and monitoring of production and development\". During the meeting the staff will give participants information about the administration and the  management of the project phases.\r\n- Mobility: before the departure each participant will receive the tickets and the handbook; then they will develop a three weeks traineeship in UK, Spain, Ireland, Germany.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20

Out of studies, such as The European Youth Forum\u2019s study about the contribution of non-formal education in terms of increased employability, the soft skills that employers most frequently demand include communication skills, organisational/planning skills, decision-making skills, team working skills, confidence/autonomy and numeracy. Five of these six most frequently demanded soft skills that employers require are also being amongst those skills developed to a greater extent in youth organisations, the exception being numeracy. \r\nThese soft skills are seen as a key element for successful job performance.

For example, sense of initiative and pro-activity are traits associated with confidence/autonomy and entrepreneurship.

Employers however stress a special emphasis on the way of presenting the skills and competences (what they present, how they present it has more impact than what is written on the paper) acquired during the participation in youth work, which is an area where there is still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nIn youth work, we have the instrument of the youth pass at European level,  a lot of countries have own national recognizing tools for competences, and each young person can use the European CV format (the Europass CV) for presenting the skills and competences towards employers. But only few still know, how to work effectively with it (e.g. what to present if I have already Youthpass from 6 different events). \r\n\r\nWith this project we want to bring youth workers together, to support them in enabling young people to better assess and express their competences for employment purposes.\r\n\r\nYoung workers should be made more aware about the value that employers place on the skills and the competencies developed in the youth work, and youth workers can be trained in how to support the young people they work with, in this topic.

In contrast to talking, theatre has the power to move directly into the heart and move people from within. Often you immediately get to the people\u2019s core beliefs and motivation. The visual language of theatre allows people to understand each other quickly without getting lost in misunderstandings. Besides, playing theatre is a lot of fun and creates a safe space, being it a great method to serve as a platform to address societal issues in a light-minded way, without losing its importance. Since theatre is a process in which trust and cooperation are essential for success, it is a helpful and interesting method of exploring different ways of thinking, weighing pro\u2019s and con\u2019s in order to be able to work together as a team. Furthermore it is a way for people to become aware of their independency and self confidence.  Through theatre people are more likely to discuss their own behaviour and  to reflect on that, it does make them think about a lot of things, about themselves and other people\u2019s points of view and validate their role in life and this society. Therefore it is a beautiful and very playful way of taking people \u201cby the hand\u201d in a process of self awareness and growth towards active citizenship.

The first 3 days of the training course are dedicated to develop connections between participants and to work at the same time on more personal competences that are essential in theatre. These activities are described as \"interconnection\" in the programme. From day 4 we work 3 full days with the \"Forum theatre\" method and we end these days with a Forum theatre performance. After the training participants will be more aware, openminded and selfconcious. They will be acquainted with severals methods of theatre which they can share with youngsters and peers and bring up social issues for discussion. Participating organisations will gain, via their participants, new knowlegde on behalf of their organisation and therefor will be able to offer new methods in working with young people. At the same time they will be able to use a dedicated network in Europe with whom they can work with in future activities.

Diversity, e.g. in the group of participants, will be considered as a resource for the exchange and transfer of competences, as well as special attention is paid to the intercultural dimension of the project. There will only be few frontal lectures, the main part of the training course will be delivered in the form of practical sessions implemented by the participants in a learning-by-doing fashion, using the full toolbox of non-formal education and experiential learning. The trainers will take care of creating a supportive and safe learning environment, where participants are encouraged and coached while mastering challenges that contribute to their personal, professional and organisational development. The learning takes place both on individual level as well as in synergetic group processes, while always based on the participants\u2019 needs. Special attention is paid to making the learning points of the training course relevant, sustainable and transferable, eg by producing exhaustive documentation and by providing templates for tailor-made development and action plans. \r\n\r\nKEYWORDS/TAGS: Erasmus+, Youth in Action, quality in youth work, coaching, communication, empowerment, training course, active participation of young people, intercultural learning, non-formal education, learning to learn, social entrepreneurship, employment", null, null, "erasmus_2014-3-AT02-KA105-001052_13"], [2018, "Embrace the Reality with Media Literacy", "The Inside Out Programme", 19662.0, 5, 5, "Embrace the Reality with media Literacy is a youth exchange which will connect 33 young participants from France, Latvia, Slovenia, Turquey and Great Britain with the intention to enhance their competences on the field of media literacy. The exchange will be taking place in Kranjska Gora from the 12th to the 21st of November 2018.\r\n\r\nMass media have a strong influence on our opinions and decision-making which makes manipulation through media an increasing and pressing social problem. The current social problem seems to not be in too little but too much information. Media digitalization and mainly access to internet generate an overload of information also for the young part of the population. Due to  lack of experience and critical thinking, youth does not realize the acute strength of manipulation and its reasons too often. The voice of emotions on which media relies often increases the deepest of fears in young people lacking strong critical thinking, thus overpowering the more peaceful rationnal voice of statistical data and logic.\r\n\r\nTolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination are values promoted by the European Union. Due to different interests, mass media very often does not follow these values. On the contrary, it creates fears that can be identified and avoided only by a developed media literacy. Our youth exchange will help young participants to elaborate this skill which will make them aware of media manipulation as well as gain knowledge and power for an efficient and safe use of media tools.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, the participants will gain knowledge from using the tools that are used by mass media itself: storytelling by text writing, photography and video. Through the experience of creation and renewal of fake stories, participants will also be acquainted with the traps of media manipulation. \r\n\r\nWe have included pressing thematics into the proces of media literacy which are displaying dialogue about discrimination, stereotypes, migrations and other challenges of the current society, often strongly marked by different media. Also, we have included a critical reflection about the advantages and disadvantages of social media that have the strongest influence amongst the young.\r\n\r\nWe will enroll young participants from 18-25 years of age, interested by media literacy, storytelling through photography and video, journalism, socially-committed thematics and social media or media in the broader sense of the term.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-2-SI02-KA105-014663_4"], [2018, "United in Music", "The Inside Out Programme", 18947.0, 5, 5, "\u201cUnited in Music\u201d is a youth exchange dedicated to music and the intercultural dialog.

Positive effects also reside in listening and playing music as well as creating music. Singing doesn\u2019t just influence our mood, but it also has a positive impact on the physical state of our body. Breathing and the trembling of vocal chords have a therapeutic power, making our heart beat faster and helping our blood circulate through the body. This releases endorphins to our brain which makes us happy. Group singing, playing and creating music enables interaction with people, which establishes real harmony through building bridges between individuals hailing from different cultures.\r\n\r\nEuropean values such as tolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination are facing a difficult challenge today, especially in times of accelerated migrations and economic crises. However, migrations are an important and inevitable part of the economic and social life of every country, therefore it is important to sensitise young people to it in order for them to see the positive sides of multicultural societies. Our task is to incite young people to be open and curious so that we can overcome elements of xenophobia and racism together. This is all the more important in this time when radical nationalisms are dangerously growing and attracting young vulnerable people who sometimes do not see meaning in their lives and are then seeking it in groups with dangerous views due to their lack of feeling of safety.\r\n\r\nWith the goal to increasing our understanding of the relationship between cultures, we have invited partner organisations from Lebanon and Jordan to cooperate with us. These two countries comprise a very intercultural society, which also includes many refugees. Participants from these countries will share their perspectives on migration and the possibilities of a harmonious co-existence. During the exchange, we wish to contribute to the reflection on European as well as Mediterranean identity. We will be exploring the connection between the participating countries as well as the cultural contrasts that will be enriching us. We will focus particularly on the problem of Islamophobia which can lead to a radicalisation of nationalistic groups and violence towards migrants and refugees. By combining young creative minds from European and South-Mediterranean countries in the harmony of singing and through other connecting activities of the exchange, we wish to reach a higher level of connectivity and consciousness between young people in order for them to continue being accepting, inclusive and active citizens. \r\n \r\nWe will be choosing participants according to their affinity for music and interest for the intercultural dialog. Participants will be aged between 18 and 30, as we believe the theme of the exchange requires a certain level of maturity. The key to choosing the participants will also comprise an equal representation of the two genders as well as the priority for participants with fewer opportunities, especially refugees, asylum seekers and young people with migrant backgrounds. Participants with fewer opportunities will be cooperating and socialising in the frame of a supporting environment where all are equal and opportunities are balanced. The goals set will be pursued through non-formal methods of teaching music and intercultural dialog that will be entirely prepared and conducted by participants under the mentorship of group leaders and staff.\r\n\r\nYoung participants will prepare practical workshops, a photo marathon team building, games, presentations, intercultural evenings, an excursion and shows with local artists. We will also organise a public concert where participants will present all the acquired knowledge to the public. In addition, this event will be an excellent opportunity to promote the E + Youth in Action program. \r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, participants will gain knowledge of vocal technique, choir singing, harmony and performance, but they will also learn about supporting activities such as music production. Skills like creativity in groups will be improved, performance training will strengthen their confidence and everyday evaluations will contribute to a healthy self-criticism and increase in motivation.

The awareness of these is not always easy to understand by young people nowadays. Therefore, in order to tackle the issue we wish to make the following objectives:\r\n\u2022 Give to participants the tools and competences to understand what civil society is and what is its role in our own societies; \r\n\u2022 Familiarize the participants with concepts and approaches of non violent actions i.e. how to use it best and adapt it to local contexts and realities in order to promote peace building;\r\n\u2022 Equip the participants with skills to act in order to fulfill their goals;  \r\n\u2022 Empower the young people to act wisely in conflicts on individual as well as societal levels;\r\n\u2022 Review and enhance participants\u2019 competences (knowledge, skills, attitudes) in working as  multipliers, and activists on peace building using non formal education tools;\r\n\u2022 Enable participants to develop activities and campaigns for multipliers in conflict transformation and non-violent actions, at international, national or local level.\r\n\r\nThe project will include 30 youth workers/leaders from 13 programme countries for 8 days (including travel days) in Austria.

The seminar will implement a 360degree appraisal system for international trainers within the quality framework of international youth work trainings. The tool will be used to support the development of professional practice and the development of high quality non-formal youth work trainings. The meeting will take place in East Clare Golf Village in Bodyke, Ireland in spring 2016.CONTEXTThe seminar is taking place in the context of the newly emerging International Youth Work Trainers Guild (IYWT Guild) - an independent supportive community of trainers in the youth work sector that advocates on behalf of and contributes to each other\u2019s professional development. The aim of the Guild is to ensure defined quality standards in delivery of youth work training activities. The community endeavours to have a positive impact on Youth Policy and non-formal education as part of life-long learning at all levels within Europe and neighbouring regions. We hope to do this through establishing communication platforms and systems to ensure our recommendations are heard by decision makers and through acting as advocates on behalf of its members and represent and grow our professional identity.OBJECTIVES\u2022 To develop a reflection and feedback tool that promotes the professional development of trainers\u2022 To utilise and build on the set of trainer competences (ETS and SALTO)\u2022 To implement and test the reflection and feedback tool \u2022 To measure the impact on individuals development and the quality of trainings\u2022 To strengthen the quality of non-formal education within the youth work training sectorPARTICIPATING COUNTRIES16 Program countries: Ireland, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, FYR Macedonia, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, the UK. 9 Partner countries: EECA region \u2013 Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Western Balkans \u2013 Albania, Serbia, Montenegro. ACTIVITIESThe seminar is a meeting of international youth work trainers interested in exploring the development and piloting of a professional development and feedback tool. This involves participants critically reviewing the latest ETS Trainer Competences, offering recommendations and ideas for implementing a 360 feedback system for trainers, piloting and testing the developed system, reflecting and evaluating its functionality and value, exploring and understanding other appraisal systems and purposes, responding to the needs and proposed changes, full participation and contribution throughout the seminar, evaluation of the activity and open, transparent and consultative communication with the wider trainers world.METHODSThe diversity of methods will include: workshops about competences they have as youth trainers and tools they use to evaluate the quality of their work and youth trainings in general; peer interviews; assessment simulation games; work in small groups;  group analysis tools \u2013 360C\u00b0 evaluation, 6 thinking hats, Case clinics and Blossoming issue; imaginarium techniques (projection of the image of youth trainers, future vision of youth trainers); interactive presentations; Expert tables and World Caf\u00e9; individual work \u2013 assessment of trainers competences, and pair assessment, creative labs.IMPACT, RESULTS & LONG-TERM BENEFITSThe developed 360degree appraisal system will form an essential part of IYWT Guild\u2019s membership process and our aim is to cascade the opportunity after the Seminar. The documentation of the process through the digital reporting will inform the wider world of trainers and allow them to follow and feedback on developments. Each participant will have actively taken part in a self-assessment process of their trainer competences as well reviewed feedback from other stakeholders and identified their strengths and areas for development based on this analysis. They will also plan for further personal and professional development. For our partners it means supporting and investment in the opportunity and the professional development of the trainers they use in the field.On a wider scope, the seminar wishes to build on the importance of international youth work trainers taking more responsibility and having more autonomy for theirs and others professional practice. We strongly believe the focus on quality and the professional development of trainers will in turn ensure the sustainability and quality of future training activities and therefore will also in the longterm improve the quality of the youth work that young people then experience, and promote and raise the quality for trainings for NA\u2019s and SALTO.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-3-IE01-KA105-016705_24"], [2015, "Integration Through Action", "The Inside Out Programme", 16746.0, 11, 12, "Our planned project will influence the participants by motivating and inspiring them to take actions in their local societies.

Individual work with using the coaching methods inside the organization, as well as work with local communities, can increase the quality of NGOs' work generally and have direct influence on the target groups organizations work with.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we face a problem that youth workers representing NGOs which work for local communities have lack of coaching skills in their work. First of all, it is caused by the reason that youth workers are not aware about importance of these coaching skills. And as a result, they are not able to use in their work. Moreover, it is caused by lack of professional coaches and coaching trainers which are ready to share their knowledge and experience with youth workers, which in a way comes from lack of proper non-formal education, missing international cooperation in this field and supporting system between NGOs around Europe. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this training course are: \r\n- To learn about importance of coaching skills in youth work;\r\n- To learn coaching skills how to use different techniques and methods in individual coaching in order to guide and mentor volunteers knowing more methods and techniques.;\r\n- To practice different coaching techniques and methods;\r\n- To increase the quality of NGOs' work in local communities and inside their own organizations;\r\n- To establish partner relationships between organizations and create the support system;\r\n- To learn about opportunities for young people and youth organizations in frame of Erasmus+ Programme;\r\n- To plan the activities for future cooperation between the organizations.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be empowered to learn from their own experience and create their own individual knowledge and development concerned with issue.

European values of pluralism, indiscrimination, acceptance, justice, and solidarity are reportedly threatened by economic difficulty and the growing migrant crisis. This is why we will build on music creation and performance to help promote a more tolerant and inclusive society with a positive perception of migrant men and women. We will examine migrations and the necessity for intercultural dialogue, research our migrant roots and experiences, and review how these issues are reflected in musical evolution.The participants will be selected based primarily on affinity for music and/or interest in migration issues.

They will also be instructed in supporting activities of musical productions; i.e. organisation, promotion, direction and technical support. They will hone their skills in creative teamwork, the most difficult type of teamwork. Through collaboration and mutual support they will also improve their social skills, a key element of creating possibilities and opportunities for the young.

How to integrate different nations, and do they even want that (UK for example)? How do we also integrate tens of thousands of new citizens of EU that came here because of the wars in Middle East?

The exchange will be between 26.8. and 3. 9. 2015 by river Kolpa in the Bela krajina region, inspiring in its cultural diversities. Music workshops combined with generally beneficial content tied to music and performance is aimed at stimulating youth participation in society and personal development.\r\n\r\nThe young have always felt connected to music. Listening to music is the most frequent activity among the young only rivalled by watching TV. Unlike passive TV consumption, researchers stress the positive effects of listening to, creating and playing music. In addition to musical skills, such activities develop other useful abilities. Music also transcends borders and is a perfect medium for intercultural understanding and communication.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn vocal technique, choir singing and harmonization, composing lyrics and performance skills; additionally the basics of self-presentation as well as proper use of Youthpass and Europass. Through engaged music they will learn how to critically engage with matter and express themselves creatively. They will also be exposed to the visual side of performing arts. They will be required to understand the basics of project organisation and promotion in line with the possibilities for the young by the Erazmus+ programme. The public performance workshop will build on acquired musical performance skills enabling the participants to leave a strong impression in personal interactions as well as public appearances. The final night of the exchange will feature a public performance, where participants will present their new skills and knowledge. The training and concluding event will be filmed and edited to serve as promotional presentation of the entire exchange and the multicultural interactions therein. At the same time the event will be a good opportunity to promote the Erazmus+ programme \u201cYouth in Action\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will include structured social games and performances aimed at getting to know each other and learning about each-other\u2019s diverse cultures and cultural diversity of the Bela krajina region. The gained cultural awareness and mutual understanding will further develop European civic consciousness and identity. \r\n\r\nThe project participants will be selected primarily based on their affinity for music. They will have manifested an interest in planning and implementing parts of the programme. Additional considerations are gender equality and affording the less privileged the opportunity to participate. The participants will be between 18 and 26, because the level of difficulty inherent on music creation demands maturity. We aim at relatable ages, age differences inadvertently result in hierarchical divides and social fragmentation.\r\n\r\nThe young participants will gain skills in creative teamwork, while performance training will strengthen their individual confidence and independence. Daily evaluations will contribute to a healthy self-critical attitude while strengthening motivation. We will also aim to hone their social skills, a key element for creating opportunities in a world where collaboration and mutual support are growing ever more important. The participants will be asked to create, prepare and conduct parts of their performances on their own, with the mentors and leaders acting as guidance support only, which will stimulate their creativity and sense of initiative.\r\n\r\nThe participants will form fruitful connections enabling future collaborations. We will provide a safe and supportive environment to develop their confidence and self-image, both necessary for widening the scope of their cultural ventures and ensure a more active participation in society. Informal education programmes, such as this, are invaluable for the less privileged youth, because they enable cooperation and socialising in a supportive environment of equals affording equal opportunities.\r\n\r\nAll the activities described above will develop the capabilities and skills of the participants irrespective of their status of privilege, raising self-esteem and employability as well as bettering their cultural awareness and social interactions on an intercultural level. \r\n\r\nThe project will be featured on Internet sites and social media pages of all participating organisations, including a photo-journal of the exchange and a video presentation of activities and final public performance.

The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory.

Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school).

It is about the mobility in Europe, Ireland and Spain, for our students preparing their Leaving Certificate in 3 years, in Administration, Sales, Social Health, Catering and Manufacturer, with the option European English or Spanish. It consists of a Training Period in these countries, including 64 participants.\r\n\r\nFor the first year: a placement is proposed to the students in the classes of Technician of Manufacturing and Electrotechnics. They are aged 15 or 16 and will go for three weeks to Tafalla in Spain, in june 2019.\r\nIt is a real advantage for these young people of 16, who change remarkably both personally and in their social behaviour.\r\nFor the first year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students in the Administration,  Social and Sales classes, European section.\r\nThey will go for three weeks to Athlone in Ireland or to Valencia in Spain, in March 2020.\r\n\r\nFor the second year: a placement abroad is proposed to the students of the Admintration, Sales and Social class, European section.

Mobility is beneficial for professional integration as the businesses value it. Our students experiment supervised mobility, which very often encourages them to do it again spontaneously and so the probability of working abroad is high.\r\nThe benefits of mobility are more than satisfactory, as follows:\r\n    -  Adaptability, analysis abilities, initiative\r\n    -  Greater confidence and self-esteem\r\n    -  Dealing with another language, culture, local gastronomy\r\n    - Ability to cope with a problem\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mobility can be immediate or delayed\r\nFor young vocational students, mobility enhances personal development as they benefit from very rewarding and challenging experiences.\r\nConsequently, they become more involved in their professional or learning  project and they come out of it better and more experienced.\r\nMoreover, the students commonly experience two work placements abroad.\r\nWe intend to make training periods in European countries - Ireland or Spain- a more extended programme.\r\nMobility allows our students to have access to the European job market.", "http://www.entertainmentideas.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046088_14"]]}}, "6HY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "JA\u00c9N+ (II): Formaci\u00f3n Profesional con Plus en Europa (II)", "Deanfield Private Nursing Home", 365004.0, 8, 36, "JA\u00c9N+: Formaci\u00f3n Profesional con Plus en Europa is an initiative by Diputaci\u00f3n de Ja\u00e9n, that aims to foster the labor insertion of young people from the province of Ja\u00e9n, and improve the training offered by Vocational Education and Training Centers with professional internships abroad. \r\n\r\nDiputaci\u00f3n de Ja\u00e9n coordinates the project, that gathers 16 VET Schools of Ja\u00e9n\u2019s province, and will select 150 participants from second year of VET studies. \r\n\r\nAfter an analysis of the required work force and the professions with better expectations, and having enquired the VET Schools about the project, the consortium is finally set with 16 different VET Certificates:   \r\n\r\n MANAGEMENT ASISSTANT\r\nPERSONAL CARE\r\nGASTRONOMY\r\nNURSERY\r\nADMINISTRATION\r\nSUPPLY MANAGEMENT\r\nICT INSTALLATIONS\r\nELECTRICITY AND AUTOMATIC INSTALLATIONS\r\nELECTROMECANINC MAINTENANCE\r\nMECANIC MANUFACTURING \r\nPRODUCING THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS\r\nTRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT\r\nICT AND NEWTWORKING SYSTEMS \r\nOLIVE OIL EXPERTISE\r\nMETAL AND POLYMERS EXPERT\r\n\r\nParticipants will be selected after a selection process, being the same one in every center- the programme will consist in:\r\n- 30 hours intercultural preparation\r\n- 20 hours language course\r\n- 8 week work placement in international companies, to choose among Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, Poland and United Kingdom\r\n\r\nAll participants will aslo have several workshops and work sessions about labour integration and entrepreneurship, leaded by EURES Ja\u00e9n\r\n\r\nThe Project will be managed according to the set of tools and recommendations given by EUROPASS and ECVET, aiming at obtaining the best assessment and validation possible for the internships. \r\n\r\nThe project will be promoted and coordinated by Diputaci\u00f3n de Ja\u00e9n, though every center belonging to the consortium will take part in every phase.

The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model.

These pressures, including international competition, industry consolidation and increasing incorporation of costly digital signage technologies into the advertising industry, are important factors impacting SMEs, given their limited access to investment capital. Consortium SMEs have therefore identified a clear need for an outdoor media technology that can replace paper billboards, is affordable, as equally market-effective as digital advertising and that can generate consumer appeal.
