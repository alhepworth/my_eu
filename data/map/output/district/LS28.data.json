A key component of the project is looking at how practical \"low-cost\" materials can be developed for the recording of seismic events. This is seen as especially important in the countries that are less well economically developed, but which are often in seismically active zones. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project\r\nTo work with our project partners to develop a set of materials that are low cost and portable to help with the practical aspects of teaching seismology. This will involve the use of Raspberry Pi computers and \"slinky spring\" seismometers. The project will look at working with partner schools in India and in Kenya to develop their understanding of seismic risk and giving them practical tools to enable them to take seismic readings and allow them to contribute to the global schools seismic network.\r\n \r\nDescription of activities\r\n [1]. Development of computer software to enable Rasperry Pi computers to be used for the recording of seismic signals;\r\n [2]. Development of a reliable and robust, yet cheap and accurate seismometer (\u201cSlinky Spring\u201d seismometer);\r\n [3]. Collaboration between international partners to enable validation of results obtained;\r\n [4]. Opportunities for school students from participating institutions to travel and participate in the development of the project;\r\n [5]. Mobilities for the staff involved in the project.\r\n \r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\nThe project will look at setting up and calibrating \u201cprofessional\u201d quality seismometers in the school and ensuring that these are linked to the other project partners. These will be linked into the schools seismology network. \r\nRaspberry Pi computers will be used to develop the software to be used with the \u201cslinky spring\u201d seismometers. These will be calibrated with the \u201cprofessional\u201d quality seismometers and the data will be triangulated with the project partners in both the UK and abroad.\r\n \r\nOnce regular and reliable readings can be taken the seismometers will be taken to the partner schools in India and Kenya to test in the field. Further development of the seismometers will be undertaken once the \u201cfield trials\u201d have been undertaken.\r\n \r\nShort description of the results \r\nBy the end of the project, the project partners will have an increased knowledge and understanding of working together across borders. Torquay Girls' Grammar School will be the coordinating school for the project.\r\n\r\nImpact envisaged\r\nAt the end of the project it is envisaged that a practical method of taking seismic readings at a local level in LDC\u2019s will have been developed. This will have a positive impact in terms of the increased awareness of the dangers that are inherent in seismically active zones.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits\r\nIn the longer term, having small portable, yet accurate seismometers available in schools in the less developed, yet seismically active zones around the world, could possibly help in saving lives from the risk of earthquake and Tsunami.", "http://www.fulneckschool.co.uk", "Torquay Girls' Grammar School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000280_2"]]}}}}
