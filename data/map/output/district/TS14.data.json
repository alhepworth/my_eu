Students have open minded   the visual education which is also mentioned in EU education reports .Starting from this point,DIALoguE intends to develop a new tool which will be used in all subjects in the school.However, it will be formed for the history lessons in our project.  The results of the study revealed a low number of classroom activities centred on watching movies in history classes. However, compared to many other activities, watching movies was ranked first in terms of its pleasure.  Consequently, our project will attract students to the history classes by leveraging technology, provide permanent learning for students, help students to develop an empathetic approach to historical events, facilitates the professional development of teachers, improves students' intercultural communication and peer relationships, and increase students' ability to think creatively. Accordingly, in this project, we have designed a digital tool and teaching method that integrate cinema films and short films shooting by students into the history curricula.

When choosing these major thematic fields we took into account the following realities:\r\n-learning a foreign language is absolutely necessary for a successful integration into the open labour market and for a complete personal and professional development \r\n-classes can sometimes fall into routine, that\u2019s why using Art as a means for creating a more enjoyable learning environment will help students become more enthusiastic and motivated to develop language competences in a non-classical manner, by experiential learning and educational games. \r\nThe project will be implemented by collaborative working of 9 schools from all over Europe: 3 high-schools focused on Arts which will guide the Art related activities (Romania1, England and Portugal), 4 elementary schools with English and Arts expertise at their level which will contribute to the creation of the Art-based English teaching activities (Cyprus, Croatia, Slovenia and Turkey) and 2 Computer Science high-schools in charge with transferring the teaching activities into the digital book (Spain and Romania2).\r\nThe target groups will be made of students aged 6 to 18, according to each partner school\u2019s type.\r\nThe project will last for 36 months: September 2015 \u2013 August 2018.\r\nFrom October 2015 till March 2018 we will create the course and its curricula which will include the rationale, objectives, learning contents, learning activities, and expected results, indicators of achievement and evaluation tools, time resources and methodological suggestions for English classes taught through Art-oriented activities. It will contain 8 modules, one for each month of the school year, consisting of various learning topics which will cover different areas of interest/ knowledge connected with everyday life/ human activities/ natural environment and/or with Arts. Starting from these topics, each partner school will make 2 lesson plans for English classes which should be taught through Art-oriented activities. Each lesson will include English, Art and ICT tasks. According to their own school type, each partner will suggest 2 lessons for either primary, lower secondary or high-school students, respectively. There will be 144 lesson plans totally which will serve as support for local project activities (classes held in each partner school) and short-term students exchanges. During these activities films, photos, and ICT and art-related tutorials will also be created to illustrate parts of the project activities. These digital materials will be used for creating the digital version of the book.\r\nFrom April 2018 till June 2018 we will make the augmented reality book in paper format containing project-related information, videos and images created during the project\u2019s activities which can be read both in the classical way and by using a device (smartphone, tablet) having installed Aurasma. There will be organized 6 short-term students exchanges and 6 teaching activities aimed at trying out the course curricula created at local level. \r\nFor a good project management and implementation there will be organized 3 transnational project meetings, one at the beginning of each year of the project. \r\nAmong project results, we can mention:\r\n-a new website .eu domain which will contain the course curricula, project information and an e-learning platform\r\n-the course curricula on paper and in its digital version which will be freely available and openly licensed for downloading from our e-learning platform for anyone interested in using it as teaching aid. The augmented reality book will be printed in several copies so that each partner school's library could have it. Other books can be offered to schools on different occasions.

Therefore, Arts Education is a universal human right, for all learners, including those who are often excluded from education, such as immigrants, cultural minority groups, and people with disabilities.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, with our common project, \u201cexplore culture: bit by bit\u201d, we want to develop in students, with disabities or not, and, not least, in the teachers and educators, a real awareness of the importance of Art and, especially in our days, of their relationship with Multimedia.\r\n\r\nMultimedia is very helpful and fruitful in education due to its characteristics of interactivity, flexibility and the integration of different media that can support learning. The provision of interaction is the biggest advantage of the digital media in comparison with other media. It refers to the process of providing information and response. However, many aspects need to be taken into account when using Multimedia in education. Even though multimedia is offered worldwide, access to learning materials and computing equipment differs from country to country. The use of multimedia by students needs to be supported by very skilled teachers. They must guide students through the learning process and provide them with appropriate and effective learning strategies\r\n\r\nWith our project, we want to develop an educational programme of interdisciplinary activities on Art and Culture. These initiatives seek to encourage creative thinking as well as new ways of acquiring and developing knowledge. \u201cexplore culture: bit by bit\u201d is a project that intends to develop communication, reflection, creativity and the use of many practical experiments. It brings together different areas of Art and Culture, thinking on the different ages, nationalities, experience and educational needs; it will be a learning space which will seek to make access to culture more democratic. We want to collaborate with different artists and languages that can provide to students and teachers different experiences and realities contributing to the dialogue and openness we strive to achieve.\r\n\r\nMuseums offer a dynamic opportunity to expose students to experiences and explore new ideas in a rich and educational environment. Through interactive exhibits and practical activities, students have the ability to take ownership of their own learning and develop and explore their own curiosities. This unique exposure provides the foundation for creativity, critical thinking, and connection to the world around them.\r\n\r\nAdditional to visits to different museums, the project intends that these visits can be worked by each of the countries in different contexts that could culminate in exhibitions. That is, after the international meetings in each of the countries, the teachers involved, will develop with their students, in their schools, multimedia projects that, if possible, may be the subject of public presentations to the school community. These presentations or exhibitions may be shared for all participating countries through online communication tools.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the partnerships with different artists and museums, the Portuguese part of the project will prioritize collaboration with the newest art museum in Lisbon: MAAT \u2013 Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology. The MAAT is a new cultural proposal that combines these three fields in a space for debate, discovery, critical thinking and international dialogue. An innovative project that brings together a new building, designed by the architect Amanda Levete, and the Tejo Power Station, an example of Portuguese industrial architecture from the first half of the 20th century, and one of the most visited museums in the country. MAAT reflects the desire to present national and international exhibitions with contributions from contemporary artists, architects and thinkers contemplating great themes and current trends.", "http://www.stocktonsfc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035484_5"], [2016, "EATING  FOR LIFE: healthy eating education at school", "Prior Pursglove and Stockton 6th Form College", 112170.0, 7, 7, "According to the World Health Organisation, the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008.Country estimates for 2008 record that over 50% of both men and women in the WHO European Region were overweight, and roughly 23% of women and 20% of men were obese.\u2022 Based on the latest estimates in European Union countries, 30-70% of adults are overweight and obesity affects 10-30% of adults.\u2022 Estimates of the number of overweight infants and children in the WHO European Region rose steadily from 1990 to 2008. Family af\ufb02uence was found to be a signi\ufb01cant indicator of overweight or obesity in around half of the countries surveyed in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey undertaken by the WHO: those from lower af\ufb02uence families were more likely to be overweight or obese. This pattern was strongest in western Europe.Over 60% of children who are overweight before puberty will be overweight in early adulthood. Childhood obesity is strongly associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, orthopaedic problems, mental disorders, underachievement in school and lower self-esteem. The WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity encapsulates an important package of comprehensive and integrated recommendations that will inspire and foster even more action at the European level. The Commission's recommendations to address childhood obesity cover six areas: \u2022 promotion of intake of healthy foods; \u2022 promotion of physical activity; \u2022 preconception and pregnancy care; \u2022 early childhood diet and physical activity; \u2022 health, nutrition and physical activity for school-age children; and \u2022 weight management.Such a massive agenda could not be addressed in a small scale project such as this, so the principal aim of this project is therefore to introduce the basic principles of healthy eating to schools and students, and to develop effective ways to encourage students and school communities to examine their eating habits and modify them in order to promote healthy outcomes. The project will encourage and facilitate schools, teachers and pupils to share knowledge and good practice about the ways that healthy eating is encouraged and supported in a number of European countries.The project will ask young people from each of the partner schools to examine some of the food options and choices made by young people in the participating countries. Through a series of practical, planned and shared events in five countries, working with significant groups such as parents and teachers, healthy eating will be investigated and encouraged. It will be supported by the creation of a bank of healthy eating resources contributed by the participating schools and contained on a dedicated project website, which will be linked to each of the partner schools' own websites, and which will provide a sustainable legacy from this project for those schools and their communities.In the first year of the project, in each country involved, partner schools will:- Research the incidence of obesity and poor nutritional diet in their country, locality and school- Investigate the eating habits in their country, locality and school; - Look at the impact that healthy eating can have in the fight against obesity;- Investigate the strategies that are in place at local and national level to promote and support a healthy diet. - Share their findings via an online website to be established as part of the project activities.As this work continues in each country and school, a series of Blended Mobility activities will begin and continue, one in each of five countries - over the course of the project each of five schools will host, prepare and organise a learning activity attended by a delegation of students and accompanying persons from the other partner schools, at which they will present the food and eating culture of their region and country, highlighting the healthier and unhealthier aspects, and suggesting ways of adapting the diet to promote good health. The success of each event will be evaluated by the participants, and the learning will be shared with the other partners and disseminated more widely though the online tools to stakeholders in each country.On the basis of what they found through their research, and what they learnt from other partners during the Blended Mobility activities, the students of each partner school will: - Develop resources to promote and support healthy eating so that the work of the partnership can be disseminated locally, regionally and nationally. This will include the collation of healthy recipes from each of the project partners, and everything produced will be shared online with students from the other partner schools to provide European added value.

The idea for the  project stems from the beneficial teaching and learning experiences gained by staff who have participated in the  Comenius/Leonardo projects and also the new Erasmus plus KA1/2. Although these project were and are student based staff supporting the students gained valuable experience and new ideas from working with partners from other European countries. The college has a international policy that anticipates further growth in European projects and the participation of members of the teaching staff in this is important in the context of deeper Europeanisation of the college. During the last 10 years the college has found participation in European projects an effective way of overcoming the marginalisation caused by both the peripheral location of the town of Stockton on Tees and also the socio economic inequalities  of the towns demographics.After careful selection and preparation, a cohort of teachers will travel to Cyprus to gain expertise in the following 2 areas; \u201cInteractive media for \u201cinteractive\u201d teaching and learning\u201d and \"Project based teaching and learning\" This will be done through the completion of a 5 day intensive course. Both these areas ofter opportunities for fairly rapid classroom deployment. A clear objective will be to develop skills, techniques and tools that can be disseminated rapidly to the whole of the body of teaching staff. A second objective will be to support the colleges reputation as an international college with a strong focus on deeper European partnership. This project offers the opportunity to undertake CPD in a  partner country married to the possibility of forging new partnerships. During the project support will be provided by a dedicated international manager and the input of the head of college CPD. In total, some16 teachers will simultaneously attend 2 different training courses. The teachers will undergo a selection process based on the likely benefits to the individual teachers both in terms of their own professional development (inputs) and also significantly on their ability to disseminate the projects technical and also valorise the European aspects of the project with particular emphasis on the building of links and partnerships with colleagues from across the European Union(outputs). ResultBy the end of the project 16 teaching or support staff  will have undergone training in a European context. They in turn will have disseminated new skills and techniques to the remainder of the teaching and support staff. This will in turn lead to the rapid deployment of a number of new new teaching tools, skills and techniques. A further positive outcome will be the development  of new links and partnerships with EU partners.", "http://www.stocktonsfc.ac.uk", "Prior Pursglove and Stockton 6th Form College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023683_coordinator"]]}}, "6HZ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTR", "Guisborough General Hospital", "nhs_RTRAQ"]]}}, "8DW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Un itin\u00e9raire vers autrui pour une rencontre en terre inconnue", "Galley Hill Primary School", 88723.0, 2, 4, "Context: This project involves 4 schools located in isolated and landlocked areas far from any borders.
