However, this vast amount of cultural heritage material can also be overwhelming for many users who are provided with little or no guidance on how to find and interpret this information.

The system will offer suggestions about items to look at and assist in their interpretation. Navigation will be based around the metaphor of a path through the collection. A path can be based around any theme, for example artist and media ('paintings by Picasso'), historic periods ('the Cold War'), places ('Venice') and famous people ('Muhammad Ali').
