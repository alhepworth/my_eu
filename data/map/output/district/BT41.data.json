We regularly carry out all the planned mobilities, which we expand every year, as we want to find quality learning places for all the educational programs that we implement. We update the content of curricula based on experience from abroad. Cooperation with education organizations lead to several examples of good practices (eg transfer of chemical labeling practices) to the introduction of modern methods of teaching. With mobility, we raise the level of professional profile of staff and thus the quality of the education process. VET practical education abroad enables the integration of professional and soft competences - in practice and in daily organizational problems. We strive to maintain a constant connection with global trends in the profession and the labor market, and therefore we strongly encourage staff training and therefore we cooporate in Erasmus + program as well as with national programs (Raising Vocational Teacher Competencies).\r\nIn the past year, we met with ECVET expert and implemented improvements to follow ECVET principles more systematically. In recognizing student learning outcomes, we take into account and assess the acquired knowledge abroad. One of the novelties is the form, which gives us an assessment of the practical knowledge of every student at a foreign employer. All participants in mobility also receive Europass mobility.\r\nThe selection of students is carried out on the basis of published criteria and the counseling service can propose candidates according to special needs and social status.\r\nWe pay special attention to the preparation of students for mobility - we conduct a workshop on preparing CVs and take care of the transfer of international experiences among students. A part of the preparations is also a language course and a review of the geography / history of the host.\r\nTeachers are involved in the preparation of documents and the organization of the path, and receive practical information from colleagues who have already been on training in a given host country.\r\nIn the past year, we attended a workshop at CMEPIUS entitled \"Strengthening the employment potential of students\" and implemented new methods in the framework of student mobility evaluation. After mobility, we meet with students and we embed an international experience with an emphasis on the acquired soft competencies. In this way, students share informal experiences with us, and on the basis of the information obtained we improve the next mobility and prepare students better for them.\r\nWith teachers returning from mobility, we discuss the quality of work placements and staff training places in order to improve them in the future. After the completion of the project, teachers are provided with instructions for obtaining points. They also submit a report to their pedagogical supervisor, to fulfill their training announced in the yearly work plan.\r\nStudents give their experiences to classmates and the general public (blog), and teachers to staff and employers. The result of knowledge learned abroad is a book pastry Kruharije & Cukrnije with recipes and methods, which have been taught abroad for many years.

In the individual discipline (special goals) we would like to achieve: \r\nQualify veterinary technicians for the work in a veterinary team, improve their skilled supportive care for sick animals; in order to achieve these objectives, participants will work in veterinary clinics in the UK and Ireland, shelter for horses in Italy and shelter for abandoned animals in Cyprus .\r\nStudents in the field of nature conservation will carry out mobility in a school laboratory in Finland where they will obtain analytical competence. In addition, nature protection technicians will also carry out field work in a tree nursery and afforestation. \r\nStudents  in the field of food processing will carry out mobility in a professional laboratory for olive oil analysis.\r\nBakers and confectioners will work in the bakery and confectionery school workshops and in manufacturing plants. They will participate in the preparation of desserts and bakery products. They will learn how to communicate with customers and suppliers. \r\nIn order to implement the project, we have established a project team with the main coordinator who will coordinate all activities; further, we have determined coordinators for individual mobility who will be responsible for their smooth implementation.\r\nIn order to select participants the institution will publish an invitation to tender opened to all interested students of the school.

After 2 years of experience as a Consortium, the strategy of internationalization of the VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE (CFA) has improved and continues to adapt to everybody\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nOur Consortium also got bigger and the number of mobilities almost doubled. The international experiences are seen as a process integrated into the course of training, Masters of Apprenticeship consider them as an increase in value more than a constraint, our foreign partners are involved in a bigger reciprocity today and we work finally on the certification of these experiences.\r\n\r\nNumber of mobilities 2017-2019 :\r\n\u2022 Learners: 154\r\n\u2022 Accompanying persons: 37\r\n\u2022 Members of staff: 31.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Consortium are more numerous and more diversified. The EPLEFPA Lyon-Dardilly-Ecully consists of 4 constituent centers: high school, CFPH, Regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE and the Horticultural farm. The agricultural and horticultural regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE consists of 20 UFA. Every UFA is also constituent center of an EPLEFPA most of the time. Among the 10 members of the Consortium we count as many UFA as High schools and EPLEFPA. This variety of profiles explains that we make demands of mobility for mixed audience (learning and initial training) who have a common route of training. Our project grows richer year after year and the European culture, the exchange of practices, propagate in all these organizations.\r\n\r\n7 institutions composed our Consortium 2015-2017; 3 new UFA have joined the project involving new partners (Spain, the United Kingdom). Therefore, a total of 10 institutions participate in this Consortium EFP for 2017-2019. These 10 institutions have decided to get together to mutualize the initiatives, coordinate the actions, to unite the work force, the technical skills and to benefit from a shared financial management. Mobility resource teams (an education-administration binome task force per institution) are associated to the development of the project to determine orientation, the general and specific objectives, strategy... They are the link between the Regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE and the mobilities in every institution.\r\n\r\nThe objective is more than ever to develop and to strengthen individual mobility in these establishments, with a growing demand from the learners, their families and the professional partners. Indeed, the discovery of new skill techniques, the improvement of the foreign language level, the opening to the European citizenship, the improved autonomy in the work field and in everyday life are so many assets approved by all the actors of the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium II EFP project will be spread out over two years (2017-2019) to facilitate the pedagogy of alternating qualification courses: so according to the seasonality of the sectors and the rhythms of alternation of the UFA, each of them, with the cooperation of the French employers, can schedule the departures of learners, trainers, members of the teams and the associated professionals.\r\nFor the learners, establishments propose mobilities in a company for two or three weeks in agreement with the French employers. This duration provides enough time for the learner to become integrated into the host company and to discover new techniques without penalizing the French employer in his professional activity.\r\n\r\nThe staffs, as for them, will leave from 2 to 7 days for mobility in training centers and partner companies. \r\n154 apprentices and 37 accompanying persons will leave for mobility in Italy, Germany, Romania and Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Spain, The United Kingdom, Ireland \u2026: back to France, they will use the observations made in the partner country, to present their life in a company but also their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis year we have developed the chapter \"scattering\" and \"valuation\" to take advantage of these experiences to speak about the project. Furthermore, we have launched a more elaborate quality approach to be sure of the relevance of the project and to maintain a reflexive approach.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, profits are multiple: an enrichment of the professional practices for the apprentices and the staffs, an interest generated within the teams and the learners around international exchanges, intercultural exchanges, valuation of the various actors involved in the project, which already impact on the participating establishments.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036978_2"], [2018, "CAFRE VET Application 2018", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 29940.0, 2, 2, "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nThe VET Learner and Staff mobility applied for is to partner with College ten Doorn \u2022 Zuidmoerstraat 125, 9900 EEKLO \u2022 Belgium  (website: www.collegetendoorn.be) to enable 12 CAFRE agriculture students to work in Belgium for 2 weeks in Spring 2019. It also incldes a preparatory visit by one CAFRE staff to visit College ten Doorn in the autumn 2018. The relationship between CAFRE and College ten Doorn has been established as CAFRE is hosting a two week traineeship for 15 College ten Doorn agriculture students in March 2018, following a staff visit in January 2018. \r\n\r\nThe remit of the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) is to develop the competencies and values of people entering and working in the agri-food industry and to provide them with the capability to contribute to the sustained economic growth of the industry and the development of the rural society.\r\nFor the agriculture sector this involves\r\n\u2022 Providing training for new entrants. CAFRE is the main provider for agriculture in Northern Ireland and is the only college in the island of Ireland offering courses from Level 2 to Master\u2019s Degree level.\r\n\u2022 Providing skills based and managerial training for existing businesses\r\n\u2022 Supporting farmers and growers through Business Development Groups, providing group based learning and provision of advice and technology transfer.\r\nCAFRE Programmes are strongly vocational and learners completing agriculture programmes either return home to farm, pursue successful careers in the agri- food industry or continue with their education.\r\nThis project targets students completing the first year of the Level 3 Diploma in Agriculture delivered either fulltime, part-time or work-based. At Level 3, students combine practical husbandry skills with the underpinning knowledge needed to work in industry.  This group has been selected as they have:\r\n\u2022 Developed the basic skills needed to be able to work in industry\r\n\u2022 Have already some experience of working in industry\r\n\u2022 Recognise the differences in approach to managing a business in Northern Ireland with that in another country such as Belgium.\r\n\u2022 An opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills developed whilst on mobility to their coursework in the final year of their programme and\r\n\u2022 Disseminate the outcomes of the mobility to the students who enrol in September 2019.\r\nIt is anticipated that 12 students will take place in the mobility in March / April 2019. They will complete 10 days working in industry across a range of businesses, visit specialist agri-food businesses and cultural centres. \r\nThe expected outcomes of the mobility are:\r\n\u2022 Development of enhanced employability and vocational skills of students through work placement\r\n\u2022 Improved self-confidence\r\n\u2022 Acquisition of a high level of practical skills\r\n\u2022 Gain a broader range of experiences through working in businesses in Europe which will encourage students to be more mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the mobility is to help develop rounded individuals so monitoring will cover both the placement and social / cultural aspects of the mobility.\r\nAs the experience of living and working in another country will be challenging for participants, CAFRE regards all mobility participants as coming within the definition of \u201cvulnerable adults\u201d and is putting a high level of support. There therefore will always be a member of CAFRE staff on duty or on call to deal with eventualities.\r\nCAFRE staff will accompany the students to their placements on the first day, assist with introductions and ensure participants know exactly what is require from them. They will also visit the students each day on placement to monitor progress. This is also an opportunity for CAFRE to meet their supervisors in industry and establish links which will be of use during the review process.\r\nAs staff will be staying in the same accommodation as the student, staff will meet informally with the participants daily to discuss activities, address any issues or concerns that may arise and plan for the following day.\r\nParticipants will be encourage to reflect on what they have done and achieved which will enhance the value of the learning.\r\nProgress will be measured against the individuals learning plan agreed prior to departure. All achievements will be mapped against the learning outcomes of their programme and will contribute to the achievement of their target qualification.\r\nStaff accompanying the group will be required to produce a detailed report fro CAFRE Management on their return and disseminate the outcome of their training to course teams as they plan for future mobilities. \r\nPlacements are most likely to be in rural areas not accessible by public transport. Therefore the CAFRE staff will also be responsible for transporting students to and from their placements.\r\nThe staff will also be responsible for managing the budget and for accompanying participants on cultural and planned activities / visits to a range of locations of vocational interest.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047550_coordinator"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 5794.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047223_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 4746.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-013006_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 2553.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035486_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 2224.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000465_coordinator"]]}}}}
