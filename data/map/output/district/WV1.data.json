An emerging trend towards this direction is the integration of on-demand modes in conjunction with public transport, leading to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) concept. MaaS is a user-centric, intelligent mobility distribution model, in which users' needs are met via a single platform and are offered by a service provider, the mobility operator.

However, conventional concrete technology requires slow, heavy, noisy, expensive, energy-consuming and often dangerous mechanical vibration to compact the concrete and to develop strength and durability. Modern technology; Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) is now available, where concrete can simply flow freely into the pre-formed moulds, or formwork, and eliminates the need for compaction.\n\nDespite of the steady increase in SCC usage in Europe and worldwide, its adoption in general construction has not been as rapid as expected. The full benefits of SCC are far from being exploited. One of the main reasons for this is its high materials costs (one and half times) compared to conventional concrete.  This is because SCC requires a substantial quantity of fine powder to give the concrete the necessary cohesion to achieve its flowing properties, and prevent segregation. Special high range water reducers are essential for providing the high filling ability required. Sometimes, viscosity modifying admixtures are also required to prevent segregation and bleeding in the fresh mix.\n\nThe main objective of this project is to increase the economical (i.e. reduce materials costs) and environmental (i.e. use wastes) benefits by examining the potential of using quarry waste fines and novel cost effective and environmentally friendly admixtures for SCC mixes.

The fellow will propose a comprehensive approach to the UK deportation regime, taking into account its various components: (1) immigration policies, (2) agencies that enforce them, (3) public debate that accompanies changes in migration policies and their implementation, (4) migrants that become deportable and are deported, as well as (5) return migrants and stayers back in sending countries who consider migrating to the UK and who adjust their (im)mobility strategies according to, or resisting, migration policies. The project assumes that the deportation regime is a transnational phenomenon, since it concerns not only people in migrant-receiving countries, but also in migrant-sending counties. The research offers an analysis of the largest migrant group in the UK, the Poles. The case of the Polish migrants will offer an insight into how the transnational UK deportation regime becomes rooted among migrants and develops back in their hometown communities.

It balances visual, emotional and biological benefits of lighting for humans; promotes good vision and simultaneously satisfies human emotional and biological needs; and takes into account that light also stimulates non-visual effects on our psychology and physiology. Given that every human is constantly exposed to lighting, massive introduction of HCL could have a significant social and economic impact for the EU.  With this potential in mind, the European Strategic Roadmap 2025 of the EU lighting industry association demonstrates the paradigm shift from \u2018energy efficiency\u2019 to  \u2018light for wellbeing\u2019. The industry aims, together with EU legislators, for the growth of the European lighting market through more intelligent and Human Centric Lighting. This will result in an increased number of jobs in Europe. At the same time, educational programmes for this topic in Europe are falling behind, failing to produce the graduates (and numbers) required. There are significant growth and employment opportunities that are not being tackled. \r\n\r\nTo respond to this challenge, the LIGHT4HEALTH partnership brings together six internationally renowned institutions from the UK, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Russia, and the US, to bring together their advanced research and teaching expertise on the intersection of lighting design and health research in a validated cross-disciplinary course offer of excellence, extended with rich and professionally produced open educational materials, and an online Virtual Lab platform aimed at accessibility and fostering implementation across Europe. To establish a strong link between health research and lighting design, the project partners will select the most relevant health research methods, tools, and findings in Neurology, Photobiology, Neuroendocrinology, Neurobehavioral Studies, Psychophysiology of Perception, as well as Behavioral, Cognitive and Environmental Psychology, and will introduce them into lighting design curricula by producing a dedicated cross-disciplinary course LIGHT4HEALTH.\r\n\r\nRegular consultations with lighting industry stakeholders will guide the consortium's selection of learning methods, learning objectives, assessment criteria, research methodologies, and required knowledge, skills, and competences, filling the gap between research, education and the workplace. Three innovative teaching modules comprising the course will be validated through test-runs in the format of transnational Summer Schools at partner organizations, resulting in first-hand experience and feedback data.\r\n\r\nVarious participants are considered for the pilots and beyond.

Four public events at national, EU, and international level will be the main activities of dissemination and communication for relevant stakeholders who are essential not only as the target audience, but also as users of the Virtual Lab, multipliers of the knowledge generated, and a source of valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nLIGHT4HEALTH's impact will be strongest at EU level, while also providing benefits to society and the economy at local, regional and national level, along with other Erasmus+ and EU activities. Through intensive cross-border and cross-disciplinary cooperation, the project will trigger processes and produce results that are likely to become self-sustaining and develop further, such as the LIGHT4HEALTH teaching community and the Virtual Lab.

We expect that two target groups who will particularly benefit from improved workplace communication are D/deaf/hearing-impaired (D/deaf/HI) workers, and migrant workers. \r\n\r\nThis objective has been formulated around known needs, based on existing research policy, and is strongly aligned with Erasmus+ objectives and priorities. \r\n\r\nThe European Framework Directive 89/391 on Safety and Health at Work is a milestone in improving safety and health at work, which guarantees minimum safety and health requirements throughout Europe. Employers are therefore strongly motivated to ensure their employees' H&S in the workplace, and an easy way for all employees to communicate urgent messages, particularly in high-risk situations, will help to do this. It will also reduce employer's concerns about workplace communication issues, which should encourage an increase in the employment of D/deaf/HI people, and migrants, (acting on the horizontal priority of social inclusion). Furthermore, according to the Health and Safety Executive, manufacturing and construction are the industries with the highest rates of industrial deafness cases, and so employers who do not have systems in place for D/deaf/HI employees are likely to lose more experienced workers whose hearing becomes impaired over time. This further relates to the aging of the workforce, an issue raised in the EC's Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nThe project will create 4 intellectual outputs:\r\n\r\nO1 - Sign vocabulary\r\nAround 200 health and safety words and phrases, created in English by experts in manufacturing, health and safety and sign language, then transferred into a signed form (based on International Sign wherever possible). \r\n\r\nO2 - Online glossary\r\nGlossary with videos of all the sign vocabulary signs, with translation (and additional information where required) in English, British Sign Language, German, Austrian Sign Language, Italian and Italian Sign Language. \r\n\r\nO3 - E-learning resource\r\nOnline (desktop and mobile) e-learning resource with bite-sized, scenario-based learning activities, taking videos from the online glossary in order to teach the sign vocabulary. \r\n\r\nO4 - Guidelines for diversity in health and safety\r\nInformation on national health and safety qualifications, how the e-learning resource can be incorporated into VET providers' existing health and safety training courses, and information about how people with hearing impairment can specialise in a career in health and safety. \r\n\r\nPartners have identified eight groups of people from which participants can be recruited:\r\n\r\n- Employees with hearing impairment\r\n- Migrant employees\r\n- Employees with no hearing or language issues (they will also need to use the sign vocabulary if it is to become widespread)\r\n- Health and Safety experts and/or officers\r\n- Training Curricula developers\r\n- Human Resource policymakers\r\n- Social-inclusion activists\r\n- Health and Safety teachers\r\n\r\nThe ultimate impact that the project aims for is Increased access to employment for D/deaf/HI and migrant community.

In particular, the AEERO project will contribute towards the objectives of the 'Agenda for New Skills and Jobs' by equipping people with the right skills needed for jobs in aerospace; a sector with enormous potential and need for growth within the supply chain in the face of non-EU competition.The size of potential growth for the sector is indicated by the unparalleled demand which will see the number of passenger aircraft in service more than double over the next 20 years. This has been documented by a number of respected sources, including the Aerospace Growth Partnership (a UK aerospace collaboration between government and industry) and SEMTA (the UK sector skills council for science, engineering and manufacturing technologies). This indicates how imperative it is that high quality training is produced and delivered which is both relevant to the sector needs and is also engaging to the target audiences.AEERO fulfills this need by creating an innovative online learning resource in English, Italian and Portuguese (3 key languages in the global aerospace industry). The platform will be designed to meet user needs and contain easily accessible, media rich learning materials and resources that are pertinent to the vocational skills required by engineers across the EU aerospace industry, from supply chain to preventative and breakdown maintenance.The learning outcomes and the delivery methods will be informed by the needs identified through detailed and project specific analysis of the training requirements of sectoral employers and employees. Training partners in each of the partnered countries have independently undertaken previous analysis of employer demand wither through EU projects or commercial activity which will provide a sound basis for a cohesive project methodology.

The ever increasing importance of instilling a European and more widely 'globalised' identity of the university and ambition among it's students and staff is a necessity in the evolution of our role, regionally, nationally and internationally. The project aims to address the underlying requirements of this sub-strategy by continuing to build on the successful foundation we have already built in broadening the aims, ambitions and horizons of our students by offering them the opportunity to realise a period of European work experience through previous and current mobility projects. We aim to strengthen existing partnerships and in doing so open such opportunities to a greater number of participants from a more specific selection of vocational academic fields. The outcome of these aims and objectives will be to inject international dynamism to the local and regional knowledge base that helps to underpin the local and national economy, sharing best practice in industry and driving creativity and talent forward in an ever more global economy.We hope to offer a range of work placements to a total of 31 students aiming to add value to their studies by undertaking a Sandwich Year placement in another European country, and recent graduates in need of industry experience. In particular we are aiming to target The Built Environment, Hospitality & Tourism, Engineering, Education and ICT. These opportunities will be offered in collaboration with partners selected for their experience in the field of providing 'host' organisational services in the Lifelong Learning arena across four locations in Europe. Our partners will provide end-to-end services from logistical support and project monitoring and administration to certification and final reporting, but most importantly, we trust that all partners have the networks and expertise to deliver dynamic, engaging and challenging traineeships opportunities for our participants. The partners we have selected in this bid are continuing to prove their ability to meet our needs through current HE and VET mobility projects. Having embedded International placement opportunities in to our Careers and Employability services offer, we hope to continue to support our students and recent graduates in achieving a period of international work experience.We follow already tried and tested methodologies implementing improvements where they can be identified. From the initial project proposal we have developed a communication framework that will identify the correct calibre of candidate, support individual progress and achieve individual learning outcomes whilst supporting the development of language skills and disseminating results and measuring impact.Our experience in the delivery of European mobility projects shows that at an individual level we increase the confidence and ambition of students as well as their experience and skills base ultimately impacting on our increasingly successful employability record reflected in the rise in DELHE statistics in recent years. In continuing to work with established partners whilst adding to our portfolio we continue to build the university's capacity for networking and corporate cooperation which again feeds back in to our internationalisation sub-strategy in the context of our European activities.Longer term benefits for the region will be a workforce and local talent base better equipped for the demands of the modern European market place contributing to the development of world class vocational industry skills base which will support the local, regional and national economy in the years to come.

According to the European MOOC Scoreboard, 675 courses have been offered freely by European universities between March 2015 and February 2016. However, despite this impressive offering, there are few examples within the EHEA of institutions strategically deploying MOOCs to complement their own educational offer. Apart from virtual mobility arrangements among selected universities, partnerships in ICT-supported teaching and consequent recognition of achieved learning outcomes are scarce in European HEIs.The ECs 2013 Communication on Opening up Education states that \u201cIn addition to broadening access to education, wider use of new technology and open educational resources can contribute to alleviating costs for educational institutions and for students, especially among disadvantaged groups\u201d. At the moment, this potential of MOOCs is not being fully realised, due to a lack of uniform arrangements for recognition, transferability and portability of credit, as well as due to an immature evaluation framework for assessing the quality and cost-effectiveness of the same MOOCs.In particular, MOOCs have the potential of \u201cSupporting the efforts of EU countries to integrate refugees in Europe's education systems and ensure their skills development is an urgent task in the light of the current migration crisis\u201d (EC, 2016). Refugees face legal, linguistic and financial barriers to enter Higher Education, in addition to the challenges coming from the \u2018lost time\u2019 obtaining refugee status, finding accommodation, re-establishing links with family etc. With the help of credit-bearing MOOCs, students would be able to begin introducing themselves to their studies at their own pace, without needing to enroll the institutions, knowing that this credit would be eventually recognised towards their final degree, once they were able to access Higher Education more formally. Alternatively, MOOCs could help refugees top-up specific skills and directly enter the labour market.Thus, the MOONLITE project has been designed to:-Widen and improve the HEIs teaching for registered HEI students (1st mission) -Create new educational pathways for refugees (serving society, 3rd mission) and-Build entrepreneurial and language skills among those two groupsThe MOONLITE consortium is made up of experienced actors in the field, and between them include actors with experience in:-Designing and running MOOCs-Designing solutions for MOOC recognition and assessment-Setting up quality frameworks for MOOCs-Coordinating groups of institutions producing MOOCs-Researching the contribution of MOOCs to language teachingSpecifically, the consortium aims to:-Identify opportunities and barriers in recognizing MOOC-based learning for students and refugees-Create institutional and cross-institutional scenarios to exploit MOOCs for credit-bearing HEI courses & future employability amongst students and refugees-Implement a set of scenarios in partner HEIs and amongst our partnership reaching 175 learners, refugees and registered students-Create a cost-benefit analysis tool, allowing Higher Education Institutions to calculate the impact of MOOC-provision on their triple bottom lines (financial, environmental, social)-Run an open online course targeted at MOOC providers and refugee support groups on how to design and utilize MOOCs for refugees while make learning resources available beyond course duration-Create a vision and recommendations, aimed at European policy makers and institutional leaders, for a more viable and strategic role of MOOCs in European HEIsThe project will help Europe consolidate around a more coherent approach to credentialisation of MOOC-based education. This will in turn lead to an increased flexibilisation of the Higher Education system, by allowing a much greater range of accredited learning opportunities to both enrolled and non-enrolled students.

It has an expansive impact on economic growth, employment and social development. Nevertheless the tourism sector faces a series of challenges, e.g. difficulty of finding and keeping skilled staff or growing demand for customised experiences, new products and growing competition from other EU destinations.\r\nIn June 2010, the European Commission adopted the Communication, \u201cEurope, the world's No. 1 tourist destination \u2013 a new political framework for tourism in Europe\u201d. This communication set out a new strategy and action plan for EU tourism focusing on improving the range of tourism products and services as well as enhancing tourism quality, sustainability, accessibility, skills and ICT use.\r\nAccording to the European Regions Research and Innovation Networks more attention should be given to up-skilling tourism workers and a formal recognition and validation of skills at national and European levels. This holds especially true to where cross boarder mobility is high and many tourism companies experience shortage of skilled workers with a high level of staff turnover. Finding the adequate skilled professionals, in addition to keeping skilled, motivated and knowledgeable staff is key to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the industry sector. On the other hand, many VET learners state that there is a range of free resources to learn English in tourism, but these resources are mainly directed at the hotel sector with focus on the reception and restaurant. Hotels in popular touristic destinations have extended their offers to the wellness sector to offer their guests: manicures, pedicures and massages. Due to the fact that, that hotels work on a global market, the staff in the wellness sector work more and more with international clients and English is quite often used as a common language. Therefore, there is a high need to learn or refresh ones English. Employees in the wellness sector are in many cases not able to attend classes because they may have clients during the normal course times or a basic English course would not fit their needs since does not focus specifically on occupational specific language. \"Assessment and enhancement of vocational language skills in the wellness sector\" (Assess Well) aims to train and further train individuals in the wellness sector.

Together they plan to endeavour on a three year quest to develop a curriculum based on learning outcomes, language learning while taking into account various aspects of the wellness sector, for example: spa management, hygiene, care cosmetics, intercultural competences. The curriculum will be modular in structure and include work-based learning in regards to practical exercises like onsite workshops, job-shadowing, authentic simulations. The outcomes of this curriculum will be based off of a research (desktop and surveys) with the target group: VET schools, providers,  curriculum designers; furthering VET institutions; language teachers in VET; tourism/wellness sector employers and employees.\r\nIn correlation with the curriculum media-based language resources will be developed. About 6 \u2013 7 videos of 10 minutes maximum videos will be developed and include learning outcomes which are based on skills, knowledge and competences for the English language since this is more often than not the lingua franca for the tourism and wellness sector. The resources will include exercises to check for understanding and promote occupational specific language learning for persons who already have a beginners knowledge of English. \r\nBuilding off of the initial outcomes assessment tool for the recognition and validation of language skills and work-based activities in the tourisms sector, this output will be two-fold in that there will be a theoretical knowledge and also a testing portion which will assess learners based on their intercultural competences, ability to converse professionally with customers, ability  to follow the correct steps when performing a treatment etc. The tools will enable assessors to define levels of competences.\r\nTo validate and test the appropriateness of Assess Well, a training concept in which persons can take place in a virtual and/or physical mobility based on the curriculum and resources will be developed.

When it comes to audiodescription and subtitling (practices which offer visually/hearing people an equal opportunity to enjoy arts under comparable circumstances), across Europe there are some good practices but generally the level of implementation of these services is very low. Audiodescription/subtitling has to become the norm, not the exception, as it is today. Unfortunately, the profession of Audiodescriber/Subtitler is still not widespread at EU level and in many countries it is not even recognized as a profession. Many professionals are working in isolation or on a voluntary basis and the possibilities to make their job sustainable over time are very limited. \r\n\r\nThe rationale of the project is that in recent years many projects have been implemented to improve the artistic competences of audiodescribers/subtitlers, but no one has focused on a concrete need of these artists: increase their sense of entrepreneurship in order to foster the creation of new and professional providers of audiodescription/subtitling services which will be sustainable over time. \r\n\r\nThe general objective of the project is thus to promote entrepreneurship and support people working on audiodescription and subtitling to start their own businesses and improve self-employment skills. \r\nThe project will focus on 2 specific objectives: \r\n1) Increase basic enterprise skills of artists/cultural operators working as audiodescribers/subtitlers,\r\n2) Develop practical tools to support artists/cultural operators to start and manage their own business.\r\n\r\nThe objectives will be reached through a set of well-defined activities which will be implemented in 24 months by 6 partners coming from 5 different EU countries:\r\n- 1 international training planned to improve key enterprise skills of people already working in the audiodescription/subtitling sector; \r\n- 1 international training to improve knowledge on how to set up and manage a business which will be successful and sustainable over time;\r\n- development of a practical handbook to concretely support people working in the audiodescription/subtitling sector in starting their own business;\r\n- development of an interactive platform to support audiodescribers/subtitlers to successfully manage their business in order to make future companies sustainable and profitable over time;\r\n- implementation of dissemination activities and 5 multiplier events (2 international and 3 local) to actively involve the participation of stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThe activities will be implemented by a well-balanced partnership composed by 2 non-profit associations (Centro Diego Fabbri and Cultural Centre Wroclaw, 2 private companies: 1 providing the audiodescription and subtitling (Audiosigno) and 1 experienced in accessibility policies and dissemination (ARGO), 1 University (University of Wolverhampton) and 1 business incubator (SASA Inkubator) experienced in delivering tailored training for young entrepreneurs.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036688_coordinator"], [2017, "Leading Learning by Networking", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 210087.0, 6, 6, "The three-years project interlinks two topical issues: school networking and inclusive education.

When talking about professional networks in our project, we mean open, continuously cooperating groups of teachers within one school and across various schools sharing their experience and materials and cooperating in terms of innovations and development of teaching and learning. Many researchers as well as policy makers underline the importance of internal and external support of networks.

In the second sequence, the target group also includes teachers particularly involved in the exchange of experience and improving the quality of teaching through participation in the professional networks aimed at managing diversity at schools.\r\nThe project consortium consists of six partners (CZ, SI, SE, BE, UK, ES), the Czech partner (Masaryk University) is the project coordinator. The project partners have been involved in developing and realising nationally recognized training courses/programmes for headteachers, and they cooperate with entities involved in the development of school policy. All the partner institutions have been in long-term cooperation with a high number of schools and headteachers in research and development projects, too. \r\nThe methodology of the project includes activities as following:  Website and communication platform preparation, theory  on networking review,  assessment of the head teachers/school needs and situation in involved countries \u2013  qualitative study  (interview with headteachers) and quantitative study (questionnaire),  development of Baseline Study, training modules preparation, training modules piloting,  national workshops and Handbook for headteacher trainers  development.\r\nFive headteachers in each country will co-operate on the interviews, examples of good practice, giving feedbacks etc. For the purpose of experience and good practice, the headteachers of the involved (and other) schools may use the project website (national and international sections), they may create contacts and cooperating network of headteachers/schools at the national and international level and they can continue in cooperation even after termination of the project. \r\nThe main project outputs are: Theoretical Framework (text file), a comparative study based on qualitative analysis (text file), comparative study based on quantitative analysis (text file), complete Baseline Study summarizing theoretical and empirical data, and suggestions for traning modules (printed in English and all national languages), Handbook \u2013 training modules (CD).  The quality of the outputs will be reviewed by the experienced external evaluator. The feedbacks from headteachers, national workshops and ENIRDELM conference participants will be incorporated. The outputs will be promoted through project website, national workshops, international symposia at ENIRDELM conferences, closing conference, different national media etc. The training modules and Baseline Study are going to become a part of the training courses implemented in the participating partner institutions and they are therefore going to continue to be used. Dissemination strategies have been developed to make project results available to relevant groups and individuals. The materials will remain available on the website of the project even after the termination of the project, they will be available on CDs, they can be used by a number of educational institutions in many countries around the world.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CZ01-KA201-035502_4"], [2016, "C.I.L. - Cultura e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em L\u00ednguas II", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 198725.0, 5, 30, "The CIL II Project aims to respond to both the common needs of a consortium of 3 training organisations (Centro Europeu de L\u00ednguas, Casa Pia de Lisboa and C\u00e2mara Municipal de Lisboa) and to the individual needs of each of the 3 organisations. As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

The ever increasing importance of instilling a European and more widely 'globalised' identity among it's students and staff is a necessity in the evolution of our role, regionally, nationally and internationally. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to address the underlying requirements of this sub-strategy by continuing to build on the successful foundation we already have  through  broadening the aims, ambitions and horizons of our students by offering them the opportunity to realise a period of European work experience. We aim to increase our portfolio of partnership relationships whilst strengthening existing partnerships and in doing so offer such opportunities to a greater number of participants from a wider background of vocational academic fields. The outcome of these aims and objectives will be to inject international dynamism to the local and regional knowledge base that helps to underpin the local and national economy, sharing best practice in industry and driving creativity and talent forward in an ever more global economy.\r\n\r\nWe hope to offer a broad range of work placements across a variety of vocational areas to 125 students and recent graduates, particularly in the sciences, education, and engineering fields. These opportunities will mainly be long term placements for both, students looking to undertake a sandwich option abroad and final year students hoping to gain the international work experience they will require when establishing themselves in their chosen career pathway. These opportunities will be offered in collaboration with partners selected for their experience in the field of providing 'host' organisational services in the Lifelong Learning arena across five locations in Europe. Our partners will provide end-to-end services from logistical support and project monitoring and administration to certification and final reporting, but most importantly, we trust that all partners have the networks and expertise to deliver dynamic, engaging and challenging traineeship opportunities for our participants.\r\nWe follow already tried and tested methodologies implementing improvements where they can be identified. From the initial project proposal we have developed a communication framework that will identify the correct calibre of candidates, support individual progress and achieve individual learning outcomes whilst supporting the development of language skills and disseminating results and measuring impact.\r\n\r\nOur experience in the delivery of European mobility projects shows that at an individual level we increase the confidence and ambition of students as well as their experience and skills base, ultimately impacting on our increasingly successful employability record reflected in the rise in DELHE statistics in recent years. In continuing to work with established partners whilst adding to our portfolio, we continue to build the university's capacity for networking and corporate cooperation which again feeds back in to our internationalisation sub-strategy in the context of our European activities.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits for the region will be a workforce and local talent base better equipped for the demands of the modern European market place, contributing to the development of a world class vocational industry skills base which will support the local, regional and national economy in the years to come.

In the medium term, the project also aims to facilitate the integration of mobility into national training systems, and also to promote the recognition of the knowledge and skills acquired during mobility through the attribution of valid credits. In this way, the project will contribute towards lifelong learning in the truest sense of the term, by ensuring that the resulting competence and enhanced employability will serve to reduce the risk of social and professional exclusion and, on the contrary, improve awareness of active European citizenship.\r\nThe participants selected will have clearly followed a training path relevant to the achievement of these objectives, but are currently facing difficulties as far as breaking into the job market is concerned. In order to remove this obstacle the participants need to acquire some form of competitive advantage, especially given the fact that the current scenario of socio-economic crisis in Europe is leading employers to further reduce the number of employees and, at the same time, make higher demands in terms of required qualifications. As a result, young people without access to a chance to develop key skills, to gain professional experience and to prepare themselves for entry into the market, may risk long-term unemployment or find themselves obliged to accept survival work which has nothing to do with their chosen career. In either case, this inevitably leads to frustration, and sometimes even to social and professional exclusion.\r\nTransnational mobility, promoted by a high quality project, creates added value in terms of employability by means of better language skills, not just for social integration but also for professional development, and by means of a clearer understanding of the European dimension of life and work in the future. Mobility brings citizens together, increases mutual understanding and tolerance and boosts confidence to face a world of instability, uncertainty and insecurity in relation to the near future. By providing valid, transparent, clearly-certified qualification which can be easily recognised by employers, mobility also increases the participants\u2019 levels of competitiveness and employability. \r\nThis project will therefore deliver a 13-week mobility programme for 70 young Portuguese citizens who have concluded vocational training, including those from disadvantaged social backgrounds. The project will include language preparation for all participants, adapted to their real communication needs, and will provide specific socio-cultural preparation so as to help develop intercultural competence. The language preparation organised by CEL will be teacher-led and will include the use of our own materials, specifically created for this purpose. At the end of the experience, the participants will be evaluated and given a language competence certificate issued in accordance with the C.E.F.R. for Languages and stating the contexts in which skills have been acquired. Following this preparatory stage, the participants will begin a 13-week work placement experience, seamlessly connected to their existing training path, certified in accordance with national vocational training legislation and clearly indicating the skills acquired and the performance level of each participant. Finally, these several forms of certification will be linked by Europass Mobility certification, clearly indicating to potential employers the content of the work placement and the knowledge and skills acquired, and will therefore demonstrate the capacity of the participant to take initiative in the construction of his own future career.  \r\nThe mobility experiences to be carried out under the terms of this project will occur between Sep. 2015 and June 2016 and will involve 21 partners from 8 member states of the EU, chosen for their proven competence in guaranteeing excellence in mobility and for their specialised knowledge of the specific professional sectors in which the participants wish to pursue their careers. Upon conclusion of this transnational experience, the participants will therefore be able to approach the job market with an enhanced profile, a completely new perspective of their future and a greater spirit of innovation and determination.\r\nWe firmly believe that this project will make an active contribution towards the fight against unemployment by promoting more and better qualification, relevant lifelong learning and the recognition and validation of real skills acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PT01-KA102-012587_14"], [2014, "DEVELOPING SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES IN VOCATIONAL TRAINING", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 87514.0, 4, 39, "Our proposal is a consequence of the results of an analysis conducted jointly by the three organizations IKASLAN, TKNIKA and the Deputy Ministry of Vocational Training and Lifelong Learning of the Basque government .

Training on entrepreneurial skills and employability skills with work-based training will make young people more employable in Italy and Europe.The project also aims to make the participants more modern, innovative, flexible and attractive to the labor market. This formal, non-formal and work based training, triggers positive changes in terms of self-esteem, language skills, flexibility and organizational skills.The project tackles the reduction of  young people being unemployment and gives the participants entrepreneurial skills increasingly required by the labour market and to obtain a qualified job and the understanding of continuous learning.This project will improve, strengthen and expand the skills and competences acquired in theory, with a work-placement of 22 days in a company in England or Spain.

In addition, we can now teach the skills of well-being, of how to have more positive emotion, more meaning, better relationships and more positive accomplishment.\u201d  In working towards these goals we will be collaborating with two organisations in Italy who bring to the partnership their experience in working with disadvantaged youth from all over Europe, their methodologies for fomenting holistic personal growth and their well-established collaboration with high quality work placement providers. The project aims over a two-year period  to provide 40 students in the fields of Caring for Children, Hospitality and Catering, Art and Design,  Youth Work Practice, and Supporting Teaching and Learning the chance to learn new skills in Italy and thereby inspire creativity, innovation and confidence.  Students will follow a 10 week preparation course in Wolverhampton followed by 3 months on placement in Italy, with follow up, consolidation and evaluation activities on their return. The programme will encompass the following elements:  learning to speak basic Italian and use it both socially and in the workplace; learning specialist techniques for work; developing a positive approach in the workplace including good self-presentation, communication and reliability; raising  awareness of health and safety at work; through a process of reflection and evaluation, increasing  autonomy as life-long learners; taking part in inspirational visits to centres of excellence ; through coaching on mobility  heightening awareness of European values; establishing friendships and working relations with individuals and organizations that will outlast the life of the project.  The project will not only make the individual participants stand out in the job market but will also help the partnership organizations develop new working practices and share areas of expertise.  Success stories from the project will be promoted to prompt businesses and other organizations to get involved with work experience programmes and open up the doors to further  European wide communication and cooperation.", "http://www.aes.wolverhampton.gov.uk", "Wolverhampton City Council", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023709_coordinator"], [2014, "Preparing for Sustainable Work in Art & Design, Food Preparation, and Supporting Teaching and Learning: Wolverhampton-Brescia", "Wolverhampton City Council", 111881.0, 2, 2, "Wolverhampton Adult Education Service strives to help young adults learn employable skills and develop behaviour and attitudes that will best equip them to enter the job market.

Throughout Europe, youth workers strive to invent and deliver activities that will engage with the hard and hardest to reach young people. The project is inspired by the need to find engaging and attractive ways to bring young people back to education.  It is notable that young people who are neither in education, training nor employment (NEETs) have become so because of their personal history of learning (that was often neither fruitful nor enjoyable), a lack of motivation to strive for targets that appear unobtainable, and their lack of confidence in themselves. Media and art themed workshops can address each of these obstacles; providing engaging and enjoyable learning, recognising and enhancing current capabilities, developing confidence, and ultimately promoting young people to set personal targets and take action towards participating in further education and towards employment.Our rationale  and need for the Creative Youthwork Network project is common across our partner countries and more broadly across the EU, addressing high levels of unemployment particularly amongst people with deprivation and disadvantage.This project first designs and delivers a workshop that develops skills and competences in youth workers to act generically to design and facilitate educational workshops aimed at engaging and inspiring hard to reach young people, such as NEETs. Then the workshop builds the skills of youth workers to design, resource and deliver themed workshops.  The project progresses from an outline workshop programme (attached) to full content and resources Having contributed to the overall design of the workshop, each of the project partners will send youth workers to participate. The project culminates in each of the partner organisations designing a themed workshop that is relevant to their nation/region.  This will result in a bank of themed workshops made available as OER, that each of the partner organisations can offer to young people.Through this process of first developing the skills and competencies of youth workers (target group 1), the project then has built capacity to reach and impact directly onto young people (target group 2).  The delivery of such media and arts themed workshops to young people may be regional or national event, that is delivered through the national funding received by the project partners. In building a network of project partners (that has to potential to engage with a growing number of partners), the project has the potential to create a European network of  youth organisations.Hence the project is transnational as it:- develops a consistent level of skills and competencies in youth workers- values and shares musical heritages across Europe- builds a future network of youth organisations who will engage young people with the EU agenda.", "http://www.wcrfm.com/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HR01-KA205-021805_3"]]}}, "4BL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "European vocational training placements in the health and social services sector", "The Haven Wolverhampton", 299012.0, 5, 33, "The field of social and health services is currently among those with the highest employment potential.

It has the highest grape production in the province, is home of one of the most important schools of the territory in the food and agriculture sector, Convitto Corso.For these reasons, in 2015 the Municipality of Correggio submitted the project named \u201cEAT in Emilia\u201d, that has been successfully evaluated and financed by the European Commission in the Erasmus+ programme. Considering the success of this first experience, that had an experimental role, the Municipality of Correggio has extended the dimension of the activities involving all interested actors operating in the provinces of Reggio Emilia, Parma e Modena. \"EAT in Emilia 2\" born from these seeds, grows with the interests shared by Emilia-Romagna Region, which has also set up its own collective mark QC (Controlled Quality), which identifies products environment and health friendly.The action of protection and promotion of Emilian culinary excellences is of strategic importance for the Provinces involved, that are committed to promote awareness and diffusion of the specialties of our land. The beautiful products of Emilian agriculture and typical gastronomy are also strengths of local promotion and tourism of the territory.The partnership is completed by schools and vocational centers of the provinces, business associations, promotion consortia, global enterprises and with a selection of the most appropriate receiving partners.\u201cEAT in Emilia 2\u201d project  arises from the knowledge of the territory, its products and the concept of promotion, but with a strong connotation in marketing, e-communication and e-commerce areas, with pragmatic references to operative tools, including ICT and social media, which allow, through the European benchmark, to develop the best possible performance to be spent on the labor market, raising the employability level of participants.The concept of \u201ctypical food product\u201d is here defined and 'transferred' certainly not from a closing or defensive point of view, but as GLOCAL RESPONSE to the increasing search for quality. This in order to pursue competitiveness and sustainability, fostering the reconfiguration of production systems and giving more negotiation power to farmers and rural groups.We want to enrich our young learners with innovative skills, to support both exploitation policies and SMEs willing to grow in value (and income), providing them with ideas and strategies to develop toward a real \u201cglocalization\u201d. It is no coincidence that the forms of marketing of the typical product that we propose in the project, follow on one side the path of the short chain and on the other the openness to web 2.0 tools, e-business and social business.Every school/vocational center involved will be associated to training experiences characterized by the recognition of credit and able to provide our learners with at least one specific skill/performance among those recognized in the Regional (or National) Qualification Framework, in order to produce new skills and improve local and European employability.We must start from the young people that, with \"EAT in Emilia 2\", will have EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH, through a linguistic-cultural preparation specific for the destination country and thanks to a 5-week/3-month work placement experience in European SMEs, respectively for 95 students and 32 newly graduates. Participants will be able to develop those life skills which are necessary to become a real citizen and to integrate quickly into the labor market.\"EAT in Emilia 2\" responds to the competitiveness and internationalization needs of our enterprises and, at the same time, it offers to young people tools for growing as individuals and facing the labor market with better perspectives and with a portfolio of validated skills and experiences in a clear, recognizable and readable way.The foreseen destination countries are: Spain, Malta, UK, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands and France.", "http://www.cafemaxsim.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005073_13"], [2017, "Learning hospitality in Europe by undergoing a VET traineeship", "Cafe Maxsim", 304309.0, 4, 20, "Over the past 20 years, the technical and vocational education has been subject to numerous reforms and changes that had weakened the training offer. Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased internationalization of training institutions, in line with European standards of education.\r\n\r\n During the project, the Europe Direct Regione Lombardia will disseminate the project among
