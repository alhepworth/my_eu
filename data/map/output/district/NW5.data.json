Over two years, the project will have a clear progression through youth workers\u2019 trainings and media-focused youth exchanges in each country. This will inform and upskill youth workers and help them to tackle radicalisation by building a safe space for young people from the three countries to discuss complex issues, learn about other people\u2019s lives,  develop critical thinking and common values and help them to take their voice outwards and campaign for human rights in a safe and peaceful way.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:  \r\n\u2022 to bring young people from different backgrounds together and enable them to learn about each other's lives \r\n\u2022 to create a safe space for young people to discuss complex issues and work peacefully for human rights and against discrimination \u2022  to enable them to develop their skills in media and in speaking out about their experiences and ideas   \r\n \u2022 to train youth workers to strengthen young people against pressures to radicalise\r\n\u2022  to take the message and the methods of this project out more widely.\r\n\r\nThe project will begin with a youth workers\u2019 training in the UK, which will bring together three youth workers and a leader from each country.  They will exchange understandings of youth work and the current pressures in their own countries, and methods to engage against radicalisation and for human rights. They will prepare all aspects of the following youth exchanges which will bring young people from different countries together to about others\u2019 lives and take action for human rights in a safe and inclusive way.\r\n\r\nThe youth workers will practise the skills learned during three youth exchanges held in France, Palestine and the UK.  Each exchange will bring together young participants to learn about each other\u2019s countries and learn how to take their voice outwards to work against discrimination and for human rights.  Each youth exchange will build on from the previous one as the groups develop knowledge and skills.  The first youth exchange (in France) will look at Anti-Discrimination ,  the second (in Palestine) at Human Rights, the third (in the UK) will focus on Taking Our Voice Outwards (in the UK).  Each will have three parts, beginning with \"Listening and Comparing\" when the participants present their own lives to the young people from the other groups. This will be done during a countryside residential. In the mid-part of each project, \"Building a picture\" will allow the group to meet local youth groups to find out about the local situation in relation to human rights and anti-discrimination.  with a recap of the questions, ideas and media from the previous one. This will be followed by small-group project work under the title \"Making a Change.\"  A variety of non-formal ways of learning will include media work (film, photography and spoken presentations). In each exchange, small teams will do project work to produce outputs to show each other, and (in the last activity) work on ways to reach the wider public and local, national and European representatives.  \r\n\r\nA final youth workers\u2019 exchange in the UK will allow for a full evaluation of the whole project and for dissemination.  \r\n \r\nThe number of participants will be 111 but as people will take part in more than one exchange, this will be 50 or 60 different people. The reach of the project will be much wider as dissemination will be built in from the beginning.  The project will involve 3 youth workers and a leader from each country in Activity (1);   in Activities (2),(3) and (4), a leader, two youth workers and eight young people aged 16-20  from each country. The final activity (5) will again include 3 youth workers and a leader from each country. \r\n\r\nThe project will include public events to reach young people beyond the project, material will be made that will be disseminated and used for future work, young participants will be supported in doing feedback after exchanges and youth workers will cascade their training.  Following the project, materials and recommendations in relation to preventing radicalisation will be published and disseminated.

This is the scenario that shapes our students faces and affects the way, in which young people face their future with very limited expectations focused on the local community, disfavoring personal growth and professional development.\r\nTherefore, there is a clearly need to develop mechanisms that foster the acquisition of professional skills for young people, which will help them to be integrated in the labour market in the future. Erasmus+ will allow them opening new horizons at cultural, social and professional level improving its European projection. We highlight the role of this project as a booster of understanding and visibility of Vocational Training.\r\nThe experience that has been carried out through KA102 \"CADIZ young Europeans\" 2015, 2016 and 2017 projects, supposes for our Consortium a curricular complement needed by local VET schools to acquire an international dimension. The results achieved through the students, endorse the trend towards internationalization, improvement of skills, as well as the increase of their employability career options.\r\nThe Consortium, which develops the project, is coordinated by IFEF \u2013 Cadiz City Council.

Fernando Qui\u00f1ones, Centro M\u00aa Inmaculada and IES Fernando Aguilar Quignon.\r\nCurrently, these local VET schools develop a total of 95 mobilities, having been established since 2015, as a group that work effectively in a collaborative way, in the achievement of the objectives through an equitable distribution of tasks and consolidation of various operating bodies, such as Mobility Committees in each center and a Steering Committee which all members are included.\r\nIn this call, an inclusive project is presented and it will allow the mobility and training of students, teachers and professional experts in the area of Middle-Level Vocational Training; prioritizing the inclusion of students with fewer opportunities and long-term mobilities (Erasmus Pro), including the optimization of quality, use, enjoyment and advantage of student mobility, support and advanced planned visits as a guarantee of success.\r\nThis project will be developed during 24 months between October 2nd, 2018 and September 30th, 2020. A total of 55 young people, 39 students and 14 recent graduates will be involved.  These awarded participants will undertake Erasmus Pro (3- 5 months) and short-term mobility (20 days - 2 months) in the following countries: Italy, Czech Republic, Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal, Greece, Holland, Belgium, France and Malta.\r\nIn addition, 17 Staff Job Shadowing Mobility will be incorporated. This will be carried out in accredited centers in The Netherlands, Germany, France and Belgium. One Expert Mobility will provide training in our Centers for Vocational Training.\r\nThe impact expected on students will be positive on their learning capability and performance. In the medium-long term, it is expected to generate an incentive dynamic of entrepreneurship and mobility, consolidating better academic results and reducing the school dropout rate, as well as, a feeling of belonging to the EU that will help them to work in international environments.\r\nThe participation of students, who are in unfavorable situation in the project, will contribute to their effective inclusion in the educational system, reducing the risk of academic failure and encouraging their access to higher education.\r\nCenters and schools for Vocational Training will have a positive impact on upgrading and internationalization of the school environment, having an improvement in the quality of life-long teaching skills with the effort to adapt to new educational needs, contributing to the development of creating an European culture with the consequent social impact that foreign mobility implies, the improvement of the curricular project and the creation of networks.\r\nAs well, an impact on host partners is expected. This will be as a result of the improvement of procedures and methodologies applied within the company or educational center experienced at first hand other ways of working and doing things.\r\nAt local level, this project will consolidate the commitment established between schools and the local administration to work together to improve the quality of education and training, encouraging educational promotion and internationalization and the development of a more accessible and inclusive educational model.", "http://www.claudinelondon.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048537_4"], [2016, "Young Styrians GO Europe!", "Claudine London", 164243.0, 7, 25, "\u201cYoung Styrians GO Europe!\u201d is the European internship project for all young Styrians in Vocational Education and Training (VET).

The project foresees the allocation of 50 grants for the realization of traineeships in European companies operating in the Fashion industry and located in the United Kingdom, Spain and Lithuania. Beneficiaries of the mobility action will be 20 recent graduates and 30 students in the third and fourth year of studies in the sector \"Clothes and Fashion/Textile production\", coming from the Institutes members of the Consortium. Recent graduates will carry out the mobility within 12 months from their graduation and their traineeship will last 120 days (plus 2 days of travel), duration considered necessary to attain a complete training and professional experience. The traineeship performed by students will last 21 days (plus 2 days of travel) the presence of 4 accompanying persons  is foreseen. The promoters desire to realize this project to address the training and employment needs of the territories in which they are set, where the Fashion industry represents a relevant driver for the local economy and has got a huge potential of development. The fashion sector is composed by highly innovative companies with a great economical potential and it is one of the most dynamic in Europe, contributing for the 7%  gross national product of EU. It has high development rate and offers employment to almost 5 millions of people in Europe (Study on the economy of culture in Europe, 2006, \u201cCreative Economy \u2013 the Challenge of Assessing the Creative Economy \u2013towards informed policy-making\u201d, 2008).Anyway, the fashion sector requires highly qualified operators, with adequate practical and operational competences, transversal competences, including linguistic ones. So it is essential to provide young people  entering the labour market with practical skills and soft skills, to tackle unemployment, to allow companies to have adequate labor force, and, finally, to strengthen the productive capacity of territories. So, the objective of the project is to better qualify local human resources through the carrying out of international mobilities, focusing on the acquisition of technical and transversal skills required by the fashion industry, in order to make the professional profile of the participants more competitive on the labour market, contributing to increase their employability and to takle the phenomenon of massive migration of young people from the areas of origin. Carrying out a traineeship in European companies operating in the fashion industry will enable participants to integrate theoretical studies with practical activities, according to the philosophy of \"learning by doing\". During the traineeship they will be constantly monitored and supported by tutors who will assess their progress, and- at the end of the experience- the learning outcomes achieved, releasing the appropriate certifications.The experience will contribute to achieving the following results in the participants:- Improvement of practical and operative skills in the fashion sector and consolidation of technical and professional knowledge- Improvement of language competences, including the sectorial language of the fashion industry- Knowledge of different labor markets and other economies, new methodologies and practices in the fashion sector- Familiarization with social and cultural contexts of other EU countries, and strenghtening of European citizenship- Development of transversal communication, organizational and problem solving competences- Acquisition of  national and European certification expendable in the labor market- Upgrading and integration of the CV with new competences and experiences- Opportunities for recognition of competences acquired abroad (ECVET)- Improvement of the capacity of identification and evaluation of employment opportunities in the labor marketThe project will have a positive impact on the members of the Consortium, in terms of: capacity building of the organization and management of international activities with local and foreign partners; strengthening of strategies for internationalization and development, introduction of transnational mobility activities as \"systemic\"; updating of curricula to the needs of the area and the world of work.

In October 2014, they will meet in the UK, learn about each other\u2019s country and youth work practice and explore their skills and understandings of working with young people. They will learn about  CADFA\u2019s previous exchanges and the project of grassroots twinning. Working in sector groups,  they will plan for the project exchange visits to the UK  during the following year; they will then lead the preparation, the exchanges and the  follow-up work in their own countries.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth exchanges will  each involve 13 participants from each country plus two leaders. They will use the methods that we have found successful: a residential outside London or Abu Dis followed by time in our base town; using a creative medium that allows an exploration of the differences between the young people\u2019s lives while they work on a common product; a final public display of what they have done; making this part of on-going twinning work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA second mobility activity for youth workers will take place in Palestine in August 2015.

The project will help them develop understanding and solidarity between them as they create and run activities to support the work of Camden Abu Dis Friendship Association (CADFA) including communication with twinned organisations in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver two years, 12 young volunteers  will be involved: eight from Palestine for five months at a time working alongside four from Europe who will work for ten months at a time. These will be young people from France, Spain and Germany. and 12 from France will work with CADFA in the UK in groups of four for periods of five and six months.  They will be based at CADFA\u2019s  office  in Camden. Drawing on experience from their own cultures and  areas of their own interest/ competence, they will help with events and activities in Camden and with CADFA\u2019s partner twinning groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volunteers will learn how to support twinning links, interpret between cultures and experience and work to raise awareness of human rights.  They will work in parallel with CADFA EVS volunteers in Palestine in order to support existing twinning links between schools, university and youth clubs.They will prepare and post blogs, photos and stories from the UK on the internet for Palestinian people to read.  They will help with web links to both Palestine and to their own countries of origin. . We hope that this work will stimulate an interest in maintaining international links to promote human rights on the part of the volunteers and will work with the sending organisations to help build opportunities for on-going work where appropriate.", "http://www.cadfa.org", "Camden Abu Dis Friendship Association Education", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001544_coordinator"]]}}}}
