Many of these technologies are spearheaded by the contributions of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME).  There is a clear opportunity to revolutionize space technologies by leveraging advancement in the commercial electronics market.  However, despite the obvious benefits to the space industry, it remains difficult for SMEs to get involved due to the significant cost, effort, time, and paper work to qualify parts for space applications.  A trend toward smaller and cheaper satellites allows for a novel approach to space qualification and testing.  Nanosatellites (between 1kg and 10kg) can be launched at a relatively low cost as piggy back payloads for larger satellite missions.  Since the cost of failure is an order of magnitude lower than conventional satellites, nanosatellites offer an ideal platform for high risk demonstration missions.\n\nThe aim of this project is to flight qualify a wide range of SME payloads in a 3U 3kg nanosatellite platform operating at a 700km orbit.  The primary purpose of this spacecraft is as a technology demonstrator.  Each SME in the consortium will be responsible for contributing a particular spacecraft subsystem.  The University of Surrey will integrate these systems into the nanosatellite platform, and will also be responsible for the ADCS and CMGs of the satellite.

The sending organisations include IES Cartuja, CE Ave Maria San Cristobal, IES Polit\u00e9cnico Hermenegildo Lanz, IES Francisco Ayala, IES Aynadamar, IES Zaidin Vergeles, CDP Atl\u00e1ntida and IES Virgen de las Nieves. This VET schools have experience in the management of European projects. With this new initiative, we intend to join efforts to contribute to the improvement of educational quality and to increase job opportunities.\r\nTo achieve this, we propose activities for students, who will do internships in companies, and activities for teaching staff, who will carry out a job-shadowing activity in VET schools. Regarding the students, the project includes 58 mobilities: 54 students of Initial Vocational Training (FPGM) will do their internship in companies for 87 days, hosting countries include the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom and France; 4 students of Basic Vocational Training (FPB) will do their internships in Italy for 3 weeks. For Initial Vocational Training students, the project includes 13 accompanying teachers during the first week of stay. For Basic Vocational Training students, there are 2 accompanying teachers during the 3 weeks to reinforce the monitoring.\r\nThe internships will be recognised by the official module of Company Placements (FCT), which is common to all students. However, this experience will entail an added value for the participants at a personal and professional level. In addition to acquiring knowledge and skills in their field of speciality, they can benefit from a linguistic and cultural immersion, expanding their linguistic and personal skills. This will foster their autonomy and they will acquire a more versatile profile, which will facilitate their access to the labour market. It will also encourage motivation to continue with their education.\r\nAs for the teaching staff, the project includes 9 mobilities for a week in Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Teachers can learn about other educational systems and observe the work carried out by other professionals. Thus, they can enrich their professional and methodological knowledge. They can learn about different resources, ICT, training programmes, etc. All this will have a very positive impact on the quality of the education provided, adapted to the needs of today's society.\r\nFor the proper management of the project, communication channels will be established between all the parties involved throughout the entire project. There will be a continuous contact between the City Council, school mobility coordinators, teaching tutors, participants, host and intermediary organisations and company tutors.\r\nThe City Council will be part of the Association of European Cities XARXA FP. This supposes an improvement in the quality of vocational education in Granada, promoting the mobility of students and teachers. In addition, we have the cooperation of different companies, including intermediary and host organisations with great experience in European projects, which will allow us to achieve the expected results.\r\nRegarding the selection process, it will be carried out in a fair and transparent manner, publishing the established selection criteria. Then, we will organise practical issues (travel, accommodation, insurance, etc.) and quality issues (training programmes, agreements between different parties, etc.). Pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation will also be provided before the mobility.\r\nMonitoring will take place during mobility period. Participants will have a teaching tutor and a company tutor, and communications will be established among all the parties to ensure compliance with the training programme and the adaptation and satisfaction of participants.\r\nAt the end of the mobilities, participants will obtain a certificate and the Europass Mobility document.\r\nEach member will hold a meeting with the participants for the final evaluation of the project. All results will be shared between the coordinator and the members of the consortium to maximise the results. The results will be disseminated through different means: meetings, press and local TV, web pages, European platform, social networks ...\r\nIn conclusion, we intend to promote the internationalisation of education through innovative training programmes for students and lifelong training of teachers.

This is crucial to all partners as we are situated in geographical areas of the EU which suffer from high levels of youth unemployment and disengagement. It is also key to economic recovery and success in our regions to have a workforce that is skilled to higher levels that are relevant and useful in today\u2019s highly technical and global society. We believe that excellence within the teaching profession  can inspire learners to achieve and realise their full potential and to become independent, resourceful and active citizens within the local and wider communities. We have had successful collaborative projects in the past focusing on teaching and learning approaches, especially with regard to the use of IT. We feel we can build on these earlier experiences as well as drawing on  the expertise each organisation possesses. \r\nThe project's objectives are \r\n1. To enhance the quality of teaching and learning in VET curriculum,\r\n2. To create a model of collaborative staff development, working with local, regional, national and international organisations. This will be done through working together to develop innovative methods of delivery ( e.g. an eGuide to Staff Development, TEDx talks, TeachMeets and research into the development of 'Apps' for learning resources on mobile devices.) \r\n3. Enable the effective delivery and assessment of Key Competencies ( basic skills and transversal skills, digital skills and entrepreneurship skills) within the VET curriculum. \r\n4. To establish a culture of learners who can work with teachers to develop and assess new learning resources to assist in teaching of Key Competencies.\r\n5. To foster partnerships with local schools, employers and careers agencies in the delivery of project activities.\r\n6. To make explicit the outcomes, activities and outputs of the project through effective dissemination.\r\nThis project will involve a range of people at varying points in its lifecycle. Each partner will have a core team of staff who have the relevant skills and expertise to lead this project and engage others in the various activities. We plan to involve approximately 140 students in the preparation and evaluation of resources as well as ensuring the learner voice is a key component of the outputs of this project.\r\nWe intend all teaching and support staff in our organisation will benefit from this project by either participating in multiplier events ( TeachMeets, and Conference) engaging in the development of teaching resources and having access to the final products of the project ( the eGuide, teaching and learning resources,  the TEDx video and  Student Blog) This could potentially reach over 800 members of staff. \r\nWe also intend to engage a wider audience at the multiplier events such as local schools, university partners, careers staff, employers, awarding bodies and parents\r\nMulitplier events, called TeachMeets,  each year will disseminate the ideas and resources of the project and will address some of the themes contained within the eGuide, such as how to be inclusive within the classroom and within the organisation, coping with students with mental health needs, how to manage challenging behaviour. \r\nWe plan to host a conference in the third year which will cover a large number of topics addressed by this project, include a  talk by an inspiring national figure and engage with a wide range of stakeholders.\r\nAs this project\u2019s desired goal is to be transformative for our organisations, the methodology that will be used in this project will be consultative and inclusive.

A curricular component of the degree is a traineeship module which has to be done in companies.The aim of this project is that five students develop their traineeship in other EU countries and that two teachers could improve their capacities in the professional and educational activities they teach and also enable them to become involved in the development and improvement of these mobility activities and Erasmus+ projects. This objective is the focus of the project, though it does not detract but instead guarantees, other parallel goals around improving multicultural competencies, learning foreign languages and increase significantly the employability and job opportunities for our students in other EU countries. Retrieved on potential students, we have an estimation of participation of five students, once taken into account that some interested ones might fail. If unexpectedly these posts were not occuped, we have defined the duration of the project in 24 months, so that if necessary, some mobilities could be managed in the next academic year, either students or exceptionally recent graduates. The participation of two teachers involved in the mentioned computer studies, who will be preferably selected from among those who collaborate with European projects and / or bilingual programs, is also provided. In both cases, students and teachers must have a B1 level of English or the same in the host country language.The student activities will be aimed to integrate and complement the curriculum of our degree. For this, a training agreement related to the competencies of students should be prepared to be developed in the company. Before the departure, students receive training and they make arrangements to develop their traineeships and reach goals related to multiculturalism, language learning and employability. During their stay they follow a language course in the host country. Teacher\u2019s activities allow them to learn and participate in the medium in which the employment and education of its students is developed, but this also allows increasing the quantity and quality of these kinds of mobilities or other Erasmus+ projects.The months from September to January serve primarily to train and select students on everything relevant to ensure its success in the host company: motivation, fitness, foreign language, culture clashes and activities of companies. In the months of January and February, practical and logistical issues like traveling, accommodation, insurance and local information, should be treated, without forgetting other outstanding formal aspects of the project such its training program, documentation and monitoring. Duration of student mobility is three months from March 15 to June 20. The methodology for teacher training periods (five days) is similar and parallel, and although no less complex, it is more feasible due to responsibility, because involvement and rigor are expected in participants.As a result we will improve the personal and professional maturity of participants through intercultural environment and companies in other EU countries, skills acquisition in a second and / or third foreign language, the possibility of employment in other EU countries, the removal of frontiers to the individual, and especially their freedom, not only to be employed but also to choose the place in Europe where they can do it. Apart from the impact on participants and our school, this project is a collaboration with the mobility programs that are managed with the participation of different actors ranging from the authorities of the EC to local companies providing related services.In a medium term we intend to consolidate traineeship in other EU countries by the students from our centre. In the long term we expect to extend the mobility and employment companies so that it could be enjoyed by others through the possible future creation of a consortium with several of the five centres of Granada or others from Andalusia, offering VET courses in microcomputer systems and networks.", "http://www.halesowen.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-023471_1"]]}}, "3TT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1609372800000, "Intra-Logistics with Integrated Automatic Deployment: safe and scalable fleets in shared spaces", "Logistic Engineering Services Ltd", "Today, intralogistic services have to respond quickly to changing market needs, unforeseeable trends and shorter product life cycles. These drivers pose new demands on intralogistic systems to be highly flexible, rock-solid reliable, self-optimising, quickly deployable and safe yet efficient in environments shared with humans. ILIAD will enable the transition to automation of intralogistic services with key stakeholders from the food distribution sector, where these challenges are particularly pressing. We will develop robotic solutions that can integrate with current warehouse facilities, extending the state of the art to achieve self-deploying fleets of heterogeneous robots in multiple-actor systems; life-long self-optimisation; manipulation from a mobile platform; efficient and safe operation in environments shared with humans; and efficient fleet management with formal guarantees. Scientifically, ILIAD pursues ambitious goals for complex cognitive systems in human environments beyond a specific use-case. We will overcome limitations in the state of the art in tracking and analysing humans; quantifying map quality and predicting future states depending on activity patterns inferred from long-term observations; planning of socially normative movements using learned human models; integration of task allocation, coordination and motion planning for heterogeneous robot fleets; and systematically studying human safety in mixed environments, providing a foundation for future safety standards. Our consortium is uniquely placed to tackle these challenges and to maximise exploitation beyond the project\u2019s duration. It includes partners with a proven track record in all key research areas, leading technology providers for intralogistics, end users that are leading in their respective markets, and the National Centre for Food Manufacturing at partner UoL, facilitating access to realistic test sites.
