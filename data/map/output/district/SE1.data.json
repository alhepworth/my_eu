By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 1912418.0, 7186916.0, 5, 15, "CryoHub", null, "http://www.lsbu.ac.uk", null, "h2020_199618_999911309"], [1480550400000, 1543536000000, "Rapid Integrity Assessment of Flexible Risers for Offshore Oil and Gas Installations", "London South Bank University Lbg", "This action will bring to market a unique product, RiserSure\u2122, for assessing the condition of flexible riser pipes widely used in offshore oil and gas production.

The Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010 prompted very recent new safety legislation in the US and Europe (2015 US offshore safety drilling rule, 2013 EU Offshore Safety Directive). This is driving the uptake of non-destructive testing (NDT) to monitor riser condition.\nCurrent techniques cannot reliably or efficiently assess flexible riser condition to provide advance warning of failure.

The two main groups internally that contribute are the staff in the wider enterprise/careers team and the academic staff engaged with enterprise and business partners. It is rare for people in these groups to have genuine entrepreneurial experience, as by nature entrepreneurs are more likely to work independently. However, there is demand for this experience to greatly improve the impact, efficacy and functioning of the enterprise and entrepreneurship provision and wider engagement in the ecosystem.

The learning it offers will have wide and long-term impact on their organisation, those within it and the wider community.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are to deliver clear understanding and practical experience for staff involved in the ecosystem that can positively impact their work, make it more relevant, appropriate, engaging and impactful for everyone involved. The Training Programme will also improve the profile and attraction of roles in enterprise education and therefore improve recruitment, and retention of high quality staff. Our objective branches to include improving skills, competencies, qualities and capacity for innovation to all staff involved. \r\nAdditionally, ETEE will work with external target groups (staff in VET providers, incubators/accelerators) to extend the impact into the ecosystem beyond HEIs. \r\n\r\nWe aim to engage indirectly with 1000 beneficiaries across the ecosystem, and achieve this through consultation and feedback activities, training activities, a combined Communication and Dissemination Plan, a significant Exploitation Plan, 4 Multiplier Events and activation of our joint networks together with momentum generated around the ETEE project itself.

In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?  How can schools encourage positive attitudes in all pupils and set them on a path to fitness for life and a healthier, more productive future?  \r\n\r\nThe task begins with up-skilling current and future teachers to lead the attitudinal change we require from all educational sectors.  This project seeks to do that by bringing together a number of high achieving schools, aware of this need to 'educate for life', as well as Universities with a Teacher Training remit--including a focus on training Physical Education teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership consists primarily of a University and 2 schools in each of three countries--the UK,  Spain and Greece.  (An additional partner of a University based fitness facility adds additional expertise and resources to complement the other UK partners and  bring the total number in the partnership to 10.)  \r\n\r\nThe group have agreed a 2 year work-plan of collaboration in order to exchange knowledge, bring more focus to the Pupil Health & Well - Being agenda and develop joint resources.   4  joint,  transnational meetings  and a program of on-going  local activities to strengthen education are planned.  Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.

This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.

Also, the school\u2019s high prioritization of internationalizing students helps to strengthen their professional profiles, as well as their personal and intercultural competencies.   \r\n\r\nFor the second time, we include ECVET in our mobility project.\r\nThis involves the prepared \u201dMemorandum of Understanding\u201d, which is signed by our partners and us and is attached to this application.\r\nWe have also attached the \u201dLearning Agreement\u201d form, which we will use to formalize the commitment of our partner, the student and us in connection with the forthcoming mobility initiatives.\r\n\u201dUnits of Learning Outcome\u201d will be agreed upon in advance in each circumstance and attached to the \u201cLearning Agreement\u201d document.\r\nWhich competencies students will obtain in the course of each mobility initiative will be drawn up in a \u201cTranscript of Records\u201d and attached to the student\u2019s EuroPass Mobility certificate.\r\n\r\nThis application covers:\r\n   68   VET student work programs\r\n   17   HG student work programs\r\n 120  HG-EUX student language and work programs\r\n   38   HHX and HTX student language and work programs \r\n\r\n 17   accompanying teachers\r\n 22   teacher work or training programs \r\n\r\nWe expect programs to run during the entire project period, as we also expect to incorporate programs in different European countries. The needs and wishes of individual students and teachers are considered in determining destinations. Most often, students and teachers have a good idea of where they can be challenged appropriately and obtain relevant professional inspiration.  \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to strengthen the school\u2019s international work. The participation of more people in training abroad will set greater focus on internationalization in general. CPH WEST expects that a number of teachers and counselors will become more motivated to work actively on this front, using this opportunity to include international projects in their teaching.

The person receiving care is often a parent but can be a sibling, grandparent or other relative who is disabled, has some chronic illness, mental health problem or other condition connected with a need for care, support or supervision.Although research has provided clear evidence that heavy caring responsibilities can result in emotional difficulties, health problems, social exclusion, and limited opportunities for social and leisure activities, professional support services are lacking in many EU countries. This is largely due to the fact that the youth work, educational and social services sectors are not aware of this group. However, it can be seen from the UK experience that young carers are a large and important group that youth services need to address.The main result expected after completion of the project is that each of the six partner organizations and several hundred other interested stakeholders will have access to a set of tools and interventions, together with the skills and capacities to use them, to support young carers. Such tools will include questionnaires, motivational interviews, checklists, services navigators, etc. In addition, the creation of practical support services will be promoted through practical guidelines based on a model support project established by each partner in their region.The tools are intended to allow identification of young carers; to allow practitioners to assess the situation of young carers, including measuring the level and impact of the care burden; and to allow practitioners to develop an action plan to address issues adversely affecting young carers.

In Europe there are more than 50,000 broiler breeders who are facing a major problem concerning control of air- and insect-borne pathogens in their broiler houses, which results in high infection rates of the broiler flocks. This is partly caused by insects \u2013 especially flies \u2013 entering the broiler house through the ventilation system. The Airpath project seeks to solve this problem by developing a new type of barrier based on electrostatic precipitation. This is a known technology used in larger applications where cost is not a major concern such as chimneys on power plants. Hence, the technology must be further developed, scaled and adapted to the specific needs of the European broiler industry. Background of the project The project seeks to solve one of the major challenges that the poultry sector is facing concerning airborne pathogens. An example is Campylobacter which is a major problem in broiler houses (and in the consumer product). At certain times of the year (the warmer months) the breeders experience a rise of infection to more than 60-80% of the flocks. A previous study by DTU Veterinary Institute in Denmark has demonstrated that a major source of the infections is flies entering the houses through the ventilation system. DTU has demonstrated that by effectively keeping the flies out of the broiler houses, the number of infected populations will be drastically reduced. Using simple fly screens it was possible to reduce the infection rate to 15% of the flocs in the problematic period, whereas control populations not using screens showed more 50% infection rate.", 209328.0, 3393175.0, 7, 12, "AIRPATH", null, "http://www.poultry.uk.com", null, "fp7_94939_995014070"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "STIRLING ASSYNT (EUROPE) LIMITED", 29308.0, "Support expenditure for the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (21.01.04.04)", "fts_2017_62180"]]}}, "0SU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1546214400000, "Adoptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments", "Canonical Group Limited", "AGILE project aims to create an open, flexible and widely usable IoT solution at disposal of industries (startups, SMEs, tech companies) and individuals (researchers, makers, entrepreneurs) as a framework that consists of:\n\u2022 A modular IoT gateway enabling various types of devices (wearables, home appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.) to be connected with each other and to the Internet;\n\u2022 Data management and device control maximizing security and privacy, at local level and in the cloud, technologies and methodologies to better manage data privacy and ownership in the IoT;\n\u2022 Support of various open and private clouds;\n\u2022 Recommender and visual developer\u2019s interfaces enabling easy creation of applications to manage connected devices and data;\n\u2022 Support of mainstream IoT/M2M protocols, and SDKs from different standardization bodies for device discovery and communication;\n\u2022 Two separate gateway hardware versions: a) the \u2018maker\u2019s version, based on the popular RaspberryPi platform for easily prototyping and attracting the current community; b) the \u2018industrial\u2019 version for more industrial and production-ready applications; \n\u2022 An ecosystem of IoT applications shareable among users and developers leveraging on existing initiatives by key stakeholders in this domain, like Canonical and Ubuntu Snappy IoT ecosystem.\nPiloted in relevant open areas (fields and in a port) for field & cattle monitoring through drones, air quality & pollution monitoring and in smart retail, AGILE will be easily adaptable and usable in different contexts serving as an horizontal technology for fast IoT prototyping and engineering in different domains.

There are just over 500 VET learners at the school, 20 permanently employed staff and around 60 employees who are contracted to work with teaching and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to gain more knowledge about EU cooperation and to obtain a greater insight into the overall objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for Higher Vocational Education. More knowledge is needed about how ECVET should be applied regarding the transfer of credits & qualifications and also insight into how this is done in other parts of Europe concerning the professional roles that VET learners at Frans Schartau are educated for. Additional aims are to learn how the curriculum could better reflect the European dimension and the development of technology within teaching. The aim of the project for VET learners is to give them work experience abroad as well as an opportunity to strengthen their language skills, which is a request made by the labour market. As a result of mobility, employability increases and at the same time VET learners enhance their opportunities for working in an international labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will be organised by three members of staff who have previous experience of international cooperation. Activities are well established and methods for running the project have been planned for some time.

Staff should be in a position that enables them to apply their new knowledge immediately for the benefit of VET learners and to support the school\u2019s own work with internationalisation. The 31 VET learners participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across these four areas of work. Learners should have good interpersonal skills and a clearly stated goal for what they hope to achieve in their future careers with the help of this new experience. Participants must also have good communicative skills to be able to convey what they have learnt after their period of WPL. After selection, the goals for mobility should be agreed and anchored with the host company or organisation and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anticipated result is that Frans Schartau will be at the forefront when it comes to internationalisation. There will be a greater understanding of professional roles seen from a European perspective. This knowledge will add an international dimension to the school\u2019s programmes and teaching. New knowledge will be generated concerning technology, not least the knowledge needed to continue providing relevant and high quality Work Placement (WPL) abroad. As the school is a part of the City of Stockholm, where all levels of education are provided, results can be spread via the municipality\u2019s Intranet and newsletters.

In these learning models the role of guidance is essential. In the model of this project we utilise also the perspectives of students and companies, because then the perspective of customer guides the planning and enables to create an qualitative customer oriented educational service product.AIMSThe wide aims of this project are- to improve the learning outcomes of work-placement by utilizing eLearning platform as learning and guiding environment- to increase co-operation of schools and companies by offering companies a tool with possibility to familiarise student to the company before the work-placement and help companies to improve company\u2019s familiarizing material more learning friendlyThe concrete aims of the project are1) to create a eLearning platform (tentatively Moodle used by Helmi), a. where student planning for work placement abroad can familiarize beforehand to relevant vocational skills demonstration material, to work placement abroad in general, to practical matters of work placement company and to receive personal guidance during work-placement period 24/7.b. In the same platform work placement instructor can meet the student and guiding teacher beforehand and create company\u2019s familiarizing material (e.g. videos, interviews) to eLearning platform in co-operation with teacher and student.c. Teacher can produce material to eLearning platform, guide student in work placement tasks and support work place instructor 24/7.2) to plan and build to eLearning platform a pedagogical guidance model which supports the work placement abroad, including e.g. material production, guidance, evaluation and  collecting feedback.NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PROFILETo this project participate the following foreign companies and schools:Scancoming Spain, ESP; Fasada Incoming, ESP; Laventeli, FRA; Scancoming London, GB;  Banbury Museum, GB; Koning Willem I College, NL; Collegi Badalones, ESP; RWS, DE. To activities participate 60 1-3. class travel&tourism and business students and 20 teachers and eLearning experts. MAIN ACTIVITIESIn the beginning of the project all the project members fill an questionnaire where we try to map the present state of guidance and expectations to improve them. In autumn 2016 we plan and create an eLearning platform and content to it (general practices in work-placement abroad, vocational skills demonstration, eLearning guidance model (24/7), familiarizing material of companies). During their work-placement, guidance of the student will be done by job instructor of the company and guiding teacher who will visit student once and guide her in other times by eLearning platform 24/7. During visits to partner companies and schools guiding teachers discuss with job instructors and person in charge of partner school about the state of familiarising students to company\u2019s customs and success of guidance and plans to improve them. After first year of the project, summary meeting will take place, where we evaluate the results of Questionnaire 1-2 and the results of discussions with partner companies and schools, and make the plan for 2. year of the project (improvement). After second year, in the end of project in final summary meeting, we evaluate the results of all questionnaires and discussions and the fulfillments of aims of the project.RESULTS AND IMPACTS:A) Students: During two years 60 students will perfom work-placment abroad in professional and innovative company. The skills of student improve significantly, because with the help of eLearning platform: she has familiarized to work-placement company before work-placement, she has been able to ensure learning objectives while working and she has had chance to receive guidance 24/7.B) Partner companies: They have received concrete help, equipment and benefit with the help of eLearning and guidance model showing how to familiarize students to company. The guiding skills and eLearning skills of job instructor have improved.

It would mean a new profile for our school and add to an improvement of quality.\r\nOur teachers of English need to get the relevant training courses to broaden their language and methodology competences. \r\nThey also should have an opportunity to exchange and reflect ideas with other teachers from European countries and counties in Germany. \r\nEspecially in the first years of learning a foreign language, the important basics such as pronunciation, intonation and language structures are being implemented. Plus, pupils at an early age tend to learn a language more easily and eagerly.\r\nThe importance of learning foreign languages will increase in the future and that means for our pupils , in the focus on international cooperation and job opportunities, an even higher level of importance. In this point we will equip them better for the labour market through good knowledge of English. \r\n\r\nAs both primary schools are interested in deepening their partnership, we have planned a job shadowing activity. The first exchanges of pupils and teachers have been successful and should possibly be carried on. These visits to another country enable the pupils to develop important intercultural and communicative skills. We have observed that pupils at primary school age level act and communicate quite openly with each other. Having had this positive emotional aspect at an early age should lead to a higher motivation to learn foreign languages as a long-term goal.\r\nOur member of staff who is currently trained to participate in the process of organizing the exchange trips, is supposed to do the job shadowing in order to make herself familiar with the school, staff, school activities, area and the city. As we do the exchange trips with 10-year-olds, a profound knowledge of the school, the area and relevant parts of London are vital for the accompanying staff. Long-term goal for our school is her ability to take over the exchange plannings.\r\nAs we are lucky to have the personal contacts while the exchange visits are taking place, we can prepare the job shadowing activity together with the partner school and aim for a successful outcome. Both partners should then be strengthened to continue their cooperation. \r\nTo achieve our aims of the project we have chosen the following activities in a structured order: A job shadowing at the partner school at the beginning (combination of the aims \"Deepening the Partnership\" and \"Acquisition of Vocabulary for Teaching Subjects in English\"), then followed by structured teacher training courses on CLIL (in Britain) and after that, \"Teaching at the Partner School\" .\r\n\r\nAt present we have 3 teachers of English and one teacher-in-training in our English department;  in total, there are 4 planned activities in our project.

YESESD focus on: Sustainable Development (3 pillars - economic, environmental, social); the role of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) ; the role of the Earth Charter through its youth initiative (ECYI) ; how the role of youth plays out in all of this; how does it affect them in particular; and what do their specific roles need to be. It will try to draw the connections between skills development for employability and the changing nature of work by using success stories from the experiences of some of the Country Networks that are the backbone of the Youth Employment Summit (YES) Campaign.\r\n\r\nWhy needed this?\r\nEncouraging civic involvement and investing in youth's key concerns must be an urgent priority of governments and civil society. Recent major international conferences have addressed issues surrounding youth livelihoods development through technical and vocational education and training. However, the resolutions that emerged from these conferences have, in some areas, failed to be sufficiently acted upon. Therefore, it is up to the young people themselves to take actions consistent with the commitment made by governments in these world conferences. During the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 the Youth Caucus made an input to the political declaration calling on governments to establish an integrated ethical framework of shared values, such as the Earth Charter that will guide them towards the common good and effective implementation of the sustainable development agenda at all levels. According to Nyoni and Serageldin (2005)  youth employment is a global priority for sustainability, peace and prosperity and in their essay they describe a project on equitable employment for the future as it relates to \u201cPrinciple 10: Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development.\r\n \r\nMore to that end, a global movement called the Youth Employment Summit (YES) Campaign has been created to work with all concerned stakeholders to implement the MDGs of the United Nations through its 75 YES Country Networks. About 1500 young people from 150 countries launched a Decade Campaign of Action in Alexandria, Egypt at the first Youth Employment Summit in 2002 so that young adults, especially young women facing poverty, will be engaged in educational, technical and vocational training programmes that will then give them the skills and capacity to create productive and sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their communities. \r\n\r\nEconomic: Youth face higher unemployment than any other demographic. Youth make up the majority of the enrolled in TVET courses. Therefore, it seems like a natural fit for TVET courses to use one disparity to counteract the other. Young people aged 15 to 24 represent nearly half the world's jobless although they are only 25 per cent of the working age population, and halving world youth unemployment rate would add at least $2.2 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) equal to around 4 per cent of the 2003 value, according to a new ILO analysis - Global Employment Trends for Youth 2004.\r\nEnvironmental: Because the youth in TVET are learning working habits that will be carried on throughout their working lives it is important that sustainability issues are adequately addressed in curricula to instill environmental-friendly work habits. \r\n\r\nSocial: Using TVET to create sustainable livelihoods can combat feelings of despair and desperation among youth. Integrating life-skills into TVET can help youth to: cope with daily struggles, integrate into their community/society, decrease criminality, etc. \r\n\r\nNon formal education methods and approaches will be actively used during the whole program and participants will be in the center of program by sharing experiences, contributing the program. Simulations, group works, peer to peer learning, discussion, field visits are example of methodologies that will be used. \r\n\r\nTrainers and invited experts will share their experiences and knowledge with participants in order to reach the project and objectives.

The Ecett learning method (Exchange of good practices on the ground) is then a unique training approach to address these gaps.We cooperate with Ecett-Networks and its powerful and innovative method Mecett (international awards: \"Training Journal 2013\"  and \"Peer Awards for Excellence\" (London 2014)General objectives: increasing skills, acquisition of new practices, new tools, construction of new projects, motivation of workers, confrontation of ideas,... each participant will also focus on personal goals (as defined in its course).Ecett internships are valuable remedies for the training of personnel in the following cases: costly training in a distant country, contents very specific to our business, remotivating workers who work routinely and stimulating their creativity, discovering how peers solve similar problems in a different cultural context.2.PARTICIPANTSThe 50 participants will leave in small groups of colleagues, for field observation courses.The trainees are professionals with some experience and seniority in the youth sector and who are part of the partner institutions of the consortium . They are searching answers to certain issues they encounter in their work.They have needs concerning the accompaniment of young people and families (working with adolescents, young migrants, young people with double/triple diagnosis, young people accommodated in homes, families,...) and requirements concerning work and staff organization (human resources, motivation of workers, Labour Organization).Trainees acquire specific and transversal skills and discover good practices.3 ACTIVITIES\u00abActivities\u00bb = job-shadowing field. Each group of participants will go for 2 to 3 days courses in a host institution that has developed good practices in their area, according to predefined learning objectives. They will be able to bring new ideas to their workplace.Locations: host institutions of the Ecett network, which has more than 2,000 places of potential courses in Europe.The method MECETT has been described, tested and transferred from two projects funded by Leonardo da Vinci: \"Ecett\u2010Pilot 2006\u00bb and \u00abEcett transfer of Innovation 2009\u00bb and funded by the ESF: \u00abEcett\u2010Convergence 2009\u00bb.\" This learning process is benchmarking, research and description of good practices that can be transferred to other parts of the network. Evaluations reveal that 87% of training objectives have been achieved and that these exchanges have a concrete impact on how trainees think, speak and work after their course. The rate of satisfaction of trainees is 97% (+ 600 trainees).4 METHODOLOGYThe Mecett method is a combination of virtual exchanges and visits to host institutions, based on the model of the journeymen apprenticeship and elearning. Since 2006, Ecett help desks  have accompanied more than 600 students, and hosts to follow the MECETT procedures.Students involve their team and management since the phase of preparation of their course (negotiation of learning objectives). Ecett \u00abTraining Files\u00bb  are personal notebooks (data identification of trainees and their hosts, objectives of learning, conventions of training, planning, individual budgets, assessment of experience, good practices)..Three months before their departure, the students are accompanied by their Helpdesk to identify the organism (the host) with relevant expertise to the target problem. They will leave in groups of three or four  to get a critical mass for impact on their return. Return: meeting of team/manager to report, orally and in writing, their main ideas and good practices.5 EXPECTED IMPACTS : AT THREE LEVELS:-transversal and specific impacts on the trainee himself-impact on the Organization / the team, on return-impacts on the target public  = service users = young people accompanied by these professionals and learners6.

Instead of only talking about the theories of equality, freedom, inclusion, the method lets participants reflect on whether their actions reflect their theories.  Through interactive activities combined with reflection sessions, participants gain a deeper understanding of themselves and a greater awareness of their effect on others.

They develop and manage homes that are affordable to low and median income households, as well as other assets that contribute to thriving local communities. They act as long-term stewards of these assets, ensuring they remain permanently affordable. This is achieved through mechanisms that ensure that any additional value generated is retained within the CLT.\nGoal\nBy the end of the project we aim to have established a widespread movement of CLTs across the region and CLTs to be widely recognised as a mainstream option for housing supply and urban renewal in all countries.\n#SHICC #CohesiveCities", 1483228800000, 1609372800000, 359444.0, "nweurope_46_3"]]}}, "5LA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "School European Professional Development", "CITY OF LONDON  Academy Southwark", 28226.0, 1, 1, "At the City of London Academy we work in a borough with high levels of deprivation, and the school has a large number of pupils from challenging socio-economic backgrounds and with special educational needs (SEN).

Therefore, the project will take an approach based on subsequent incremental up-scaling processes, first to productions of 100g/h, second to 500 g/h and subsequently to 5 Kg/h, heavily relying on on-line measurements during FSP synthesis of temperature fields (FTIR), concentration of precursor species in the different flame fields (FTIR), evolution along the flame of the particle size and degree of agglomeration (thermophoretic extraction and TEM) and definition of velocity fields within FSP reactor (phase Doppler anemometry) combined with computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations able to predict for FSP reactions the flow, temperature and specification fields, spray conditions, combustion dynamics and particle evolution, including particle formation, growth, etc.", 153216.0, 3638145.0, 6, 13, "ADVANCE-FSP", "http://www.advance-fsp.eu", "http://www.engineeringsurfaces.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112617.jpg", "fp7_93034_996727090"], [1430438400000, 1509408000000, "Innovative Social Investment: Strengthening communities in Europe (InnoSI)", "Euclid Network", "There is growing consensus in Europe that an active set of approaches to welfare known as Social Investment will improve human capital, enable more people to participate in society, and reduce intergenerational deprivation, yet implementation has been uneven across member states and much remains to be learned, especially with regard to regional and local realities of Social Investment.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in foreign countries and gain valuable experience which can\u2019t be acquired by other means. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields is difficult and students have had problems finding apprenticeships in Iceland. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to make sure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to stay abreast of things regarding development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, six students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for four to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nVocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad. TCR emphasizes collaboration with schools in other European countries, making sure that students are informed of the possibilities of studying abroad and encouraging them to make use of the possibilities. \r\nStudents of the School of Web Development have received grants to visit KEA before, this application is for the next years\u2019 class so that they can also get to know studies at the school. The visit to KEA is integrated into a course in the final study year and is an important part of the studies. In Graphic Media Design and other planned group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades. Lately, video presentations have gained popularity among students returning from trips and this has led to increased interest among other students.\r\nIt is important for the students of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in foreign schools. In this application 74 students are applying for 14 day group study trips. It also includes application for six teachers to escort student groups. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers, at least during the first few days while they are getting to know a new environment. In one of the groups applying, one student is in a wheelchair and the application is also for two accompanying persons for 14 days each. \r\n\r\nIt is also important for the teachers and staff of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad. Many of the schools to which visits are planned are by far larger and offer a wider range of study programs than Icelandic schools ever can. TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programmes to meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. Among new study programmes that have been developed at the school to this purpose are a programme in web development and design, a new study programme in technology and science for exceptional students that was set up in cooperation with Reykjavik University, and a completely restructured design programme now named the Design and Innovation programme where design and arts are intertwined with studies in traditional vocational fields. The school also offers a year-long study programme in preparation for university studies in the arts for students who have already completed a matriculation exam. By visiting schools abroad teachers and the staff of TCR acquire invaluable new knowledge and experience that contribute to the development and enhancement of the education TCR provides. \r\nThe grant application includes an application for grants to 19 members of staff for study trips ranging from 5 to 14 days.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA116-026468_1"]]}}, "6TE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Building health literacy around pregnancy, birth and early life of the infant by  developing a unified, research-informed and socially-inclusive prenatal and postnatal web-based education programme for parents-to-be and new parents", "Best Beginnings", 302585.0, 4, 6, "Becoming a parent is an intense and tranformative period, with a unique mix of stress and rewards, but also opportunities to positively influence behaviours and outco.

The vision for European aviation is shaped by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe in the Flight Path 2050 goals, which define stringent regulations on pollutant emissions. To meet these goals, the major engine manufacturers develop lean premixed combustors operated at very high pressure. This development introduces a large risk for reduced reliability and lifetime of engines: pressure oscillations in the combustor called thermoacoustics. Much research has been dedicated to study this phenomenon over the last decades with mixed success.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

The project, therefore, offers an opportunity to 18 young people with care experience (9 French and 9 British) between the ages of 18 and 25, to come together as a group, gain new skills and broaden their horizons.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to take these young people out of their daily routine, which is often expressed in relative isolation, and to enable them to create, recreate and strengthen social inclusion and networks to avoid future disruptions.\r\n\r\nOur approach is one of non-formal learning, aimed at improving individual\u2019s transferable skillset whilst providing them with a positive new experience. The project revolves around three key activities: 1) Preparation: For most participants, travelling to a foreign country (but also within their respective countries) is a new and often unthought-of experience. The prospect of going abroad for the first time can be just as daunting as it is exciting. As the main drivers of the project, individuals are expected to face up to the bureaucratic as well as practical challenges involved with the process of organising a journey. 2) Project activity and travel experience: The project revolves around participants producing visual and audio testimonials acting as a platform to communicate their own personal experiences and perspectives. The exchange is further underpinned by cultural visits and group activities to enlarge individual\u2019s horizons and foster positive dynamics between participants. 3) Showcasing and broadcasting: To finalise the project participants will develop a PR and communications plan laying out how the artistic results are being shared across various channels with a public audience.\r\n\r\nPutting individual participants into the centre of the project, the Youthpass evaluation tool is used throughout the project to track individuals\u2019 non-formal learning process and support their personal development.\r\n\r\n\u00abWitness to your life \u00bb will have a multifarious impact on each project participant, increasing their self-esteem and boosting individuals\u2019 confidence, whilst equipping them with valuable life skills from communication and negotiation, to independent learning, problem solving and dealing with stress and conflict as a team. At the same time, by spending time in different socio-cultural environment and learning about other peoples\u2019 perspectives, participants gain a more positive and inclusive image of \u201cEurope\u201d and its essential values of solidarity, diversity and friendship amongst its people. Learning from each other\u2019s experience, professional project participants benefit personally by strengthening existing links, whilst inter-organisational competences and expertise is increased.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, the exchange will allow individual participants to share their experience and learnings with their peers on a local, national, and international level through the diffusion of the content they have created. Furthermore, making the creative output of the project accessible to the public has the power to raise awareness of and increase sensibilities towards the difficulties as well as the assets created through the experience of growing up in care. For the two organisations involved, the project further constitutes an opportunity to strengthen existing links, as well as to identify new potential partners, with the overall goal of developing a strong professional network to improve outcomes for care leavers across Europe.", "http://www.driveforwardfoundation.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR02-KA105-014264_1"]]}}, "7RL": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 3925136.0, "Food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture (21.02.07.04)", "fts_2017_9184"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 3906414.0, "Mediterranean countries \u2014 Confidence building, security and the prevention and settlement of conflicts (22.04.01.03)", "fts_2017_9269"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 1308379.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_19233"], [2016, "CHRISTIAN AID", 974270.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_20968"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 872252.0, "Disaster prevention, disaster risk reduction and preparedness (23.02.02)", "fts_2017_23419"], [2016, "CHRISTIAN AID", 811893.0, "Enhancing the respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and supporting democratic reforms (21.04.01)", "fts_2016_22172"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 610577.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_27465"], [2016, "CHRISTIAN AID", 568325.0, "Civil society in development (21.02.08.01)", "fts_2016_26605"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 479739.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_29519"], [2016, "CHRISTIAN AID", 324757.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_32818"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 87225.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_49358"], [2017, "CHRISTIAN AID", 833.0, "Other management expenditure (14.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_21716"], [2016, "CHRISTIAN AID", 533.0, "Other management expenditure (14.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_20742"]]}}, "7SJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1396310400000, 1498780800000, "Embedded Multi-Core Systems for Mixed Criticality Applications in Dynamic and Changeable Real-Time Environments", "Systonomy Limited", "Embedded systems are the key innovation driver to improve almost all mechatronic products with cheaper and even new functionalities.

Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out.

Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension.

The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology.

The Accountability Advocates Project forms an integral part of a wider programme on youth-led accountability called the Big Idea\u2019. It also builds on a previous EC funded initiative to consult young people in twelve countries on their priorities for the next SDGs. Young people identified fair governance and accountability as top priorities and raised several critical questions including: What role will youth will have once the content of the SDGs are confirmed? How can they hold leaders to account? The new SDG framework accords fresh priority to accountability and governance but lack of coordination between different youth actors means the youth constituency has not developed a cohesive approach to how they will engage in SDGs\u2019 monitoring and accountability mechanisms.Another key challenge for young people\u2019s meaningful participation in decision making and accountability is the lack of capacity development opportunities for youth and youth organisations.  The outputs from this project will be translated, through the Big Idea, into a methodology for youth-led accountability that youth organisations can use to develop a shared, deep understanding of youth-led accountability and reach consensus on how youth-led monitoring of SDGs can be effected and governments can integrate into their processes of implementing and monitoring the SDGs.There are three objectives:\u2022 Build the capacity of youth-led Community Based Organisations (CBOs) to hold governments to account effectively;\u2022 Demonstrate how young people can lead, or partner with others in, the monitoring of the SDGs;\u2022 Promote the exchange of good practice and foster increased sect oral coordination and North-South cooperation.The project will build the capacity of 20 young leaders from youth-led CBOs in 7 countries to become \u2018Accountability Advocates.\u2019 They will be trained utilising a Post-2015 Youth-Led Monitoring & Accountability toolkit, which capitalises on Restless Development\u2019s peer-to-peer, non-formal methodology, and supported through a mentorship scheme.

Over 80% of cases occur in the first 7 days after birth and the remaining 20% of disease occurs between 8-90 days after birth.

The overall objective of this proposal is to design immunization strategies capable of inducing strong durable and placentally transferable protective immune responses against GBS in women in order to fill this gap in early infancy when direct immunization is not possible. Starting with the genome sequence of 8 strains of GBS, Novartis scientists have identified three proteins that confer protection against lethal challenge in neonatal mice from immunized females. Combinations of CPS conjugates plus the recombinant proteins conferred protection against 12 of 12 GBS strains representing the major disease causing serotypes. In order to translate this research into a viable vaccine it will be necessary to identify appropriate adjuvant and delivery systems capable of inducing a protective response which will last through pregnancy. In order to select the serotypes of CPS to include in the vaccine, it will be necessary to understand the serotype distribution of GBS disease in Europe.

Individual groups have developed assays within the context of the vaccine discovery efforts, with identification of measurable processes for parasite growth and virulence to test specific antigens. In-house assays are strain, stage and even process specific and the ability to compare results between different candidates is further limited by diverse methodologies and assay components such as parasites, cells and reagents. The absence of some level of harmonization of practices also makes interpreting the meaning and relevance of vaccine research outcomes complex. Lack of an enabling environment for comparability of research results generated in different labs could unfortunately lead to scepticism of the results that in turn generate uncertainty about the efficacy of the vaccines and rationale of the development pathway. To compare the relative merits of different candidate vaccines and approaches in a credible and informed manner, efforts must be made to create this enabling environment by supporting the development of a baseline level of standardization around key assays that can be utilized a) in the evaluation of malaria vaccines, and b) throughout the Development process. Consistent, reproducible and comparable intra- and inter-lab performance and increased accuracy and precision of assay data, will strengthen the quality of the data on vaccine performance and generate greater confidence in the vaccine potential of the candidate.", null, 1479691.0, 10, 14, "OPTIMALVAC", null, "http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england", "/docs/results/images/2013-02/53621.jpg", "fp7_91933_999453178"], [1293840000000, 1435622400000, "European Primate Network: Advancing 3Rs and International Standards in Biological and Biomedical Research", "Public Health England an Executive Agency of the Dept of Health", "Biomedical research depends on the availability of living non-human primates and biological material with primate origin.

Within such a context, the role of training is increasingly linked with the need to safeguard employment. The request for a substantial coupling between training and the labour market, upsetting the traditional barriers between the two is imperative. In particular this applies to Vocational Training, students whose heavily demanding immediate integration into the labour market immediately after the end of their studies.

Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", "http://www.rambert.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_21"], [2017, "European Connections", "Ballet Rambert Ltd", 118804.0, 16, 39, "The last 16 years Aventus invested much into sustainable relations with European partners.

If treating 20% of the patients with severe structural airway disease, we estimate that in Europe our technology will improve the quality and length of patient lives and result in savings of \u20ac517 million per year.\n\nWe plan to further develop our platform technology to generate other complex tissues/organs such as bowel and liver replacements for clinical applications which will impact the lives of tens of thousands of patient in the EU with bowel and liver diseases.", 241588.0, 5856898.0, 5, 13, "TETRA", null, null, null, "h2020_198788_949570346"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Europa Mobilit\u00e4t in der Ausbildung mit Erasmus \u00fcber Bildungsakademie Pflege MHH", "Guy's & St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", 342718.0, 7, 9, "The educational academy Nursing (BAP) is an autonomous vocational training\u00b4s department in the framework of the training academy of the Medical University Hanover, traditionally called MHH. The nursing school trains 200 students, the school for OTA/ATA 150. The MHH has in addition another 257 apprenticeships in varied health care professions. We have achieved till 2014 to send over 100 students, in their second year of training, over what was formerly called the Leonardo da Vinci project abroad in Europe. Since June of 2014 we have successfully applied for the funding in the new Erasmus+ program and are in self-governing the funding. The Erasmus appointee (Bledsoe/Stanze) of the nursing school could accordingly over the years acquire a multitude of very good contacts to hospital facilities in Ireland, Austria, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Malta, where regularly, that is to say, yearly our students went to their foreign internships or as the case may be their foreign practical. The number of students that the nursing school of the BAP could allocate to participate in the Program has continually increased. With the Erasmus+ project application 2015/2017 a goal has been set, to make it possible for at least 100 Trainees of the nursing school and German wide over the pool project, to participate in the exchange program in a European land of their choice. This goal will be achieved, because of January this year already 64 grants have been issued. The internships or practical\u2019s intended duration is 4 - 7 weeks but dependent upon the application and assignment plans, the framework of the practical training and availability of the receiving organization.\r\nThe emphasis by the chosen exchange facilities lies in acute nursing care clinics, in order to further already developed practical skills during the exchange. Our experience over the past ten years and the establish network with health care Clinics throughout Europe, as well as the tremendous response from vocational Training Institutions and Trainees , show the interest and need for this program. Before the internship or practical begins the Students are counseled and advised regarding the training abroad by the Erasmus appointee of the BAP nursing school. The Erasmus appointee will be available as a contact person throughout the internship if needed. During the foreign assignment the personal Mentor stands close meshed to the side of the Trainee, the extent of which is previously agreed between the receiving organization and the Erasmus appointee of the BAP who organizes the placement. Common educational objectives, goals and outcomes are evaluated. They are establishing between the sending and host organization, the documentation is according to ECEVT.  In 2016 the BAP will for the fours time provide nursing students from Innsbruck internships in the clinical setting through the Erasmus+ Mobility program, as well as expeting 12 Nursingstudents from Turkey. Furthermore, the BAP of the MHH would like to extend this offer to addition foreign facilities and encourage them to do so, there concrete plans with Salzburg/Austria and Poland. For the first time this year we have specific request from Portugal and Spain. The foreign nursing students that take part in the Erasmus+ program at the MHH will be accompanied by a personal Mentor who has successfully completed an additional qualification\u2019s course regarding Mentoring. Additionally the Erasmus appointee makes regular visits on the stations to insure the learning progress. The most important change with this project is the changeover from the Training agreement based on ECEVT to the learning agreement developed by the ECEVT Learning group. The learning outcome units according to the DQR and EQR standards will be part in the described development of the new curriculum. Goal is the comparable qualification and education within Europe. We are certain that all health care profession will be able to profit through international exchange students. At the same time our European neighbors will recognize, that even though health care professionals in Germany have a mostly vocational training, they are none-the-less highly qualified. The students at the MHH learn skills, methods, social-communication and personal expertise and through their foreign exchange they will enhance and extend their knowledge of their profession which can be transferred effectively and goal-oriented to all aspects of their daily work practice in the varied fields of their occupation in health care and augment the theoretical instruction of the their school. This is to be supported by the exchange of the educational personnel. The BAP at the MHH strives for a professional, cultural and linguistically exchange on the local, regional, national and international level. This enables our students to recognize the possibilities and chances that a united Europe offers, as well as the flexibility for their future carrier opportunities.", "http://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/Home.aspx", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004967_6"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "GUYS AND ST THOMAS' NHS FOUNDATIONTRUST*GSTFT", 169183.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_6533"], [2017, "GUYS AND ST THOMAS' NHS FOUNDATIONTRUST*GSTFT", 3023.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_49176"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["RJ1", "Guy's Hospital", "nhs_RJ121"]]}}, "9SG": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "EMERIX IP LIMITED", 51220.0, "Provision of services and work on behalf of outside bodies (10.04.02)", "fts_2017_55523"], [2017, "EMERIX IP LIMITED", 42589.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_58773"], [2017, "DODS PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED", 25077.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_63762"], [2016, "DODS PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED", 23342.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_65161"]]}}}}
