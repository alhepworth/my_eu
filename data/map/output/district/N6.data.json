It mobilises a transnational partnership aimed at improving the quality of adult education and enriching the pedagogical content by combining the teaching of living foreign languages with the teaching of the cultural heritage inherent to the studied  language thanks to new technologies.\r\n\r\nThe LV & PV project is in line with EU policy and the UNESCO International Convention of 2003 which supports the celebration and safeguarding of linguistic diversity and cultural heritage on the European continent.\r\n\r\nThe current enthusiasm and the growing interest of learners for a better knowledge of the living cultural heritage justify our determination to make the cultural heritage richness available to as many learners as possible and reaching the widest possible audience.\r\n\r\nAccording to our conception, the living cultural heritage comprises all the spiritual productions of man and signifies an event, a place, an action, a masterpiece, a history, but especially the memory which provides a range of emotional, social and spiritual values. Thus discipline of foreign living languages, which is inclusive, can offer a special place for cultural and civic education. \r\n\r\nThrough this project we intend to highlight the often hidden treasures of cultural heritage, in this case - Russian cultural heritage in Europe, which is clearly an integral piece of the European and world cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nFrom this angle of intersection between heritage and teaching, we wish to give more meaning and emotion to the content of foreign language training for adults.\r\n\r\nRecognising the increasing motivation of learners in this field, their need to have the keys to cultural diversity and taking into account the new technical possibilities offered by the digital age, we will offer learners the best samples of Russian cultural heritage on different media and digital infrastructures.\r\n\r\nResearching, cataloging, mapping, describing, digitising and in this way revitalising the best samples of the Russian cultural heritage by integrating them into the teaching of foreign languages for adults - these are the objectives of the LV & PV project.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, the new multilateral partnership LV & PV will mobilise and bring together 6 European partners (France, Poland, Great Britain, Cyprus, Denmark and Germany) as well as a large number of actors, organisations and structures.\r\n\r\nA multiplicity of direct participants (project stakeholders, contributors, learners, observers) and indirect participants (associate members, members of the local community, experts, digital trainers, policy makers, travel agencies and network users) will be involved in the activities and will benefit from the results of the project.\r\n\r\nThe general logic of the project is to mobilise the know-how of all the partners and giving priority to a participative approach. This will enable partners to be closely involved in the design and management of all the actions of the project on the basis of shared responsibility.\r\n\r\nA complete educational tool developed in the course of the project (Russian cultural heritage repertoire, compilation of didactic texts, Power Point presentations, sound recordings and video sequences, cultural and educational itineraries) on digital media (WEB portal of the project, YouTube channel) will be the tangible result of the project. It may have interesting after project impact, since the didactic transposition of the concept of the living heritage is quite feasible and possible for other target languages.\r\n\r\nOther important results are expected at the end of the project:\r\n\r\n- increased cross-border cooperation;\r\n- reactivated professional networks;\r\n-professionalisation of the teams in the setting up and management of a European project;\r\n- increased competence and knowledge of learners and teachers in the field of heritage during language courses and in digital skills;\r\n- more active participation of civil society, associations, volunteers and youth and other stakeholders in the project.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of the project all content and results will be available on the WEB portal and You Tube channel and maintained in the working state by the coordinator and partners.\r\n\r\nGiven its evolutionary nature and adaptable to other formative contexts, the project may have an extension in other lines of educational work and may also be of interest to the sensitised public.", "http://www.russianpresence.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA204-037351_1"]]}}, "6QL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1546214400000, "TagItSmart! - Smart Tags driven service platform for enabling ecosystems of connected objects", "Evrythng Limited", "TagItSmart sets out to redefine the way we think of everyday mass-market objects not normally considered as part of an IoT ecosystem.
