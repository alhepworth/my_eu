The project was created by a project team at the Primary School No. 51 with Integrative Classes in Katowice. The need to create such a project results both from the low results achieved by our students on external examinations and from the teachers' desire to introduce and apply new teaching methods and forms of work, so as to motivate all our students better.\r\nThe project team consists of 14 teachers selected as a result of recruitment. Among them there are teachers of mathematics, science, geography, ICT, Polish, English, early school education and our school educator. Almost all team members are teachers with many years of experience who are aware of the changing school reality and the diverse needs and expectations of modern students. Therefore, they have decided to undertake the challenge of introducing changes in their didactic process by implementing innovative methods and techniques of work, using ICT and making classes more attractive in a way that would strengthen their students' motivation to develop the key competences. In order to achieve the intended goal, it is necessary to carry out professional development of this group of teachers in a way that will allow for changes in the institution.\r\nWe have chosen 7 courses giving our teachers the opportunity to acquire and improve new professional skills (linguistic, methodological, ICT, psychology etc.). Teachers will attend courses that take place in Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Norway and Malta in order to become adept in European systems of education, methods and forms of work and multiple ways to develop motivation and key competences (linguistic, mathematical and scientific-technical, IT, social and civic), as well as learning skills. The content of these teacher development courses includes the use of ICT in the didactic process, the use of games and other activating methods, working with the student with SEN, English teaching methodology, characteristics of work with the elementary school pupil as well as issues related to working with teenagers. Apart from that, 3 teachers will attend a refresher English course for teachers of other subjects - it will contain issues of introducing elements of CLIL -bilingual teaching in the classroom. The knowledge and skills acquired in the process of teacher development will allow us all  to make the classes more attractive and, as a result, to increase the students' commitment and motivation.\r\nA valuable part of our project is the participation of our teachers in the observation of other teachers in their work during the so-called job shadowing. Our partners are schools from Italy, Spain, Great Britain, Finland and Portugal, to which pairs of teachers will be sent for observation. Our partners have important achievements in the  teaching of pupils from SEN - also those gifted ones, using ICT in the teaching process, working with eTwinning, bilingual education, using CLIL and broadly understood international cooperation. We expect that these trips will significantly contribute to the development of our teachers' competences in these areas and will enable them to see how in practice the knowledge gained during the development courses is used. What is important, the schools in Portugal, the UK and Italy also work with older students, this will give us a chance to become familiar with the specificity of working with older teenagers, who we have had at our school since last September.\r\nThe project has been planned for 22 months, during which teachers will be prepared for mobility, it will be implemented through their participation in courses and job shadowing, furthermore evaluation and project validation will take place. Thanks to the participation in the project, our teachers will undoubtedly improve their competitiveness by acquiring new skills (linguistic, communication, ICT, organization, culture and interpersonal skills). We are convinced that the increase of key competences will contribute to raising the self-esteem of all our students, the number of educational failures will drop and we will provide them with a better start to the next stages of education. Our school will benefit from participation in the Erasmus Plus program by increasing the quality of the educational offer, achieving better teaching results, raising the pedagogical competence of our staff and establishing new international contacts. On account of these activities, the school, teachers and students will be prepared for further activity on the local, national and international levels.", "http://www.lts.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PL01-KA101-048385_3"]]}}}}
