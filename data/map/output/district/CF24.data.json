Formula student UK is an international design- and racing competition staged every year at Silverstone. Teams from universities all over the world compete in designing and building a single-seat racing car from scratch, powered either by electricity or internal combustion. In the competition itself the design, the financial planning and the business model are presented. If the car passes a thorough technical inspection it proceeds to compete in an acceleration event, braking, a figure-of-eight skid-pad event and general track driving. It is, therefore, clear that the competition challenges various aspects of the engineering studies and in return delivers more qualified engineers from the universities.Both Team Spark and Cardiff Racing are making their own racing car and want to share their story in this documentary. Each team consists of 40 young people which want to widen their knowledge by taking on real world challenges by completing hands-on projects; an experience that is unusual for most young people. Out of these 80 people, 9 members from Team Spark and 5 members from Cardiff Racing will make the documentary. The other members will continue to work on the car. The main difference between the teams is that Team Spark is making an electrical racing car while Cardiff Racing is making a combustion racing car. Hence, the documentary will cover both car types in the competition and describe the differences in their design and build.The knowledge and the experience the team members get from this amazing experience will in return help them greatly in the future. The teams want to give the audience some insight into the immense amount of work and endurance the teams need to  make a racing car and observe the excitement and tension at the competition. The documentary\u00b4s main goal is to increase young people's interest in science and innovation by showing them all of the amazing things they can do with a technical education. The film will be shown in schools, workplaces, on television and on social media in order to achieve this goal. Our second goal is to increase young people's skills in filmmaking by learning on their own how to make a documentary from scratch. The third and final goal is to promote the teams and hopefully get more sponsors, better resources and hopefully higher scores at the competition.

The cooking was also a great way to learn about each country and was enjoyed by everyone who took part, who all now have cook books that were created by themselves and a designer.

Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight.\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis.
