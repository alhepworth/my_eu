At the heart of this new emerging connected economy is creativity.  For offenders/ex-offenders to embrace this new economy they need to develop their creative capabilities/understand how to make positive connections to increase their Social Capital.\r\n\r\nHuman creativity is endless, but for ex-offenders the words \u201cNo!\u201d and \u201cit will never work\u201d dominate. Creativity allows one to learn about ourselves, develop fullest potential, survive in an ever changing world, with many mutually reinforcing strands supporting resettlement. \r\n\r\nCreative senses need to be ignited, becoming aware ones environment, wider community, thus developing empowerment in society, greater self-awareness; opening a new world of opportunities and engaging in learning.  Creativity is a way of sharing meaningful things/ ideas, unlocking innovative capacity.  \r\n\r\nThe project partnership is diverse specialist organisations in the criminal justice system from four EU member states (Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and the UK),  who are working together to develop an innovative approach to allow for offenders to develop within the Connected Economy, \"excavate buried dreams\", resolve fear/learned helplessness to develop positive goals.\r\nUnderstanding the importance of connection, individuals learn the seemingly complex process which allows the swap of information/expectation/culture, learning to open up to others, which requires humanity/generosity.  Learning to share creativity through the Connection Economy means that the individual needs to give up control over the outcome, to learn to work in partnership.  Through giving up control over the outcome of ones interactions, allows others to make connections.  Friends bring more friends, reputation allows the chance to build a better reputation, access to information encourages seeking  more information, making learning exciting, cross generational, rewarding, helping the offender \u2018Learn to learn\u2019.\r\nAs connections multiply, they increase in value as does social capital.  The project recognise the dynamics/potential of the Connected Economy and how by developing creativity linked to this economy we stimulate innovation, openness, diversity, and a new safety net for the truly disadvantage in society.\r\n\r\nThe project is developing a Manual of approaches, tools and methodology to offenders and ex-offenders to develop their creativity and access the connected economy.  The training materials and tools are about:  Igniting creativity; Learning to share, trust, connect;  Understanding how the connected economy works (tools and rules); How to develop contacts, networks, social capital;  Progression towards employability; Become a non offending EU citizen resilient in a complex society.\r\n\r\nProject partners are testing these new approaches, tools and methodology on 40 offenders and ex-offenders, using 13 as indepth case studies linked to a Social Return on Investment methodology to explore the impact the projects concepts can make.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of the project will be captured in the 'Study of Lessons learned' which will support evidence based policy making in the Criminal Justice System around these new learning approaches linking creativity to the Connected Economy.\r\n\r\nDuring 2017 a road show of dissemination conferences will be held across the EU in Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and the UK to engage policy makers and practitioners working in the criminal justice system into the benefits and good practice of the projects concepts and tools.  Interested organisations and individuals can join the project discussions via the projects social media platforms to learn more and share their own ideas.\r\n\r\nProject results are clearly linked and  committed with Europe 2020 strategy and European policies to fight poverty and social exclusion and results grounded on a shared vision, tools and methodologies that will provide lessons to be learned and an opportunity to engage some of societies hardest to reach individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Creativity in the Connected Economy is about helping those most at risk in our modern complex society, and through the development of innovative approaches to help this individuals to engage into the labour market/employment and to create a thirst for more learning.  By learning to share and connect these individuals are developing a valuable social capital, which will help them in months and years to come, making society a safer place and helping those from prison or the courts to create full and positive futures.", "http://www.pictora.org", "Pictora Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013755_coordinator"]]}}, "8HT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Circular Process for Eco-Designed Bulky Products and Internal Car Parts", "Oakdene Hollins Limited", "ECOBULK through a large scale demonstration effort will contribute to \u201cclosing the loop\u201d of composite products in the automotive, furniture and building sectors by promoting greater re-use, upgrade, refurbishment and recycle of products, parts, and materials. It will bring opportunities for both the environment and the economy by offering business opportunities along the entire new defined supply and value chains. ECOBULK approach will be based on identifying and promoting commonalities in processes, technologies, products and services ensuring replicability and transferability to other industrial sectors. The ambitious application of the circular economy model in the three selected sectors is justified by the high numbers of synergies, in terms of the design (design for modularity, design for disassembly/dismantling), materials (fibre and particle reinforced plastic composites), manufacturing technology (moulding, extrusion, hot pressing, thermobonding) and business models (leasing, renting, PSS, fix-it shops, etc.).  The methodology will embrace and focus on large scale demonstration activities in 7 countries and more than 15 demonstrators to address the key components of the circular economy solutions; rethinking product design to shift towards a Design Circular Framework, validation of material and product manufacturing technologies to ensure technical and economic feasibility, new reverse logistics for the recovery of products and parts from consumers or users and into the supply chain, implementation of Innovative business models exploring C2C, B2C and B2B opportunities, and dissemination to raise awareness and knowledge sharing activities on circular economy solutions.

By keeping components and their embodied material in use for longer, significant energy use and emissions to air and water can be avoided. In addition to environmental benefits, remanufacturing provides opportunities for the creation of highly skilled jobs and economic growth.  \n\nDespite these accolades, remanufacturing is an undervalued part of the industrial landscape and an under-recognised sustainable industry. Activity to promote remanufacturing is currently undertaken at a sectoral level for some product sectors. In Europe, unlike in the recycling industry, cross-sectoral activities to facilitate knowledge transfer and promote the industry do not exist. Our major competitors, the US and China, already have a common vision and strategy for remanufacturing within their industrial landscape. An outcome may be that European remanufacturing could lose competitiveness against these more organised sectors. As a result, there is a real need for a European-level solution to encourage remanufacturing throughout Europe.\n\nThis proposal sets out the formation, coordination and support of a European Remanufacturing Network (ERN) over a project period of two years, which aims to:\n\u2022 Encourage new businesses to take up remanufacturing.\n\u2022 Help existing remanufacturers improve their operations.\n\u2022 Improve competitiveness of remanufacturers domestically and internationally.\n\u2022 Create greater awareness of remanufacturing in the public and policy makers to increase demand and address barriers.\n\nThe aims of the ERN will be achieved through:\n\u2022 Mapping out the current remanufacturing landscape in Europe and estimating its future potential.\n\u2022 Disseminating best practice in remanufacturing business models, processes and design.\n\u2022 Providing industry with remanufacturing knowledge, tools and partnerships.\n\u2022 Undertaking an information campaign to raise the profile of the European remanufacturing industry.", 195287.0, 1150022.0, 6, 9, "ERN", null, null, null, "h2020_194406_942473438"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "OAKDENE HOLLINS LIMITED*", 225726.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_2474"], [2016, "OAKDENE HOLLINS LIMITED*", 56463.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_53480"], [2016, "OAKDENE HOLLINS LIMITED*", 1751.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_25146"], [2017, "OAKDENE HOLLINS LIMITED*", 1329.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_25907"]]}}, "8RY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "BK Hilden goes Europe", "Nordson (UK) Ltd", 63117.0, 11, 26, "The vocational college \"Berufskolleg Hilden\" as the sending organisation expands its international activities by searching and finding placements for students with organisations, enterprises and institutes in European countries, in order to reinforce their linguistic, inter-cultural and professional skills and knowledge. The 37 participants of the project belong to different sections: 2-year-course in biotech, 3-year-course in IT and students of commercial education. Before attending Berufskolleg Hilden these students decided to work in very different professional areas and have reached different qualifications and certificates. The above mentioned project includes 3 different activities matching the 3 different sections. At a very early stage all students are informed about the possibility of internships abroad. Their interest is also aroused by separate informative meetings held by former interns reporting about their experiences in foreign countries. They get information about current partners of the Berufskolleg Hilden and about organisational and financial aspects. At the same time the existing contacts are carried on to emerge the current data according to supervisors and contact persons. The individual facts are directly given to the participants in order to start a personal contact and relationship to the tutors at an early stage; i.e. before departure. In the section dealing with commercial education the students start their placement in cooperating companies and contact them through their employers. According to  the section/activity varies the duration of their stay.  In the biotech section the students stay abroad for at least 3 months, in the section of commercial education the stay is only 3 weeks and in the IT section the student stay for 2 months. When beeing abroad a continual contact between the  participants, the            tutors  and coordinators  in Hilden is secured. In addition to that a personal visit of the teachers in charge is effected; respectively in the BTA and IT sections. In the end the Training Agreement and the Europass will be worked out and signed mutually. All students write an internship report which is proof read and evaluated by their teachers. These reports offer an insight into the increase of language, professional skills and experiences, as well as into social and intercultural competences of the students. Furthermore the reports as well as presentations are used for evaluation. Posters and presentations function as a tool for spreading the results. Moreover organisations and other interested parties are informed by these activities in order to establish the Berufskolleg Hilden as School of Europe (Europaschule) focussing on the major target of internationality.", "http://www.nordson.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000172_23"]]}}}}
