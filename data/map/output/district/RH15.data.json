This will allow to store and shift the harvested solar energy available abundantly during the summer to the less sunny and colder winter period thus covering a large fraction of heating and domestic hot water demand in buildings. The targeted benefit of this next generation solar heating technology is to reach and overcome a solar fraction of 60% in central/north Europe, reaching 80% in the sunnier south of Europe, with a compact and high-performing STES system at low cost, realising solar-active houses throughout EU.\nThe SWS-heating system is based on a multi-modular sorption seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) unit, using novel sorbent materials of Selective Water Sorbents (SWS) family characterised by superior heat storage density compared to the state of the art, making it possible to drastically decrease the storage volume with negligible thermal losses. These materials are employed in a sorption module with dedicated heat exchangers. Solar heat is provided to the storage modules by high-efficiency evacuated tube solar thermal collectors. Intensive research activities will deal with an advanced vacuum combi-storage tank, with the aim to further minimise thermal losses. A smart and adaptive control will be developed for efficiently managing heat supply and demand sides, including advanced features aiming at user-friendliness. A building prototype will be commissioned including the SWS-heating system, which will be tested and validated in Germany and Sweden and proof all challenging objectives.\nThe project also includes dissemination and communication activities to ensure outreach of its results.

These groups of learners face barriers to learning and accessing work which their peers do not and these learners often fall behind in their work and in attainment. They require an additional intervention in order to succeed and improve their future career and learning prospects. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nWe worked with learners with fewer opportunities who are underachieving on their courses who would benefit most from an intervention to broaden their opportunities. The objectives of the project addressed their issues and needs through:\r\n-Providing additional assessment and support opportunities to validate skills for learners to succeed in their qualifications\r\n-Boosting employability and mobility in the wider EU labour market through practical work experience\r\n-Raising participant's awareness and understanding of other cultures, countries and language to broaden their life perspective\r\n-Increasing self-esteem, confidence and motivation and social skills\r\nAccompanying adults had opportunities for continued professional development, increasing their motivation in working with groups with fewer opportunities and developed their teaching to include transnational perspectives.\r\nThe partners also worked together to modernise education and training in working with these groups by sharing best practice and utilizing innovative techniques in supporting learners with fewer opportunities to improve their learning performance and enhance the employability and mobility prospects. The project also reinforced and further developed the transnational scope of the partner organisations in working at an international level.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nParticipants consisted of learners with fewer opportunities studying on entry level and level 1 introductory vocational qualifications at Care Co-ops,  Chichester College and Aspire Sussex in the vocational areas of horticulture, catering and construction.  Most learners also had additional needs including mental health issues, learning disabilities, disadvantage, offending and drug and alcohol issues. The total number of learners who participated in the project is 192 with 64 accompanying adults. This was carried out over 16 mobility flows with an average of 12 learners and 4 accompanying adults per group.\r\n\r\nDescription of project activities\r\nTwo week work placements took place at Eco Chateau Training Hotel in the vocational areas of catering, horticulture and construction. The placement itinerary was jointly designed by course tutors from sending partner organisations and the host partner to build in opportunities for assessment where learner evidence is lacking for specific qualification units and a range of individual learning objectives specific to the participants. ECVET arrangements were developed to increase recognition of achievement. Outside of the working day, visits were organised to places relevant to their vocational areas such as to local food producers and visits to building projects. Participants also took part in cultural visits to places of interest, socialising with French people and sharing a meal in the local French community. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in carrying out the project\r\nThe project was managed within the Care Co-ops Quality and Project Management Framework. For mobility projects, this included the 10 principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nThe impact of the project on the learners was that they had increased opportunities for their learning outcomes to be assessed, therefore increasing their opportunities to succeed in achieving their qualifications. Participants also demonstrated increased confidence, motivation, linguistic and employability skills through having carried out a work placement abroad. Partner organisations have shared good practice through established networks and this will contribute to a larger dialogue about creative ways to engage learners with additional needs through mobility projects. Accompanying staff developed their professional skills in sharing practice with partner organisations on supporting learners with additional needs and experience increased motivation as a result. \r\n\r\nPotential long term benefits\r\nIn the long term we expect the project to have a significant impact on the learners' attitude towards work, learning and European work to increase their future prospects. Through further developing this model, we hope to share our learning more widely so that it can be adopted by other organisations for inclusion in future European mobility experiences.", "http://www.aspiresussex.org.uk", "The Platform Social Enterprise Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012228_1"]]}}, "9RQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "International Orientation for Apprentices of Coburg and Gera", "HPC Engineering PLC", 25148.0, 6, 6, "It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to find appropriately qualified young people to fill the many positions around the world for KAESER Service Technicians.
