Part III\r\n\r\nContext: \r\nThe Wartburg College states in its Strategic perspective: 'Customization for all types of pupils, quality of our education and personal responsibility of the teachers'. This has been worked out at our location by focusing on talents:\r\n1) broadening: room for education that takes place outside the physical school building);\r\n2) in-depth: room for deepening the Christian identity; attention must be paid to the development of talents (during the lessons, in extra study materials, debating, extra courses, etc.); and\r\n3) multi dimensional: room for multi diminsional education in the classroom in tto and veto, but also a versatile didactics.\r\nThis has been elaborated by the tto team and applied in its own tto policy plan. The school wants to train the tto pupils to become citizens who are valuable and therefore serve in their international and own environment.\r\n\r\nBeing valuable as a Christian citizen in this context implies the following objectives for tto:\r\n1) After three years, the pupils have the level of language proficiency that corresponds to level B2 of the European Reference Framework (ERK) for all sub-skills.\r\n2) The pupils can talk and write with insight about a diversity of European and international aspects. In this way they learn a cultural empathy to serve themselves in their (international) environment. European and international orientation (EIO) takes place in the regular subject lessons, cross-curricular projects and international cooperation programs.\r\n3) The students are reminded of the social relevance of the English language in the whole of the (global) society, in organizations and the business community and in further education.\r\n4) The teachers offer high-quality learning material to constantly challenge the tto pupils.\r\n5) In the classroom and at the school it becomes visible that the pupils are called by God to live not for themselves but for God and their neighbors. That is the guideline for learning for pupils and teachers. The question 'why do we learn a language?' we answer with: 'to serve God and to be a blessing to others'.\r\n\r\nAims:\r\nThe tto teachers will develop their English language skills and CLIL didactics (Content and Language Integrated Learning) in order to raise the level of English of the pupils. Also the teachers will be able to dig deeper in the subject content. Another aim is that pupils will grow in the way they give English output which will make it possible to participate in the society as European citizen.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants: \r\n14 teachers (6 CLIL course, 8 job shadowing; during two school years).\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n1) CLIL course at the Hilderstone institute in Broadstairs. \r\n2) Job shadowing at several English schools.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n1) The CLIL course consists of a 'Language' as well as a 'Methodology' part. It focuses on classroom English and also on how to give the right instructions when it comes to effective learning. On top of that the course offers a wide range of CLIL-didactics that will provides the teachers more tools to manage the educational process.\r\n2) The job shadowing consists of the attending and observing of classes, the collecting of new classroom English and didactics and the collaboration with English teachers (discussing each others' lesson materials and lessons observed as well as the participation on moments of spiritual formation).\r\n\r\nExpected impact:\r\nAfter the courses teachers will have made huge progress on the area of language skills, CLIL-didactics as well as international orientation.

Our main goal this time is to develop skills to be able to introduce project-based learning on a wider scale at our school. We would like to gain experience via job shadowing mobilities. Our target schools are institutions where teachers already apply the methods required for project based learning. Moreover, we would like to participate on courses that will enable colleagues to acquire skills that will play an important role in teaching certain curricula using project methods.\r\nIt is a significant change in our new project that the majority of the applicants are not language teachers. Most teachers participating in this project are highly motivated and would like to improve their professional careers thank to the opportunities Erasmus+ offers. Their language skills grant their successful participation in courses.\r\nWe consider acquiring skills for project-based learning highly important as traditional teaching methods (frontal teaching, teaching based on assessment and memorising) are becoming less effective because it is more difficult to motivate students and as a result new skills for project-based learning are becoming essential.\r\nThis project would enable us to organise nine mobilities. However, due to dissemination, we expect that at least half of the teaching staff would be affected by the project. These nine mobilities are very diverse, though they serve the purposes of project based learning and they are all in the interest of our school. This initiative will have an impact on health prevention, school-parents relationship and it will also have a positive effect on informal learning.\r\nIn case our project is accepted, our school could become even more international and we could claim that 25% of our teaching staff have brought their professional horizons to a European level and they would have a wider insight into current trends in pedagogy. However, becoming an international school is already an ongoing process in case of our school. During this project cycle schools from abroad (especially from Poland, Germany and Great Britain) have inquired concerning job shadowing possibilities at our school. These cooperations originate from previous mobilities where our colleagues got in touch with local teachers.\r\nOur headmistress takes part in our project this year as well. Her participation signals that our project is supported by our school leaders.\r\nWe would also like to highlight that international projects improve the language skills of our teaching staff. Taking part in a mobility will activate their language skills, in contrast with everyday teaching situations in which our language skills seem to deteriorate.\r\nOn the whole, we expect our project to help us make learning at J\u00e1nos X\u00e1ntus Bilingual Secondary School more entertaining.

To think about it, a tutor helping a child to learn reading/writing always selects appropriate learning material based on the child's needs and capabilities.<br/>4. Personalized content presentation.
