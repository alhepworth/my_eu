It includes  multidisciplinary competences of literacy (the working language is English) and numeracy, and facilitates the exchange of knowledge and good practice between 6 European nations: Italy (leading partner); Hungary; Poland; Germany; the UK and France. The basic idea is to plan, prepare and deliver a series of recreational Maths contests using ICT over a  period of 3 years between participating partners to help make using Maths enjoyable and appealing. The use of contests consisting of problem solving in mixed-cultural groups during project meetings and single nation teams on-line during the school year, which focus on thought showering and the chance to go back over the process of alternative solution discovery when errors occur, will encourage students, especially those who find Maths difficult and uninteresting, to keep trying. Maths is often considered an insurmountable obstacle but we aim to build confidence and show that errors are an essential part of the learning process. Maths contests are not currently widespread in schools because they are sometimes considered a waste of time or a diversion from the formal syllabus, but they do in fact help to build cross-curricula and digital skills and foster critical thinking which students can use in other fields and apply to their future learning pathways. The project addresses the acquisition of basic skills as well as offering diverse challenges for the more able learners.\r\nThanks to eastern and western European cooperation within the project, there will be the possibility to share knowledge, problem-solving techniques, experiences, methods, observations and other aspects which will help the achieved results to become more universal. Another aim of the project is to arouse students` interests in further education along these lines, which are crucial for the economy of each participating country and future employability. In the process of the project, partner schools want to work together to compare Maths syllabi and select material to create problems and find solutions together. They will produce a final handbook with the publication of  the contest results and solutions in both electronic and hard forms. The cooperation among European institutions in the project will contribute to the improvement of the quality of education, widen aspirations and foster the implementation of innovative practices in European schools.", "http://www.heanorgate.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA201-003209_3"]]}}}}
