The portal provides activities to users that increase their meta-linguistic awareness about the bi- and multilingual use of sign languages. Specifically, we will exploit research data and analyses by translating them into a resource with educational units that support upskilling of deaf people in order to communicate remotely with signers of other sign languages. The MULTSIGN project had demonstrated that sign language users have a unique enhanced potential, compared to spoken languages, to communicate across language boundaries, and the project will enable signers to exploit this potential. The portal also provides a service for setting up flexibly adaptable bi- and multilingual online work spaces for transnational groups of sign language users, with an integrated tool for sign-to-sign-translation between different sign languages. This will enable disadvantaged deaf communities, who are largely isolated from international contact, to access developments and resources already available elsewhere among international deaf communities but not linguistically accessible. The project is a collaboration between an academic partner, the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in the UK and a private company with special expertise in the relevant area, Dolphio Technologies, in Hungary.

The three years EwasteR journey, undertaken through a series of nine closely related work packages, developed and established the partnership as a collaborative high performance team.  The EwasteR project addressed the increasingly relevance of the Electrical and electronic waste (E-waste) sector in Europe which is currently the largest growing waste stream. Recycling of WEEE is a specialist part of the waste and recycling industry. Indeed, waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) such as computers, TV-sets, fridges and cell phones is one the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with some 9 million tonnes generated in 2005, and expected to grow to more than 12 million tonnes by 2020.WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content, and if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources (e.g., around 10% of total gold worldwide is used for their production). To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and enhance resource efficiency the improvement of collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.The main beneficiaries of the project are young aspiring workers/technicians and entrepreneurs (learners) wishing to work in the weee recycling and reuse management sector, but the project also provides substantial benefits to the organisations working in the circular economy area using VET as a tool to increase employability chances for those learners at the European level.The aim of the EwasteR project has been to emphasise the relationship between waste creation and resource management and to demonstrate the need for skills, competence and experience of entrepreneurs and specialists in devising a solution and/or an appropriate intervention. The project had four concrete key objectives, including:-Overcome the challenges of vocational skills mismatches in the WEEE re-use sector and give supportto it;-Contribute to the development of new solutions in VET system;-Ensure the highest possible relevance for all targets groups and stakeholders involved;-Create new conditions for providing employment and training opportunities and supporting national Qualifications award in the sector with growth potential (green jobs).The future for the practice that has been developed in EwasteR depends on three key factors and these have been the focus of the exploitation strategy. These factors are:-Evidence of the demand for the recognition and validation of new professional qualifications in WEEE recycling and reuse management sector to implement the NQF and RQF of different Countries across Europe;-The development of new European initiatives that enables the development of a strategic sector skills alliance for VET providers and professionals, employers, experts, and stakeholders concerning Circular Economy system and sustainable development across Europe;-The potential to encourage training-exchanging experience across Europe and to work for an effective impact in the VET and labour systems at all levels.", "http://www.uclan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_554341-EPP-1-2014-1-IT-EPPKA2-SSA_1"], [2018, "REbuildinG AfteR Displacement", "UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE", 341104.0, 4, 5, "Immediately following a disaster and conflict-induced displacement a community will undergo resettlement as a process of recovery comprising efforts to restore the displaced community\u2019s equilibrium level from different perspectives. Resettlement is also a process that introduces new built environment (BE) for the displaced.

However, following a fundamental change in the system, restoring the earlier equilibrium is almost impossible. When BE is concerned, the most overlooked aspect of understanding and determining the success of the resettlement is the role of the host community. A sudden change in the pattern of interaction with the BE would have an immediate effect on the stability of the host community. Consequently, both the communities will suffer stress in adapting to the new BE.

The community need analysis will also inform the competency framework, in identifying the competencies required by BE professionals to better engage in rebuilding efforts. The project will further develop a synthesis report on the role of the BE in enhancing social cohesion and a guidance note with recommendations on best practices. The outputs discussed above will not only benefit theory but due to the importance of the subject matter within Europe and beyond, it will provide an important contribution to the practice. These outputs will inform policy and will be helpful for national and local governments, international organisations, non-profit organisations and BE professional bodies to understand the issues related to rebuilding communities following disaster and conflict induced mass displacements from the perspective of the BE.

What are good examples, what are barriers? The survey will result in a roadmap to further professionalize sign language teachers and the sign language teaching profession and in recommendations for the development of a transnational qualification system for sign language teachers based on the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning (EQF). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\n\r\nThe sign languages of the EU are recognized as fully fledged indigenous languages of the EU (Leeson, 2006), and an important part of Europe\u2019s multilingual diversity. In most EU countries the opportunities to learn a sign language however are limited. Mainstream schools and colleges do not \u2013 as a rule \u2013 offer sign language courses to their students. Deaf sign language users who want to train to become a sign language teacher or who want to further professionalize their teaching skills will find it even more difficult to find a training course and/or accessible resources. \r\n\r\nThe short-term objective of this project therefore is to develop an OER that sign language teachers in EU countries can use for information and inspiration, either independently or as participants in national or transnational training courses for sign language teachers. The objective in the intermediate term: to  promote and support further collaboration in this field between organizations, between countries, and between the teaching and teachers of sign languages and those of spoken languages.

We will use a bottom-up methodology, asking sign language teachers and learners what they do, think, want, need, as wel as a top-down approach, comparing EU programmes and curricula for the training of sign language teachers and selecting good examples. Last but least, we will look at methods, frameworks, guidelines and tools developed in EU projects for the teaching of spoken second languages, screen these for their usability for sign language teachers, adapt and translate these and add them to the SignTeach OER. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO?\r\n\r\nThe SignTeach consortium consists of experienced sign language teachers and other experts in this field from 11 organisations in 8 EU countries, each with extensive national and international networks.

Given the inadequate educational and well-being outcomes for many of the most disadvantaged groups in British society (particularly looked-after children, families experiencing multiple problems) the social care sector is called upon to achieve fundamental changes. The high-profile Munro review of child protection argued for a child-centred system as is commonly found in countries where social pedagogy underpins care and welfare provisions. The influential Association of Directors of Children's Services therefore recommended that local authorities should adopt social pedagogy to ensure 'a consistent and holistic approach to underpin the commissioning and provision of support for children and young people across the age range, and their families'. Whilst social pedagogy is clearly recognised as a way of addressing the need for systemic change - the Government is currently funding a social pedagogy pilot under its Innovation Programme - and pilot projects have consistently demonstrated its potential to improve outcomes, taking social pedagogy to scale is hampered by the cost of training a substantial part of the workforce and a lack of free comprehensive learning resources that can offer compelling insights into social pedagogical practice in other countries and support innovation.We aim to address these issues effectively by creating a Massive Open Online Course in European social pedagogy, consisting of 9 sessions that offer unique insights into social pedagogy in the partner countries. Our international multi-sector partnership between 9 organisations leading social pedagogy developments in higher education, vocational training and organisational capacity-building is designed to share innovative and best practice across linguistic barriers that have frequently prevented cross-fertilisation in social care across Europe. To support this aim and influence policy-making, we also propose to produce an academic research report that draws on the learning about social pedagogy between the 7 participating countries, outlines innovative ideas with the potential to impact on social care practice and makes policy recommendations about how these can be cross-culturally translated in order to develop a coherent conceptual and practice framework in social pedagogy across Europe.

The understanding of concrete learning behaviour and uses of electronic courseware and online resources is an important prerequisite to assess the quality of autonomous, lifelong learning. \r\nAnother challenge are the high dropout rates associated with e-learning, not in the least where MOOCs are concerned. Among numerous other variables, an important factor is the lack of engagement and motivation, since students don\u2019t know how they are progressing and what their peers\u2019 achievements over time are. Students involved in e-learning often have a limited knowledge of their own learning habits and which rate of studying with the online material is required. To succeed in (semi-)autonomous learning, however, a higher level of self-regulation is needed.\r\n\r\nThis project proposal addresses the Erasmus + challenge of raising the quality of education through the use of learning analytics. Learning analytics is a new and promising research field which can be defined as \u201cthe measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners in their context, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environment in which it occurs\u201d (Siemens et. Al). The recent evolution of web-based learning and the possibility of tracking students\u2019 online behaviour offers promising new ways of measuring actual self-study activities. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a clear image of how higher education students in different European countries learn online. The goal is to map existing learning patterns in 4 different types of online language learning and teaching and maths courses and to feed back this new knowledge to the most important educational actors themselves, being the students and their lecturers. We want to use a bottom-up learning analytics approach taking the perspective of the learning process, focusing on the courses used and the students\u2019 learning trails through these courses, and intend to use process mining techniques for the analysis of the data. Therefore, a complimentary and cross-disciplinary consortium of teams from three universities and a private open source company was set up.\r\nTogether, they will first implement tracking of learning data based on the new Experience API standard for interoperability with other learning environments (e.g. mobile apps, games) and reporting tools. After a piloting phase, the learning behavior of several student groups enrolled in distance learning or university programmes with an important self-study component will be tracked during one semester. The data will be collected in a central repository (Learning Record store). An important point of concern in the project will be the privacy of the students who will be monitored. Participants will be asked to give their consent to collect and use their data for the aims that will be clearly described. The data will be kept anonymous and the EU data protection directive will be taken into account.\r\nIn a fourth phase we aim to analyse the processes of autonomous learning comparing them to the intended pedagogic objectives of the tools. Patterns of learning behaviour will be detected, based on which different user profiles can be identified and feedback about used learning resources can be obtained.\r\nFinally, data visualisation tools will be developed and implemented in order to create a learning dashboard application for students and for teachers. Special care will be given to ease of use of the dashboards for non-specialist users. These applications will allow both the teachers and the students to understand how they learn online but also to compare their profile to user patterns of their peers. Educators get dynamic and real-time overviews of how their students are progressing, which students might be at risk of dropping out or of failing for the course and which parts of the courses cause difficulties/require more feedback.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at the development of a generic model for implementing learning analytics in interactive e-learning tools, which can be reused in different educational settings, countries, courses. The project outputs will be used by or presented to the student and instructor target groups but more generally also to all stakeholders in the field of educational innovation and research on a European level.

According to the Modernization Agenda for Higher Education, the sector faces multiple challenges in its quest to build critically thinking, creative, and adaptable adults (Vassiliou A.); these include the economic crisis, youth unemployment, integration of new technologies and modes of working, and more. On the other hand, the Communication on Opening-up Education highlights the need to stimulate innovative ways of teaching and learning through new technologies and digital content, to alleviate the \u201cnew digital divide\u201d which has led to 50-80% of students never using digital content, and to exploit the opportunities of the digital revolution in educational contexts.In engineering principles, the knowledge students build while enrolled in higher education may become to a large degree irrelevant a few years after graduation as a result of the fast evolution of technology in innovation related sectors. In this context, the capacity to think critically and to learn-to-learn are as important, if not more, as the base knowledge developed through formal curricula. In addition, to facilitate an effective transition to the professional world higher education must expose students to industry practices and processes rather than be limited to the development of core knowledge. This exposure may be achieved to a certain degree through specific courses; more effectively, it may be achieved through the integration of industry processes into curricula thus enabling students to use new skills and competencies in a learning environment that simulates the way industry deploys knowledge.Objectives: LEAP aims at building experience and knowledge among higher education students on emerging lean and agile industry practices empowering them to effectively transition into the professional world, focusing on engineering disciplines. The project further aims at closing the new digital divide by promoting the development of high quality digital content for higher education linked to both academic and industry needs. Lean practices will encourage students to design solutions that meet needs while minimizing the deployment of resources. Agile practices will expose students to industry cycles in which design is integrated throughout production processes, as opposed to only in the early stages of production, ensuring that the final product effectively addresses consumer needs.Methodology: LEAP will pursue these objectives through the design and development of serious games that encourage learners to adopt industry roles, to think critically for addressing community and societal needs through agile engineering solutions, to practice on the application of industrial process management in the context of their higher education curricula, and to take into account environmental responsibility issues in service design and implementation. Recognizing the importance of supporting educators on integrating the proposed innovative learning methods and tools into their teaching practices LEAP will further develop good practice guidelines and instructor support content. The outcomes will be validated in real-life contexts in classrooms in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Estonia, and the UKThe outcomes of the project will be:\u2022 A lean and agile learning design framework that encourages students to think critically for building engineering solutions that effectively address user needs while taking into account environmental issues\u2022 Proof-of-concept serious games based on scenarios that challenge learners to introduce solutions to real-world issues through engineering innovation\u2022 Educators support content for facilitating the integration of proposed methods and tools into existing instructional practices\u2022 Good practice recommendations for promoting uptake and adoption of project results based on evaluation findingsImpact: LEAP will promote quality teaching and learning in higher education through the alignment of educational processes to industry needs. It will further promote the implementation of the Communication on Opening Up Education by fostering the development and deployment of digital content for higher education that helps build student capacity in adopting industrial design, by supporting educators in their efforts to continuously update their instructional skills, and by stimulating innovation in learning and teaching through educational frameworks that link education to the professional world.", "http://www.uclan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-EL01-KA203-023624_5"], [2017, "Games Used IN Engaging Virtual Environments for Real-time language Education", "UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE", 177344.0, 6, 6, "Although the use of games, simulations and immersive environments have been explored by numerous EU projects in order to promote the commission\u2019s goal of promoting language learning and linguistic diversity, it is still not clear how best to integrate them in effective language learning environments in the primary and secondary school sectors. Moreover, while digital games increasingly preoccupy the social lives of many young people, educators do not have a clear picture of how best to replicate the levels of motivation, creativity agency and enjoyment they experience during the game experience. Although previous generations of digital games have been criticised for promoting unhealthy or solitary lifestyles in young children and teenagers, the recent prominence of more affordable forms of augmented and virtual reality through such games as Pokemon Go, as well as multiplayer networked games such as World of Warcraft, demonstrate that they can be used to promote learner engagement beyond the four walls of the school classroom. The GUINEVERE project addresses the Erasmus+ challenge to promote importance of language learning in addition to their mother tongue by harnessing the potential of digital technologies to promote play and creativity in order to learn new languages. Through digital play in authentic immersive environments primary and secondary school students have the opportunity to learn about important forms of digital and collaborative literacy that are vital not only for their future employability but for their whole person development. \r\nSince coming to prominence over the last decade immersive learning has gone through several iterations of popularity but has often been marginalised in educational environments due to the cost and expertise required. As a result of appearance of more affordable devices such as Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard and the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, immersive learning has been identified by the European Centre for Modern Languages of the Council of Europe (ECML) as an opportunity to provide authentic materials, enable direct contact with other learners and teachers, and promote connectivity. \r\nThrough the GUINEVERE project language teachers and learners will be trained to create their own digital games by transferring them to immersive environments such as virtual worlds, augmented and virtual reality game platforms, and casual games for mobile devices.

Entrepreneurship education generally address active citizenship, social entrepreneurship, venture creation as well as employability (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice, 2016. Entrepreneurship Education at School in Europe. Eurydice Report. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union), and is considered a priority at all levels of education throughout Erasmus+. All or most of the  mainstream resources in this field however, are not accessible to Deaf sign language users: texts do not meet their reading requirements, videos are not subtitled, examples, tools and other resources are inappropriate or inaccessible, mainstream support services, career counselors, mentors, trainers have little or no experience with sign language users. As a result, in the UK labour market, one in five of deaf respondents were unemployed and looking for work compared with one in twenty in the overall UK labour market (RNID, 2006).The objective of the Deaf Enterprise project is to develop, test and implement an OER and curriculum for Deaf sign language users of all ages and all backgrounds that meet their specific strengths as well as requirements. All output will be developed by and for Deaf sign language users from day one and will include interviews with successful Deaf entrepreneurs, training modules, examples, videos, interactive resources, guidelines, and more. All information will be tested for its accessibility, appropriateness and attractiveness for the target groups. To this end, we will organize a transnational training event and several national multiplier events. The output of the project can be used for individual study, for dedicated training programmes for Deaf sign language users, and to supplement / support mainstream entrepreneur education activities with Deaf participants. The University of Central Lancashire is the main contractor and has an international reputation for its Deaf Studies and Interpreter Training programmes, its International Institute for Sign Languages and Deaf Studies (iSLanDS), its Institute for Innovation, Enterprise and Entrepreneurship and its many activities and online and face to face resources for aspiring entrepreneurs.

The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented.

Based, since 2009, on certified methodologies born under the Leonardo da Vinci program, and then on the implementation of Erasmus+, our project CEDRES.S offered to more than 300 VET learners (young people aged 18-25 on their integration path, unemployed people changing career, young graduated) the opportunity to carry out a qualifying path in a European company. \r\nResults are convincing and on line with European studies: 3 to 6 months upon return, 65 % of the participants will be back to work and among them, 15% abroad. 15% will integrate a new training and 5% will decide to experience another mobility to enhance their qualification.  \r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: group departure supervised by intermediary host organisations, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, and individual departures with direct contractualisation of host companies - targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with experienced intermediary organisations and companies in 18 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities.

They are monitored by counsellors at P\u00f4le Emploi or \u201cMissions locales\u201d (members of the consortium);- 20 grants for work 4-week work placements in European companies (Italy, United Kingdom) for continuing VET learners, enrolled in a regional training programme preparing beneficiaries for entering skills training or employment (\u201cgroup 2\u201d). These people are in the process of professional reintegration after several months of unemployment. They have identified a professional project, but are weakened by the lack of transversal skills. An accompanying person will travel with each flow in order to help the trainees to settle in. 4 grants are needed for accompanying persons;- 10 grants for 3-day job-shadowing/observation periods (Finland, Poland, Spain), for staff of the consortium member organisations (\u201cgroup 3\u201d). They promote mobility and need to live a mobility experience themselves and to open up towards a European dimension.After an open call for tenders, AFORMAC was chosen by the Regional Council to assist in the implementation of the project for the beneficiaries of groups 1 and 2.The main objectives for the VET learners (groups 1 and 2) are:1\u00b0 behaviour: motivation, autonomy, self-reliance, communication, social skills, mobility2\u00b0 professional: professional skills and competence, new professional techniques and practice, better knowledge of the world of enterprise;3\u00b0 linguistic and cross-cultural: practising a foreign language, discovering another European language, realising one's European citizenship, growing aware of one's own culture.Transversal skills - necessary for one's personal, social and professional fulfilment - are in the centre of the project for these two groups of VET learners, and this even prior to gaining professional skills as such.The main objectives for the staff mobilities (group 3) are:- development of professional skills;- better understanding of the stakes of European mobility;- improving linguistic and cross-cultural skills;- making the European area one's own and realising fully one's European citizenship.Expected outcomes for the VET learners include:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills- re-establishing one's personal and professional project- increased employability- renewed interest in learning- more active citizen involvement- better capacity for geographical mobility on all levels: regional, national, European, or even international- quicker access to better employment or to skills training/a diploma courseEnvisaged results for staff are:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills;- stronger interest for European mobility;- better understanding and anticipation of the Europe 2020 targets for life-long learning;- increased sense of belonging to Europe.Finally, the potential longer term benefits of the project include : - pursuing the regional dynamic created amongst the members of the consortium of AUDACE mobility projects;- training of better quality for continuous VET trainees in Auvergne;- internationalisation of employment/training support structures;- more international activity both in sending and receiving regions;- a wider perspective on one's professional practice thanks to exchange;- bringing VET centres and businesses closer together, thus enhancing the active role they can play in the issues of unemployment of young Europeans;- European cooperation on other innovating projects.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014842_2"], [2017, "AUDACE+2", "UK Work Placement", 141272.0, 8, 8, "\u201cAUDACE+2\u201d is a mobility project led by a consortium, coordinated by the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Regional Council, the sending partners being P\u00f4le Emploi Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and the 14 \u201cMissions Locales\u201d of the Auvergne.

Indeed, it is uncertain whether the regional training programme in question will be maintained by the new Regional Council or not. Likewise, we will not apply this time for grants for mobilities of staff of the consortium member organisations. The \u201cAUDACE+2\u201d project for 2017-2019 thus returns to the line of the previous projects \u201cAUDACE\u201d 1 to 6 (2008-2015) within the Leonardo da Vinci programme.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-036153_7"], [2018, "Jeunes d'Est Ensemble en Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne", "UK Work Placement", 133645.0, 6, 6, "JEEME \u2013 2018 \u00ab Jeunes d\u2019Est Ensemble en Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne \u00bb (european mobility for Est Ensemble youth), is a new project carried as a mixed Consortium which federates 4 organisations established in the conurbation of \u00abEst Ensemble\u00bb in the department \u00abSeine-Saint-Denis\u00bb, specialised in the field of professional integration support, and 5 European partners experienced in the reception and qualification of European trainees.\r\n\r\nCoordinated by the IERF (European Research and Training Institute), holder of the Vocational Training Mobility Charter, the Consortium proposes to implement qualifying mobility pathways to enable 54 job-searching participants, 18-25 years old young people in integration and adults in career changes, to professionalise and strengthen their employability in the aim of a sustainable integration into the labor market.\r\n\r\nThe major prerogative of the JEEME project lies in the implementation of structured mobility schemes allowing participants of various levels, ages and professional backgrounds to develop job-related skills, technical-linguistic and intercultural skills, and this at the most appropriate moment of their professional evolution.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 8 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration with an educational level from V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is the integration in the job market.\r\n\r\nThe choice of destinations was determined by listing the job offers of the companies in the territory and the needs of the participants we wish to host within the project. Thus, 44 mobilities, divided into 5 flows, will take place in English-speaking countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus. JEEME is also aimed at young people between 18 and 25 years old who have migrant backgrounds, with few opportunities and little knowledge of French, for which we have declined a mobility flow in Brussels.\r\nThere are numerous results expected by the members of the Consortium:\r\n\r\n- Inscribe the sustainability of the project at a territorial level and broaden the Consortium's partnership basis by promoting the internationalisation of other organisations working in the fields of employment support, education and training.\r\n\r\n- Promoting mobility initiatives as a qualification and employability tool for people in integration and contribute to the development and certification of the knowledge acquired during the mobility period from employment professionals and companies.\r\n\r\n- Raise awareness among prescribing public authorities to include dedicated budget lines in complementary calls to the Erasmus + programme in order to multiply internship opportunities for internships for people in integration.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047512_1"], [2018, "Mobilno\u015b\u0107 uczni\u00f3w i nauczycieli \"Ekonoma\" gwarancj\u0105 sukcesu zawodowego", "UK Work Placement", 131348.0, 5, 5, "The promoter of the project is Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Ekonomiczno-Us\u0142ugowych [ZSE-U] in Byt\u00f3w.

This seminar is in line with the goals of the Erasmus + program and more precisely those of the action KA1 \"Mobility of the youth actors\", in fact:\r\n\r\n1) target participants are or have been active actors in the field of youth\r\n2) the aim of this type of Erasmus + project echoes the purpose of the seminar, namely the professional development of the actors,\r\n3)share the objectives of Erasmus +: encouraging interaction between actors, strengthening European cooperation, discovering youth work.\r\n\r\nThe need identified is to promote the hosting within the structures that have never yet seized this opportunity; the seminar also wants to meet the needs of the partners leader in the hosting projects. Indeed, the activities planned will allow them to reflect on the causes of certain difficulties encountered in hosting projects and to revitalize practices already acquired by setting up a hosting protocol for beneficiaries with specific needs or less opportunity. The objectives of this meeting will therefore be:\r\n\r\n- to strengthen European cooperation\r\n- to discover/ improve youth work in an intercultural context\r\n- to exchange around professional practices\r\n- to develop common working methods for future partnerships / projects\r\n- to increase and support projects aimed at hosting young people and / or professionals\r\n\r\nThe activities planned for the development of the identified objectives will be group workshops aiming to analyze the hosting process in all the key stages in order to facilitate the access to the projects and thus to promote more this program.\r\n\r\nThis project will positively influence the direct and indirect beneficiaries as it responds concretely to the needs identified during its conception. The meeting will provide specific responses through the development of ad hoc activities to achieve the objectives. In the short term, the participants will be able both to acquire skills in hosting projects and to renew the dynamics already acquired. In the long term, we believe that with this exchange, the European partners present will be able to design a new approach to mobility and hospitality projects, taking into account the social and political context of present and future Europe. Regarding the management of the project, we wish to keep a very collaborative and transparent management of any decision and follow-up of the quality of the seminar. We will put in place an \"open method of coordination, to share data, online meetings, information / advice at a distance.\" During the three days convention, the partners will have their own place for the animation and moderation of the debates. Methodology will also be deployed in the final evaluation phase of the project, dissemination of results and promotion of the pocket-book of good hosting. Mobility will be assessed using formal and non-formal tools and participants will reflect on their learning during the first phase and on their personal expectations. During this stage, SWOT analysis will be again the point of departure in order to identify if the difficulties, opportunities or weaknesses of each organization have been well treated and solved. At the end of the Europe 202 program 0, it would be worth considering bringing together all the participants reunited again to follow-up to the seminar and to adapt the hosting protocol pocket-book to the new needs and challenges identified in the context post Europe 2020.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-FR02-KA105-013410_3"], [2016, "MFR Rencontres, cultures, emplois : une exp\u00e9rience europ\u00e9enne", "UK Work Placement", 16458.0, 2, 2, "This project is the third partnership of Erasmus + Mobility teaching and professional training at the Le Verger Centre for Training and Promotion. In 2013 there was three colleges, now there are five within the MFR Maine-et-Loire network which allows us to send 100 students, 20 adults in training,4 members of staff and 6 young graduates for training in less than a one year period.This project adheres to the objectives fixed by the MFR Union under contract to the Ministry of Agriculture and follows international routes for professional training. This objective is above all suited to our department, the second tourist focal point that welcomes about half the British people who visit France. All the training associated with Erasmus+ (working with people, the hotel trade, tourism, cat and dog breeding, management of equestrian centres) encourages and leads students to learn to adapt to meet client\u2019s needs. Students at MFR and CFO often choose this style of training as an alternative to others on offer, 50% of their time is spent working in a business and 50% of their time is spent at college. Present times are difficult because they involve people who have travelled a little, who are quite self-sufficient and who are not too curious. These young people who have not travelled a lot need to be encouraged to branch out into new work experiences outside of France.To respond to these needs we have developed a plan involving training and work experience in Belgium and in Great Britain for 100 young people 4 from MFR and 20 adults currently training at CFP. They go for three weeks, two weeks for the CAPA students who are a little younger, less self sufficient and do their work experience in a business related to their studies.The offer of education and training via the Erasmus + in England is also available to members of the teaching profession. It includes the staff of MFR or CFP, the manager, administrative staff, instructors, etc. This 4day training allows you to meet and exchange ideas with an English counterpart.CFP Le Verger will also accompany young graduates who have difficulty fitting into working and living lifestyles whilst doing their 4month work experience.The impact on the beneficiaries of the Erasmus+ in Europe is the development of competences and ability, notably their mobility, adaptability and increased self -confidence as well as an appreciation of other cultures. It emphasises the need to master the English language. It also provides a better understanding of the role of a European citizen and of finding a place in the European job market.The impact on staff will be in a broadening of their teaching and training methods and skills. Observing new methods encourages questions to be asked and the development of new and different ways of providing education. Constraints on mobility should be reduced for those who participate and it should be easier to move around in order to find work.For members of the CFP and MFR partnership the outcome of the project is marked by the positive results of - joint European actions, the tools, common good practices, quality education and training better adapted to global work needs.

Furthermore, there is currently no mechanism for organisations delivering sport-based social inclusion activities to measure, or place a value, on these activities.There is therefore a distinct need for a best practice model which draws on the experience of organisations that are addressing the issues relating to social inclusion via sport, to create a consistent and measurable set of resources which can be used by practitioners across Europe to deliver targeted and cost effective outcomes in the key areas that impact on social inclusion.To address this need, this project will develop Online Resources and an Impact Measurement Tool for the delivery of social inclusion programmes across Europe.

To improve the knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in football and other careers\r\n \r\n4. To deliver a high quality social and cultural programme including exposure to the language within the host country\r\n \r\n5. To ascertain if participants are more willing to travel to Europe to take advantage of the opportunities as a result of the trip \r\n\r\n6. To achieve migration from England/Wales to Europe as a footballer and/or in alternative career paths in August 2016 and beyond.\r\n\r\nIn order to address these aims and provide added value to the participants across these aims, LFE will deliver a two week pre-season training programme in The Netherlands/Spain for seven Football League under 18 Academy teams. This will mean that 168 participants will benefit and will be facilitated by top tier Dutch and Spanish host clubs.\r\n \r\nACTIVITY 2 (aimed at RELEASED apprentices who are recent graduates from ASE) has very similar participant aims as the individuals are trying to establish themselves in the labour market having now graduated from the apprenticeship but still face the same context and backdrop and a greater need to broaden their horizons and career direction:\r\n\r\n1. To achieve both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the development of the participants as footballers\r\n\r\n2. To improve the knowledge, understanding and acquisition of Lifelong Learning principles and transferable skills\r\n\r\n3. To improve the participants knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in football and other careers\r\n\r\n4.

To achieve a professional football contract at a European club and/or as an employee/trainee in Europe in an alternative career\r\n\r\nIn this instance the aims and added value will be addressed by an individual 12 week player placement programme at one of six host clubs in Sweden. This opportunity will be afforded to 30 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe main activities to be undertaken across the two projects will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Daily Training Schedule\r\n\r\n2.

The Transnational Association will fix its commitments and responsibilities in a cooperation agreement and in the specific and compulsory documents of the ERASMUS+ Programme.The selection of candidates will be based on their language competences and their academic reports, as well as on their social and personal skills and their personal maturity. Prior to their departure, the students will undertake an online course which will provide them with preparation, guidance and information. The staff will carry out a 1 week-stay \u2013job shadowing\u2013 in Football Associations and vocational training organizations, where they will be able to meet and exchange good practices from the host partners\u2019 systems of educational and vocational training. The programme content of the stays has been designed by the teaching staff of the sending vocational training centres. It follows a methodology focused in the development of competences, which is particularly suitable for mobility experiences, as it emphasizes on acquiring appropriate skills and competences.A face-to-face training day and an online workshop about mobility and the internationalization strategy of the Consortium will be organized for the staff.RFEF is responsible for the follow-up and the project management with technological support and human capital. The Foundation, which has a broad experience in the management of mobility projects, will be in charge of the following tasks, together with the rest of partners: information, selection processes, preparation, agreements with the partners, learning agreements, quality commitment, follow-up, assessment, validation of competences, dissemination, financial and administrative management. All these steps ensure the quality of the project.All participants will receive a EUROPASS Mobility Certificate as well as other certifications and accreditations by the sending and host partners.An EVALUATION of the project results will be conducted. This study will not only evaluate the training and skills acquired by the participants but it will also focus on measuring the impact of the project. It will evaluate the results and will identify and define the impact that the project has had on the training system of all the partners and on the employment, as well as the gender equality measures. The project will include a COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION PLAN, which will enhance the visibility of the project, its objectives and results (the results and competences acquired). It will also disseminate the progress achieved and provide the European football and sport decision-makers at a local, regional, national and European level with new knowledge and material.The intended dissemination channels are the websites of the Football Association, the educational platform of the project, social networks and the participants\u2019 blogs.Duration: From 01/06/2016 to 30/05/2018.", "http://www.lfe.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024324_5"]]}}, "8RJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Implementing the idea of sustainability into teaching and learning in Adult education", "Lancashire County Council", 189694.0, 6, 7, "In many European countries adult education centres cover broad levels of the population nationwide. Since the initiation of the UN World Decade \"Education for Sustainable Development\" adult education centres aim to enable learners to act sustainable. However, topics in the field of sustainable development are often only treated sporadically and separately or in discipline-specific courses. But the concept of education for sustainable development emphasises the importance of multidisciplinarity \u2013 therefore topics should be treated by a comprehensive approach to sensitise for sustainable acting.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a lack of suitable materials for adults \u2013 materials which illustrate the complexity of social, economic and ecological issues adequately and which are related to the everyday life. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop teaching and learning materials which support the distribution of interdisciplinary knowledge as well as creative competence in the field of sustainable development. The main focus is on adult learners in language courses. By integrating relevant topics and questions in language teaching learners are inspired to think about the issue and their own actions. The project aims to achieve a long-term change in behaviour of the learners. Because of the complexity of the different topics the development and testing of the materials is limited to language courses. In order to develop the broadest possible effect the materials will be free of charge and freely accessible to all teachers on the internet after the project.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation of the project idea, it is planned to establish a consortium of adult education centres from six EU countries.", "http://www.lancashire.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA204-001469_6"], [2015, "Leren om verstandig en duurzaam te veranderen", "Lancashire County Council", 16657.0, 3, 3, "CVO Lethas Brussels has to implement quiet a lot of changes in the nearby future. Changes of curricula in the second language courses, didactical and methodogical changes, working with self steering teams and professionalizing our track guidance services are the most important ones. \r\n\r\nAction 1\r\n\r\nTherefore  we want to professionalize 2 members of our management staff.

Now we want to learn from an educational centre with more than 10 years experience in working with self steering teams. We will send two learning teams (6 teachers and 2 staff members) to Copenhagen for a week to visit VSK and we will prepare those two teams in order to work more efficient during this week. In advance we will work out a program with our Danish partner, so we know how we will work on this theme and how we will evaluate and disseminate our results in our centre. We really want to install more self steering teams. We believe teachers feel much more involved because they will be responsable for much more than only teaching.They will learn to organise themselves, their class groups, the didactical approaches. They will be responsable for classrooms, media, and so on. We believe that teachers working in self steering teams are much more motivated and involved in their daily life work. Thanks to these  study visits we are sure, that our teachers will be much more informed and motivated to make this switch and will work together with their collegues. After working a while with our self steering teams, our staff is ready to inform other centres of adult education to work with self steering teams.\r\n\r\nTrack Guidance Service\r\n\r\nCVO Lethas Brussels wants to professionalize its Track Guidance services. Therefore we send 4 track guiders to The Lancashire College in Chorley (UK). This Adult Education Centre has built up a high quality Track Guidance System.
