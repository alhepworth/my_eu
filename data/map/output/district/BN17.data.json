This will be followed by a home hospitality phase with their choice of cultural visits and the joint organisation of a Czech/ UK Cultural Day in the coastal town of Littlehampton in order to help promote a positive communal experience and combat some of the zenophobic attitudes towards the Eastern European immigrant population in the town.  This project should have the result of increasing the participants own personal and social development, give them a great sense of achievement and widen their horizons which will help with employment and further education prospects in the future.  Previous participants in a similar project have gone on to participate in further international volunteering projects and developed their skills and experience to become leaders, providing opportunities for more young people to develop in the same way.", "http://www.girlguiding.org.uk", "Girlguiding Littlehampton District Ranger GuideUnit (Senior Section Unit)", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012101_coordinator"]]}}, "6FE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "MORE POWERFUL TOGETHER", "The Littlehampton Academy", 187803.0, 5, 5, "Discrimination is a process related to all negative attitudes and behaviors that are prejudiced against members of a group or group. Prejudice, and therefore discrimination, also leads to negative attitudes toward the group or group of members they develop, as well as to negative attitudes that range from dislike, contempt, avoidance and hate.  But today we know that there are \"people\" in the world; different, black and white, male and female, sexual orientations, races, religions and so on. The person/student who was exposed to discrimination or social exclusion, finally unfortunately may tend towards terror. The provision of equality between different people, the concept of justice begin with education. Education, to play a role in the development of social norms and inclusion, the main objective is the improvement of the human equality perspective.\r\nOur project's aims; The participants'll\r\n-overcome the perception of discrimination and will learn and know their rights about only being a 'human'. \r\n-have no worry to attempt and work together in their area of interest without discrimination of race, gender and religion etc. in the future.Thus,they'll be together in harmony in their family and business life.\r\n-live in the era of the participants'll be provided with ICT -used to adapt to them for the digital era.\r\n-witness the good examples about equality among European countries. \r\n-improve new skills.\r\n-be able to experience and increase skills in foreign language \r\n-create a more effective collaboration and exchange activities. Thus, the perception of lifelong learning can be created not only for the participants but also for parents and\r\n-The students who have negative attitude against school and lessons because of social exclusion can encourage to continue their education life. Thus, both social and economic benefits that can be provided will contribute in creating economic growth and sustainable development.\r\n-The schools'll cope with the need of internationalization in order to be able to deal with 21st century demands, the need to educate qualified European citizens by improving all their basic skills.\r\nWe\u2019r 5 partners, the UK, France, Turkey, Portugal and Norway so as to support the students who can't take advantage of the education because of any types of discrimination such as refugees, from different races/origin, religions and different genders including LGBT in order to integrate them to both the education life and social life. Because, we,with all partners, have found out that the students who are tend to leave school early or who have negattive attitudes against the school have different cultures, races, religions, ethnic origin or sexual orientation at our schools.\r\nWe have 3 transnational meetings to plan, organize and evaluate the Project activities and 4 LTT meetings to tackle with the sense of discrimination. The number of participants totaly is 96 in mobilities and the activities types are blended mobility of school learners. Each school\u2019ll built both an Erasmus+ students and teachers teams.The Erasmus+ students teams should involve the students who was exposed to discrimination or social exclusion because of their differences, feels hate, has no tolarence towards differences, bullied, has low self esteem, has negative attitude against school and lessons or refugees and they can be determined by both the school the guidance counselors/school psychologists and the school teachers. \r\nAll the activities are created for 10-18 aged students and teachers of schools. The participants will be able to learn more about both their rights using enjoyable and easy ICT tools such as Web 2.0. to improve and adopt the digital society. \r\nThanks to the project, \u0131t is important for all the participants not only to create an awareness about equality but also to combat failure in education and social life. A positive relationship or closeness that can be experienced by a different ethnic groups approaching with prejudice may provide a positive perception of the group to which the other belongs, by strengthening the perception of similarity between one's own and the 'other'.The participants will be able to;\r\n-learn to be and live together.\r\n-raise awareness about equality and have a better understanding of global education and cultural exchange.\r\n-overcome all forms of discrimination both in perception and in the family in the future and will be together in harmony in their business life.\r\n-adapt to the digital era.\r\n-improve new skills.\r\n-make a beginning to contribute in creating economic growth and sustainable development.\r\n-provide  to be more educated as future generations .\r\n-experience many foreign language.\r\nand for the parents, the perception of lifelong learning can be created and they will be able to make an awareness for equality on society, language, education and work lives.\r\nThe project name is \u201cMore Powerful Together\u201d to ensure the unity for more powerful society and economic.", "http://www.tla.woodard.co.uk", "The Littlehampton Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036794_coordinator"]]}}}}
