It is a critique of the argument that explains the success of European capitalism in terms of differences in social structures that had effectively prevented the emergence of citizens in oriental societies. The ambitious scope of this project is to revisit questions of citizenship in orientalized cultures India, China, Islam and Indigenous through investigations untrammelled by orientalist assumptions. The research methodology is genealogical through which the origins, interpretations and mutations of ideas and actions will be clearly located in their historical and cultural settings. The project methodology is designed deliberately to focus on disagreements. Rather than working with like-minded collaborators, the project will engage with its antagonists through a series of workshops where opposing views will be debated and disseminated to a wide audience. What it means to be a citizen, who may be a citizen, what obligations derive from citizenship are at the forefront of much political discourse as the nation-state dissolves into regional identities, integrates or fails to integrate new social groups, and is transformed by supra-national entities. Above all, the question of citizenship lies at the heart of the legitimacy of the European Union. Yet, when we investigate the origins of ideas about (European) citizenship we discover that it is essentially considered as a Judeo-Christian development juxtaposed against Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Hinduism.

The first is to provide a number of discrete learning interventions, which can be delivered either through a web-based trading platform or in a day-trading facility, to enhance the quality of financial decision-making by private investors trading on their own account.  Within that overall objective, the principal goal is to address issues of emotional regulation in financial decision making.  In common with many other areas where technology has been used to assist learning, financial training has largely focused on imparting propositional knowledge and increasing people's intellectual understanding. However, our work to date has shown that despite investors having considerable appropriate knowledge, their actions can still be ruled by their attitudes, habits, or emotional states. Emotions not only mediate rapid expert situation recognition and the application of expert intuition, but they also give rise to important persistent biases in decision-making through framing effects and the disposition effect in particular.  Game based technologies are becoming proven as a method of learning, particularly as they can place people in virtual situations.  In the context of financial decision making, xDelia will use serious games to analyse and train behavioural patterns and to support the non-formal and informal learning process.  The project will produce learning interventions which employ physiological sensors alongside serious games.  Wearable sensor equipment will help build a picture of a person's emotional state.  Data collected via sensors in both game play and during actual trading will be analysed alongside real time event logging, diaries and past trading data.  The validity and effectiveness of the interventions will be tested and further developed through a series of trials, including 'live' testing with private investors.  Because of the problems of transfer of skills learned into actual practice and the need to support the development of expertise over extended periods, learning interventions developed by the project cannot rely solely on learning games.  We have therefore developed an approach combining games, sensor feedback, and didactic materials with a structured, diary based approach to reflection on practice in order to support transfer of learning into the 'real-world' practice setting.By investigating this phenomenon and tackling directly the challenges faced by investors, the project will demonstrate the potential to achieve improvements in emotion regulation processes through innovative, technologically supported approaches using a combination of physiological sensors, emotion regulation training , and serious games in a real-world setting.", 819143.0, 3612026.0, 6, 7, "xDELIA", null, "http://www.open.ac.uk", null, "fp7_89453_999923337"], [1204329600000, 1304121600000, "Service Oriented Architectures for All", "The Open University", "Computer science is entering a new generation.

Recent work has shown that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have enhanced tree growth in forests. However these increases in growth can also cause \u2018priming effects\u2019 whereby microbial degradation of soil organic matter is stimulated by fresh carbon inputs, such as plant litter, releasing additional carbon from the soil. Given that forest soils represent the largest terrestrial carbon pool, priming effects could cause a major release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Despite their potential importance in ecosystem carbon dynamics under environmental change, the processes and mechanisms underlying priming effects are still poorly understood. This is in part due to the enormous disparities in the experimental scales and methods required to study microbial processes vs. ecosystem carbon dynamics and the difficulties in extrapolating the results of laboratory studies to the ecosystem level. This project will significantly advance our understanding of the role of priming effects in forest carbon dynamics in different forest types and reconcile the experimental problems of scale using multidisciplinary nested studies across multiple scales. The nested design will explicitly test the validity of extrapolations made at one scale to predict effects at another.  The ultimate aim is to allow the extrapolation of results from small-scale studies of priming to the ecosystem level for a wide range of forests.

I Creativity holds a strong position in early childhood and primary education, while it appears to be under greater pressure in the more formal educational environment of secondary education. It is therefore necessary to exploit, support and sustain the creative potential that is found in young children. \r\nScience education features highly in European education policy. Major EU reports urge countries to ensure that science education engages students before the age of 14 with science and scientific phenomena, through extended investigative work and \u2018hands-on\u2019 experimentation. The adoption of inquiry-based activities in science education is viewed as the only way forward (Rocard et al., 2007), as it is widely accepted that effective science education based on inquiry can lead to wonderment, and is fuelled by curiosity.\r\nSchool in Europe today would benefit considerably from acknowledging and fostering the link between science education, and creativity. Science education could (and should) be more creative. In the teaching and learning of science, a more creative approach based on curiosity and inquiry would be beneficial, involving, for instance, a move away from the pedagogy of the \u2018correct answers\u2019, which makes pupils believe that it is wrong to be wrong, and become progressively less willing and able to take risk and to unlock their creativity. Further, in a more creativity oriented science education, new modes of interactions within the classroom could be developed to stimulate self-expression \u2013 which, if nurtured, could manifest itself subsequently in later years in terms of an ability to create and innovate. Such a major shift towards more creativity in science education, though, both in terms of fostering creativity in science and teaching science creatively, would require a profound change in educational practices and cultures, demanding the development not only of new curricula, but most importantly of appropriate teacher training and professional development.\r\nThe CEYS project is a timely response to the aforementioned needs, at the European level, aiming at the development of a teacher development course and accompanying materials to be used in European  professional development to promote the use of creative approaches in teaching science in preschool and early primary education, in the frame of inquiry-based educational environments. \r\nThe CEYS project brings together a consortium of five distinguished partners from four countries across Europe. More specifically, the project brings together three internationally recognised universities (AUC, IOE, OU), a science education centre in a leading science research institute (INFLPR), and a distinguished educational research department operating within a school (EA) and thus providing close interaction with teachers, students and classrooms. This consortium has all the characteristics necessary to guarantee the successful and efficient realisation of the project activities.\r\nThe overall aim of the CEYS project is to adapt, test, implement and disseminate a new training framework (including an appropriate curriculum, training activities that include good in-school practices, as well as a variety of supporting material) that will support the training of teachers to use creativity and inquiry-based approaches in the teaching of science. CEYS will work on expanding the existing state of the art in early years and early primary inquiry-based science education and creativity, as this has been explored and described by the FP7 research project Creative Little Scientists.\r\nCEYS will enhance early years and primary teachers\u2019 capacity to teach science effectively using inquiry-based approaches and focusing on the development of children\u2019s creativity. This will make goals of inquiry-based science learning more likely to be realized and achieve meaningful impact for a critical mass of teachers, and consequently students, across the EU.

It is not only of great interest to the scientific community, but also captures the attention of the general public to a large extent. Important astrobiological themes like the origin of life on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets have engaged thinkers at least since antiquity and will not be solved by one single discipline alone.  To educate a new generation of scientists with the necessary multidisciplinary background to get new insights into these important questions, we propose the creation of a European Astrobiology Campus (EAC) under an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership. In this virtual campus (which will not be a formal administrative entity) 10 European academic institutions and 2 non-academic entities that have previously been engaged in astrobiology research and possess ample experience in interdisciplinary training will cooperate to offer comprehensive, high-level training in astrobiology for a new generation of scientists capable to work beyond the boundaries of their own discipline. A varied range of activities are planned by the EAC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EAC will offer a series of high-level courses about exciting interdisciplinary subjects covering the whole range of astrobiology, spanning from formation of habitable planets to the search for biosignatures on other celestial bodies. Also an introductory course for interested newcomers and a scientific summer camp for undergraduates will be offered. Novel tools like e-learning and training software will be used in these events. Furthermore, they will include scientific fieldwork at astrobiologically interested sites and other research projects like astronomical observations. This comprehensive course programme will be unique in the world and would be impossible to be organised by a single institution. It will also establish Europe as the leading training area in astrobiology, which will consequently attract top students from all over the world, binging about a \u201cbrain gain\u201d for the European Research Area.\r\n\r\nHowever, training students in scientific skills is not sufficient to prepare them for an increasingly competitive European labour market. The Strategic Partnership therefore also will offer extensive training in transversal skills in cooperation with our non-academic partners, the scientific consulting company Innovaxiom and the science exhibition and communication centre Cap Sciences. During an internship at Innovaxiom students will be able to learn important capabilities like management, desiging successful (business) strategies, event preparation, public relations, production of promotional material, decision making and customer relations. Together with Cap Science, students will have the possibility to prepare an exhibition on an important astrobiological subject. These two collaborations will give students also an inside view of important employers of scientists with a multidisciplinary background: museums and consultants. In addition, the training efforts of the partnership will not be restricted to university students. It is equally important to train the lecturers to enable them to hold high-quality astrobiology courses and to overcome the difficulties in multidisciplinary teaching. The partnership will organise a workshop on education in astrobiology to allow lecturers to exchange experiences and to present novel course organisation teaching and assessment methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA learning software package on the subject of the origin of life for use in high schools will be designed and textbooks both for school and university students are planned to be composed. Furthermore, the partnership will continue with a new edition of the Encyclopaedia of Astrobiology, the major reference work in the field, which will be ready at the end of the grant period.           \r\n\r\nThe partnership will also launch activities aimed for the general public.

However, in spite of a clear case for framing OER as a contributor to innovation in education, the picture that emerges from recent research reveals several obstacles that need to be overcome for OER to have a substantial impact on education and society. Limited reuse and repurposing of OER by educators, manifested by a tendency to use OER as supplementary rather than primary material, have been attributed to several factors: uneven supply, lack of official policies or incentives for reuse, limited proof of effectiveness and lack of digital and pedagogical skills on the part of educators. The substantial political and philanthropic investment in OER has so far mostly focused on the supply side, but there is now a growing need to increase the uptake of OER by educational practitioners and learners.

However, they have a quite different nature although sharing many of its goals.This lack of a ranking dimension for online education is harming these universities which are going to play, and they already play in some cases, an important role in the future of higher education, as it is also stated by some EC documents, as the ones presented by the High Level Group on the Modernisation of Higher Education. Online education, further away of just MOOCs or OER, needs to be more visible and evaluated in order to get higher reputation as a means to solve some of the current higher education issues.This project aims to generate:a) A set of European-led quality criteria and indicators for the measurement of world-wide online education dimension, andb) The guidelines for integrating these online education metrics in the current U-Multirank ranking, the European funded university ranking which intends to be a European contribution to the development of a multidimensional ranking.CODUR would like to impact on 15-20 European higher education online education institutions in an initial stage and on at least 50 non-European international universities later on. These 65-70 universities can be the starting point of the new dimension of the U-Multirank ranking. National and international stakeholders (industry, networks and associations) will also be involved, as well as students summing up a total of 490 people participating in any of the activities scheduled in the project.The method of work will be based on the analysis of current quality assurance tools for online education, the identification of the shared common criteria and indicators and its fitness with the U-Multirank ranking. Two Intellectual Outputs are expected. These outputs will provide the new online education institutions dimension (set of criteria and indicators) to be integrated in the U-Multirank ranking, and the guidelines to improve the performance of online institutions. In addition, several intangible results will also be achieved, as the increase of reputation of the partner institutions and the strength of the strategic alliance from the partnership perspective, and the increase of high level quality learning opportunities for European and world-wide students, as well as better reputation for online education. These outputs will be achieved through carrying out the following activities:a) Aligning the provision of online higher education institutions worldwide with U-Multirank categoriesb) Designing the means for systemic comparisons of current online education quality assurance tools and systemsc) Develop, test and refine representative performance online quality education indicators based on common criteria d) Design, test, valorise and refine the toolbox for data gathering and testing the new ranking tool with European and worldwide online university partners e) Create a set of new guidelines for adapting CODUR indicators and toolbox resources, under the supervision and feedback of a U-Multirank expertf) Guidelines to improve the performance of online institutions The creation of these criteria and indicators, which would be an useful opportunity to the partners' institutions to reinforce their networks and to confront different perspectives of the online HE field, would also eventually extend the offer of high quality online learning opportunities, in accordance with the Erasmus+ priorities in adult education field. This will contribute, too, to create a European leadership in this field under the flagship of flexible, open and quality online higher education.", "http://www.open.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA203-025182_2"], [2014, "Development of an open access remote photovoltaics laboratory and associated open educational resources for online training and education.", "THE OPEN UNIVERSITY", 106086.0, 3, 6, "This project suggests the development of an open access remote PV laboratory for educational purposes. The remote PV laboratory will be installed outdoors at the facilities of the TEI of Athens - Greece, which is in a geographical region characterized by a large number of annual sunshine hours, allowing the users to perform real-world tests and experiments with photovoltaic panels over the internet, in real time. At the same time, the student can have a live view of the systems through a web camera, offering him/her a sense of personal presence in the place where the experiment takes place. The system should be accessible by everyone on the planet with an internet access and will be offered in at least five different languages. It also should be accompanied by appropriate educational material, for several target groups, such as students, postgraduates, professionals and educators, allowing it to be used by a broad variety of users directly. Moreover, the remote laboratory could help students with disabilities, to increase their participation in a laboratory environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the remote PV laboratory, open educational resources (OERs) will also be adapted and developed to accompany it. These OERs include educational texts, tests and documentation developed for various types of users, from high-school students to professionals seeking to expand their field of knowledge. In addition to open educational material, a series of experimental exercises will be developed on photovoltaic systems, using advanced information and communications technologies, which could be adapted for courses currently present in higher education curricula and based on the innovative remote photovoltaics laboratory. A specialized website will be created to communicate the users with the remote laboratory in order to perform the experimental exercises. These remote experiments could be used for distance education, professional training and part time study. Thus, students from Europe and around the world, whose institutes/schools do not have laboratories, or their countries do not have a high annual number of sunshine hours, can perform experiments and then analyze the results according to the taught theory. Classroom courses can also benefit from this system by letting the teachers demonstrate the behaviour and analyze the characteristics of a photovoltaic panel in real conditions. This approach opens new ways in the teaching and educational process by giving students the feel of an almost direct experience with the experimental device and  providing an excellent context for developing remote collaboration skills that will be important in their future careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experimental exercises and educational material will be integrated into a global remote laboratory gateway. This gateway will be a specially designed web-portal for worldwide higher education, and it will act as the basis of all educational and training activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive well-recognized European Universities are involved in the project as well as the Technical Chamber of Greece.

Seminars will be provided to local professional organizations, such as the Technical Chamber of Greece, so as for their members to be informed of, use and provide feedback on the proposed system. The system and some of its capabilities will be presented in relevant peer-reviewed scientific conferences, in order to disseminate the system towards other scientists with expertise on the fields of online/remote education and for the opportunity to receive feedback from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duration of the project will be three years. The first two years will be devoted to the design, sizing and installation of the remote pv laboratory as well as for the development of open educational resources and experimental exercises.

New modalities of distance-learning have changed the landscape of adult education over the last years. These new modes of learning offer an invaluable opportunity for those\u00a0who leave the formal\u00a0education system\u00a0with few or no qualifications or for the most disadvantaged sectors of the population.  Distance education is especially relevant for the initial and ongoing training of groups at risk of social exclusion, since it places emphasis on formal content, as well as communicative and digital skills that prepare them for personal and professional challenges. This occurs thanks to the advantages of this educational modality associated with flexibility, individualized attention and skills training for the 21st century. It is an opportunity to achieve a more egalitarian, more democratic and more inclusive society. Despite this, research in this field is still scarce and there are few adult centers that offer online distance education. \r\n\r\nThe goal of Institut Obert de Catalunya, with more than 2000 students in basic adult education per year, is to create a research group to observe the e-learning processes of students in a way that improve educational quality. In this way, it is proposed to influence aspects such as interaction, motivation, student autonomy, attention to diversity and support to groups at risk of social exclusion or new incorporation in the education system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the main goal of this project is to research in e-learning in contexts of basic education for adults to increase the quality of education.  Moreover, we want to share the results with the international educational community. The project consists of  a job shadowing to 1) establish collaboration with an adult education center in e-learning  that allows the exchange of results and good online distance education practices, 2) establish contact with European distance education research groups to obtain information about the research lines they carry out, the methods used and the results achieved, and 3) disseminate the results and establish new contacts with adult education centers through the annual international congress of the ARPCE (Association for Research in Post-Compulsory Education).\r\n\r\nThe participants in the project are professors of different subjects with a solid experience in educational research since they are part of research groups linked to the university.

The partners have been chosen from the most innovative European organizations committed to Big Data and industrial processes innovation. The project, that will last 36 months, will create a model of training curriculum and a Data Scientist profile on (at least) 5 key topics affected by Big Data. The macro-areas that have already been identified are: - Machine learning, statistical modelling, predictive analytics and data management; - Big Data needs, labour market analysis and value chain development, alongside a proper inclusion of industry requirements;- The organisational culture.These macro areas have been identified during the proposal preparatory phase and will be re-designed according to the results of the initial project phase (leading to the development of O1- New Big Data Initiatives - Towards a Data-driven Mind-Set). Within this phase, partners will undertake a survey aimed at identifying new Big Data Analytics models, training opportunities and needs, as to update the state of art of Big Data Analytics, also carrying out a comparative analysis of the results as to have a picture of what is going on in Europe on Big Data. An inventory will be created and made available on line, respectively of initiatives and training opportunities in Big Data Analytics, with a focus on identifying existing modules and resources to be further adapted and developed to respond to the target groups needs, and those missing to be developed ex novo. The training path (O2 - Data Science Modules and Open Educational Resources) will be composed by a set of 5 modules, each composed by 30 h structured at distance courses and in presence. This will result in a training offer of 150 h (70 h as e-learning, 80 h as two-week intensive course). The set of modules, MOOCs, methodologies will be tested in a joint demonstrative blended course, that will involve 450 participants from 5 partner countries representing Large Companies, SMEs, HEIs, Research Institutes, Foundations  and 75 selected beneficiaries (10 funded by EU contribution and 65 participating at their own expenses), in a blended mobility in Ancona (Italy). After testing the course, the curriculum will be improved and standardised according to partner HEI\u2019s ECTS system and rules and included in already existing course and MSc degree courses (O3 - Model and Recommendations for a Data Science Curriculum). The model of curriculum will be accompanied by a set of policy recommendations for the validation and recognition of 21 ECTS with reference to the EQF Level 7 and 8 and of the new profile (Data Scientist), ensuring long term project sustainability. The proposal aims at making lifelong learning and mobility a reality, by creating flexible learning pathways and addressing a higher number of learners. The proposal will thus pave the way to the EU2020 target of raising HEI education attainment, by making it more attractive with new Business and HEI cooperation, innovative cross-sectoral topics of current international relevance and by encouraging employability. The project will adopt a participatory approach with active involvement of stakeholders in the different project phases. Creating and validating in the test blended course a set of collaborative modules, Big Data Analytics modules and OERs will serve as an example of transnational Business-University-Society cooperation that may be adapted to any other course subject, providing long-term sustainability of the project deliverables. DA.RE. dissemination will raise awareness on Big Data Analytics across Europe, opening the path for Data Science initiatives in reaching different pedagogical goals and facing global challenges (data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling, for a quick and reliable access to data;  exploratory data analysis to generate intuition; prediction based on statistical methods). Dissemination will be ensured by a dedicated website and use of social media, press conferences, events, a promotional video, and a e-newsletter to be distributed in partner countries and over Europe. A strong link with Networks of Excellence, members of the International Data Science Committee will enable long-term sustainability and accessibility of DA.RE. deliverables. Within the DA.RE. project, 3 national events will be realised in IT, SI and PT.
