Indeed people tend to be less active than fifty or sixty years ago (the number of people who never exercise has increased by 3% since 2009 - from 39% to 42% - according to Eurobarometer on Sport and Physical Activity) and their diet has also evolved. In fact, teenagers, nowadays tend to be more fond of junk food, fries, sodas, candies and chocolate than vegetables, fish, etc. These unhealthy food choices result in the increase in overweight and/or obese people (According to the OECD, there are more and more obese people from 8% to 24.5% within the EU - with 24.5% in the UK - ). Therefore the creation of this project is motivated by this global and alarming issue.                   The main objective of the project is to create awareness of the importance to have a healthy lifestyle. Both partner countries aim at working together (as they have already started doing so for the past six months) through regular exchanges and virtual meetings via the twinspace that will be especially created for the project and through physical meetings during the planned mobilities.                    Through this project, we also aim at developing our students's motivation because a loss of motivation and involvement in school activtities can lead to early school leaving and as aforementioned early school leaving leads, in its turn, to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. So this is one important issue to tackle.                      The pupils's self-esteem, curiosity, confidence, decisiveness, tolerance and open-mindedness will also be impacted by their participation in the project.                     Another of our aims is to develop our pupils as European citizens and engage learning about other cultures and lifestyles. It is important to encourage their curiosity, their openness to other cultures and nationalities and their propension to mobility. This will be done through regular web conversations, activities planned throughout the project and physical meetings.                    We are also building this partnership with a view to developing our students' basic and transferable skills, use of a foreign language and use of ICT. This will be developed through completing tasks and communicating with each other via IT tools.                     There are numerous objectives for our students but there are also many objectives for the staff and the teachers involved in the project.  Indeed we aim at making our teaching methods more innovative and more attractive than regular usual teaching methods. The reputation and standing of our schools will also be impacted by such a project.                    The topic of our project is a global concern and is totally in line with \"Europe 2020 Strategy: for a Healthier EU\". Our project  \"A healhy mind in a healthy body\" covers various fields such as Food, Sport, Health and Prevention.In order to reach the objectives aforementioned, a wide range of activities is planned. These activities will include the creation and the election of a logo to illustrate and promote our project, video presentation of the pupils and of each respective school and country, the creation of a healthy cookery book, the creation of posters and shooting of videos to promote and advertise a healthy lifestyle, the presentation of different sports, physical activities through the organisation of \"Home Games\" and \"Junior Olympic Games in order for the pupils to get acquainted with sports and physical activities from their counterparts's country and the shooting of a video debunking stereotypes - stereotypes about boys and girls and stereotypes about different European nationalities. All of the results of these activities will be uploaded on the twinspace and on the project-related website.                    To prepare, organize and implement all these activities, a strong development of collaborative activities is planned at an European level and at a local level between pupils and teachers. Moreover the planned activities in the project will be totally in line with the pupils's curriculum so all the students will be involved in the activities - although not all of them will take part in the mobilities - as a consequence, the project and its objectives will become an integral part of the pupils's school life for two years. Furthermore, the pupils will receive lessons and attend classes to enable them to do the different activities successfully.Finally, the mobilities will enable the real development of team spirit. The mobilities will also enable the pupils to re-use and transfer the previously acquired skills in the actvities to be done together - France & Wales.                     Thanks to all the project activities, we hope to contribute to the achievement of the EU2020 objectives especially concerning its priorities in terms of education.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-023981_1"]]}}, "2PT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Together Stronger", "Ysgol Gymraeg Dyffryn y Glowyr", 111300.0, 4, 5, "Our \u2018TOGETHER STRONGER \u2018 project has brought a dedicated and inspired team together, who are all committed to new and innovative strategies to be tried and tested to improve and motivate our pupils learning of ICT and the basic skills in both numeracy and literacy and emotional and physical wellbeing. The aim of the project is to combine collaboration of expertise from around Europe with the use of ICT to develop our pupils into Global Citizens who are open-minded, critical thinkers who are not afraid of the challenges which they face in the 21st century, instead they face them with confidence. The project aims to ensure innovation where each partner country \u2013 Wales(Pontyberem), Sweden, Italy, Ireland and Wales (Dyffryn y Glowyr) \u2013 contribute invaluable learning experiences that will inspire all pupils to learn.\r\n\r\nThe 'Together Stronger' project will ensure that pupils:\r\n-improve their basic numerical and literacy skills.\r\n-develop their understanding of working in an innovative way through specific tasks and activities.\r\n-improve pupil potential and suitability for future employment on leaving education.\r\n-communicate through an international professional learning community raising standards in pupil performance, teaching and learning, furthermore improving and developing leadership and management skills.\r\n-understand the importance of physical, emotional and mental wellbeing in all aspects of life - including in the world of work.\r\n\r\n Each partner school will be able to:\r\n- use ICT in education for a purpose and improve skills and understanding.\r\n- work with schools with little or no experience of working in such projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will promote a deeper understanding of language and cultural differences as well as associated common issues such as:\r\n-developing an appreciation of global citizenship, diverse lifestyles and habits that impact on our ever changing world and future,\r\n-preparing for and understanding European Citizenship and global coexistence.\r\n\r\nThis project deals directly with the common challenges facing each country in terms of up skilling the future national and European workforce. Schools will promote the exchange of their most effective teaching techniques and develop the resources of each educational establishment. Minds will be broadened and horizons will open into Europe as a community. Schools will also benefit from the opportunity of sharing innovative practice and working within a network of fellow professionals.\r\n\r\nCommunicating during and after the project using ICT will be essential. Staff will develop a better understanding of the power of ICT platforms through using etwinning. \r\n\r\nParents, school governors and community members will be involved in European diversity with regard to cultural, well being, entrepreneurship, innovation and employment factors. Their knowledge of the progress of their children will increase.\r\n2333 pupils will take part in this project (of which 500 are disadvantaged), along with 267 school staff.\r\n\r\nThrough working collaboratively together as schools, local schools and the wider community will benefit from sharing good practice as teachers, and as practitioners, learning new techniques and strategies from each other to ensure more effective learning experiences for our pupils which will motivate our learners to learn and succeed at work in the 21st century.  Working together will allow us to strengthen the delivery of education on an European level.\r\n\r\nThe pupils voice will be at the heart of the project. They will not take part in international visits, but they will be fully engaged in our project. An International School Council will be formed, communicating regularly using etwinning and conference calls.\r\n\r\nPartner schools will continue to remain in contact after the official project end date to support each other and continue to raise standards and share best practice with each other. Dissemination of the project will be undertaken within each school using a range of tools as detailed in this application.\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe, following intense communication and planning that our project \u2018TOGETHER STRONGER\u2019 will have long term benefits to all participants that take part.", null, "Ysgol Gynradd Pontyberem", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036724_2"]]}}}}
