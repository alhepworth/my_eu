Some teachers are working in the e-twinning platform and are carrying out relevant projects. This way, we work with linguistic and cultural diversity. We also belong to the UNESCO schools net, as we wish to integrate multicultural aspects in the curriculum. Moreover, we also want to be a Multilingual School. If we are granted the multilingual project in the school, we would be able to foster other ideas and projects that are now in the initial stages, and dependant on our linguistic skills.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThe participants on the Erasmus + project would benefit from this scheme, it would enable them to improve their methods of teaching English. We already teach some subjects in English, but we wish to increase the number of subjects and reinvigorate our ways of teaching. We also think that the new materials and applications that could be developed would be very important.  \r\n\r\nThe 12 teachers who would participate in this project have been organized into 3 teams , one for each level -kindergarden, primary and secondary).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main objectives are :\r\n\r\n1. Acquiring language and teaching skills that would benefit each level in school.\r\n\r\n2 . Observing the teaching methodologies within a British school.\r\n\r\n3 . Improving the English skills within our school, whilst integrating the language into different subjects such as Art and ICT.\r\n\r\n4 . Produce materials which will improve the language skills of our students .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach team of teachers will carry out the following activites / courses in order to achieve the above goals: \r\n\r\n-  methodology courses.\r\n\r\n-  Refresh English courses.\r\n\r\n-  CLIL courses.\r\n\r\n-  Job shadowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants are dynamic , participatory , and employ innovative ICT techniques in education. They are also committed to the european project, and our enthusiastic and eager to carry out the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n 1. A group of teachers will attend English courses to improve their level. The courses will be about CLIL in Sciences, ICT and Maths. Allowing the teachers to improve their English, whilst inspiring them to employ innovative methods in their English teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Another group of teachers will go to \"Birdwell School\" to observe the teaching techniques. We may incorporate the different styles into our school to develop our English teaching. The aim is to achieve new methodology, materials and ideas to introduce them in linguistic and non linguistic subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. All the teachers who participate in the project will develop their English and materials, in order teach some subjects in English. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT\r\n\r\na. To learn and to hopefully implement cooperative work in the future.\r\n\r\nb. To belong to a mobility program, so we can open future opportunities and projects.\r\n\r\nc. To improve and refresh the English level, written and oral.\r\n\r\nd. To get innovative ideas and techniques to motivate the students in the English lessons as well as in the other subjects that will be taught in English.\r\n\r\ne. To discover more resources and activities to prepare, design and evaluate new English materials (CLIL). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE RESULTS, IMPACT AND POSSIBLE LONG TERM BENEFITS. \r\n\r\na. Increase the teacher's and student's motivation and involvement in our school.\r\n\r\nb. Improve the language competence of the school community and increase the international projection.\r\n\r\nc. To create and develop teaching materials for our classes.\r\n\r\nd. Integrating language skills and contents into the different educational levels of our school: kinder garden, primary and secondary.\r\n\r\ne. Cooperating with our partner school to foster the exchange of ideas and mutual enrichment.\r\n\r\nf.  To develop ICT to form a relationship and exchange between the students of both countries. \u2013 To promote and organize student exchanges between the UK and Spain (Primary and secondary levels).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to point out that all the educational community will be enriched from this project. The pupils from both schools will have the opportunity to increase their linguistic skills in a foreign language. They will also learn about a different culture and hopefully establish lasting relationships with the exchanged pupils. The program will generate a wider influence which will impact Rub\u00ed (location of school) through means of exhibition, presentations, seminars and conferences.", "http://www.birdwellschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-000963_2"]]}}, "9DU": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 14340.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_70200"], [2017, "TIMMUS LIMITED*", 663.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_63072"]]}}, "9EE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "STages Erasmus pour les Professeurs Stagiaires", "Bristol Bordeaux Partnership", 16164.0, 7, 8, "The ESPE - Graduate School of Education and Teacher Training of the University of Bordeaux delivers a 2-year Masters Course that prepares students for primary and secondary school teaching and professions connected to education. Inasmuch as international mobility has proven to be highly relevant for the acquisition of professional skills linked to education, and helps open the door for future teachers, and thereby their future pupils, to European and international exchanges, the ESPE uses its own funds to finance 2-week international training courses during the first year of the Masters course. The aim of the STEPS project is to develop this mobility via European financing for 33 students, in their second year of the course, who have passed the teaching examination and thus gained the status of trainee civil servant.  \r\nIn February-March, participants will undertake a two-week training course in a primary or secondary educational establishment in one of the following eight countries (UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Ireland, and Bulgaria). To the extent that participants are at the head of a class in France on a part-time basis, this course will be held over a period split between the school holidays and the work time of their schooling with the ESPE. Placements in educational establishments will be made by way of intermediary placement organizations (universities or higher schools of education, associations, etc.) with whom the ESPE has been working for a number of years.  \r\nThe international course experience will be fully integrated into the learners' curriculum. It will be prepared under the teaching course units of \"training course support\", \"digital educational project\", \"initiation to research\" and \"teaching in a foreign language\".  It will foster the work produced by students aimed at validating the second year of their Masters course.\r\nThe project should help to train new-generation teachers and educators who will be able to enhance their knowledge with teaching practices developed in other European countries. On a regional and local scale, it will strengthen already active bilateral cooperation programmes. On a national scale, it will provide the wherewithal to test a new form of mobility during students' initial training that could prove transposable to other ESPEs. On the European scale, it will help to boost pan-European education. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries are teachers starting out on their careers, the project will have a significant multiplier effect. By financing an international training placement for a student, there could potentially be over 1200 pupils (for a primary education teacher) and over 4,000 pupils (for secondary education) likely to benefit from greater European openness.", "http://www.bristolbordeaux.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036972_5"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "BRISTOL BORDEAUX PARTNERSHIP", 6542.0, "Europe for citizens \u2014 Strengthening remembrance and enhancing capacity for civic participation at the Union level (18.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_70914"]]}}, "9LB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1270080000000, 1364688000000, "Reduced Certification Costs for Trusted Multi-core Platforms", "Wittenstein Aerospace & Simulation Limited - Wa&s", "The proposed RECOMP (Reduced certification cost for trusted multi-core platforms) research project will establish methods, tools and platforms for enabling cost-efficient certification and re-certification of safety-critical systems and mixed-criticality systems, i.e. systems containing safety-critical and non-safety-critical components.\nRECOMP recognizes the fact that the increasing processing power of embedded systems is mainly provided by increasing the number of processing cores. The increased numbers of cores is commonly regarded as a design challenge in the safety-critical area, as there are no established approaches to achieve certification.\nAt the same time there is an increased need for flexibility in the products in the safety-critical market. This need for flexibility puts new requirements on the customization and the upgradability of both the non-safety and safety-critical critical part. The difficulty with this is the large cost in both effort and money of the re-certification of the modified software, which means that companies cannot fully leverage the advantages of modular software system.\nRECOMP will provide reference designs and platform architectures together with the required design methods and tools for achieving cost-effective certification and re-certification of mixed-criticality, component based, multi-core systems.
