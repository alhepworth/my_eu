The overall aims are:\n1. Improving the quality of life of the citizens, by offering the citizens a clean, safe, attractive, inclusive and affordable living environment.\n2. Reducing the environmental impacts of activities, by achieving a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, a major increase in the investment and usage of RES and an increase in the deployment of electric vehicles.\n3. Creating a stimulating environment for sustainable economic development, by generating more sustainable jobs, stimulating community involvement in smart solutions and to boost start-up and existing companies to exploit the opportunities of the green digital economy and Internet of Things.\nTo achieve the aims, a key innovation challenge in all three lighthouse cities of RUGGEDISED is to arrange successful combinations of integrated smart solutions for energy and e-mobility (enabled by ICT platforms and open data protocols) and business models with the right incentives for stakeholders to invest and participate in a smart society. Specific challenges relevant for the lighthouse cities are: \n- to manage peak load variation in thermal and electrical energy supply and demand; \n- to develop appropriate cooperation structures and business models for exchange of energy;\n- to develop Smart City (open) data platforms and energy management systems\n\nRUGGEDISED has derived 10 specific objectives and planned 32 smart solutions to meet the challenges. The development of solutions in the lighthouse cities is not the primary goal of the project, but a necessary means to find the right incentives and to create validated business cases to enable large scale deployment and replication of solutions.

The project responds to the challenges of sustainable investment in education and training, aligning education and training activities on different levels with necessary technical implementation processes. Bridging the gap between teaching competences and school infrastructure, it will also design and publish pedagogically informed implementation models that will significantly contribute to sustainable investment, performance and efficiency in school infrastructure across Europe. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of School 4.0 is to enhance and to improve teacher education curricula in all stages of professional development. The project focuses on teacher training curricula that aim at (a) developing the competences of teachers in teaching digital literacy / media pedagogy and at (b) developing digital competences of teachers for effective use of ICT in teaching. The second priority of School 4.0 is to provide stakeholders in school infrastructure across Europe with a solid basis of decision-making when investing in technology and implementing ICT solutions in schools. Innovation in learning can succeed only when professional teachers can use functioning and functional ICT infrastructure in schools. At the same time, rapid changes in technology challenge decision-makers to understand the success factors for effective and sustainable investments. \r\n\r\nGoverning bodies throughout the EU have issued strategies for the enhancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure in schools and prepared large-volume investment packages. Several studies have been conducted on different implementation models of ICT in schools. School 4.0 links up the two interrelated dimensions of teacher education and school infrastructure in a transnational strategic partnership of European partners.\r\n\r\nEstablishing a transnational cooperation of decision-makers in teacher education and school infrastructure for the exchange of good practices for sustainable development of ICT competences in school education across Europe, School 4.0 brings together complementary partners from Germany, UK and Austria: (1) two institutions of higher education involved in initial teacher education, (2) two local authorities responsible for school infrastructure and for continuous professional development of teachers, (3) two alliances for the promotion of ICT in education, as well as (4) three schools. Participants in learning and training activities are key players in teacher education and training in the field of ICT based learning. Participants from universities or teacher education colleges are key players in the development of curricula for initial teacher education study programs as well as vocational education training for teachers. The participating school authorities play a key role in the operational implementation of project results. \r\n\r\nSchool 4.0 develops an integrated curricular concept for implementation of digital competences in continuous teacher education. Drawing upon the maxim \"pedagogy first\", the project also develops models for sustainable and effective implementation of ICT school infrastructure in different educational contexts, translating existing strategic frameworks onto the operational level. It results in the establishment of a transnational think tank of decision-makers in teacher education and in school infrastructure  that will continue to impact on education policies across Europe.\r\n\r\nLong-term objectives of the cooperation are (1) contributing to continual development of teachers\u2019 digital competences and (2) contributing to sustainable investment, performance and efficiency of customized ICT solutions in schools across Europe.", "http://www.whitehill-sce.glasgow.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA201-035713_6"]]}}, "2TL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "Alexandra Parade Primary School", 2914.0, 1, 1, "Leanne Mannering and Lisa Littlewood are keen and enthusiastic primary teachers who are permanent to Alexandra Parade Primary School in Glasgow.

This requires schools in Scotland to teach 2 additional languages at primary school level. Alexandra Parade Primary needs to offer another foreign language in addition to French, namely Spanish.    \r\n\r\nThrough participation in the course we will improve our confidence and competence in Spanish language and in turn become better practitioners.  The course aims to improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish to young learners and provide us with materials and ideas suitable for teaching Spanish at primary level.   In addition, our full immersion into Spanish life will significantly raise our cultural awareness bringing a positive impact to our teaching methodology.  As a result of the course we will ensure that Spanish will become embedded as part of every day school routine.  The nature and location of the course will also give us greater insight into contemporary Spain, and its education system.\r\n\r\nThis project will also enable us to make links with other European schools and share our experiences and methodological practice.
