Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project. We hope to extend it in the future \u2013 also geographically. In the long term, we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education. We hope that we will be able to inspire young people for this path.

On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language.

Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue.

Customers who are retired or unemployed or who do shiftwork often prefer our classes in the morning and in the afternoon.\r\nBy constantly improving their didactic and methodological competences, we enable our language teachers to facilitate their learners\u2019 access to foreign languages, to reach them on their respective levels and through their learning channels, thus keeping up their joy of attending our courses.\r\n\r\nAims of the project\r\nIt is our aim to improve and extend our teachers\u2019 didactic and methodological tools in order to increase our customers\u2019 satisfaction and to safeguard the success of our association.\r\nOur management\u2019s commitment to the further education of our teaching staff motivates our teachers as well. The trustful rapport of customers, teachers and office staff is fostering a lively atmosphere within our language school and also gets our customers in contact with teachers and participants of other classes. This positive atmosphere also enables us to learn what problems occur or what is particularly popular with the learners, apart from our periodical questionnaires. Long-term memberships of our customers guarantee them a successful learning outcome as well as the continuity of our school.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants\r\nWe are planning to dispatch 19 language teachers, who will act as propagators and share their newly obtained knowledge with others in our language school. Overall, we work with about 55 freelance trainers who could benefit from this dissemination. Our language teachers are academically educated experts, native speakers with different vocational and educational backgrounds and trainers who have been educated for school teaching. But teaching adults requires special knowledge of the target groups, the obstacles to learning and preferred ways of learning. It should also reflect current English spoken by common people in everyday situations. Therefore we deem a systematic didactic and methodological training dealing with these aspects necessary.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of activities\r\nThis year\u2019s projected dispatch of our teachers is part of a long-term initiative to improve the language teaching at our school. The teachers will take part in two courses from Pilgrims\u2019 summer university. The courses \u2018Creative Methodology for the Classroom\u2019 and \u2018British Life, Language and Culture\u2019 will enable them to get a targeted didactic and methodological training, to apply the newly obtained methods in workgroups and to broaden their linguistic and cultural competences.\r\nApart from the regular classes, there is a wide range of events in the evening, in which the participants can learn more about particular aspects of learning and teaching foreign languages.\r\nBy sharing terraced houses with others, our teachers will have the opportunity to make contact with colleagues from all over Europe.\r\n\r\nCarrying out the project\r\nThrough lesson observations, we have chosen language teachers who can take part in the teacher trainings and act as disseminators of the newly acquired competences. The school\u2019s administration has filed the application and will organise the participants\u2019 journey to the UK and the transfer to Canterbury. The participants will attend one of the afore-mentioned courses. After completion of the training, we will hold follow-up meetings, in which participants of the training will share their knowledge and competences with their colleagues.\r\nFurthermore, in the informal bi-monthly meetings our teachers will have the chance to present their successful lesson plans to their colleagues and to discuss these with them.\r\nA weekly teacher-training lesson open to all language teachers in Hamburg will get back to certain aspects of the training in England and further explore them.\r\nIn October 2015, we will offer our teachers and other trainers in the metropolitan area of Hamburg an intensive course.\r\n\r\nDescription of the aspired results and the long-term benefits\r\nInspired teachers and learners ensure successful learning and extend the membership of our customers with our association. This facilitates the conveyance of valid language skills and promotes an understanding of the English-speaking communities.\r\nIn the metropolitan area of Hamburg with its big harbour and all its commerce, there is a multitude of opportunities to make use of such language skills and to make guests from abroad feel welcome in our city.\r\nBeing an educational institute, we will try to establish contacts with potential partners in Europe to continue our project.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA104-002222_1"], [2014, "BeLLL (Be Life Long Learning)", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 36330.0, 2, 3, "Harmony continues to drive the focus on increasing participation in learning and employability by developing quality career guidance, counselling and support services for their staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is a part the Learn and Lead Strategy developed at Harmony. The whole idea beyond this concept is to help teachers/trainers grow and provide the environment in which it is possible to happen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Learn & Lead strategy has been developing since 2000 when a language school Harmony in Trnava, Slovakia was set up by Jana Chynoradska, a Professional Teacher of English Language and Literature, currently a co-owner of Harmony language school and a holder of an academic title of \u201ePaedDr\u201c. in English pedagogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJana,  current Principal Manager,  has been always interested in helping teachers grow and develop their full potential. As the result of her endeavour she started cooperation with Jim Wright, the Principal Manager at Pilgrims Teacher-Training, Canterbury in the UK in 2007.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir two companies along with a French partner, David Sherry, the owner of GLS language school and a co-founder of the canSPEAK network in France, started to develop the concept of the Learn & Lead in 2010 via the Grundtvig funding from the local agencies. In 2013 the Learn & Lead continued its development with Pavel Siroky, the owner of a training institution RCV from the Czech Republic and Phillippe Abadie, the co-owner of a CNTC language school in France. At the moment the Learn and Lead for Parents is being developed in the learning partnership programme funded by the Grundtvig agencies with the expected outcome to work out the \"Parent as a Leader\" program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResulting from this the organisational need is to strengthen staff training in order to be ready and qualified to deliver the Learn and Lead professional language programs (e.g. Parent as a Leader, Multiple Intelligencies, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeading by example seems to be a very important and highly desired way in our adult-training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of the BeLLL project are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR HARMONY: \r\n\r\n-to internationalize, modernize and professionalize\r\n\r\n-build networks of international contacts\r\n\r\n-actively participate in society and develop a sense of European citizenship and identity\r\n\r\n-increase the capacities, attractiveness and international dimension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STAFF\r\n\r\n- to develop new competencies, to be able to adopt to change within the organisation and grow as a professional\r\n\r\n- support the staff in the acquisition of competences with a view to improving their personal development\r\n\r\n- support the professional development of the staff\r\n\r\n- enhance notably language competences\r\n\r\n- raise awareness of other cultures and countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the number and profile of the participants, there are expected to be 20 participants (15 trainers, 3 managers and 2 admin staff) with mobilities in three countries (France, UK, Germany) participating in structured courses, coaching and job shadowing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will foster the development of each participant in the key areas defined prior to the mobility, be evaluated after the arrival and as well as 3 months after the arrival. This will help us monitor and evaluate the impact of the training. The project will be led by a project team (Project Manager, Project Support) who will be held responsible for the smooth running of the project (practical arrangements, mentoring, evaluation, communication with partners, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefit of this project will be in its great contribution to establishing the Learn and Lead Career Path of a Trainer. Harmony as a catalyst of the Learn and Lead strategy as well as a member of the international canSPEAK network has got a very good positon and reputation gained among the members. Based on this there is a very high probability that the Learn and Lead Training Career Path of a Trainers will be adopted and possibly developed by the members of network. \r\n\r\nThe Learn and Lead Career Path of a Trainer will be fully adopted by Harmony by 31st July 2016 and its associated schools within the USH network. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarmony as a coordinator of the strategic partnership aiming at establishing the Learn and Lead Training Academy which is going to  be developed during 2014-2017 with five more partner-organisations (Germand, Poland, Turkey, Czech Republic, France) will adopt this Learn and Lead Training Career Path of a Harmony Trainer into its training scheme and build upon it further on.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA104-000115_2"], [2018, "U\u010denie zru\u010dnost\u00ed potrebn\u00fdch v 21. storo\u010d\u00ed", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 29393.0, 3, 4, "The aim of our Secondary Grammar School of M.

On the other hand, as a bilingual centre, our needs focus on the improvement of bilingual and non-bilingual teaching practices\r\nConsidering the diversity of learning rhythms, and academic, linguistic (bilingual) and cultural levels, due to the origin of our students, one of our key objectives is to know different strategies to meet the expectations of this diversity.\r\nPROJECT BACKGROUND:\r\nIt has different aspects that imply an improvement in the performance of the academic life of the school, both at the methodological and organizational level. The centre is immersed in a powerful Europeanization process from which it is trying to strengthen the teaching of languages, mainly in the non-linguistic areas. And this Europeanization is carried out in the two key action areas that have a direct impact on the students: Vocational Training and Secondary Education (both compulsory and post-compulsory). For both sectors we are developing internationalization projects that pivot around the participation of the educational community members in E+ projects.\r\nThe school Faculty is undergoing a major reform and most of the professionals who join our centre are qualified at a high level (linguistic skills) to provide bilingual teaching. \r\nLooking to offering our students the optimal teaching level, we believe it is convenient and even, prescriptive, that our teachers have the possibility of undertaking qualified training courses to enhance their languages skills.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\r\n- To Know new teaching methodologies, focusing on attention to diversity outreach. \r\n- To detect the strengths and weaknesses of our methodology. \r\n- To promote knowledge, appreciation and dissemination of the common European heritage: linguistic, cultural and natural. \r\n- To use English as a communication tool in the classroom, improving it with our pupils.\r\n- To include the strengths detected in the schools visited, in our Center Plan and carry out the modification of those, that do not contribute to the achievement of all the above. \r\n- Europeanization of the school and teaching practice. \r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS:\r\nThe number of participants in the project is 8. They are qualified on the heritage preservation and dissemination, the respect for Human Rights and their European dimension. Finally, due to the extensive experience of some components in E+ projects, as well as the bilingual teaching, the performance of responsability positions at regional level, our team represents a promising group to consolidate an innovative European Development Plan in our school.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY:\r\na) job shadowing (Belgium and Germany) to learn teaching practices for the integration of immigrant students to promote European identity, and methodological strategies based on learning by tasks, as well as classroom and center dynamics aimed at favoring attention to diversity and the integration of the European Common Heritage in our classrooms.\r\nb) b) mobility activities focused on the enhancement of the participants\u2019 foreign languages competence will be held to improve formative needs in our staff Participants will attend specific courses in Malta, France, Finland, Ireland, Greece and UK.\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nThe outcomes will be measured through the participants\u2019 assessment of both written and oral competence in foreign languages, their ability to share teaching experiences with other professionals, and to learn skills and new resources used in other countries. The participants will share their newly acquired knowledge through a personal blog. They will also employ digital platforms, (eTwinning, Moodle) to get their work known by the school comunity. \r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS:\r\nMobility activities will increase the number of language acquisition-related activities in our school, thus promoting values such as interculturalism, European Heritage dimension and citizenship awareness.

Therefore we have chosen our partner institutes from English-speaking and German-speaking areas.\r\nOur language school has been present in the field of adult education since 1992 and in the course of the recent five years we have paid more and more attention to the needs of the adult students aged 45+. While analysing the dominant tendencies emerging in the sector of independent language schools, it has become clear for us that in addition to the age groups of secondary school students and young adults, the number of senior adult students aged 45+ is higher and higher year by year. Since in each member country of the European Union, including Hungary, there are new job-market related and demographic trends, it is the mutual interest of both the individual language learners aged 45+ and the language teaching institute involved in adult education, that bigger and bigger emphasis should be placed on the needs of senior students. It also meets social demands in addition to the individual and institutional targets.\r\nOur language teachers, without exception, are qualified teachers in foreign languages and most of them have work experience of long years in the field of adult education, due to our HR policy. On the basis of a throughly compiled set of selection criteria we have chosen the travelling colleges from among them. The most significant aspect of selection has been the highest probability of selecting colleges we can expect the best results of in the long run. \r\nWhile planning this current project we have set a well-defined aim of providing our language teachers and our course coordinators with special knowledge to be gained in the field of geroeducation and geronto-andragogy and we have made efforts to find partner institutes that can fully satisfy these needs. For this reason we have forged relationships with institutes which are perfectly suitable for organising tailor-made courses during which our participating teachers can widen their horizon and can have a deeper insight into the special methodology of teaching foreign languages to senior students.\r\nWe have been endeavoured to set up a scedule to avoid overlapping and to secure the continuous completion of all the jobs in our school.

R. Stefanik in Ivanka pri Dunaji is a big school for more than 800 pupils (at the age of 6 to 15) near Bratislava. The build was extended twice in recent years, as the number of pupils has been growing. Along with that, the number of teachers has been growing as well. Luckily, most coming teachers are enthusiastic. We want them to educate themselves and feel happy and loyal part of our institution \r\nThe school is oriented to foreign languages, ICT and environmental education. Our pupils have achieved many successes in various competitions, including English and German language competitions. Many students continue in bilingual secondary schools. However, we still have to work hard to develop quality of education, bring new methods and more entertaining activities into classrooms. \r\nWe have participated in some European projects, such as eTwinning Schoolovision, European Languages Day, ENO Tree Day. We cooperate with our twin school in the Czech Republic. A British teacher comes every year to our school with amazing presentation about Britain and with information about studying in the UK. \r\nNevertheless, there is yet much to do if we want our students to think in European dimensions. It is even more important now, when media are full of negative news and conspiracy websites spread lies. \r\n\r\nAims:\r\nThe first aim of our project is to improve our teachers' language competences, which will mean better quality of foreign languages teaching at our school too. Along with that we also want to widen knowledge about European, British, and specifically English and Scottish culture and life. Teachers should be able to promote and support European values, such as peace, cooperation, human rights, tolerance and solidarity. They will become better in teaching critical thinking and how to distinguish reliable sources of information from the fake ones.\r\nA crucial challenge is inclusion of the pupils with special needs. Therefore we are sending our employee to Special Needs and Inclusive Learning course. \r\nAll participants will bring inspiring information about education system and methodology in other countries. They will meet new colleagues and possibly start international projects with them. \r\n\r\nParticipants, mobilities and expected results:\r\n- Eight employees are involved in the mobilities. They are all teachers and also have other important roles in the school. \r\n- Seven participants will attend Pilgrims courses in Canterbury. We have only the best experiences from 2015 Pilgrims summer courses, when three teachers brought new enthusiasm and many interesting activities to school. We are still in touch with some Pilgrims teachers and collegues from Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Germany...  \r\n- They will study at one or  two weeks courses, in compliance with their needs and our school needs:  \r\nMethodology & English Language for Primary Teachers \r\nMethodology & English Language for Secondary Teachers\r\nEnglish Language Improvement Course\r\nSpecial Needs and Inclusive Learning\r\nDrama Techniques for Creative English Teaching\r\nPractical uses of Mobile Technologies in the Language Classroom\r\nBritish Life, Language & Culture.\r\n- One teacher will participate in Teacher Training in Inlingua Edinburgh. The course consists of two main components (Teacher Training and Spoken Performance) plus an extensive Scottish culture programme.\r\n- Studying English in an English-speaking country and intensive contact with teachers from around the world will surely bring efficiency to our teachers' communication skills and widen their intercultural knowledge. The courses will empower them with the tools to communicate effectively in English and to apply their knowledge to the classes too. The participants will refresh the oral and listening English skills, apply a modern, communication-oriented teaching methodology, benefit from the exchange of best practice.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nOur school has participated in two Erasmus plus KA1 projects so far and the mobilities and results were amazing. Therefore we know we can expect great benefits for our school, our pupils and our teachers. We hope to promote students' deeper interest in learning, and not only English. Our teachers will inject life into lessons and make them more attractive. \r\nWe are also convinced that the chosen courses will contribute to giving European dimension to our school. The students will gain a better understanding of European life, culture and values in its various aspects.\r\nWe believe our participation will promote cooperation of our school with other educational institutions abroad.\r\nOur school is part of local community.

The effort to create a pedagogically and professionally erudite team of teachers interested in lifelong learning is the basis of a good school. Teachers who lack  such attributes are unable to guarantee  high quality in education and upbringing even if all the other conditions are provided. On the other hand, high quality teachers can, to a certain extent, compensate for worse conditions in educational process. Having the top teachers in the school system is determined by  the attractiveness of teaching profession. The attractiveness does not depend solely on adequate salary, conditions for personal development, work conditions and public recognition, but also on career prospects and opportunities for professional growth.\r\nFor this reason, our school has decided to participate in Erasmus + programme and send 6 teachers and 1 school executive, the deputy headmaster, to take part in the educational programmes. Three of the teachers will improve their methodological competencies in teaching English as a foreign language and the other three will improve their competencies in CLIL courses. We would like to incorporate new trends CLIL method in teaching biology, European studies and geography in the bilingual section in our school.\r\nDespite being the co-authors of a unique study programme called European Studies and pioneers in implementing it into the eight-year study programme and five-year bilingual programme, we can see the space for improvement. Perceiving the changes in society and new trends in education, we feel that we must react with high degree of flexibility and must not rest on our laurels.\r\nThe school inspection findings and the results of the official testing leave no doubts that the system of bilingual education is highly efficient and also very attractive for the students. We would like to contribute to the positive changes  in the Slovak educational system, whose results fall behind the European standard. In order to succeed, we think it is inevitable to provide opportunities for professional growth of our teachers and thus increase the attractiveness of teaching profession. Highly-skilled teachers and well-functioning school management must present the results which will convince the officials who hold the future of our education in their hands.\r\nThe improvements in school management, which could create more positive school atmosphere,  seem to be of equal importance. By taking part in a mobility project, we expect  positive results in the area of communication, financial management, and project management.

It enables working adults to take the \"Fachhochschulreife\" and the \"Abitur\" (equivalent to A-levels or baccalaureat or Matura). For many of our scholars this is not only an essential opportunity to clearly improve their career perspective  but also for social participation and integration. About 70% of our scholars have a so-called migration background, whereby the majority originates from (Eastern) Europe. By applying for this EU-grant our school would like to support ten English language teachers who wish to advance their foreign language, intercultural and  IT competences and are prepared to utilize them to the betterment of the school. Moreover, by attending teacher training courses with international participation abroad (Canterbury, England), at a school accredited by the British Council (\"Pilgrims\") which is renowned for high quality courses and a mix of teachers attending from all over Europe, we hope to get new contacts for our school. In addition to the participation in training events new contacts with teachers from other European countries can be made with the aim of creating a (digital) school partnership, from which our students could directly benefit. Increased training needs arise from the specific curricular requirements in the face of a very diverse student body, made up of adults of different ages, different backgrounds, educational background and professional orientation. In particular the subject English plays a key role in our school not only due to its relevance to the career prospects of the scholars, but also because it opens up prospects to the scholars in a globalized world. To match up to the task, teachers must be additionally trained not only in their traditional department but also to make use of opportunities to use new media for teaching.

The main goal of our institute is to provide students of all ages from youth trough adults with adequate foreign language skills that enable them to adequately compete in today\u2019s international business arena.  In order to stay current our strategy includes the implementation of innovative methods for providing these skills.   Considering the ever changing and competitive nature of international business our organization needs to constantly modify its strategy in order to meet these new challenges.\r\n\r\n2.  It has therefore become imperative that our teaching staff be offered opportunities for honing their expertise.  This includes updating their knowledge of new teaching methods, new trends and curriculum development in order that the high quality of our educational process can be maintained.  \r\n\r\n3.It has also become evident that our organization needs to establish a cooperative atmosphere with foreign educational institutions.  The implementation of international activities such as the attendance of foreign courses in education, cooperative projects, teacher exchange programs and the sharing of individual goals of foreign educational systems would help our organization develop and apply long term modernization and internationalization policies.\r\n\r\n4. Obtaining practical skills for teaching foreign languages has become an absolute necessity for teachers.  These skills include elocution, communication, authentication, confidence building and the teaching of colloquial English without the associated stress.  We seek innovative programs in order to accommodate individual target groups for the purpose of achieving increased effectiveness in acquiring language, social, intercultural and managerial skills. These programs require expertise in creative thinking, innovation, leadership, motivation and conflict resolution as prerequisites.   It has become necessary to constantly improve entrepreneurial business skills and impart these into the curriculums in order that students can become more competitive in the world of business.  Teachers are therefore required to implement their improvements, (gained through ICT) and apply didactics of e-learning etc. during their teaching sessions.\r\n\r\n5. Based on these requirements our organization plans on embracing the international mobility of our pedagogical staff.  They are qualified and certified English teachers experienced in teaching children, youths and adults.  They are self motivated to constantly develop their professional expertise.  The project therefore consists of preparation, implementation and follow up activities.  The main thrust, implementation, will consist of 6 courses each lasting14 days.  A total of six teachers will attend six courses.  These courses are designed to help teachers expand their own language and pedagogical skills, self awareness, their role in the educational process, improved motivation, effectiveness and development skills are also addressed.  Exposure of their skills in English speaking countries will foster the exchange of information, increase intercultural consciousness, strengthen their own linguistic skills and will help then recognize the cultural aspects of the UK.\r\n\r\n6. This is the new path for educators to follow.  Thanks to new creative methods, tools, new educational systems and the implementation of ICT this is now possible.  These innovative and improved skills will positively impact future projects.  These results can only have a positive effect on the participants.  Their improved language skills will increase their employability and support their career growth as well as instilling motivation and the self satisfaction of having widened their horizons.", "http://www.pilgrims.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA104-000229_1"], [2018, "Building bridges", "The Education & Training Company Limited", 14087.0, 2, 2, "Our organisation puts a great focus on long-life learning and personal and professional development.

On the other hand, it contributes to the organization's strategic objective to become an innovation center as far as working with adults is concerned locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nBabel Center was set up 9 years ago by a group of young teachers who believe in lifelong learning and have always looked for ways to best answer the adults' need of learning a foreign language in the easiest and most enjoyable way possible. In time the team of teachers has grown, as well as the number of languages taught (at the moment there are 10). The needs of the adult learners have also changed together with the new technologies and increasing opportunities of using a foreign language. At this stage, the challenge for the organization is to find creative ways to respond to the needs of the adult learners, to keep them interested in the whole range of foreign languages, i. e. to build up a system that assures high quality of the courses delivered and keeps teachers motivated to develop professionally and innovate.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for the organization is to positions itself within the international context of foreign language teaching. In 2010-2012 we ran our first Learning Partnership project within the Grundtvig Program. Having had the chance to collaborate with other 8 institutions, most of them foreign language teaching centers, has proved the importance of learning in an international context, and has also indicated ways in which the Babel team can contribute through its expertise to creating a European know-how in this field. During the last 2 years, the confidence in the teachers' expertise has grown as a result of the excellent feedback they have received for presentations and workshops delivered at local, national and international conferences and seminars. In this sense, establishing international contacts and access to the best resources of expertise in 2014-2015 can mean a leap forward towards the the higher goal of bringing Romanian added value to the European level by means of future partnership projects, as well as by a high quality offer of Erasmus+ trainings in the field of teaching foreign languages.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" fulfills its objectives by organizing 9 European mobilities which involves the participation on 13 members of the organization. Special attention has been given that all levels of the organization are offered the opportunity of international mobility, from Junior trainers to the management team taking into consideration their motivation and area of interest/ expertise, as well as their ability to disseminate information on a local, national and international level.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project are coordinated by a support team, consisting of people with experience in international collaborations and project management. The project involves a stage of preparing the mobilities, of 9 actions taking place throughout 2014-2015, of organizing dissemination activities in various frameworks (in the organization, in Edu-Cafe - the Resource Center for Teachers, national and international conferences, The Romanian Institute for Adult Teaching) and assessment.\r\n\r\nThe 9 actions represent participation at training sessions for developing creative methodologies in language teaching and for creating learning communities (Creative Methodology, The Creative Classroom, Building Positive Group Dynamics), using new technologies and adapting them to future requirements (Future Learning - Using Ipads and Tablets, Education for Tomorrow) and for developing high quality systems (Teach. Learn, Quality, Finnish Lessons for European Schools), and finally for developing linguistic, cultural and methodological competences in teaching the Roman languages, i. e. French and Italian.\r\n\r\nThe results of taking part at these mobilities will be a set of individual competences connected to latest knowledge, which are extremely important abilities for the 21st century trainer and for the management of an innovative school.  On top of that, increased self-confidence and inter-cultural openness within the European context will boost participants' motivation to exchange views in various dissemination activities and in future projects possibly generated within the networking done during these mobilities.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the project, including the way the present application has been written, the proposed approach is one of partnership and responsibility of all parties involved. Both the training providers and the participants are partners in this project, having in mind that the needs of all those involved are as important as the needs of the organization.

In the Trnava, Nitra and Bratislava regions we significantly contribute to the increased public participation in education, the improvement of employee skills of corporate clients and to building effective links between employers and young people to improve their chances in the labor market.The project has 2 main targets. The first is to provide additional professional skills to our teachers.  The courses focus on creative methodology and business English. The participants will be trained in current innovative teaching methodologies, use of the current teaching and supplementary materials, creative and alternative approaches to teaching, in the skills to teach English for special purposes (business). Our aim is that the project participants will gain practical appliable knowledge and skill which will then be forwarded to other colleagues. The professional development of the individuals will contribute to the growth of the school as a whole. This part of the project includes courses for trainers in cooperation with the Pilgrim Language School and other educational and training centers in the UK. This will involve three teachers from our school.The second objective is to set up an effective system of training for teachers and a progressive approach to working with students. The course \"How to train teachers\" will allow us to work with our lecturers to ensure their continued education, to link the needs of the schools, of the clients with teachers' performance and lessons. The second activity is coaching and NLP, which represents a new and modern way of working with students based on empathic understanding, effective communication to maximize the students' potential, leading to better results and increased motivation. Both activities are in line with the latest trends in education that emphasize a humanistic approach to the student and the need to adapt the education to students (not students to the education plan).The knowledge and skills acquired by the teachers will be applied practically in the form of new courses, improved methodology, in creative work with teaching and supplementary materials to provide the student with more interesting and effective classroom hours. Their contribution to the development of the school will be optimized in the school\u2019s curricula with the teachers able to provide a wider range of courses and actively participate in the training of colleagues through mentoring. The expected learning outcomes of activities aimed at training teachers will improve the system of professional development of our lecturers. Our school will offer training courses intended for both our teachers and those at other teaching institutions. Better results and good feedback achieved by more effective approach to students will motivate them to seek further language training.The results are seen at several levels: the personal and professional development of the teachers, the continuing development of the school and its human resources, the expansion and diversity of course offer, the enrichment of teaching methodology, an increased interest in courses from corporate clients, greater public participation in education and improved language preparation of candidates and corporate clients.The impact of activities at local and regional levels is seen in qualified and professional language services for key employers, graduates and jobseekers with a positive affect on their work performance and activities on the labor market. New expanded courses with topics relevant to teachers from other language schools will create an opportunity for the further professional development and improve the quality of language teaching in Slovakia - at the national level.The project will enable us to modernize the methodologies used in our school and to carry out training that will increase the professionalism of our teachers .

Many of our partners have expressed desire and interest to choose our organization for their future mobility exchanges and therefore we would like to start training and education our staff members in the key competences, necessary for developing host activities in the EU context.The training programmes and structured courses we chose will:-  help our staff to improve their skills and competencies in key areas such as communication in English in European contexts, cognitive and critical thinking strategies, collaborative strategies, planning and evaluation- help our staff to gain and use new, innovative methods and approaches, especially designed according to different age and interest groups they address at their work; - contribute to the quality of our staff\u2019s teaching and to the development of staff - help our administration, teaching and training staff to develop professional competencies and to organise and co-ordinate cross-curricular activities by using an inquiry-based learning process in a local community.These activities should make it possible to experience a number of key aspects which should meet the training needs of teachers and staff in our institution and will contribute to the development of staff\u2019s knowledge, skills and attitudes as decision-makers in the design, management and implementation of quality curriculum-making and international projects and help our organization towards developing ai international curriculum which would enable us to become a host organization for teachers and students from all over Europe.We will choose 6 participants who are members of our administrative and teaching staff and who are in any way involved in international projects. Participants in the chosen training programmes are expected to develop their language skills in English by engaging in cooperative group work, by carrying out interviews to local people, by participating in seminars and hands-on workshops, by trying out new methods in practice, in the field, on computers and various workshops.   Sessions will promote interaction among participants in the whole programme and every effort will be made to provide a collaborative learning environment. An interactive communicative approach is applied, which provides participants with experiential learning. Participants develop their fluency through discussion about current affairs and topics of general interest.We want to do this project because we wish to send the members of our staff to international and highly qualitative courses and programmes for the professional development of their competences, incorporating a European dimension of education in all its activities and promoting the exchange of ideas and best teaching practices as fundamental pillars of its methodological approach.Our plan is to become not only a sending but also a host organization for international exchanges and trainings.

However, interactive characters still lack the visual appeal and subtle details of real actor performance as captured on film. In addition, existing production pipelines for authoring animated characters are highly labour intensive.RE@CT aims to revolutionise the production of realistic characters and significantly reduce costs by developing an automated process to extract and represent animated characters from actor performance capture in a multiple camera studio. The key innovation is the development of methods for analysis and representation of 3D video to allow reuse for real-time interactive animation.

Specifically, we will encode mathematical problems into networks consisting of nano- or microsized channels and nodes, and will use self-propelled biological agents to explore these networks and find the solution to the encoded mathematical problems. Due to the very large number of agents, the problem is solved in a highly parallel manner. A number of different types of micro- and nanoscale biological agents will be used, including innate objects (protein filaments propelled by molecular motors) and living systems (bacteria and fungi). The novelty of this approach lies in the use of self-propelled agents (avoiding scalability issues associated with the use of external driving forces), as well as in the combination of human intelligence (in the target-oriented design of networks) with the parallelism enabled by large numbers of biological agents.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.
