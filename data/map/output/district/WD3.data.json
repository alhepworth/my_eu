A report of the European Commission from 2012 proposes \"Rethinking of Education: investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\". This process is necessary because by 2020, 20% of new jobs will require skills at a higher level, and education must raise both the standards and the levels of achievement to fulfil this requirement and to encourage transversal skills necessary to ensure that young people are able to become free entrepreneurs and adapt to the inevitable changes, which are becoming more numerous, in the labor market during their career. In this perspective, the project EMOTION aims as objectives:\r\nO1- Increase the quality of teaching and learning by improving the skills of management and leadership of training  for a total number of 7 VET teachers participating in activities of shadowing type in Granada, during 7 days\r\nO2 - Improvement of the quality of professional training of 64 students (in 4 streams) from the fields of qualification Commerce/Trading and Tourism, participants in practice training sessions of 14 days, at economic agents  in the UK - London, between 2017-2019, in order to facilitate insertion on the labor market for future graduates\r\nO3 \u2013 Increase the capacity of a total number of 80 teachers and 1200 students from VET to trigger changes at the school level, in terms of modernization and international openness by strengthening the European dimension of the educational and professional training process, until 2020.\r\nThe project addresses to students and teachers in VET: 7 teachers will participate in direct observation by job shadowing, of the way the management and leadership of training is approached in an innovative manner, in a prestigious school in Granada, and will benefit of transfer of good practices and advice in this field; 64 students of XI th grades will participate in practical training sessions in four streams-placement  at economic agents in the UK, to improve professional skills, during two years, as follows: Stream 1 - Feb. 2018 practical training (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers.

Our pedagogy of alternation has always accustomed students to have different work placements in various professional backgrounds. It is therefore quite natural that we decided to set up internships for European mobility. Our training centre has organized European mobility programmes since 2008. Two kinds of public are primarily concerned: students in second year of Bac Pro SAPAT (services to people and territories) for a 3-week placement, and students in 2nd year of CAP \"cooking and waitressing\" (with the apprentice status) for an internship of two weeks negotiated with their tutors when they signed  their apprenticeship contract (one week taken on the company time and one week on the training centre time).The idea today is rooted in the minds and represents a real motivation for the majority of learners although some families still need to be convincing. In mountain areas, mobility needs to be developed indeed...We stayed on the idea of a much anticipated preparation.(pj 2) When our students join the class of \"Seconde\", we talk to the families and to the students. Students meet young people who have already benefited from this program. We begin to raise funds to complete the exchange. When they are in 2nd year , a cultural preparation work begins with dedicated time. (See work schedule). Families are associated to the process ( pj 10)From 2008 to 2013, we set up a support by a trainer throughout the stay. Since 2014, we have tested the organization of mobility without the presence of a trainer but with a \"referent\" person in the host country. This system works fairly well even though our work placement mentors expressed frustration not to meet with us for intermediate and final assessments. We have thus decided to develop the following plan for the majority of our next mobility programmes: a trainer from our centre will handle the first days of the stay and so a first contact with the work placement mentors will be done.Then our referent contact in the corrersponding country will take care of the rest of the stay. This principle explains the number of professional mobilities requested in this application. During their free-time, our students will also be supervised by that referent person (living near) who can act in case of troubles.The number of scholarships requested is down compared to 2014, being in an area in demographic decline, our class numbers are down.Each mobility is therefore subject to a review to re-examine our practices and enable us to progress in the Erasmus+ program management  in the future.Mobility in Ireland is a new thing. A trainer colleague will spend 5 days at the Dublin Institute of Technology (from February 1st to 5th, 2016) as part of the European mobility programme for professionnals and he will try to make new contacts for both the food sector and personal services.As the history of our project shows, in 2012, we established groups of mobility for professional tutors, first trainer of the \"food\" sector in 2012 to discover the professional training and work organization in Swedish restaurants. This experience was renewed for 10 tutors and trainer of the \"early childhood\" sector in January 2015 to explore early childhood care in the Swedish system. (pj 3) Given the value of these experiences for adults and actual professional repercussions, it is expected in the next application (2017) to set up a stay for cooks in Ireland and to involve our Swedish partners in that project. A committee of our Board of Directors will start thinking about that project next March so as to be able to apply for 2017..2 other trainer colleagues have recently expressed a desire to experience an individual professional mobility  (Elise CAILLIAU in 2016/2017 and in 2017/2018 Jerome MONTAVON) one in Ireland and one in Scotland. Their goals are professional immersions in high schools to exchange with colleagues. After these two stays are completed, this will be 100% of the members of the teaching team which will have benefited from European professional mobility.

This information will be used to optimise the informativeness of SNP panels and select SNPs to tag haplotypes, and hence ensure that genotype information can be used within and between breeds. The project will explore the opportunities for extended phenotypic collection, including the use of automated on farm systems and will develop standardisation protocols that, in consultation with ICAR, could be used by the industry for data collection and management. Developed tools will be tested and validated by demonstration in collaboration with dairy, dual purpose, beef and minority breed organisations.

Moulded Paper Products (MPP) from China are up 20% cheaper than the equivalent EU products. Due to continued increase in prices there is a need for the EU industry to reduce cost affiliated with low energy efficiencies. A major portion of recovered fibre is sourced from local SMEs such as waste paper merchants, waste management companies and corrugated case manufacturers. The recovered paper market will be directly impacted through potentially higher demand. Demand from China for recovered fibre has pushed prices high. Exports globally estimated at over 13 million tonnes per annum (expected to increase by around 18 million by 2009) are used mainly for MPP manufacturing, which are subsequently exported back to Europe. Estimated growth volumes for existing and new markets, show that increasing usage of recovered fibre will be restrained, unless the industry can move forward on the following key issues: \u2022 Improvement in the ability to produce cost competitive products \u2022 Step change in the aesthetic characteristics of products, at competitive prices \u2022 Migration towards utilisation of post- consumer recovered fibre The Solution. The proposed project aims to develop a novel process for producing moulded paper products more energy efficiently with better complexity in design.

However, we recognise a need to move these skills further forward particularly now that all staff and students have access to their own iPads on a 1-to-1 basis.  It is simply not enough to just USE technology (such as Apps, Youtube, Google Docs) in the classroom,  teachers have to make EFFECTIVE use of such technologies.\r\n\r\nAfter a transparent and open internal application process  a small group of staff (9 - comprising six subject areas, the whole Psychology department, 3 members of SLT, 2 Heads of Department and the Headteacher - some roles overlap) were selected to take part in the project.  However, as the school gained much experience from the previously successful Comenius project, it is widely recognised that this small group of teachers will be truly representative of the staff as a whole.  We endeavour to ensure that all staff will benefit from the project whether or not they themselves travelled.\r\n\r\nWe have identified that a way to enhance teachers skills in this area is to afford them the opportunity to watch other practitioners doing so with their own students.  To this end two members of one of RMS's most effective departments will jobshadow colleagues in Finland - chosen because of its high PISA rankings. This will be a reciprocated visit as we will host the Finnish teachers as part of their own separate, unrelated project application.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we feel the need to learn about new,cutting edge technology applications and so we will send colleagues to attend a course that will cover this.  The course has been chosen because of its excellent reviews and because the itinerary perfectly suits our needs.\r\n\r\nOther colleagues will attend a course, also in Finland (and depending on timings, possibly Estonia) to assist teachers in benchmarking the assessment of digital skills  exhibited by students.  AGian this course has been selected because it fits our needs perfectly.\r\n\r\nUltimately we will use what we learn to enable our students to make more effective use of the technological skills they will need for their future careers.  They are already adept and confident computer users, with their digital skills being well-honed, but this project will ensure that they are able to utilise these skills in much more effective and efficient ways.  For example. we currently encourage the use of digital tools to work collaboratively, but sometimes such work does not achieve intended outcomes.  By combining the experiences of all elements of this project we hope that we will be able to encourage students will be able to share their collaborative work on a more widespread basis.\r\n\r\nWe will present our finding through a variety of channels, most notably subject-specific journals, seminars and workshops.  The most important thing is that the project will enhance teaching skills throughout the school and in the wider community whilst at the same time providing students with more opportunity to make effective use of technology in their learning.  This process helps learners to be come much more independent and in so doing put them in charge of their own learning. \r\n\r\nAll of these benefits are in line with our school ethos whereby each child is esteemed as an individual, capable of success and encouraged to do their personal best.", "http://www.royalmasonic.herts.sch.uk", "Royal Masonic School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036405_coordinator"]]}}, "5EA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1267401600000, 1393545600000, "Remote Accessibility to Diabetes Management and Therapy in Operational healthcare Networks", "Chorleywood Health Centre", "The REACTION project will develop an integrated approach to improved long term management of diabetes; continuous blood glucose monitoring, clinical monitoring and intervention strategies, monitoring and predicting related disease indicators, complemented by education on life style factors such as obesity and exercise and, ultimately, automated closed-loop delivery of insulin.The REACTION platform will feature an interoperable peer-to-peer communication platform based on a (SoA) service oriented architecture \u2013 all functionalities, including devices, are represented as services and applications consisting of a series of services orchestrated to perform a desired workflow.
