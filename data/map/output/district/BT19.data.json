The Digital Agenda for Europe is comprised of 7 pillars that allow meeting the set targets for 2020 and one of them refers to Enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion (6th pillar). In this context, increasing attention has been paid to e-inclusion policies at European level, including improving the EU e-skills as the main prerequisite for development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employability. However, improving the level of e-skills to reduce digital divide at European level requires a transnational effort. The countries involved in this partnership have different levels of digital economy development and population lack of e-skills.  In the same time all the countries are facing same challenges in terms of addressing the needs of vulnerable groups such as: people with disabilities, minorities, migrants, economically disadvantaged people in urban and rural areas.   The proposed project partnership intends to offer lifelong learning benefits to vulnerable groups by using innovative training techniques to improve their level of digital inclusion.  The project will focus on developing, sharing and transferring innovative digital education practices , enabling organizations to work together in order to developing a digital literacy course to help vulnerable groups to gain basic digital competences.  The project methodological approach will bring a new perspective of addressing directly the needs of the adult learners belonging to vulnerable groups by developing a tailored curricula and innovative training course to help them  improve their basic digital skills that can ultimately facilitate their social inclusion and raise their employability. In the same time the projects planned interventions will contribute to the development of adult educators\u2019 competences to deal with diversified groups of socially disadvantaged members of the communities, making use of new technologies and teaching outcomes.  Last, but not least, the project activities are designed to strengthen cooperation and networking between partner organizations. The project's main objectives are:1. develop and implement innovative inclusive adult education methodologies to enhance basic digital skills of vulnerable groups, including new curricula, courses and accompanying learning materials and tools tailored to adult learners belonging to vulnerable groups2. extend and improve the educators competences to effectively deliver digital literacy courses for vulnerable groups including  obtaining British NQF accredited qualification in facilitating learning and development for groups3. develop and implement innovative tools to evaluate learning curve of adult learners belonging to vulnerable groups including the use of digital storytelling techniques4. develop  multi-lingual web portal for e-skills educators5. Increased institutional capacity of 4 educational type organizations to provide digital literacy courses to vulnerable groups6. Increase institutional capacity of 2 cultural organization (Librarians) to extend services & provide e-skills training to under served members  of their communitiesThe main added value of the project is to increase the institutional capacity of the all partner organizations by developing competences and skills of its staff and its network of trainers to form a community of \"e-tutors for e-inclusion\",  which share competences acquired under a single  training plan. This critical mass include  over 1000 staff and learners in all partner countries representing the main resource to continue to professionalize learners in all partner organizations. The overall impact of the partnership program is to enhance the institutional capacity of each partner to assimilate and use innovative methods of adult learning by working with Adult Education organizations in different European countries. The project is an open door for future cooperation between all organizations involved. After the implementation of the program designed for our staff and learners,  the skills and experience gained will help our organizations to increase capacity to improve basic digital literacy training services and develop training and qualification of national community e-tutors. Also this program will support the development of training modules based on coherent models which quality has been certified in other EU countries.", "http://www.kilcooleywomenscentre.co.uk", "KILCOOLEY WOMENS CENTRE", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024433_coordinator"], [2015, "Innovative Quality Mentoring for Social Inclusion", "KILCOOLEY WOMENS CENTRE", 197065.0, 4, 6, "The proposed project partnership intends to offer lifelong learning benefits to less educated and low skills categories of people by using innovative and quality mentoring techniques to improve their level of social inclusion and employability.\r\nThe projects will focus on developing, sharing and transferring innovative mentoring practices between participating countries, enabling organisations to work together in order to developing adult educators\u2019 competences to deal with diversified groups of learners, making use of new technologies and teaching outcomes. Also the project will contribute to improving and extending the offer of high quality learning opportunities tailored to individual adult learners including through innovative ways of outreach and delivery. The project proposed intervention is following a previous collaboration between current partners during 2012-2014 within Community Mentoring for Social Inclusion Partnership funded LLP Grundtvig Learning Partnerships (GRU-13-P-LP-237-SV-UK). The previous partnership project aimed to compare and contrast the experiences, methodologies, definitions and assumptions of the different approaches used by the organizations involved in providing learning opportunities to socially disadvantaged members of communities and involve representatives from these groups in these processes. As a result of these exchanges the project collectively designed and integrated approaches based on attracting, training and empowering successful individuals from similar backgrounds to socially disadvantaged adults, to become community mentors. \r\nThe project aims at increasing institutional capacity of the project partners, empowering them to provide new and innovative services for social inclusion in Europe.  The training of trainers will generate a legacy to the project, and will ensure the cascading of learning continues after completion.  The pool of trainers in each member country will be an asset to the organization and their local community.  In this context the objectives proposed for developing a new partnership program are:\r\n1. Development of a common professional profile of Community Mentors for Social Inclusion at European level, based on the initial assessment and lessons learned and best practices applied  in partners countries. \r\n2. Develop training curricula adapted to the common professional profile of Community Mentor for Social Inclusion (based on the initial assessment). \r\n3. Increased institutional capacity of 6 organizations in 4 countries by providing modern and innovative training to their key staff involved in community mentoring for social inclusion.\r\n4. Develop competences and skills of 132 professional in adult education to become community mentors for social inclusion using short-term staff training and learners blending mobilities. \r\n5. Develop innovative tools to transfer information and knowledge,  promote and support community mentoring activities. \r\nThe intellectual outputs created during the project, generate training tools and materials, transferable in any European country and will continue to be used by the project partners  and also other organizations. \r\n* The Community Mentor Profile developed during the partnership is an important reference for future interventions and it will sustain itself based on the quality of the content.\r\n*The curricula and training modules that will be developed will constitute transferable knowledge ready to be used by any interested organization. This training is an important asset for any organization involved in community mentoring building its capacity to deliver training services to the community. \r\n* The critical mass of 132 professionals in adult education trained in community mentoring (22 people in each organization) will ensure the multiplier effect of the  intervention.  They also represent important assets to their organization, which can valorise their improved skills and competences. Therefore each organization will be interested to support their activities from their own resources as a win-win strategy.\r\n* Community Mentoring 4 Inclusion guide  (electronic format), and the Video \"Community Mentoring in the European context\" \r\nwill ensure both project visibility and knowledge transferability long after the project will end. \r\nLast but not least the partnership will continue to exist after the project ending based on common interests and values.  All partners will continue to work together and share experiences regarding a common profile of Community Mentor for Social inclusion at European level, which can be recognized/ certified at national and international level. The project will strengthen cooperation between all partners network by extending their activities and actions in the field of inclusion.

The project will take place between 1st September 2016 and 31st October 2018 and is aimed at representatives of local education centres, i.e. at the directors of these institutions and the teaching staff who give lessons to groups of learners aged 60+. The consortium has been structured to ensure that various local education facilities with a range of main strengths and focuses are involved as well as trans-regionally active associations.    The objective of Silver Learners is to improve the programme offered by education centres, taking into account the challenges of demographic change as well as the associated altered circumstances and education practices of senior citizens. The older generation needs to be provided with educational support to enable them to remain active members of society and face the challenges of growing old independently for as long as possible. In this context, the fields of media competence (using ICT and new technical resources) and health are regarded as being particularly significant.  In addition, it is essential to reach poorly educated target groups. Elderly people with a migration background, for instance, rarely attend education institutions.It is planned to communicate tried-and-tested education models from the various countries for improving the learning situation of the elderly and also to jointly develop and implement ideas and concepts. New, innovative educational concepts for the older generation are to be developed on the basis of the different experiences. Since, at present, the adult education centres are primarily attended by the so-called middle classes, the current objective is to focus on persons who have had fewer educational opportunities, including those with a migrant background.  This will entail analysing the motivation for learning as well as the options and the existing barriers to education. The project comprises six meetings of the project partners. The time between these meetings will be used for processing the results and disseminating and applying them locally as well as for preparing the next convention. The meetings of the partners are to be organised as workshops made up of presentations, dialogues in varying work groups, and excursions. The following issues are regarded as particularly crucial:- Competencies and learning abilities of the elderly and the consequent requirements on educational programmes;- Communication for and with senior citizens - How can the target groups be reached, in particular those that are not so well educated? How can the communication skills of older people be intensified (use of ICT, social networks, language, etc.)?- Further education for everyday life \u2013 How can the older generation be supported in their ICT-influenced daily lives (using a PC, online banking/shopping/booking)? How can new tools be made appropriate for elderly people?- Further education on health \u2013 Besides keeping healthy (sport, prevention) and new technical aids, this focuses mainly on dealing with age-related diseases such as dementia. The venues and thematic focuses of the meetings have been selected so as to ensure that the partners can best introduce their strengths into the discussion. Meetings are to be held in Iserlohn, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, Luxembourg, Bunnik, Stockport and Chorz\u00f3w. The first event will be organised as an introductory kick-off meeting. Then, after four content-related workshops, there will be a summarising wrap-up meeting at which future, more extensive, cooperative ventures are to be planned.Besides the specified aims, teaching staff will benefit from the project because their skills will be upgraded, especially regarding the interests of the elderly during lessons, the effective use of ICT, and the inclusion of health aspects. This will enable education centres to improve and expand what they offer and thus for attendees to commit to the institution.   Working together with familiar partners (town twinning, successful partnerships in other EU projects) will reinforce the networks and enable them to be redefined with the help of new partners. The project partners get to know other countries, embark on intercultural dialogues and expand their knowledge, including their linguistic skills. The project will be beneficial to society in Europe as well: well-educated, committed and health-conscious senior citizens face the effects accompanying age with greater confidence. In consequence, the growing generation of elderly people will be encouraged to play an active role in society. Thanks to the joint work of ten partners, the results of the project will be disseminated in numerous different regions and countries of Europe, thus making a major contribution towards added value in Europe.", "http://www.kilcooleywomenscentre.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA204-003327_2"], [2017, "Teaching Problem Solving in Technology Rich Environments", "Kilcooley Primary School", 122899.0, 4, 7, "Teaching Problem Solving in Technology Rich Environments\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that many students across Europe struggle with mathematical reasoning and problem solving.  \r\n\r\nThere are 7 partners.

Audio technologies and coding methods are as essential to the development of very high quality immersive and interactive 3D media as MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) has been to on-line music and streaming media. Sound is directional: the positioning of sound sources and the acoustics of the space are critical to the experience, impact and sense of presence.
