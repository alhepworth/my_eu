Previous research on these tropes has generally not used a transhistorical perspective, and transhistorical studies of literature have rarely included analyses of gender. The tropes are all based on an understanding of women as ancillary to men, as irrelevant and expendable. These are assumptions that are seemingly out of touch with modern society.

A 5% increase in the recovery factor would yield as much oil as is expected from all future exploration efforts.\n\nThe reason for low recovery rates is the breakthrough of water or gas in the well. The industry has addressed this by developing inflow control devices (ICD & AICD) that choke oil production both at start up and when gas or water incursion occurs; but do not stop these entering the system.\n\nOur innovative solution utilises the properties of fluid dynamics to create an Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV) that, whilst remaining simple in concept, eliminates the weaknesses of AICD and ICD products. By comparison, proof of concept tests on our AICV show it will increase recovery, does not choke initial oil production, can stop gas and water completely, is autonomous, reversible, reliable and price competitive.\n\nWe have established the concept, but still face significant technical challenges which we need to outsource to specialist R&D partners. These involve developing an innovative laminar flow element, filters and seals that can withstand the harsh environments in wells.\n\nREVIVAL enables our SME partnership to create a novel, highly differentiated, validated pre-production prototype that can be quickly commercialised post project completion, providing outstanding benefits for our own organisations, our oil company clients, national government exchequers and Europe as a whole.

With rising energy prices and greater focus on energy efficiency the building sector offers the single largest potential for energy savings.  This is reflected in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, 2002/91/EC. This Directive strongly encourages the use of passive heating and cooling techniques such as thermal mass in building construction and refurbishment. Passive techniques such as thermal mass offer the potential to save up to 50% of energy used in heating and cooling. However, there is a barrier to its effective implementation. In order for thermal mass to work effectively the concrete and brick surfaces must be in contact with ambient air and kept free of insulation, including conventional mineral wool type sound absorbers. The acoustics reverberations (echos) however caused by this can affect the health and work efficiency of inhabitants and in some severe cases rendering the building uninhabitable. Whilst there are some high end solutions to the problem, primarily thick polymer or metal panels, these are too expensive in all but high end applications. There is an urgent and growing need for a low cost, high performance acoustic absorber that allows thermal mass techniques to work effectively yet is at a price comparable to low end mineral wool solutions.

The rationale of the project is that young children are often excluded from access or participation in public spaces and that their democratic engagement is not only a right, but also an essential aspect of their identity and education and citizenship. We contend that there is a need to reconsider the use of public spaces to promote young children\u2019s citizenship, through a combination of voice with action that can lead to genuine participation, inclusion and belonging. Whilst the provision of preschool education and care has become well established in many European countries in recent years, one possible impact of the placing of young children in early childhood institutions is that they are less visible to the rest of society and the children have less opportunity to participate in public arenas and spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives of BRIC are to enable:\r\n\r\n\u2022 an exchange of \u2018good practice\u2019 between preschool teachers in three countries; \r\n\r\n\u2022 systematic education and training around democratic engagement in public spaces;\r\n\r\n\u2022 the development of open educational resources and targeted activities to engage early childhood professionals, parents, the local community and key stakeholders, including local politicians and representatives from business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BRIC project will involve 6 preschool teachers who will lead the project with 60 teachers in each of the following three countries; England, Italy and Sweden (total of 180 preschool teachers and approximately 750 families). Key stakeholders such as parents, local politicians and business people will also be invited to participate in the project. It is anticipated that this group will involve around 30 people in each country (total of 90).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA systematic and progressive programme of civic engagement is planned, starting from the dialogue between children, preschool teachers and parents in three countries (Italy, Sweden and the UK). The BRIC activities involve the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set up Activities \u2013 to include training in Participatory Action Research (PAR) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Orientation and initial activities in Preschools\r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus group documentation exchange and reflection\r\n\r\n\u2022 Local and transnational exchange, documentation and reflection\r\n\r\n\u2022 Forums and national conferences\r\n\r\n\u2022 A range of dissemination activities including webinars and wider dissemination through the project website and social media\r\n\r\n\u2022 An International Conference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overarching design of the project is participatory action research (PAR) with children and preschool teachers. PAR involves working with children and preschool teachers to define an aspect for improvement (use of public space), design a change to address the issue and evaluate the success of the change. In particular, the \u2018poly-vocal\u2019 method (Tobin, Wu and Davidson 1989; Tobin, Hsueh, and Karasawa 2009) will be used in order to elicit children\u2019s and practitioners\u2019 perspectives using video film to record discussion, reflection and documentation about the public spaces. This visual data will then be shared between practitioners in each country and then between the three countries to enable deeper reflection and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is intended that dialogue, reflection and documentation undertaken by preschool teachers, informed by regional and national dissemination and participation in transnational exchange will impact on practice in preschools and enhance civic engagement. The results of the BRIC model will therefore inform pedagogy and professional development in the field of early childhood education through:\r\n\r\n\u2022 the establishment of Permanent Open Forums\r\n\r\n\u2022 maintenance of the website\r\n\r\n\u2022 conference presentations\r\n\r\n\u2022 evolving practice in preschools\r\n\r\n\u2022 a project Documentation Centre \r\n\r\n\u2022 the production of Case studies and pedagogical documentation for use for reflection by practitioners. These will be in the form of video and written vignettes published online and in hard copy.\r\n\r\n\u2022 publications at local, regional and international level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIC will forge crucial links between children, practitioners and policy makers, offering the potential for significant benefits to the civic engagement of young children and the transformation of practice in early childhood education. Practitioners will increase their knowledge and skills through participation in webinars and workshops and attendance at conferences, increasing their appreciation of the advantages of evidence based practice, and greater knowledge of the impact of the significance of young children\u2019s democratic involvement in public spaces.
