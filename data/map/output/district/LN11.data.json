The requirements for sorting and segregation of polymer types within waste streams are intensifying - more stringent targets for recycling are forcing recyclers to segregate more difficult materials that they could formerly lose as scrap; increased volumes and high labour costs force the industry to reduce manual segregation and increase shredding; this requires more automation of sorting facilities; producer regulations increase the responsibility for the supply side to ensure identifiability of the materials they provide, through to the point of recycling.  Automated sorting operations are all based on Near Infra-Red spectroscopy, which can rapidly recognize the NIR signature of different polymers, and activate sorting equipment to segregate the polymer types.  NIR is the only technique that is fast enough, powerful enough and robust enough to be usable on a recycling line.  BUT the NIR technique fails to \u201csee\u201d black materials and some colours, because the carbon black pigment used also absorbs the NIR beam and prevents the reflection of the polymer\u2019s characteristic spectrum back to the sensor.  This project, based on our successful previous work, will develop a range of \u201cNIR transparent\u201d alternatives to carbon black, to enable the NIR sorting operations to segregate black and coloured plastic where they have been unable to before, to a purity that will be usable in high value recycled engineering polymers. We will base our market entry strategy on a \u201cspiral economy\u201d approach, where the packaging industry uses virgin detectable polymer to make their packaging, and this, with its product life of under one year, is recycled into high quality engineering plastics for the manufacturers of automotive and consumer durables to use without waiting for returns from their own end-of-life materials.", 411038.0, 1294579.0, 3, 3, "NIRSort", null, null, null, "h2020_210847_952281690"], [1480550400000, 1496188800000, "A new  process for removal of odour from Post Consumer Waste Polymer for non-food applications \u2013 ODEX", "Luxus Ltd", "Although much progress has been made in recycling the easier polymer streams such as at-line production waste, or through specialist closed loop systems, the challenge to recycle Post Consumer polymer waste (mainly packaging from consumer goods such as food, sauces and detergents) is still strong, particularly for polypropylene and polyethylene.  These polymers strongly absorb odours from their contents, and form musty taints due to bacterial action in the waste stream, which currently needs uneconomic levels of cleaning before they can be recycled into high value products such as automotive fascias and building products.  \nOf all of the post consumer polypropylene waste produced, under 1% is recycled into high quality products; the rest is used in low value applications such as buried geotextiles, or is landfilled or incinerated. The ODEX process concept from Luxus, a recycling compounder for automotive plastics, has been specifically created to provide a cost effective method to deodourise polymers for higher value uses; it uses only the existing heat energy from the compounding process to drive the odourous compounds out of carefully designed pellets within a continuous at-line process.  This project is intended to validate the feasibility of the process and formulate a business plan, to underpin our future objectives of scaling it up to commercial application.  The future embodiment of the technology is envisaged as a turnkey or retrofit option for Luxus and other existing compounders as licencees, allowing them to provide high quality polymers from materials that would otherwise have been destined for landfill or incineration.", 42579.0, 60827.0, 1, 1, "Odex", null, null, null, "h2020_206787_952281690"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "LUXUS LIMITED*", 408323.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_23181"]]}}, "8SW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Development of MFL through International CPD", "Grimoldby Primary School", 9175.0, 1, 1, "Context: Grimoldby Primary School is located in a rural area of Lincolnshire, geographically remote and culturally remote from the European or Global dimension which is so significant for schools today. This presents a significant challenge in helping the young people at the school to develop appreciation and respect for other cultures. International collaboration and foreign language development are key strategies for helping this to happen.\r\n\r\nObjectives: This project will help us do a number of things which link to our school development priorities:\r\nTo Improve the quality of teaching in French across the school to ensure children make rapid progress in their understanding of French language and culture.\r\nTo raise the profile and quality of our spoken and written French.\r\nTo improve the leadership of MFL in school (as per our Ofsted area for improvement).\r\nTo develop children's respect for a different European culture.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: We plan to send three KS2 teachers each year with the aim of building up their proficiency over time. All being well they will move up a tuition level in the second year\r\n\r\nDescription of activities: The core activity each year will be attending a course in Antibes. However, we expect that the participants will be working on developing their skills before, between and after these weeks in France. We would expect them to be developing an eTwinning link with a francophone territory, possibly building on an existing connection with Guadeloupe but also with mainland France which might offer options for reciprocal school visits in the future\r\n\r\nMethodology: improvement of the teachers' speaking, listening, reading and writing skills in French through formal tuition in France, and their own team learning. The headteacher will be keen to hear of their individual initiatives in developing their skills, A local grammar school, King Edwards VI, Louth, will be able to offer support to both the teachers and their young learners\r\n\r\nResults and impact: I believe this training programme in particular will be the catalyst for school improvement in our understanding of French, our appreciation of a different culture and our curiosity about life in other parts of the world. We plan to send six members of staff over a two year period to an immersive French Language Training Centre to develop their confidence, skill and understanding in teaching French to our children. They will bring a deeper respect and appreciation of the language and culture to our community which we expect to spread to our children and thereafter our families.\r\n\r\nPotential longer-term benefits: In addition, by helping the subject leader develop in confidence, they will be able to drive forward real change in this subject over a long period.", "http://grimoldbyschool.net/", "Grimoldby Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046736_coordinator"]]}}}}
