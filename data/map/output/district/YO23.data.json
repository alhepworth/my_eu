Formal and non formal learning will be recorded and accredited through Europass Certification and Language passport. As an organisation we would hope that the legacy of the transnational partnership will be carried out forward and continued past the end of the project. This activity will also meet the college strategic international plan and it will provide outstanding opportunities to engage stakeholders in updated and current practices and introduce the European dimension in the college community. \r\nThe project outcomes and experiences will be shared with our Partners Schools in York and North Yorkshire and our host partners in Spain to allow them to benefit from findings and best practices.", "http://www.yorkcollege.ac.uk", "York College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012577_coordinator"], [2015, "Rud mobilitetsprosjekt 2015", "York College", 55458.0, 2, 2, "Rud High School is abbreviated as RVG and York College as YC.\r\nDuring this first year with Erasmus+ funds there has taken place a fundamental development for both students and teachers who have been involved in the project. The students have increased their worth in the job market and we wish therefore to expand our cooperation to include Electricity and Electronics studies in addition to Healthcare. We have established a good working relationship with YC, which is famous for its prize-winning systems and good results. In the exchange period the students get to know new educational methods, live with host families and get to meet new people. This increases their self-confidence, which in turn increases their ability to take the initiative. They improve their language skills, which increases their intercultural awareness. RVG finds that our school has become more popular and parents seek more information about other exchange opportunities in vocational training. Our organization gets noticed and we experience a growing interest from other schools, parents and teachers. The exchange programme has given us the chance to improve quality development and competence in the subject. That is why we see the need to strengthen our cooperation with other countries and the EU.\r\n\r\nRVG is seeking funds for 8 students in Skin Care (Healthcare) for the whole second year (Vg2). We are seeking funds for 12 students in the Skin Care course and 12 students in Electricity and Electronics for a period of two weeks during the second year (Vg2). We are also seeking funds for two teachers in Skin Care responsible for health promotion work and practical vocational work, two teachers in Electricity and Electronics Power Current and Low Voltage, in addition to two representatives from the professional electicity and electronics trade organization . Project coordinator Kari Gr\u00f8nli wishes to be present for shorter and longer periods in order to plan and develop the cooperation further. RVG wishes to establish a solid foundation for European cooperation. This can improve students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 competence in working with innovative methods in a competitive job market together with school and business.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to increase interest for vocational studies at our school and to improve our educational product and make it more competitive in the job market. Our aim is to facilitate the introduction and use of innovative educational methods in cooperation with RVG and YC. The aim is also to increase intercultural and language understanding and promotes a closer cooperation between the school and the business community. \r\n\r\nYC has facilitated the use of module-based lessons. Students who are on exchange for shorter periods go through a module or part of one. Digital tools are employed in teaching and social media are used both for communication and marketing purposes to promote the exchange programme. After having passed all the modules the students who are on exchange for the whole second year (Vg2) take a final interdisciplinary test identical to the one at RVG. In practical training at school the students will be given subject-related tasks. Teachers at RVG have in cooperation with YC agreed on specific educational modules and wish to be present during parts of this process. This will give the schools the opportunity to develop innovative educational methods which will form the foundation for a more robust joint educational course. The students take part in trade exhibitions that keep them and their teachers up to date in their field. We see this as very important in ensuring quality development, enabling new discoveries while forming the foundation for promoting entrepreneurial skills and innovation in the subject. Students and teachers also take part in cultural activities, concerts and excursions to cities and the surrounding area, which all contribute toward intercultural understanding.\r\n\r\nRVG feels this project will provide inspiration to work towards an innovative and sustainable development in the trade for both students and teachers, in addition to contributing to make the students more competitive in the job market. The students have increased their self-confidence and make their own choices based on their experiences during this exchange programme. \r\nRecruitment to vocational subjects in our region is in decline, even as society\u2019s demand for qualified craftsmen is increasing. We wish therefore to use this project to increase motivation for vocational development and recruitment to the trades. We hope that more vocational courses can take part of their education abroad and plan to expand our cooperation with YC in that respect, as well as looking towards other countries and partners. We want to contribute to the development of innovative projects that can strengthen recruitment to vocational subjects while also consolidating the cooperation between countries in Europe and heighten competence levels in these subjects.", "http://www.yorkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NO01-KA102-013125_1"], [2016, "European Mobility for Teachers in Akershus (EMTA)", "York College", 54701.0, 3, 3, "The background for this project is an initiative in Akershus called \"Den gode akershusskolen (Dga)\". In brief Dga is about improving students' skills through a professionalisation of all levels of upper secondary education in Akershus. One of the main intitiatives is the \"professionalisation of teachers' through incorporating common core competencies and common attitudes in the upper secondary schools of Akershus. To \"have a culture of sharing of good practice\" and to be \"able to reflect upon their own teaching\" is among the core competencies expected of the teachers in the Akershus schools. We believe a relevant contribution to achieving these goals will be to have teachers complete staff mobility activities. The project involves sending 60 teachers from seven of the 34 upper secondary schools in Akershus on staff mobility activities in various European countries. Akershus County Council has formed a \"consortium\" of these seven secondary schools. The activities consist mainly of job shadowing at a partner school and participation in structured courses, in addition to some who will teach at a partner school abroad. The activities last from three days to one month and will take place at partner schools and professional course organisers in various European countries. The teachers will be representing disciplines such as history, foreign languages, social sciences and Norwegian.We want the teachers who participate in the project to be more reflected towards their own and others' teaching practice in addition to: - gain insight into other schools assessment practices- discover a variety of forms of teacher-student collaboration - examine how teachers and school management can gain results together - achieve up to date skills within their disciplines - be more motivated and knowledgeable staff that can spread good practice in their own school and in the county as a whole- achieving an interest in international cooperation We expect that this leads to a general increased awareness and openness about teaching and other relevant topics at each school. We also believe it can have a positive effect towards internationalisation and that it can lead to increased international activity by the schools involved. Ultimately this will benefit the pupils. Having motivated, dedicated, skilled, knowledgeable and updated teachers is the best starting point for pupils to learn more, to have more pupils complete upper secondary education and a high quality of the teaching, which are all among the main strategic goals we are working towards in upper secondary education in Akershus.", "http://www.yorkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA101-021979_1"], [2014, "Rud mobilitetsprosjekt", "York College", 40220.0, 2, 2, "Background \r\n\r\nTo improve and develop the field of skin care at Rud High School, we have wanted to find a partner school outside of Norway. York College seemed as a natural choice, as they already successfully work with other Norwegian schools and have the necessary expertise to satisfy the requirements of the Norwegian authorities. We believe that studying at a foreign school with different methods, living in homestay families and getting to know new people will have a huge, positive impact on young vocational students. To strengthen the development of the skills and continues development of competence and quality, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation with other countries and EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from Rud High School have visited York College on a number of occasions. We have had with us groups of students to enable them to take part in the study of Skin Care for a few days at a time. This has involved them working side by side with local students both in practical and theoretical classes. They have also met and dealt with members of the public who come in to college for treatment from students under guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is that students and teachers from Rud High School gain insight into how other schools facilitate a training in the discipline of Skin Care, while the students have the opportunity to learn other methods of learning and other methods and types of therapy than we have the opportunity to teach and practice at our school. There are a larger number of students at York College, more teachers with expertise in the field, and smaller classes where the teacher has the opportunity to provide individual guidance. An English language based collaboration with a UK college like York also gives our pupils and teachers the chance to acquire experience in working with students from many other countries all over the world. This will give the students a broader understanding of culture across national boundaries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRud High School aims to offer this program to four students each year who complete their first year in the field of Health and Social Care at first year level (VG1). The intention is that students from all over the County of Akershus seeking this opportunity can apply to Rud do a year in York.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested Plan of Action\r\n\r\nStudents from Rud High School will be integrated into classes with other local students. This includes the teaching of theory and involves taking modular exams for each subject on a par with local students. Digital tools are being used in the classrooms teaching and in connection with projects and exams.  After all modules are passed, the students take an interdisciplinary examination which will be conducted in the same manner as in Norway. Students also participate in practical work where they conduct subject-related treatments on students and clients. In addition to the program at York College, students also participate in trade shows in the UK that help them to keep up to date on the latest research and innovations in the field. It is considered important to preserve quality improvements, new discoveries and development and stimulate entrepreneurial skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers from Rud High School will visit York College several times a year to monitor their students and to lay the ground for further cooperation and development of the project.  Trips are organized and are designed to give students a broader picture of modern society, including cultural and social developments, and an understanding of historical background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\n\r\nThe skills and knowledge acquired through this year will give students the opportunity to continue in their final year (VG3) at Rud High School.  The study year abroad will have given them insights into another culture and notably into different styles of teaching and learning and sustainability. Their ability to communicate in English will have been considerably improved, providing them with a broader base both professionally, but also in general social and cross-cultural terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential long-term plans\r\n\r\nRecruitment to professions in the field of Health and Social Care in Norway is declining, while the need in the community continues to increase. We hope that the program we are developing may increase the recruitment of Skin Care students. In addition we believe that this program can facilitate a lasting partnership between the two educational institutions concerned.

In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as health promoting work in schools, welfare technology, civil entrepreneurship, broader understanding of practices and systems in VET, as well as cooperation between VET and enterprises. \r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to strengthen the region through the acquisition of professional knowledge and expertise, develop new skills and competences, to develop prosperous local communities, improve learning outcomes for VET learners, increase recruitment and the number of VET learners finishing with a trade certificate. In addition to professional competences, it is expected that the project will increase foreign language and intercultural competences, as well as motivate participants to take part in and develop other international projects in the future. This mobility project will have both short and long term effects. It will make it possible to implement and disseminate new and innovative tools and methods to a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. It will also strengthen the quality of education and training, and the region will be able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the needs of both the individual and the region. This will further increase the status and the attractiveness of VET.\r\nThe HCC writes the mobility application on behalf of its sending organisations, and is the coordinator for the project. The HCC has extensive experience in project cooperation and management through different EU projects (LLP, Interreg) and is well qualified to carry out this mobility project. Coordination and quality management are based on strong and long term cooperation with partner organisations in Hordaland and Europe. The HCC is involved in all aspects of project development and implementation for each of the mobility projects included in this application. To ensure the quality of the project, the HCC facilitates a number of activities throughout the project period, such as mobilising potential sending organisations, arranging information sessions, seminars and workshops, help with project development, preparation of participants, and dissemination of results.

Trainees will undertake a two week traineeship in either animal management studies or wood occupations. Trainees and staff working in the field of Animal Management will spend their placement in either the Netherlands or Malta and their training will be based in a Donkey sanctuary, or a Cat Sanctuary with opportunities to undertake activities in an Ostrich Farm and/or a National Park.  For those staff and trainees who are undertaking studies or training in the field of wood occupation and carpentry, their placement may be in Sweden or Portugal in one of three fields, in carpentry, in restoration, or in joinery, three distinct areas giving participants a different experience and different learning opportunities. Placements will be tailored to the individual participants needs and may include activities in one or more of these areas. \r\n\r\nParticipants taking part in Go Further Reach Higher will be individuals from the UK based in VET institutions who have experienced social exclusion, come from poor socio-economic backgrounds, were early school leavers or have additional support needs. They will be accompanied on mobility experiences with professionals who will aid their travel, support their integration into the host environment and engage in both training and free-time activities with them.

As described in the Copenhagen Declaration, the economic and social development in Europe over the past decade has also emphasized the need for a European dimension in education and training. International cooperation between educational institutions and industry will help strengthen the innovation and competitiveness of the county, and we see an increasing need for our pupils and apprentices - as future workers - to participate in European cooperation that can help find new solutions to our common challenges.\r\n\r\nThis project was initiated by More & Romsdal County Authority, and consist of a partnership between the Educational Department in the County Authority, five upper secondary schools, one vocational college, three vocational training agencies in the county, and elleven different partner organisations in Germany, Denmark, France, Finland, Spain, the UK, and on \u00c5land.

The  global trend of urbanisation brings new challenges on food production and processing, and the needs of the citizens. Today's citizens acquire safe food and water, food quality and origin of the products are of major importance. The ANNIE network has as underlying goal to establish Aquaponics Training Centres in which all kind of target groups will be trained on any EQF level. The target groups Aquaponics focus on are youth, unemployed youngsters (up to 27), disabled people who are not easily placed in the labour market, the lifelong learners - with qualification EQF 2, immigrants and career changers. Working in Aquaponics requires both high tech skills and hands on labour. The partners in this project are from different European areas with potential needs. Spain, Greece and Portugal because of the lack of fresh water, Romania, Portugal and Slovenia to develop their rural areas and UK and the Netherlands as knowledge-based economies and too much (dirty) water, which should be  re-used more sustainable.Education play an important role in these new developments, because they teach the workers of the future and make them aware of the food problems of the future.The main goal of this project is to expand a network  with educational institutions and farmers interested in aquaponics production and local governments which are aware of the ecologic and economic advantages of the system of aquaponics. Not only agricultural subjects are relevant in aquaponics, there are many cross overs. Water technology and innovative, sustainable breeding techniques need new curricula. In this ANNIE project we would like to increase the network in which education, farmers (business) and governments work together collectively  to raise awareness what to do about the enormous changes as a result of the water scarcity, technical revolutions and consumer requirements until 2050. Education have to change into international knowledge centres and with this project we will investigate opportunities of Aquaponics Training Centres, where students, young and elder, acquire knowledge and skills and competences to set up an aquaponics business themselves, to become the providers of fresh and healthy food locally. Entrepreneurial attitude will be promoted. Aquaponics give people the opportunity to start their own business with small investments. Aquaponics is the food production technique for the future, scholars say; it means there is a big market open for all sorts of activities around it.Aquaponics create jobs in all EQF levels and cross over sectors. The food sector in which Aquaponics will be part of has a tremendous challenge for the future to feed all inhabitants of the world in coming 40 years, as more than 50% of the world population lives in urban areas and aquaponics becomes a part of the food supply on small scale but close to the consumers. Fresh food, fish and vegetables are available everywhere where an aquaponics system is working.  For these new way of thinking to produce food on an effective, but sustainable way green education needs to change their curricula in the future and that only happens when the market ( business and local governments) is involved to change the curricula. And this network partners are very much aware of the things that need to change to feed the next generation as good as today! This network can help to establish an optional part of the green curricula or as a new course for the lifelong learning programs of the institutions.Outcomes of ANNIE: All partners  test the dimensional cross sector cooperation between triple helix partners in their own region- in every national network all three sections of the triple helix are represented and all of them have contributed at least one good practice- 6 good practices from the educational partner institutions implemented/used abroad;- 6 good practices of business partners watched/covered in the project;- 2 good practices of the governmental partners; (Rijnmond/Rotterdam and Murcia)- 8 new relationships from the triple helix in the network;- 4 guest lecturers implemented;- 5 field visits organised.- 30 student exchanges and practical placements from the educational partnersThe most important result of ANNIE will be the commitment of the triple helix partners in each region to continue in the next phase, to implement the good practices of this project in a new to established Aquaponics Training Centres, in joint ventures to pave new roads for youngsters in the ever fast changing European labour market.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA202-023006_5"], [2015, "\u00d6kad kvalitet i yrkesutbildningen genom internationell praktik", "Askham Bryan College", 69657.0, 4, 4, "The project aims to give students, in the first place from the second year at J\u00e4llagymnasiet, the opportunity to make one of their on the job training periods in another European country, to develop professionally and personally skills.

We will primarily choose teachers who teach groups of students where there are many pupils who are not demotivated to work with theoretical subjects, who are struggling to achieve a passing grade in at least one of these subjects, but who still have got the spirit and interest of learning more practical oriented subjects. In addition the teachers that will be selected for the project should be motivated to develop their ways of teaching and have language skills that are good enough to learn from a job shadowing where the working language is English. This implies that participants should be curious of new ways to organize teaching, willing to learn and to share experiences with colleagues and thus contribute to the spread of results from the project. It is a pre for the projects if some of the participants  teach both theoretical and practical subjects. \r\n\r\nThe partner schools are selected because they care for, and to some extent have experience in working with similar issues, and because they want to work on and develop a better connection between vocational subjects and more theoretical subjects, and because they use exercises and examples from the practical subjects when teaching more theoretical subjects\r\nThe main activities will be job shadowing of teacher colleagues in England, Denmark and Menorca and to reflect on the experience and the need of developing new methods for the teaching  with  colleagues at their own school and at school where job shadowing is carried out. \r\n\r\nExpected results will be renewed teaching practices with better customized training and use of work-relevant tasks and teaching material in the common core subjects within the Programme for Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing. Hopefully long term effect will be that students see the benefits of learning the common subjects and that they find them more motivating and easier to learn. In the end lead we expect that more students achieve a passing grade and that fewer drop out of secondary education.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NO01-KA101-013133_3"], [2016, "BI2K - Bitburg to UK", "Askham Bryan College", 7628.0, 2, 3, "The European Vocational Training Centre (Europ\u00e4isches Berufsbildungswerk) Bitburg is an international institution for the vocational rehabilitation, according to \u00a735 of the German Code of Social Law IX. Young people who have a handicap - which is of a nature or gravity that makes special advancement necessary  in order to be able to successfully finish a vocational training \u2013 have a legal right to claim a vocational measure in a \u201cBerufsbildungswerk\u201d.The promoting organization of the Euro-BBW is the German Red Cross Rhineland-Palatinate. The Euro-BBW offers vocational orientation and training for ca. 250 young adults with (impending) mental disorder and/or physical disability, from Germany and the neighbouring countries like Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Netherlands.ObjectivesObjectives of the project BI2K are new professional stimuli and concepts by offering work shadowing to staff members. Knowledge of the work culture, labour market and training system of another European country will in turn lead to a quality improvement in training.Other aims are the improvement of intercultural competences, the enhancement of learning motivation and the improvement of English language skills. This should strengthen open-mindedness concerning other cultures and the ability to take the broader view.Within the context of the inclusion debate it is indispensable for staff of a European specialist training institution like the Euro-BBW to be informed about the practice of inclusion as well as inclusive didactical methods in other European countries, in order to be able to make use of the results. Undoubtedly the internationalisation of labour markets more and more requires intercultural competences and foreign language skills. MeasuresIn order to reach these goals, the Euro-BBW wants to allow for its staff members to learn abroad in the framework of the project BI2K.In 2016 and probably also in 2017, the Euro-BBW will send four staff members to the Isle of Wight College, Askham Bryan College and Newton Rigg College for work shadowing.A more intense exchange of good practice with our British partners is planned, too. The isle of Wight College will apply for a similar project to send staff members to the Euro-BBW, and Askham Bryan is planning for an exchange with the Euro-BBW in the near future. The participants will be chosen three months before travelling during an application process in the Euro-BBW, and they will be trained systematically in intercultural matters as well as concerning their language skills. Staff members will be employed in matching areas of the colleges. There will be a cultural program on offer during the whole stay.Expected ResultsThe Euro-BBW mainly expects the following results and effects of the project  BI2K:- enhancement of didactical competences - knowledge of corporate procedures on a foreign labour market- practical knowledge of a different, European rehabilitation system- improvement and enlargement of the Euro-BBW\u2019s  cooperation network- improvement of intercultural competences - improvement of foreign language skills - enhancement of motivation- enhancement of  mobility- enhancement of tolerance concerning foreignness- enhancement of toleranceIn the long run staff members will integrate best-practice approaches from other European countries into their teaching and leisure activities at the Euro-BBW.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002984_2"]]}}}}
