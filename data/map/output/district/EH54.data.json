The main advantage of diffusion bonding is that, unlike welding, it is not a 'fusion' process \u2013 it is a solid state process and the parent materials to be joined do not need to be melted. This makes diffusion bonding an ideal solution for joining materials such as metals to ceramics and Aluminium, Titanium, Nickel, Steel etc.\n\nOther advantages include near-parent properties, minimal shape change to parts and no post-finishing. The key to successful diffusion bonding lies in choosing process conditions which are appropriate to the circumstances, because the joint needs to form successfully with both parent materials, whilst controlling deformation. Joint intimacy and cleanliness are also critical factors.\n\nA reliable NDE method is required for the inspection of the bonds. A non-satisfactory bonding may include voids that will have a negative effect of the integrity of the joint. The challenge in inspecting these bonds is that the joining process will create a multi-layered structure that will complicate the interpretation of the inspection data. In addition to this, the bonding layer will have an irregular surface making most inspection techniques unsuitable.\n\nIt is anticipated that this issue can be solved by developing a phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method and Full Matrix Capture (FMC), that combined with a material-based model of the multi-layered structure will give an assessment of the diffusion bonding. The model and the tailored inspection data will then be used in signal processing algorithms to extract features of the bonding layer.

The new concept utilises the benefits of the high capacity, next generation, few-mode/multi-core fiber infrastructures, providing also a practical short term solution, since it is directly applicable over the currently installed multi-fibre cable links. The realisation of INSPACE approach is enabled by the development of novel multi-dimensional spatial-spectral switching nodes, which are fabricated by extending the designs of the existing flexible WSS nodes, incorporating advance mode/core adapting techniques.

Integrated blended learning materials will be produced which can be used throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that since the lingua franca will be English. During the transnational visits the students will be communicating their ideas on school, local, national and European themes in English. The approach will be purely content based as the communication will be on subjects of policy making.\r\n\r\nAll in all this project will offer all interested parties in the school; from school management to parent and from teachers to students the opportunity to gain a greater insight into and understanding of education in other parts of Europe and the communities in which they operate. The issuing discussions and the wider cultural and physical exchange in general will stimulate mutual understanding of the nature of European citizenship and European unity.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFinal note:\r\n\r\nThe training sessions will occur during the transnational visits, so no further costs will be incurred above paying the trainers fees.\r\nAll short-term learning/teaching/training/activities will take place  during transnational visits.

The main output of this objective will be the creation of teaching materials and compilation through a publication in the form of a book which can be used by teachers in a horizontal manner to enhance the curriculum across all subjects.\r\n\r\nCapacity building for teaching/training\r\n\r\nWe want to achieve this objective and can measure its success through the number of young people partners have supported into entrepreneurship. We plan to achieve this by using disparate approaches to overcome the main barriers to Entrepreneurship. We will engage teachers through activities, work camps, discussion, case studies. The work of the project will focus minds and require activity to be undertaken, which will push entrepreneurship up the agenda of all partner organisations. We will agree activities in each centre and use the results to shape future delivery of entrepreneurship programmes.\r\n\r\nCapacity Building for Learning\r\n\r\nBy introducing an internationalised and transversal approach we will work together to motivate and inspire young people to build their own business idea. We will use technology to engage them and introduce a competitive element to the process with the opportunity to work internationally and transversally with learners from partner organisations. The success of this objective will be measured through quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the learner experience.\r\n\r\nCreation of an Environment where entrepreneurs can flourish\r\n\r\nThe project team will set up an internet based platform for business ideas and has a clear strategy for disseminating the work of the project across all partner organisations and their networks. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe project team will develop support tools and group work including international work camps to support learners through their exciting journey to the world of work. Furthermore partners will undertake activity to embed this fostering approach across the whole curriculum of each partner organisation as the project progresses.\r\n\r\nWe will adapt PRINCE2 style methodology to break the project into its component parts and from there create work packages for each component.\r\nThe results can be measured in terms of improved job outcomes for learners and the physical outputs of the project in terms of the publication and web platform for business ideas.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on employment rates for leavers from partner organisations.

The college provides VET-programmes in the clusters of \u2019Human food\u2019 and \u2019Animals, plants and nature\u2019 + EUX + HTX (Higher Technical Examination).The justification of this project takes it starting point at the aim of the board at Kold College in order to strengthen its international profile and its international engagement by taking the initiative to carry out international project including mobility projects.  The strategic direction of the board of the college is based on the aims of the Copenhagen Declaration, which has been made plain in the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 and Education and Training 2020. There is a match between the strategic aims of internationalisation of the VET sector on a national level and international level and the aims set in the business- and actions plans of Kold College.  The board\u2019s perception of internationalisation is also based on needs and wishes among students and the related lines of business. The overall objective of this project is to realise demands of internationalisation made by the stakeholders of the college and by this to focus of the needs of the market. Further, the objective is to develop the students linguistically, culturally and personally so they develop new knowledge based on new practices. The objective is further that students when educated are able to move freely on the Single Market and that the capacity of teachers to work internationally is increased. The objective is to increase the quality and the transparency of VET education in such a way that it can be assessed and validated based on common European standards and in the rate that learning, which is achieved in one context, can be transferred to another.This project involves 78 VET students + 18 teachers from the educational areas: baker, chef, waiter, dairyman, farmer, gardener animal keeper and EUX (farmer, gardener, landscaper) + HTX students (International studies). The students, who are sent out in this project, already have achieved adequate competences prior to the stationing and have already completed lower- or higher secondary education. In this project students go to Portugal, Ireland, UK, Norway and Belgium. Suitable placements are identified by the partnership of the project. The 18 teachers are 3 for Staff training and 15 as Accompanying person.This project holds a number of activities, which are carried out in cycles, during the 2 years duration, with the following activities: Information and guidance of students, selection of students, who are matched with placements by the partnership abroad. Professional, cultural, and linguistic preparation of student. Arrangements of logistic matters and the student\u2019s training agreement i.e. training activities, practical and legal matters. A mentor arrangement is established in the hosting company and the stay is monitored, assessed and validated in line with Kold College\u2019s standards and the conventions of ECVET and EQF. Outcomes of validation are documented in the Danish portfolio system, Elevplan and Europass mobility pass.In order to increase the knowledge of the project results, a number of dissemination activities are carried out and targeted to the stakeholders of Kold College, which count college networks, local educational committees, youth guidance centres and other local and regional collaborators, teachers, the management and the board of Kold College, the students of the college and other national and international educational institutions. The dissemination of the result of the project is done by using the website of the college, its Facebook profile, APPs, Intranet and video spots at the college, articles in local press etc. Further, dissemination is done in a number of meeting forums with stakeholders like meetings with teachers, managers, the board of directors, the board, the students\u2019 school council and the audience of the annual international EFVET conference for the VET sector.

We sent in total 11 students from our Vehicle and Transport Programme at LK to YCC and local workshops where the students had a two week period of vocational training. Since it was a success, except for the fact that YCC was not granted any fundings, we now want to move on and hopefully bring along a similar project but where a real exchange will take place. We found our project partner, WLC, Livingston, Scotland, through our branch organisation's homepage and we have already cooperate and our relations are well established by now. We have already visited each other's organisations and we feel that we have a joint foundation to build on. The profile of the participants are in all 16 year 2 students at the Vehicle and Transport Programme. The 16 students are chosen through an application process based on personal letters and interviews. The main activities are to send two groups of students of 8 at a time to our project partner WLC in Scotland. The participants will undergo two weeks' of vocational training at local garages, have a brief look of the organisation of WLC, stay in host families and participate in social and cultural events.  Our hopes are that WLC are able to get fundings in order to send 16 students to LK and workplace based training, with host accomodation and social/cultural events. The methodology used is to offer all year 2 students at the Vehicle and Transport Programme at LK the possibility to apply, then project administrators together with automotive staff and principal will choose participants. Staff from LK will accompany the participants on the trip and during the first day of vocational training. WLC is responsible for placing our students in host families and local garages. Students will be supervised and monitored by a tutor at the local garage as well as WLC staff. The monitoring is based on skills documents constructed by LK automotive staff. To ensure that this project is going to be successful we applied for local grants during spring 2014. This enabled us to pay WLC a visit as well as inviting them for a return visit before the end of 2014. Through these meetings we feel that we have a strong foundation to build on when it comes to future cooperation between LK and WLC concerning this and future projects.The expected results are: - A positive development of quality and internationalisation concerning the Vehicle and Transport Programme and the organisation at LK and within KSGYF as a whole.- Enhanced and improved language learning for students as well as staff. - Improved cultural awareness for the participants. - Increased self-esteem for the participants. - Better possibilities for employability and mobility in the future. The desired results are as the expected results above. Added to this our hopes are that the future projects will spread among other programmes at LK. We also hope that a mutual understanding concerning the importance of internationalisation could grow among staff and management at KSGYF. For keeping a wider international perspective in mind an international development plan for KSGYF as a whole would be an important tool in the future. Furthermore, our hopes are that technical will play a more important part of English eduation in the future. In a longer term international projects should be seen as a natural part of education within KSGYF. In order to establish this it might also have to be part of the organisation\u2019s budget.  Our hopes and beliefs are that the outcome of this project will coincide with the specific educational goals of Erasmus+:- We believe that the students' key competences and level of vocational skills will be improved through their two weeks' of vocational training in Scotland. - Improve the level of quality and internationalisation at the Vehicle and Transport Programme at LK and to strengthen the level of quality and internationalisation throughout our organisation as a whole. - To establish an extended form of exchange with WLC and hopefully involve other programmes at WLC as well as at LK. - Support lifelong learning, from a vocational as well as individual perspective.- Improve language education and learning.  - Improve consciousness concerning intercultural awareness.  The main objectives of our project are: - Achieve an improved learning performance through a better awareness of their own education.- Enhanced employability through a certificate which verifies the experience of vocational training in a foreign country. - Increased self-esteem by successfully being part of the exchange. - Improved foreign language competence by using everyday/technical English in a natural enviroment.  - Better motivation for using English skills.  - Enhanced intercultural awareness.", "http://www.west-lothian.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA102-012202_1"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "West Lothian College", 18721.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.west-lothian.ac.uk", "West Lothian College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046854_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "West Lothian College", 17540.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.west-lothian.ac.uk", "West Lothian College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035986_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "West Lothian College", 16731.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.west-lothian.ac.uk", "West Lothian College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023156_coordinator"], [2014, "F\u00f6rderung von F\u00e4higkeiten und Fertigkeiten durch einen englischsprachigen berufsbezogenen   \r\nAustausch", "West Lothian College", 12373.0, 2, 2, "The project \"Improving skills and competencies through an international vocational exchange in English\" aims at improving the quality of teaching and outcomes for teenagers facing difficulties in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Berufkolleg f\u00fcr Technik und Gestaltung is a college of further education in Gelsenkirchen.

Typical losses vary between 15% and 25% of the potential yield, but reductions of up to 50% were estimated in seasons when weather conditions were poor prior to and during harvest. A reduction in the tendency of pods to opening is the number one trait sought by farmers and would serve to increase the proportion of the yield recovered by the combine harvester and thereby improve production efficiency and sustainability of OSR as alternative food and energy source.
