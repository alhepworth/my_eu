More than 60 million containers are handled in the main EU ports alone. These containers are forwarded by rail, sea or road transport. The transport sector provides more than ten million jobs and generates 10% of EU wealth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to about one trillion Euros a year. Huge savings can be made for the SMEs in the transport sector by securing delivery time and place, improving the capacity utilisation of containers and reducing theft. A project focusing on electronic container security demonstrated savings of $378 to $462 per container per shipment due to improved monitoring of container movement and tampering attempts. The idea is to develop a tracking and security system with energy source and energy generation to be retrofitted in containers to enable tracking and security independently of fixed check point installations and satellite navigation systems. The supply chain will enjoy benefits from lower shrinkage and increased efficiency. The system will meet demands for increased security in the supply chain and provides location information and protection against crime. The system will increase security against terrorist attacks as it will sense and report tampering attempts before arriving to any crowded place and the container can be halted to reduce potential impacts. The aim of the project is to develop a system utilising a combination of commercial transmitters and cell phone base stations for low power, low cost positioning. The navigation will be based on signal parameters and IDs from commercial transmitters and GSM base stations combined with information in a central data base. Obtaining the position of a GSM base station from the operator is expensive so a clever algorithm is our key element to establish our own data base of coordinates", 81072.0, 1275998.0, 4, 7, "TRACKBOCS", "http://www.trackbocs.com/", "http://www.arbelelectronics.co.uk", null, "fp7_97845_998045611"], [1251763200000, 1314748800000, "Microwave Cleaning of Drilling Mud and Oil Containing Hazardous Waste", "Arbel Electronics Ltd", "Currently around 70 oil and gas exploration/production rigs drill in the North Sea and approximately 240 floating drilling rigs operate in the global industry. Totally there are several thousand drilling rigs where approximately 2400 rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in North America. Drilling processes are lubricated by a viscous oil/water invert emulsion known as drilling mud. Although Water Based Muds, (WBM), mostly are used in the top hole sections, down in the drilling/bore holes where temperatures can reach 200\u00baC, the mud used is still Oil Based Muds,( OBM) (mixture of 45% oil, 45% water and additives) or Synthetic Based Muds (SBM). The waste from the drilling process is a heavy sludge of rock, clay, sand and drilling mud (oil and brine). In 2004 the total amount cuttings from OBM and SBM generated on the Norwegian Shelf was nearly 250 000 tonnes cuttings and 45 000 tonnes drilling oil brought onshore. Recent operations in sensitive regions in the Barents sea even requires that WBM cannot be dumped and must be treated on-shore.  From 2003 and onwards Western European countries are expected to spend on average between 0.5% to 1.5% of GDP on soil remediation in primarily the agricultural sector, industrial plants, land development and municipalities. In Western Europe there are more than 600,000 contaminated sites with a market of about \u20ac 50 billion p.a.  A threshold of 0.1% Oil Content (OC) on landfill for drilling muds was established by the EU Revised European Waste Catalogue of 2002. This requires development of new technology to meet the requirements in a cost efficient manner as current state of the art solutions are either cost prohibitive or do not meet the requirements.   Our proposed project aims to help cleaning up drilling waste and land contamination at an attractive cost while meeting the 0.1% OC requirement. To achieve this we will develop an innovative, efficient and compact 2-stage microwave process line to fit in a 40 feet container.", null, 1306649.0, 5, 10, "MICROCLEANMUD", "http://www.microcleanmud.com", "http://www.arbelelectronics.co.uk", null, "fp7_107793_998045611"]]}}, "7UX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Crossing Borders", "Ysgol Beca", 132659.0, 8, 8, "The project \"Crossing Borders\" was conceived as a result of a proposal posted in Etwinning and many correspondence via email. The partnership consists of 8 partner schools based on geographically balanced countries in the EU: Portugal, Wales, Denmark, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey. All are schools which vary in background and nature which will further support the project by exposing our pupils to a greater variety that exists in our European community.The variety in size is from 60 pupils upto a 1000 and the age range of pupils involved in the project vary from 8 to 16. All these aspects aid to further support the aims of the project which is to Cross borders, break stereotypes and develop a greater understanding in pupils of the diversity that belongs to our European community. We quickly agreed that the topic Crossing Borders could be a great working title. It can be read in many ways as intended and will be utilised as such. The situation with refugees coming to Europe was something all partners wanted to address and educate our pupils about. It is an issue we could all be better discussing with the pupils in order to emphasize and teach empathy, acceptance and being open minded, but also understanding other people\u2019s' backgrounds and our duty as global citizens regardless of our backgrounds. But crossing borders is also about pushing your own limits in different ways. The activities we have planned will all be about crossing some kind of a personal border, but also trying to push others to cross borders by participating in the activities.We believe that the activities chosen to be key topics in this project, make us able to implement the EU strategic objectives - literacy and active citizenship, but also values such as  solidarity and non-discrimination and contribute to the harmonious development of the European societies. We have chosen topics which we believe are important for teenagers and pupils who are shortly to transfer to secondary school to engage in, because they are the future. Furthermore, we believe that the activities we have chosen will support the topics and the pupils in their learning process. Some activities are very specific, while others are open and can be done in various ways. We think that imagination and creativity are important stakeholders. All topics will develop the pupils understanding  The topics allow for further reflection in groups, pairs or just alone. Throughout the project teaching methods will be utilized to ensure pupils are active learners and encouraged to come to educated and reasoned conclusions.Intercultural understanding is one of education and didactics most valued aims. It improves both cognitive and anthropological enrichment and broadens up our cultural horizons. Learning techniques chosen are cause and effect, compare and contrast, problem solving and thinking of options, fact and opinion, evaluating and persuasion/ deconstructing - all techniques that enables the pupils to think freely, to engage in the activities and to develop various skills. The impact will be pupils developing their social and cultural awareness of EU and are able to see how the problems with embracing the refugees in Europe are being dealt with, pupils improving their self trust by taking part in discussions, brainstorming about their problems and their future and taking part in new and social experiences. The staff will have increased their knowledge about methodologies, training programs, educational instruments and practices. The schools have got a real international connection and have come a step closer to fulfilling the national curriculum for international cooperation and intercultural understanding.Many results will be created: A shared website will provide a learning resource for the participating institutions and others. Google drive and documents will ensure that pupils and teachers alike will have an opportunity for collaborative learning ensuring that the results of the project are forever evolving as topics are researched. A linguistic resource will be developed to enhance the pupils and teachers awareness of foreign modern languages and will be a sustainable resource after the project has been completed. Many results will be produced: artefact resources of the countries, videos and Powerpoint presentations with information and learning areas to be utilized continuously in the future, CD and booklets. The most important result of the project will be the broader, more accepting minds of our pupils who appreciate their place in society and fully comprehend and utilize their role as global citizens.It is our ambition that the partnership will develop awareness of the role that each individual plays, has played and will play in the future. We will assess the ways in which each institution develops during the project, compare data and by teaching, give the pupils an introduction and an alternative to their countries' traditional life - the European life.", "http://www.beca.amdro.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA219-022309_1"]]}}}}
