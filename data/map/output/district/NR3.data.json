Our clientele is becoming more international and correspondingly our personnel and the institution in general will have to become more international and capable of operating more inter-culturally. Internationalisation will be a key focus regarding organisational and staff development in the VHS in the next few years. The main requirements are becoming manifest.1. It\u2019s our target to ensure that every adult has the opportunity to enjoy life-long learning being able to attend high-quality and reasonably-priced courses. For this we have to improve the way we attract, cater for and advise a much more international clientele than before. This can only be achieved by improving active and passive language competence at all levels (management, pedagogical planers, administrative staff and also the teaching staff) of the institution.  2. Through our educational programme and its implementation we seek to promote equal opportunities. To this aim we have to make the organization of teaching and learning more easily accessible. We have to be able to reach refugees in particular and people with a migration background who initially do not speak German via the bridge language English and to a lesser extent French, in order even to be able to communicate and give meaningful guidance. Particularly administrative and pedagogical staff, the management and the DaF teaching staff at the VHS have requirements in this area.3. We seek to improve the efficiency and quality of our education and training programme. This means getting to know new teaching methods and tools, improving linguistic skills, looking in depth at the new standards of competence certification which have relevance all over Europe. We have to experiment with educational programmes which go beyond pure language training, which are taught in English or French or where English or French is used to assist as the bridge language.Number and profile of the participants and description of activities:Customized training courses will be offered in the UK and to a lesser extent in France for the various target groups mentioned above. A total of 154 mobilities will be conducted and evaluated. The main focus will be both to improve active and passive language skills and to improve the quality of teaching in the above-mentioned languages for the sub target group of language teachers involved. Moreover participants will gain an insight into the organisation and standards of the partners in the target countries thus boosting the capacity for innovation at the VHS.Procedures for implementing the project:The training project \u201cThe Challenge of Internationalisation at Volkshochschulen\u201d for the consortium from Upper Bavaria will be advertised at the participating institutions. Suitable participants will be invited to apply or can apply themselves. This includes all full and part-time employees as well as VHS teachers of English, French and German as a Foreign Language (DaF)After selection participants are committed to taking part and have intensive preparation. The key topics will be discussed with the partners and the procedure of running the training courses clarified. If necessary training courses will be scheduled. VHS staff will register the participants and book their travel. The training measures will be evaluated by the participants, by the institution responsible and by the management of the partner of the consortium. The results will be communicated within the consortium, but also to the Bavarian Volkshochschulen, the \u201cLandesverband der Volkshochschulen\u201d in Bavaria and on federal level. The responsible project manager will be the applicant for this project.Description of the envisaged results and impact and the expected long-term benefits:The staff at the Volkshochschulen taking part should become significantly more willing and able to communicate in the bridge language of English or French. Thus we will become more sensitive towards learners at the VHS who have a migration background at the first-contact stage, being able to give them better guidance and to invite them to take part in training courses and in the process of life-long learning.

Our clientele is becoming more and more international, therefore our staff - as well as the institution as a whole - need to enhance their international outlook, as well as their intercultural competence. Our Erasmus+ project 2016/17 was a first, but very crucial step on this way. Internationalisation remains the central task in the areas of organisational and personnel development for the vhs in the coming years. \r\n\r\n1. Every adult should have access to high quality lifelong learning at a low price. In order to achieve this goal, we need to improve our ability to approach, advice, and assess an increasingly international clientele. A key factor in this development is the improvement of the active and passive language skills on all levels of our institution (management, pedagogical planning, administration, as well as teaching staff). While English was the focus in 2016/17, we have now identified French and Spanish as further relevant \u201cbridging languages\u201d and would like to train our staff in both. \r\n\r\n2. We want to promote equal opportunities with our educational programmes. Therefore, the organisation of teaching and learning needs to address accessibility. Especially refugees and migrants, whose first language is not German, need to be approached with the help of bridging languages (English, French, and Spanish) in order for communication and counselling to become possible. This is a relevant task for all of our administrative staff, educational staff, management, and those teaching German as a foreign language.\r\n \r\n3. We want to improve the efficiency and quality of our educational programmes \u2013 particularly in the foreign language department (English, French, Spanish, and Italian). Teaching staff will focus on new methods of teaching, innovative teaching material and improvement of language skills. We would like to build on the success of our previous Erasmus+ project, shifting the focus to French, Spanish, and Italian. In order to attract a clientele with increasing media affinity, we would like to test innovative uses of new media, as well as formats of eLearning. Thus, an important focus of our project will be blended learning. \r\n\r\n4. Supporting intercultural exchange, communication, and integration is an important endeavour for adult learning institutions. Nonetheless, the required process of intercultural awareness and cross- cultural communication in our vhs is not an easy one. By offering intercultural training courses, we would like to promote this development even further in our new Erasmus+ project. \r\n\r\nOur follow-up project \u201cvhs Esslingen international II\u201d consists of 40 mobility activities in four countries. This project is a further milestone on our path towards internationalisation and intercultural openness in our vhs. We can already see the benefits of the 2016/17 project:  our staff\u2019s increasing willingness to engage in foreign language communication has improved addressing and advising our international clientele. We would like to build on this success.

The members of the consortium are part of the department of school education within the CJD Berchtesgaden. We are also known as Christophorus Schools. Our schools enjoy an outstanding reputation with regard to our three educational emphases:  the promotion of chronically ill pupils, the promotion of pupils with partial performance disorders and the promotion of junior competitive athletes. In addition, we regularly welcome unaccompanied minor refugees as our students. \r\n\r\nMeeting the diverse needs of this heterogeneous student body is the explicit goal of all members of the consortium. We want our pupils to receive the best possible education, as well as preparation for the national and international labour market. In accordance with our motto \"no one should be left behind\", we see ourselves as educational institutions for a wide variety of pupils who - in the spirit of inclusion - learn and live together. We would like for all of them to become politically mature citizens of a united Europe - without exclusion and discrimination. Central to this idea of international participation are foreign language skills, intercultural competence, and a cosmopolitan attitude. \r\n\r\nOur project aims to further a process of internationalization in all of our schools. In the past, international partnerships were repeatedly complicated by language barriers. This is why we believe foreign language skills and intercultural skills of staff at all levels to be essential to our process. \r\n\r\nOur project consists of 30 mobility activities (of 2 weeks training each) at the English language school Norwich Study Center. We hope to achieve the following with our project: 1. an increase in the quality of teaching; 2. the establishment of international partnerships; and 3. the development of a sustainable welcome culture and the strengthening of interculturality. The training courses are adapted to the needs of the participants. Training content and objectives are aimed at different status groups and serve different purposes:\r\n\r\n1. In order to increase the quality of teaching, our teachers will examine current learning and teaching methods, foreign language didactics/special needs education, as well as innovative approaches, such as theatre pedagogy, or technology-focused learning. At the same time, the active and passive language skills will be improved.  Individual teachers will also be trained in bilingual subject teaching. \r\n\r\n2. In order to establish international partnerships, our employees (administration, social pedagogues, etc.) will attend General English and Business English courses. This will improve their language skills and their confidence in using English. Those communication skills are essential in order to initiate and maintain international partnerships and to ensure the comprehensive support of unaccompanied minor refugee students. \r\n\r\n3. Intercultural sensitization is a key issue across all areas of our schools. We would therefor like to reach as many colleagues as possible with the intercultural training course offered by our British partners. However, the course is particularly aimed at those colleagues who work with students from a migrant background, as well as those who are responsible for international partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe expect a significant improvement in English language skills, new methodological skills, and increased confidence in the use of the foreign language. These improvements will have positive impact on everyday work in the classroom, as well as the initiation and extension of international partnerships. The reduction of prejudices and an increased intercultural awareness will contribute to this process. At an institutional level, we also hope for new impulses for our curricula and will explore the possibilities of a bilingual teaching strategy, in the aftermath of our project.\r\n\r\nWe take our employees\u2019 claim to lifelong learning seriously. Extended language skills provide additional qualifications for our staff, from which they benefit - both professionally and personally. As indicated, we also expect positive effects on learning methods and curricula, as well as other institutional levels. Ultimately, these are not self-purposes.

This means in particular, the needs to use the new teaching methods and materials to improve language skills including the inclusion of new standards of testing relevant across Europe. We must expand upon the current narrow language learning and educational opportunities; this may be assisted by using English as an additional connecting language.Number and Profile of Participants and Description of Activities: Appropriate training courses are offered in the United Kingdom for these different target audiences. A total of 28 mobilities will be conducted and evaluated. The main focus is to improve the communicative language skills and increase the quality of teaching English as a foreign language for the language teachers involved. In addition, this would give the participants an insight into the standards of the partners as well as the innovative power of Volkshochschule.Process for Project Implementation: The training project \"International VHS Esslingen\" invites suitable participants to pay all full-time and part-time employees as well as lecturers in English and German as a foreign language. After selecting those who are participating in the training, the topics and procedure of implementation of training will be specified and evaluated by the project manager and project partners.Description of Expected Results and Impacts, as well as the Expected Long-term Benefits: The employees of VHS should be significantly strengthened in their readiness in using English to communicate. We have a lot of first contact with our students with an immigrant background, this will allow us to better advise them and show them a more effective way to educate themselves and take part in the process of lifelong learning. The project is an important milestone on the way to internationalising our Volkshochschule.", "http://www.flyingclassrooms.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA104-002816_1"], [2015, "EFPB - Europ\u00e4ischer Fortbildungs-Plan f\u00fcr Bildungspersonal 2015 bis 2017 der vhs im Norden des Landkreises M\u00fcnchen e.V.", "The Flying Classrooms Ltd", 43501.0, 2, 2, "Project Background and project objectives:\r\nAt Volkshochschule our goal is to implement the European agenda for adult education.

By delivering good quality education through inexpensive courses, we aim to enable people to fulfill their educational needs and give them opportunities to contribute to social cohesion.\r\nWe want to promote active citizenship through our educational programs and their implementation. We aim to raise the profile of our organization to improve awareness of Adult Learning so that more adults and low skilled people feel able to attend the courses, which we make effective and comprehensive through our excellent teaching and learning. \r\nThe vhs has to face new challenges: The region of Munich is extending a lot every year. New branches and companies from all over the world are coming to Munich, and people from all over the world have settled and are working here. Munich\u2019s universities are a magnet for foreign workers and the language of communication is English.\r\nIn addition to this, more and more asylum seekers and refugees are coming to Germany, especially to Munich.  All of these new arrivals have to be integrated into the new society that they are living in. For this reason our educational staff and teachers have to be able to communicate using English and need to explorate new concepts and approaches of adult education.\r\nSo our staff and teachers have to obtain additional training to ensure that the quality of education is maintained. For different groups we can find the right kind of education. The main aim is that active language competence improves due to the quality of the English teaching they receive.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants and description of the activities:\r\nFor the different target groups customized training courses are offered in the UK. A total of 32 mobilities are conducted and evaluated. Main focus is to improve the fit and active language skills on the one hand, and improving the quality of teaching in the English language for the sub-target group of language teachers involved. Participants gain beyond an insight into the organization and the standards of the English partner, strengthening the innovative power of the vhs.\r\n\r\nProcedures for project implementation:\r\nThe training project EFBP (European Training for educational staff at vhs im Norden des Landkreises M\u00fcnchen e.V.) will be published and announced at our institution.  After an application and selection process, participants will receive a pre-course assessment to prepare themselves before they begin their training. At the same time, the vhs management will register participants and book their travel. After completion of the training, the vhs administration will do the organizational work, the teachers will give their report and there are opportunities for information sessions for other teachers. Sometime after the course has finished, the teaching will be evaluated and there should be an increase in the quality of the teaching.\r\n\r\nThe project manager is responsible for the application of this project.\r\n\r\nThe aim of our project is to raise awareness and insight into foreign cultures and the operation of foreign institutions. We believe that the experience of participants after studying on one of these courses is very positive. The courses offer a variety of experience and new skills & techniques which they can bring back with them and use when they return. For example, suggestions and new methodology  that will be motivating for their students at our Volkshochschule, more technical knowledge & background skills  and  classroom management which will enable  better quality teaching overall. \r\nIntegration should be the common idea in our daily work. The results can be put into practice to find their way into the personal development via our VHS.

There is, after all, no such event in history books as discovery of Europe, since it was mostly the Europeans who travelled around the world in search of new lands, new routes and new means of achieving their goals. \r\nWith this project, primary and lower secondary schools from ten European countries want to make the best of this tradition. All participants intend to set off for a journey during which they will discover something valuable and worth sharing with whole educational community.\r\nStudents will discover new lands and make new friends. Although no great distances separate them, they know very little about their neighbours. To change this situation, they will help one another learn about their countries and people and share their cultures. While doing this, they will hopefully discover something more:  motivation and sense of responsibility for their education, their own potential and creativity, importance of learning foreign languages and value of teamwork and cooperation. \r\nTeachers intend to explore new routes in teaching, to avoid such dangers as boredom, stagnation and discouragement, which threaten both their students and themselves.  They want to find new means to achieve their ultimate goal:  cultivating and nurturing children's natural enthusiasm for learning, curiosity and creativity, which, though possessed  by each child entering school for the first time, are often seriously diminished after just a few years of formal education. They will explore methods that will enable them to better equip children for their further education and future work and that will help in particular those students who fail to achieve satisfactory results in the traditional lessons.\r\nWe have guidelines for our search. We think the solutions lie in allowing students more power in decisions concerning their own learning and in letting children learn by working in teams on performing practical, creative tasks.  We see the need of increasing in our schools the utilization of modern tools of ICT, loved by all children. We would also like to reinstate the element of fun in learning, so often banned from our schools. \r\nTherefore, we decided to explore in our project methods based on the theory of constructivism, in particular PBL (project based learning) and webquest. As we know better than anybody that the best way leading to truly learning and understanding something is trying to teach it to somebody else, we also decided to explore the methods of peer-learning and learning-by-teaching in our work with the students. Those four methods lie at the base of all activities in our project. In our search for better routes in teaching , we are going to blend them together in an innovative method of \"modified webquest\", which will be implemented through the main group of project's activities.  Activities of another group, based on collaborative tasks performed on eTwinning platform, will facilitate the process of teaching and learning English as foreign language through providing the much desired communication context. Besides the activities based on virtual cooperation, we will also implement the targeted methods through activities involving direct, face-to-face communication and collaboration of children from different countries during transnational learning meetings. To fully utilize the potential of international cooperation for enhancing the European dimension of our schools, we are going to concentrate all project's activities on the topics concerning geography, natural environment, history and culture of partner countries.\r\nLike every well-designed expedition, our project is going to bring tangible profits: numerous teaching resources based on the methods targeted by our project, in form of websites and ICT materials. The resources resulting from the project (webquests, study materials and activity scenarios ) will be available to be re-used after the end of the project, but they will also serve as templates for the teachers, helping them develop new activities based on the  targeted teaching methods.
