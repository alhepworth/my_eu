To ensure maximum impact, the TURaS project has developed an innovative twinning approach bringing together decision makers in local authorities with SMEs and academics to ensure meaningful results and real change are implemented over the duration of the project.  11 local authorities or local development agencies are involved as partners in the project and they will orient research and development from the outset towards the priority sustainability and resilience challenges facing their cities. 9 leading academic research institutions and 6 SMEs will work with these cities helping them to reduce their urban ecological footprint through proposing new visions, feasiblity strategies, spatial scenarios and guidance tools to help cities address these challenges. The specific challenges addressed in TURaS include: climate change adaptation and mitigation; natural resource shortage and unprecedented urban growth.\nOver the five year duration of the project, the feasibility of these new approaches will be tested in selected case study neighbourhoods and new measures to enable adaptive governance, collaborative decision-making, and behavioural change towards resilient and sustainable European cities will be tested. The impact of these new approaches will be measured and results compared between participating cities before a final set of strategies and tools will be developed for demonstration, dissemination and exploitation in other European cities.  SMEs are highly involved in all work packages of the project and specific measures have been put in place to ensure the optimal economic impact of the project is achieved.", 37141.0, 7107348.0, 12, 33, "TURAS", "http://www.turas-cities.org/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015-10/164182.jpg", "fp7_100238_972311608"]]}}, "6JQ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1385856000000, 1480464000000, "Innovative plasma based transformation of food waste into high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen", "P a Moody Recycling Limited", "PlasCarb has been stimulated by a transnational consortium of R&D performing SMEs in partnership with specialist scientific resource, life cycle thinking experts, industrial customers, and access to risk finance to facilitate future market uptake. It will integrate commerce with research; transforming a widespread urban solid waste environmental problem (140 million tonnes of food and plant waste produced annually in Europe) into a sustainable source of significant economic added value, (high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen). The vast majority of hydrogen and carbon used today in industry are derived from fossil petroleum sources, the majority of which are imported into the EU from regions which are often politically unstable or competitive. PlasCarb will integrate an established technology (anaerobic digestion) with innovative, low temperature microwave plasma processing and leading edge control of carbon morphology and purification. This project will extend beyond current Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the valorisation of food waste of anaerobic digestion (AD) to generate renewable energy; it will transform the biogas output from AD using an innovative low energy microwave plasma to split biogas methane into high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen (RH2). The quality and economic value of the carbon and the hydrogen will then be maximised through the integration of high quality research and industrial process engineering expertise. The project will validate at a pilot scale continuous operation of the integrated process for a period of one month; 150 tonnes of mixed food waste will be digested to generate over 25000m3 of biogas. 2400m3 of this biogas will then be transformed into highly graphitic carbon with a market value of over \u20ac2500/tonne and RH2.

Integrated non-destructive approaches to understand and valorise complex archaeological sites", "Timescape Surveys", "'During the last 20 years a set of methods of surface survey and non-invasive sub-surface prospections have been developed to investigate complex buried archaeological sites, aiming to limit destructive intervention, such as excavation. This set includes different kinds of remote sensing, ground based geophysics, systematic recording of surface materials, GIS-based analysis and visualisation tools, geomatic and geomorphological survey. These applied technologies require high investments in instrumentation, long formation of researchers, time consuming data processing and permits for fieldwork on cultural heritage sites. Research institutions like universities cannot afford such investments while private enterprises cannot invest on human resources, and often are not allowed to test new techniques in archaeological areas. Therefore, innovation and experimentation proceed very slowly, and aspects like virtual reconstructions of the 'underground ancient world' and dissemination of results to the public are necessarily neglected. This project aims to join resources and very different skills to tackle each possible aspect connected with 'non-destructive' approaches to complex archaeological sites, from fieldwork, where new geophysics techniques can be tested, to data collection (with innovative trials to automation of the data acquisition process), to data processing (where the contribution of IT experts is needed to refine the available software), to interpretation and visualisation of results, where a 3D vision of sub-surface evidence, could achieve a science-based but still effective presentation. The consortium of 7 partners will organize the mutual exchange of researchers/specialists and will recruit new researchers for transfer of knowledge purposes. Thus, an 'open' laboratory can be established, where all expertises convey, analysis and technical activities are performed, experimental techniques and new data processing tested  and formation activities can be held.'", null, 650352.0, 8, 8, "RADIO-PAST", null, null, null, "fp7_90719_998365226"]]}}}}
