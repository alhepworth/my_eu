Despite a large amount of research on this topic, we still do not understand the most fundamental aspect of face processing: how can we identify the people we see? This is a key problem in human perception, but it also has practical implications in forensic and security settings. This project has its roots in a simple observation: pictures of the same face can look very different indeed. In the standard approach to face recognition, this commonplace fact is treated as an inconvenience. Differences between pictures of the same person are regarded as \u2018noise\u2019, and either ignored, or eliminated by systematically controlling the images used for research. This research programme takes exactly the converse approach. Instead of trying to control away this variability, we wish to study it explicitly. Under this approach, the focus is not how to \u2018tell people apart\u2019, but instead how to \u2018tell people together\u2019 \u2013 how to bring together superficially different images into a coherent representation. Early work suggests that a very important component of familiar face recognition is the ability to generalize over superficial image differences \u2013 differences which tend to fool unfamiliar viewers, as well as automatic computer-based systems. The current failure to address this variability may account for the slow progress in face identification \u2013 progress which has fallen behind the understanding of other aspects of face processing such as social perception.

However, although corporate biotechnology is a great employment opportunity for young graduates, today these degrees are not widely accepted in the European business arena. An this is because MSc/DSc teaching is scarcely oriented in exploring activities past the bench work, such as industrial management of biotechnology products. The main goal of this proposal is therefore to organize a group of European partners including Academia and Industry that will be able to improve health biotechnology degrees and make them valid in more than one country. The realisation of the project will entail the creation of multinational European Master programmes in the medical biotechnology field, implemented in close communication with partners from industry and other non-academic partners, all with missions in higher education.

Together with the increasing number of multi-faith classrooms, this emphasises the need to equip prospective teachers and teacher educators, and thereby also pupils, with adequate interreligious and intercultural skills and competences that allow them to navigate such complex and diverse contexts and cope with the resulting implications for the individual life-styles. Subjects like Religious Education (RE) or Ethics play an important role in facilitating the discussion of these issues and offering answers and explanations.\r\n\r\nRE in public schools in Europe is designed in many ways. Each country\u2019s respective situation and form of organization differs significantly for mainly historical reasons. Despite the different contexts, an increasingly widespread discussion about the possible future of RE takes place. These discussions, however, are rarely linked together and have not yet reached the level of teacher education and training. Future religion teachers are normally only rather superficially familiar with the situation of RE (and related subjects) in other European countries and thus insufficiently prepared for a joint European perspective.\r\n\r\nIn addition, RE is faced with growing religious and ideological diversity of pupils and stakeholders alike across the entire European area. Current changes to the curricula and school structure, as well as wider debates on religion in the public sphere, have produced noticeable controversy about the place of RE in schools, how it should be delivered and what young people should be taught. \r\nIn the three-year Erasmus+ project \"Religious Education and Diversity - Sharing experiences of and approaches to teacher education in the context of 'Education and Training 2020' (READY)\", teacher training institutions in Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Scotland and Sweden will therefore explore the topic \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 in two respects: the mutual exchange of diverse forms of Religious Education and the variety of approaches to subject teaching and learning, in which the question of religious heterogeneity will be considered and discussed. The results will be examined and proposals for teaching Religion and Diversity in Europe will be published.\r\n\r\nMain target group of the project are teacher trainees for Religious Education. The project begins with a structured online communication between three pairs of trainee teachers from two European countries. This process leads to the development of a joint educational module on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 between the two teacher education institutions. At the same time, profile descriptions of the situation of religion teacher education in the participating countries are exchanged, an interactive READY website is set up, which begins to unfold the diversity of RE across Europe, and a guideline for one week study visits is developed.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of the project, groups of five teacher educators and trainee teachers observe RE lessons in a European partner country for a week and hold discussions with trainee teachers, pupils and stakeholders responsible for RE. These experiences are analysed on the basis of a practical guide to European RE, processed and documented.  In parallel to these exchanges, local model RE lessons on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 are systematically evaluated and their delivery in the classroom also partly videotaped. The pupils are encouraged to establish eTwinning contacts with a RE class in a partner country and in this way deepen their knowledge and experience of religious diversity across Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the entire project is designed to achieve broad dissemination and a long-term impact, which is facilitated by the experience, expertise, contacts and structures of the Comenius Institute M\u00fcnster.

A consequence of such a choice is that the child for example risks beginning compulsory education with no or poor knowledge about the language of the host country as well as social codes and practices (even hidden ones). As the person taking care of the child often is the mother, another consequence is that she will also have more difficulties with social inclusion or with getting access to tools for inclusion, for example by attending classes to learn the language of the host country. \r\nThe reason for choosing preschool as a focus is that preschool, although it is not compulsory in our countries seems to be a possible way for migrant families to better integrate and be included in the host country. For instance, parents or some member of the family usually bring younger children to school and are therefore given the possibility to meet teachers and other parents, as well as to become familiar with the habits, traditions and way of life of the new country. In other words, preschool -or kindergarten- can be considered as a possible threshold to better inclusion not only of the children, but also their family. The target group is families with infants and children aged 6 months-7 years.\r\n\r\nAt every level, the project aims at changing people\u2019s attitudes towards migrants and their families and at developing educational tools and professional development courses to facilitate the inclusion of migrants. It is also aimed at migrants themselves to help them understand and accept the different cultural codes to integrate better in the host country. \r\n\r\nOne important and in our eyes original goal is to develop tools to facilitate the cooperation between different social actors such as municipalities, stakeholders, social workers, NGO, libraries, families of children from the host country to interact with school around the inclusion of recently arrived families. In other words, the global aim of the project is to promote preschool as a social and cultural meeting place and a tool for early inclusion for migrant families. Another objective is to compare the practices in different contexts and, although the situation may vary from one country to the other, develop common tools to improve the inclusion of immigrants in the host countries that may even be used at an European level. The different mappings and the educational tools developed through the project will therefore result in courses aimed for existing or future preschool personal and widely spread.", "http://www.abdn.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA203-034587_1"], [2016, "mobile learning in higher education", "THE UNIVERSITY COURT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN", 80436.0, 4, 4, "Mobile technologies are an important part of our daily life and we carry them all the time with us.
