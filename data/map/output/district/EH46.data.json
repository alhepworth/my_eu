Further to this, as many as 9 out of 10 young offenders leave school early, having dropped out in the 6 months or more prior to being incarcerated. This has economic implications, as it costs over \u00a3200,000 per year to place a young person in a secure children\u2019s home. Furthermore, this group of people are more likely to become entrenched in the system and become adult offenders. Young offenders are also likely to be marginalised and socially excluded when back in the community, particularly as they are likely to have less training or educational opportunities. This makes employment opportunities more limited. Thus, re-engaging young offenders whilst in custody presents a unique opportunity for resettlement into the community and education on release.\r\n\r\nHowever, research has shown that educators in prisons tend to have less qualifications than teachers in mainstream schools. There is also a higher staff turnover and training, which is specific to addressing the multiple needs of young offenders, is limited. Therefore, the aim of this project is to enhance educators\u2019 capability to re-engage young offenders with education and learning whilst in secure custodial settings in 4 partner countries in the EU. This involves training education staff in secure custodial settings to use \u2018authentic inquiry\u2019 as an intervention to enrich educators\u2019 repertoires in learning design.\r\n\r\nAuthentic inquiry is an intervention designed to build personally relevant knowledge which is useful in education. The personally relevant topic is identified by the learner, enabling greater opportunity to connect with the learning process. This is done by taking the learners\u2019 interest through their own narratives and stories (personal) and navigating this towards the production of an \u2018artefact\u2019 such as a piece of art, poster or other product that has some external educational value (public). In so doing, there is a connecting of the personal to the public. This intervention has been shown to be effective in re-engaging disengaged learners in both the UK and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported by a digital infrastructure which facilitates learners\u2019 journeys (both education staff and young offenders).  The digital infrastructure and its associated tools, enable users to assess progress along their journey, and areas of focus for them as learners. The infrastructure includes a repository for online educational resources and a community of practice for both learners and educators (trainers and education staff).\r\n\r\nEducation staff in secure custodial settings are the main target group of the project. The long term impact of this training could reach hundreds of young offenders (aged 10-17) through the staff training. The project has the potential to reach at least 100 young offenders in the secure settings that are part of this project as the ultimate beneficiary group of the project. Furthermore, up to 40 educators will be trained during the life of the project.", null, "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048100_4"]]}}}}
