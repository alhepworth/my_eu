The Global Peace Games are \u201cgrass roots\u201d soccer games that take place under the initiative of PLAY SOCCER and are organized by organizations and communities around the world. The Games are linked by common themes and encourage children and youth to share and celebrate the values and skills they learn on the playing field through sport and to find peaceful solutions in their daily lives and communities. The Games take place in the fall of each year at locally scheduled dates around the time of the United Nations International Day of Peace (September 21st). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace Village offers the perfect setting to organize this event. The Flanders Peace Field is located in Mesen, Belgium, and was one of the locations were the christmas truces took place during World War One. On Christmas 1914, soldiers spontaneously came out of the trenches, singing Christmas songs, exchanging gifts and \u2026 playing football with the so called enemy. British, German, Belgian,\u2026 soldiers were involved.
