Ebony Steelband will travel to Amsterdam in October 2016 for an exchange with Eternity. Then Eternity will travel to London in February 2017 for an exchange with Ebony Steelband. We find it important that the results of the 1st exchange of October 2016 will be evaluated in Amsterdam and continued in London during period from February 2017. It is imperative that both youth groups perceive each other's worlds on the spot and in practice can bring fulfillment through exchange activities. Each exchange group comprises an average of 15 young people and 3 leaders.

Project partners include early education institutions in Bulgaria, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Poland and Sweden. The project partnerships will be extended to institutions in Finland, Ireland and Denmark, where particularly youth welfare facilities, special-needs schools and institutions in elderly care will be considered. \r\n\r\nThe mobility project is divided into three schemes. \r\n\r\nThe first scheme - the Europaklasse class scheme - includes participants who have decided to focus on the development of intercultural competence during their initial professional education as an officially recognised nursery school teacher. As part of this education, the participants complete their placement abroad for three months at day care centres, nursery schools and at institutions for people with special educational needs. Possible requirements for participating in the project are e.g. intermediate-level educational qualification including one year at a vocational school or general qualification for university entrance including a 6-week social work placement.  The  profile of this scheme is geared particularly towards promoting intercultural competence and culturally sensitive work in plural and global societies and political conditions/contexts. The stay abroad allows the participants to learn about the conception of diversity  in their European partner country  and the resulting institutional challenges.\r\nDuring a period of preparation the participants of the first scheme approach their partner country from a variety of angles, take a specific language course and address the specific project topic on a theoretically well-founded level.\r\nDuring the stay abroad the participants are actively involved in the educational work of the partner institution. This includes e.g. working in teams, participating in public relations activities and implementing the project topic. In addition, the participants give 2 demonstration lessons, which are evaluated by the institute\u2019s teachers.  \r\nThe participants evaluate their experiences and insights after the placement abroad during an externally supervised 3-day workshop. The learning outcomes are incorporated in various documentations and publications.  \r\n    \r\nDuring the second scheme of the mobility project \u201cLearning Mobility of Individuals\u201d, the nursery school teachers in training are offered the opportunity to engage in a two-week work placement in a European country at the end of their vocational training. In this way they should be enabled to expand their already sound expertise in a culturally foreign environment and reflect on it.  These intercultural stimuli are aimed at enriching their future professional practice.\r\n\r\nThe third scheme \u201cLearning Mobility of Education Staff\u201d focuses on the professional discourse between the teachers of the institute and educational specialists in the partner countries .
