This project aims to provide participating schools with the training and support needed to effect changes to curriculum delivery.We intend to put young people at the heart of this project giving them the opportunity to work with teachers and contributing to the success of the outputs.  Participating teachers will receive comprehensive training on how they can embed creativity across the curriculum and how by improving their own skills in delivering creativity they can raise standards across all subjects but especially in literacy, numeracy and digital competences.   As part of our dissemination and sustainability plans we will train participating teachers to coach others in order to embed creativity across the curriculum in their own setting but also teachers from a wider group of schools, locally, nationally and internationally.  Creative Arts (overarching description of any activity such as drama, music, graphic arts, performing arts, film, visual arts etc.) is increasingly being recognized as an effective tool for working with young people and to give them a means to express themselves openly. Creative Arts is an effective tool to empower all  students including those with behavioural or mental health problems through creativity.  It is a form of expression that improves and enhances physical and emotional wellbeing through reconciling emotional conflicts and fostering self awareness.  In today's society the perception of the success is parallel to academic success.We will include young people from a wide range of ability and socio-economic background.  This projects meets the European Prog. objectives of promoting equity and inclusion by facilitating access to education for learners from a range of ability and those from disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities compared to their peers.Some participating pupils are disadvantaged because of:-disability.  That is participants with special needs people with mental, physical, sensory or other disabilities-educational difficulties. This includes young people with learning difficulties, at risk of early school-leaving, low qualification and/or poor school performance- socio-economic disadvantage.  To include young people with a low standards of living, low family income, dependence on social welfare etc.The pupils will take part in a series of activities throughout the project allowing them the opportunity to express themselves through creativity and to identify skills that they believe make a creative teacher.  Through social media and eTwinning pupils will work with pupils in the partner regions to share ideas and creative projects prior to exhibition during the multiplier events.  They will be given the opportunity to present their ideas and those of their peers overseas to teachers from other schools, families and the wider community. All participating schools will work with families and the wider community to develop family engagement activities.  We know that achievement amongst school pupils is directly impacted upon in families where parents do not see the value of education, this can be for many reasons. Parents may themselves have experienced low achievement in school, many may not have attended school. This can be improved by the engagement of families in their children's learning and creative arts are a non-threatening way for families to get involved whilst developing their own literacy, numeracy and digital competences.", "http://www.langstoneprimary.co.uk", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024296_1"]]}}, "2TA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1396310400000, 1491004800000, "Excellence in Speed and Reliability for More Than Moore Technologies", "Spts Technologies Limited", "Europe\u2019s strengths are based on the deep knowledge and market position in automotive industry, industrial electronics industry and leading know how for More-than-Moore based embedded system.

An investigation of these issues until now has been limited by the lack of tactile sensing technologies enabling large scale experimental activities, since so far skin technologies and embedded tactile sensors have been mostly demonstrated only at prototype stage. The new capabilities will improve the ability of robots to operate effectively and safely in unconstrained environments and also their ability to communicate and co-operate with each other and with humans. To support this aim, one part of the project will focus on the investigation of methods and technologies enabling the implementation of skin sensors that can be used with existing robots. Other parts of the project will develop new structures for representing and integrating tactile data with existing cognitive architectures in order to support skin-based cognition, behaviour and communication. As a result, the project will address three main objectives. The first is to develop new sensor technologies that can provide tactile feedback from large areas of the robot body. This development process will be incremental and will take advantage of feedback produced from the application of these technologies in the work done on the other project objectives. The second objective is to develop and integrate fundamental cognitive structures for efficient and safe utilisation of tactile data in terms of a robot body image, safe reflexive reactions to tactile events and flexible representations of spatially and temporally distributed patterns of physical contact.

A comparative study of policies for the distribution of public spaces in culturally diverse societies", "University of Wales Newport", "Tolerance has been increasingly invoked as the inspiring ideal of a number of social policies in European democracies. Appeals to tolerance have animated especially the political debates on those policies addressed to accommodate minorities\u2019 requests. Among such requests those for the allocation of public spaces have recently acquired pride of place in the political agendas of many European and extra-European countries (e.g. the allocation of space for Roma sites; Muslims\u2019 requests to build places of worship and housing policies for migrants). Despite such a generalized political and societal relevance of the notion of tolerance, some problems may occur when policies inspired by it are implemented. In particular, the implementation of tolerance-inspired spatial policies may result in the marginalisation of differences and thus risk undermining social cohesion. What conception of tolerance may be invoked to limit such a risk? To answer this question, we shall test the hypothesis that grounding tolerance on equal respect for persons may contribute to the development of spatial policies capable of resolving the tensions between tolerance and social cohesion in culturally diverse societies. In particular, the project pursues 4 objectives:1.to develop a conceptual taxonomy to clarify the liaisons between tolerance, respect and spatial issues;2.to study the ways in which appeals to tolerance have informed the development of spatial policies;3.to investigate the influence of cultural diversities on the interpretations of tolerance in different national contexts;4.to extrapolate from the above studies an overall view of the connections between tolerance and equal respect.
