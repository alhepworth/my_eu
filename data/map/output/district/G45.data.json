We are striving to increase the uptake in Language Study and demonstrate more convincingly its relevance to our pupils lives in Castlemilk, Glasgow.  In line with educational practice across the EU, and with the Scottish Government's 1+2 Language Learning Policy, we hope to revive and strengthen the Teaching and Learning of TWO Modern Languages in our school, which has recently narrowed to French only. We have therefore requested that members of the ML Dept attend Immersion Courses, in order to improve their linguistic competences; to allow them to refresh their cultural awareness; to reflect on the rationale for language learning; and to evaluate new methodologies for pedagogy.  We have encouraged Mrs J McCormack  to undertake this activity in July 2016 because she also requires further study time in Spain in order to be fully registered to continue teaching Spanish.She will live and work in the target language; She will become a pupil, and experience the activities of the classroom from the learner's perspective, which will lead to a deeper understand of the process of language acquisition .  She will attend seminars and work collaboratively, make contacts with Spanish Teachers from all around Europe, and participate in cultural activities.We hope to see more Castlemilk pupils understanding that Language Qualifications will improve their employability, make them better citizens, and help them to enjoy their leisure.", "http://www.castlemilkhigh.glasgow.sch.uk/", "Castlemilk High School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023283_coordinator"]]}}, "9UR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "RETHINKING OUR TEACHING SKILLS THROUGH INCLUSION AND ICT", "John Paul II Primary School", 7942.0, 5, 7, "The project \"RETHINKING OUR TEACHING SKILLS THROUGH INCLUSION AND ICT\" arises from the reflection of the faculty of the Colegio Hern\u00e1ndez  with the design of the European Development Plan. We have taken into account the objectives of the EU 2020 growth strategy, OECD studies and the conclusions of the Gothenburg Summit. As we state in the title of this project, we are convinced that as teachers we must rethink on the skills and abilities which are needed in the 21st century. It is essential to move towards more innovative methodologies based on equity, inclusion and suitable for life in a digital and multicultural society.\r\n\r\nTherefore we have defined the following improvement areas:\r\n1. Transformation of the culture of the organization and of the educational practices in order to  meet the diversity of educational needs of our students.\r\n2. Development of the digital skills needed to live and work in the era of digital transformation. Use of collaborative platforms and development of assessment tools to guarantee the quality throughout the process.\r\n3. Creation of International Professional Networks in order to promote the exchange of best practices in Education and the internationalization of the organisations.\r\n4. Implementation of an Interculturality Plan which will reflect the social, ethnic and linguistic diversity present at our school and society.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of innovative methodologies and the use of ICT in all areas will meet the demands of the labour market in the 21st century. Concepts such as innovation and internationalization will also be key in any successful future educational project. We are willing to accept all these challenges but we are also aware that we need to learn from the best practices regarding inclusive programmes and experiences of teaching and learning in multicultural environments. For this reason, we have chosen our partner organisations because of their effective use of ICT in the teaching and learning process an also for their wide experience with the educational challenges of multicultural societies. We believe that these  examples of good practices will help us achieve the goals set in our strategic planning and will make us walk towards the school we need to meet the demands of the society and also to the school we all want. \r\n\r\nThe Dissemination Plan will play a key role in the project \"RETHINKING OUR TEACHING SKILLS THROUGH INCLUSION AND ICT\". It will also be relevant the deep analysis of the impact on all agents and at all levels, local, regional, national and international. There is also an Evaluation Plan designed in order to assess and neasure all the aspects of the project.\r\n\r\nThe added value of this project  are the alliances that the participants will create during their jobshadowing experiences or teaching assignments and that will  be the seeds for future strategic partnerships which will enable our organization to continue with its internationalization process.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049268_5"]]}}}}
