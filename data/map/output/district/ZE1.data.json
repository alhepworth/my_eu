However we feel we need to look more closely at what we are doing in the future and extend this further in order to produce young learners who are equipped with skills for the 21st century. With the Scottish Goverment's 1+2 initiative we want to be able to teach languages that are increasingly relevant in the world. We have started taster sessions of Mandarin and our main language for the local authority is French, however we also want to offer Spanish and cannot do that with our current capacity in staff.\r\n\r\nBy going on a 3 week immersion training course, we will have our Principal Teacher of Languages being able to teach Spanish afterwards to qualification level. This will completely open up opportunities for our learners and other staff as we begin a journey of embedding the language in our school and our cluster.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the course are for the participant staff member to gain language competency and improve their teaching skills. This course will help the teacher embed languages as part of everyday school routine and open up opportunities for promotion of global citizenship which is a key part of the curriculum.

Our schools and communities although far away from each other have faced similar issues over the last few years. The changing nature of our towns has greatly affected local societies and we want to teach our pupils how to cope with these changes. One of the biggest changes has been the changing needs of the employment market. With the change in industries traditional career paths have become less attractive and less sustainable. Our project will help pupils to learn about the new industries and increase the labour market relevance of the pupils. Another central element will be developing active citizenship and encouraging our pupils to learn more about entrepreneurship and how to react to the labour market; this will help our pupils develop into active citizens with increased employability and a greater understanding of local industries. Migration is also an issue that has affected all of the project partners, both immigration into the regions and emigration from the regions, we want to get pupils to learn about the consequences of this migration and to help them better understand both the positive and negative effects migration has on the nature of our communities. \r\n\r\nOur project is for pupils aged 16-18 years and about 250 pupils in total from our five schools will be taking part in the project directly with many more being affected indirectly. Our pupils face all the normal trials of teenages growing up in today's world but with the added challenges of living in remote areas that have often been overlooked by capital-centric government policies and the changing nature of economies moving from primary industries to secondary and tertiary industries that tend to be more centralised and which require new and different skills. Due to the challenges that they face many of our pupils lack motivation and a significant proportion to don't complete their studies and are thus unable to gain employment in their home regions. The participants will over the course of the project's two years not only learn more about their own communities but also about the similar situations other communities are facing.  International collaboration helps pupils learn more about themselves as well as the wider European community. \r\n\r\nBy working together we can enhance the quality and relevance of learning in our schools and help each other develop new and innovative approaches, at the same time we can promote and support the dissemination of best practice. By carrying out five exchanges, one to each of the partner schools, our students will be able to see how different communities have reacted to the same issues. During each visit as well as running relevant workshops at each school, each exchange will be centered around a visit to an important local industry. Teachers will also benefit greatly from these exchanges where there will be round table discussions about different pedagogical technics and practices which will help teachers increase the diversity of their teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe pupils are at the heart of this project and are central to every stage of it, they will not only be learning from the workshops that will be run but they will also be carrying out research on these different topics and analysing their findings themselves. We want our pupils to learn how to express their views and become motivated, empowered young adults with the skills and drive needed to make a positive impact on their towns and regions.

This course can help bridge that gap.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the course are for the participant staff to gain language competency and improve their teaching skills. This course will help the teachers embed languages as part of everyday school routine and open up opportunities for promotion of global citizenship which is a key part of our curriculum. On return, our participant teachers will share their experience with the rest of our primary staff through CPD opportunities and events we have planned for the coming school year as well as publicising their experience and promoting our links and modern language teaching to the wider community through school newsletters and local media.\r\n\r\nThe members of staff going on the mobility have been chosen based on their engagement with global learning and modern languages and by the fact that they wish to increase their competency in French so that they can teach all ages and stages and we feel they need more experience and ideas on how to integrate modern languages in other ways and into the curriculum.    \r\n\r\nWhile the national policy makes this training more essential, this course is is also part of our school strategy for learning globally.   We have also expanded our international links this year ETC ETC  We have made tentative links with a school in the Nice region of France  and are sharing ideas on how we promote environmental responsibility through effective teaching and learning.", "http://www.scalloway.shetland.sch.uk/", "Scalloway Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046790_coordinator"]]}}}}
