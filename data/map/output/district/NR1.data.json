Chemical insecticides have been used to control insect pests for many decades and remain essential to ensure a supply of affordable food and as part of disease vector control for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the world-wide use of synthetic insecticides over many years has led to increased resistance to insecticides and contributed to environmental contamination. One way to reduce insecticide use without compromising control is to use a synergist in combination with an insecticide. Synergists are themselves nontoxic but act by increasing the effectiveness of the insecticides they are used with. They do this by inhibiting the metabolic systems in insects that detoxify insecticides. The goal of this project is to develop ecofriendly synergists for use in formulations with insecticides, both in agriculture and in Public Health, enabling a reduction in the amount of insecticidal active applied, and thereby reducing the adverse effects of these insecticides on beneficial insects such as bees. On the basis of in-depth experimental analyses of the interactions of the known synergist piperonyl butoxide with metabolic enzymes in pest insects, new molecular structures will be designed, synthesized and evaluated on pest and beneficial species using laboratory bioassays and field trials. In addition, the synthesis process to manufacture these synergists will be evaluated with the aim of achieving an industrially and economically feasible process. Finally strategies will be developed that use the novel synergists to enhance the control of insect pests while preserving beneficial insects.

For pupils the placements will be a part of their in-depth study project while they for apprentices will form an integral part of their apprenticeships. As a consequence, the period abroad will vary according to which group the participants belong. Pupils will be placed in periods of 2-4 weeks while the apprentices' stays normally will last for approximately 1-3 months.One of the objectives of PE16 is to meet the county's needs for international expertise. Enterprises of all sizes see the world as their market and depend on drawing inspiration, expertise, knowledge and workforce from across borders. Through their participation in the project, apprentices, pupils and VET professionals will be given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge, both in their fields of expertise, culturally and linguistically.

The distribution of responsibilities between FVO and its partners are specified in a separate contract for each individual pupil and apprentice mobility. For some mobilities the partners abroad will be responsible for accommodation, language training and work placements in enterprises and schools, while FVO in other cases may organize all or most of the placements directly. Travel documents and insurances are always FVO's responsibility. An individual plan is always prepared for each pupil and apprentice placement. The plan specifies which competence aims are to be focused on during the period abroad. The chosen aims will take into consideration the apprentice's and pupil's local training curriculum and the need for skills development within their specific field of learning. Europass CV is used in the selection of participants and in the planning of the placement. Upon completion of the mobility, Europass Mobility Document is used to describe the expertise the participants have acquired during their internship.The participants are expected to enhance their international competence through their participation in PE16, and their individual learning outcome is to be a contribution to internationalization in schools and enterprises in South Tr\u00f8ndelag. It is expected that PE16 will be a contribution to enhanced quality in VET and a higher completion rate of upper secondary education.PE16 is a contribution to a more extensive strategy for enhancing international expertise in schools and enterprises, in the population as a whole and youth specifically. The experiences gained from the project are to lead to further development in education and new international projects and initiatives.", "http://www.norfolk.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA116-021905_5"], [2014, "Alternative Curriculum Education out of the Wild", "Norfolk County Council", 97465.0, 3, 7, "At present, there is a gap in the education and support for school-based outdoor and environmental vocational learning for young people with challenging behaviour. The outdoors and other sustainable development contexts are often far more engaging for more vulnerable pupils than the traditional 14-19 curriculum. At the same time, young people who understand concepts around sustainable resource use, conservation and horticulture will be more informed and inspired to make their careers in these very same growth areas which are currently emerging. Young people must now remain in education until they are 18 \u2013 meaning that the outdoor learning context will be of huge importance, relevance and inspiration to these very same young people who are on average more likely to fall into the \u2018Not in Employment, Education or Training\u2019 (NEET) category upon leaving education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Curriculum Education Wild (ACE Wild) aims to train educators so that they can provide high quality environmental and outdoor learning education specifically for young people with challenging behaviour, which is of direct relevance to their future careers and further education opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, there will be a transferable school-based model which supports the professional development of teachers in this niche area, with the informed capacity to support other schools and organisations. This model will take educators from the beginning of the education journey in looking at how to identify the varying needs of these young people, right through to how educators can meet these needs through an \u2018Alternative Curriculum\u2019, specifically in partnership with local education and employment partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will achieve this aim through two key areas of work:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Action Research: Each of the 3 country partners involved will deliver 2 sets of 12 week sessions aimed specifically at vulnerable young people, using environmental and outdoor / sustainable resource use / green economy contexts. This research will be key to developing an informed model of practice that is well evaluated and based on experiences of the different partners, sharing the most innovative ideas, approaches, pedagogies and practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The development of training resources: These resources will comprise of a range of \u2018tried and tested\u2019 educational activities and approaches (including session plans and case-studies), using the environmental and outdoor learning contexts, which can be delivered by a variety of individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme will see the following 5 participating organisations meet together 4 times over the next 2 years, in each of their respective countries:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Norfolk County Council, UK \u2013 The Environmental and Outdoor Learning Team, based at Holt Hall, has had extensive experience in supporting schools to become more sustainable and environmentally friendly, by providing teacher training, residential experiences for young people and leading European projects in the area of resource use and education.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Aylsham High School, UK \u2013 An \u2018outstanding\u2019 school who wishes to further develop their growing expertise around supporting vulnerable young people in the outdoors \r\n\r\n\u2022 Susted, UK \u2013 A small enterprise specialising in consultancy, support and training for education, with a focus on sustainable development who has worked with a range of schools, vocational colleges, universities and enterprises, in addition to being heavily involved in a large number of multinational projects.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Goldcrest Outdoor Education Ltd, UK \u2013 A small business specialising in providing best-practice outdoor and environmental education to Norfolk schools and communities, within their local environment. \r\n\r\n\u2022 RCE Rhine-Meuse, Netherlands \u2013 A Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development for the Netherlands and the Euregion; comprising of 4 universities, 10 muncipalities, 3 provinces and 20 primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\u2022 RCE Oldenburger, Germany \u2013 A Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development for the district of Cloppenburg and Vechta in Germany, who addresses its activities to formal and non-formal educational organisations which focus on youth and young adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above, we hope to have better informed teachers in this growing area of education provision for vulnerable young people, specifically using the environmental and outdoor learning contexts. A further spin off will be that young people in this category will not only have a curriculum which is more suited to their specific needs, but will also be of direct relevance (and inspiration!) to their future employment prospects.", "http://www.norfolk.gov.uk", "Norfolk County Council", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001825_coordinator"], [2018, "International placement for students", "Norfolk County Council", 80090.0, 3, 4, "R\u00f8ros Upper Secondary School, Orkdal Upper Secondary School and Rissa Upper Secondary School want to give students in the fields of building and construction, health and youth development, service and communication and design and craft/hairdresser the opportunity to have an internship period of 3 weeks in the UK or Hungary for the school years 2018/19 and 2019/20. In addition, we want to give teachers in department for students with special needs the possibility to visit schools and institutions in Hungary who are working with the same kind of students. For students, this will be implemented as part of the subject In-depth study project. The consortium has contact with organizations / institutions in Hungary and England respectively, which will help with the practical arrangements in the recipient country.\r\nThe three schools are owned by Tr\u00f8ndelag County and want to participate in the county\u2019s international program, and the consortium wishes to strengthen efforts of internationalization. The aim is increased mobility among teachers and students. Increased internationalization will contribute in developing the schools and provide better learning outcomes and better implementation. The schools may be more attractive to students, and it will strengthen the schools\u2019 reputation. Increased opportunities for international mobility will strengthen the vocational reputation. Several of the program areas that are incorporated by this application are struggling with recruitment and we think international mobility will improve this.\r\nStudents from each of the four disciplines will each year have the opportunity to participate in this deployment, the selection of these will occur throughout the school year and be based on motivation and strength in subjects, interest and personal suitability. In addition, it will be desirable that 1-2 responsible persons from school are allowed to visit the students during deployment time. Three teachers from each school will be given the possibility to meet colleagues from Hungary who are working with students with special needs\r\nThe students will be deployed in companies / institutions within their field in the recipient country. For students, this will be a natural part of the subject In-depth study project, and follow the learning objectives relevant to the field. They are also assessed in the deployment period through cooperation between schoolteachers and mentors in deploying enterprise. \r\nWe hope and believe that this will strengthen the participants in both their professional area and their language and culture competencies. In addition, it will strengthen participants' autonomy and personal development.

She also hopes to encourage more pupils to think about studying a language to degree level, either as a main subject or a subsidiary subject, through promoting the use of the Europass CV and explaining the benefits to employability if you speak another language.  She and the MFL department will work with pupils inside and outside of school to disseminate these messages and ideas and the long-term benefits of the course will hopefully be seen in the increased uptake of pupils studying languages from 2017 onwards as well as increased participation in trips and exchanges abroad.
