Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended.

This problematic situation leads directly to the most important goal of the project \u2013 improving the employability of apprentices, students in full-time vocational training as well as those who have just completed their vocational training course. We want to reach this goal by offering the target group customized high-quality learning settings abroad. To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded learning stays for youths and professionals in the field of vocational training. The majority of our partners can tap into a network of a several hundred or even a several thousand potential internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network including the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations.Our network has been growing for ten years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 20 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad.

This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff.

Two learners with special needs will participate in the project.\r\n\r\nThe project, thanks to the prospect of follow-up editions, helps to make mobility a structural element in schools and stimulate them to improve actions of international opening aiming to support: language and international competence of students and teachers; professional competence of the staff, teaching improvement and the relationship with local and foreign partnership. All this will, ultimately, contribute to enrich the human capital.\r\nThe 2018 internationalization plan is developed as follows:\r\n\r\nA) Mobility actions that, along with the project, will involve other 300 students altogether, in\r\n-4-week internships in FR, financed by PON 2017-ASL, for 15 students from Vittorio Veneto Institute;\r\n-4- week, self/co-financed internships for 10 students of the Cerletti in the wine-growing areas of Novo Mesto (SL) and Krems (AT);\r\n-Participation of the Institute Beltrame as sending school of the project  2017-1-IT01-KA102-005892, for 12 mobilities of 1 and 3 months in Malta and ES;\r\n-Alternance school-work abroad, for 1 week in Berlin, (self-financed) for some fourth classes of the Institute F.

The participants will have finished, or will be next to finish the fourth year of study. Abroad, the program includes a week of preparation and 4 full-time internship in company. Although mobility is recognised as school-work alternance to all intents and purposes, its duration cannot fully overlap school lessons.  For this reason it can take place with only partial overlapping at the beginning or at the end of the school year, as in the past.  The participants come from different schools where they study technical subjects (Agriculture; Computer Sciences), Economics (Administration, in a Marketing framework; Tourism) and Vocational subjects (Wine and Food and Hospitality services, Rural Development Services). The foreign partners and destinations for this first year of the project with the Erasmus+ Charter have been identified on the basis of past experience, taking into account participants\u2019 needs, the educational opportunities they can offer and their relevance for the project subjects: UK (Reading, Cardiff, Plymouth), France (Nice), Spain (Valencia), and Austria (Vienna).  These are destinations where the management and promotion of tourism and the valorisation of resources are supported by digital technology (typical agricultural products or their transformation, but also cultural and landscape resources). Mobility will be very important for the young participants in an economic context where exports of quality products are particularly significant and at the same time the foreign tourist trade has a relevant market share.  It will assist learning in new contexts different from those of a school laboratory or local enterprise for the development of language skills and to experiment work environments that employ different technologies and job organizations and have different missions.  The experience will make it possible to develop both specific professional and transversal competences: the business environments will stimulate reflection, curiosity and a desire to learn; to promote and increase adaptability and flexibility, autonomy and the ability to work in a team.  Experience in an unknown international context will also be a wonderful opportunity to develop relationship skills, intercultural open-mindedness and personal responsibility, all characteristics necessary to work in the local economy.As at the end of the fourth form many participants are still minors, schools consider it necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher who will act as facilitator and take care of the participants and their safety.All institutes will take part in STAFF mobility.  The six participants involved will be five teachers of CLIL subjects in the English language (computer sciences, wine and food, maths and physics, etc.) and the administrative assistant of the Cerletti Institute dealing with the project.

All the schools also intend to take part in the FSE and PON regional competitions for language studies abroad for the purpose of achieving certification.The schools will extend their initiatives of hospitality, referral and exchange of both students and teachers (partnerships in Key Action 2 projects in progress, bilateral relationships with schools, invitations to visiting professors and intercultural activities).  In the framework of alternating school-work, the institutes wish to provide a broader horizon in terms of links to the world of work through category associations and internationalised businesses, with lectures in the original language by experts in subjects relating to internationalisation and pertinent to the different studies.

This in order to pursue competitiveness and sustainability, fostering the reconfiguration of production systems and giving more negotiation power to farmers and rural groups.\r\nWe want to enrich our young learners with innovative skills, to support both exploitation policies and SMEs willing to grow in value (and income), providing them with ideas and strategies to develop toward a real \u201cglocalization\u201d. It is no coincidence that the forms of marketing of the typical product that we propose in the project, follow on one side the path of the short chain and on the other the openness to web 2.0 tools, e-business and social business.\r\nEvery school/vocational center involved will be associated to training experiences characterized by the recognition of credit and able to provide our learners with at least one specific skill/performance among those recognized in the Regional (or National) Qualification Framework, in order to produce new skills and improve local and European employability.\r\nWe must start from the young people that, with \"EAT in Emilia\", will have EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH, through a linguistic-cultural preparation specific for the destination country and thanks to a 5-week/3-month work placement experience in European SMEs, respectively for 48 students and 24 newly graduates. Participants will be able to develop those life skills which are necessary to become a real citizen and to integrate quickly into the labor market.\r\n\"EAT in Emilia\" is therefore in line with the objectives of the YOUTH WARRANTY, it responds to the competitiveness and internationalization needs of our enterprises and, at the same time, it offers to young people tools for growing as individuals and facing the labor market with better perspectives and with a portfolio of validated skills and experiences in a clear, recognizable and readable way.\r\nThe foreseen destination countries are: Spain, Netherlands, Malta, UK, Ireland and Portugal.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004397_7"], [2015, "Ecoljovem XVII", "EuroTrainingServices (UK) Ltd", 197183.0, 4, 5, "With the present application, Aula de Com\u00e9rcio intends to go on working what has been a priority in its Educational Project, namely, to make lifelong learning and mobility a reality to our students, promoting justness, social cohesion and active citizenship, motivating creativity and innovation.

It is planned to realize mobilities for 100 people: 86 apprentices and 14 professionals focussed on the professions hairdresser, cabinetmakers, carpenter, plant mechanics for sanitary, heating and air, bakers, confectioners, beauticians, electronics technicians and upholstery. The professionals in vocational education and training train in the field hairdresser and beauticians.\r\nThe mobilities  distinguish single and mobilities of groups. Groups contain 8 to 10 participants. The mobility coach of the chamber organise the mobilities in cooperation with the receiving partners. The mobilities of the groups last 3 weeks. At the first days of the stay the participants take part in the education of the training centers. The get knowledge of the system of vocational education of their profession. The mobility coach of the chamber helps to organise mobilities of single persons as well.\r\nAfter the mobility  every participant gets the official Europass Mobility from the chamber of trades and craft Dresden. The enterprises who were sending an  apprentice for an internship abroad get a certificate and a sticker from the network \"Berufsbildung ohne Grenzen\" (training without boarders). \r\nAs a result the project should increase the quality and attractiveness of the voacational education. The participants improve their pracical skills and know-how, their intercultural and personal competences and their language. Apprentices should get the opportunity to discover an open Europe to reduce the fears and prejudices against foreigners.
