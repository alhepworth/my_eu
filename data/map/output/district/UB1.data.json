He is the guide and the referent of this writing  and reflection process,  helped by the teatcher of literature. In February in each classroom, 5 dialogues are selected by the pupils and are translated. In March, each classroom  receives the 25 dialogues written by the others pupils in native and translated  language.\r\nWith the literature and foreign language teatchers, the pupils stage, text in hand, the dialogues. The author shares with them this work, wich is presented to the cultural venues all in the same scenic system : the public is set up in U and the dialogues are presented in the central space in french and english.\r\n\r\nBeyond a writing process, this work is a human experience, a confrontation of point of views and stakes pointed by european teenagers.\r\nThe different steps of the project lead the pupils to experiment and appropriate four social roles : the role of author privileging a cognitive and intimate engagement, the role of performer stimulating the physical and emotional engagement, the role of stage director provoking a critical engagement about the direction choices,  and the role of spectator allowing to identify, justify and appreciate.\r\nFor the operators, mediators and education specialists this project is a way to stimulate invidual expression of pupils with a work linked up to language, writing and all the semantics fields pupils cross in their every day way of life. \"What kind of world do I LIVE in ? Dialogues without borders\", is to understand the various methods professional authors set up to accompany and value the co-construction of dialogues from young people precupations.\r\nThink artistic and cultural education in terms of cultural rights lays the fondation of a recognition of reciprocal dignity of each, children and adults. It\u2019s in the framework of this ambition that the partners have conceived this project.\r\nThe 300 pupils involved during two years in this project develop linguistic, cultural and artistic skills as their ability to be in concret terms, engaged with others in a collective production.\r\nThis collaborative project facilitates pupils autonomy and initiative, encourages individual and collective skills and constructive complicity between pupils and teatchers.\r\n\"What kind of world do I LIVE in ? Dialogues without borders\" is a way to include young people to our society supporting humanist values and \"non-discrimination\" attitude towards culture.\r\nThis project contributes to the mutualization and \"co-construction\" of european good practices in artistic and cultural education helping teatchers and cultural mediators to imptove their ability to lead european projects and built european identity.\r\n\r\nA multiplier event will take place in Toulouse in june 2019 gathering cultural professionals, researchers and members of school system on free expression in writing drama for young european people.\r\nThis project takes part in sustainability of links between educative, cultural and artistic european communities concerned by  the emergence of a common reflexion on the relationship between young people and culture, the importance of crossing disciplines in education and the collective construction of cultural Europe.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA201-037475_6"]]}}, "3HW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1530316800000, "European Medical Information Framework", "Ealing Hospital Nhs Trust", "In response to the need to tackle increasingly complex medical research questions, a growing amount of human health data is being collected, either in routine Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) databases, through research-driven cohort studies, in biobanks or related efforts. However, data sources are typically fragmented and contain information gaps which prevent their full exploitation. EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data.

Intensive lifestyle modification (healthy diet and physical activity) is effective at preventing T2D amongst South Asians with impaired glucose tolerance, but this approach is limited by high-cost, poor scalability and low impact on T2D burden. \nWe will complete a cluster-randomised clinical trial at 120 locations across India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the UK. We will compare family-based intensive lifestyle modification (22 health promotion sessions from a community health worker, active group, N=60 sites) vs usual care (1 session, control group, N=60 sites) for prevention of T2D, amongst 3,600 non-diabetic South Asian men and women with central obesity (waist\u2265100cm) and/or prediabetes (HbA1c\u22656.0%). Participants will be followed annually for 3 years. The primary endpoint will be new-onset T2D (physician diagnosis on treatment or HbA1c\u22656.0%, predicted N~734 over 3 years). Secondary endpoints will include waist and weight in the index case and family members. Our study has 80% power to identify a reduction in T2D risk with family-based intervention vs usual care of: 30% in South Asians with central obesity; 24% in South Asians with prediabetes; and 24% overall. Health economic evaluation will determine cost-effectiveness of family based lifestyle modification for prevention of T2D amongst South Asians with central obesity and / or prediabetes. The impact of gender and socio-economic factors on clinical utility and cost-effectiveness will be investigated.\nOur results will determine whether screening by waist circumference and/or HbA1c, coupled with intervention by family-based lifestyle modification, is an efficient, effective and equitable strategy for prevention of T2D in South Asians. Our findings will thereby provide a robust evidence base for scalable community-wide approaches to reverse the epidemic of T2D amongst the >1.5 billion South Asians worldwide.", null, 3004993.0, 6, 12, "iHealth-T2D", null, "http://www.ealinghospital.nhs.uk", null, "h2020_194100_953939420"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["R1K", "Ealing Hospital", "nhs_R1K04"]]}}}}
