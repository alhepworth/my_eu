This approach will drive model based pharmaceutical product development in accordance with visions of Quality by Design. Benefits include an accelerated formulation development process, particularly for challenging projects e.g. for low solubility molecules or modified-release formulations as well as allowing optimization of clinical product performance for patient benefit. In addition, it will significantly reduce the need for future animal experiments in this area and reduce the need for human bioequivalence studies for bridging between formulations within clinical programmes.

The available technology for aflatoxin detection is i) laboratory-based, ii) requires sample preparation, iii) does not provide timely identification of the carcinogen, thus iv) fails to deliver cost-effective management of contaminated milk.<br/>In this context, the SYMPHONY project aims to overcome these limitations by the integration of heterogeneous technologies, encompassing photonics, microfluidics and system integration, in a miniaturised smart system that will perform low cost label free detection of aflatoxin in milk and prevent infection of dairy products.
