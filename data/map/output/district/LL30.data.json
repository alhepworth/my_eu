In an attempt to encourage student mobility, the HLW gives the students the opportunity to partake in the ERASMUS+ programme.\r\nThe intended project can be seen as an integral part of the school-intern LINGUA programme.  In this programme pupils gain an extra qualification and through the networking of foreign languages in various vocational subjects, the students achieve a higher level of linguistic competence. The  completion of an internship abroad assists gifted students willing to take certificate courses in foreign languages: for example First Certificate in English/Certificate of Advanced English of the University of Cambridge or the CLIDA (Italian) or DELF (French) Certificates.\r\nThe main aim of this project is a fostering of international experience and linguistic and intercultural competence in our students. They should also experience the importance of key skills such as a capacity for teamwork or the ability to work under pressure and thus also develop their own personality. This is entirely in keeping with the LINGUA philosophy, which encourages the students to actively use their foreign languages and develop a love for language which will form a basis for life-long learning after their time at school. Integral parts of the LINGUA concept are the application of drama in education, CLIL , the language certificates and these very internships in EU member-states. The experience gleaned in this programme also serves to ensure the quality of the vocational training at the HLW.\r\n\r\nSchool life and organization limit the period of this project to the months of June-September, while the range of languages offered at school directly affects the choice of states for internship: Great Britain, France and Italy. Students aim to improve their linguistic and professional skills in 4-and  5-star establishments in the afore-mentioned countries.\r\nThe organization of this project expects pupils to provide documentation such as a letter of intent or a contract within a stated period of time, Certain companies provide a memorandum of understanding which the company, the school and the student accept and sign.\r\nbenefits of the project:\r\nincreases the attractiveness of the HLW\r\nimprovement of the education portfolio\r\nEuropeanization , internationalization of the HLW\r\ncreate of an international network", "http://www.bodysgallen.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000513_1"], [2014, "Interkulturelles Praktikum in Gastronomie und Hotellerie HLW K\u00f6flach 2014", "Bodysgallen Hall & Spa", 20989.0, 3, 4, "The students of HLW K\u00f6flach should fulfill the obligatory practicum in the fields of gastronomy, hotel industry, and business enterprise in at least 12 weeks between the 3rd and 4th Year in Austria or abroad.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of working in a station abroad include:\r\n\u2022 Immersion and improvement of language skills\r\n\u2022 Close contact to a foreign culture and experiences of everyday life\r\n\u2022 Getting to know international work markets and the mobility of the EU\r\n\u2022 Increased abilities in management and strategies of internationalization\r\n\u2022 Strengthened  teamwork with partners from other countries\r\n\u2022 A modern, dynamic, engaged, and professional performance within the organization\r\n\u2022 The readiness to adapt new methods in daily activities\r\n\u2022 Openness for cooperation with institutes from varying fields\r\n\u2022 Promoting the tolerance and appreciation of other cultures\r\n\u2022 Potential work in an international team with one or more foreign languages\r\n\r\nThe students will acquaint themselves with the benefits of the EU and in so doing, receive a positive outlook on the European community\u2019s collaboration.

The project partnership (8 Nr organisations) is led by Glyndwr University, Wales and is both cross sectoral and pan European in its complexion as it includes four higher / vocational education college (UK, Ireland, Greece, Germany), four independent training organisations (Lithuania, Latvia, Wales and Italy).  Many successful S.E. in the more developed western and southern European countries have grown by developing their international trading practices. This has allowed such organisations to achieve the needed investment funding to deliver their aspirations and mission statements. The former focus of social enterprises on looking for grant aid to support an exciting new idea needs to change; social entrepreneurs, S.E. managers and their potential investors must recognize that excellence in innovation and local trading is insufficient on its own to generate lasting business results. The co-production of local solutions to social problems needs S.E. organizations to be innovative and have the capacity to also attract international markets for their goods and services so as to continue to deliver the services and goods required in their home localities. In the northern, central and eastern parts of Europe the concept of S.E. is not yet fully appreciated or understood and its potential as a vehicle to tackle social and economic exclusion in disadvantaged locations is subsequently not as widely recognised.  As a result there is a need to build capacity in this sector on a cross European basis so as to enable existing S.E. and new potential social entrepreneurs to trade globally in order for the organisations to develop, grow, become more sustainable with more effective and efficient performance.\r\n\r\nTherefore this project aims to develop (a) an e-framework of factors influencing the internationalisation of social enterprise trading practices, (b) a written report that reviews and appraises the support mechanisms available to social enterprises seeking to optimise their international trading operations in all project partner countries and (c) a digitally enhanced blended learning set of S.E. development and education materials for international trading (InTSEnSE). Such outputs can be used by, (i) social entrepreneurs to learn how to overcome barriers to international their trading practices, and (ii) existing social enterprise organisations to become more sustainable through international trade, (iii) educators and trainers in HE and VET to deliver formal and informal courses of education and training.  The materials produced will be open access. These results will be based on case study research undertaken with 60 Nr S.E. organisations in urban and rural environments located in differing European national contexts. The synthesis of the data from the basic research will allow blended e-learning tools to be developed that are open access. Thus the target groups for this project are existing social enterprises & their employees seeking to develop their knowledge and expertise, potential social entrepreneurs, students/learners, teachers, partner institutions, other educational institutions, research centres, employers and their associations, and policy-makers. \r\n\r\nThe short term impact of the project will be a written report and blended  e-learning that can be used for formal and in-formal courses of HE/VET and which in the longer term will help develop capacity in the S.E sector across Europe. The work will contribute to the emergent EMES research agenda on innovation in social enterprise. The work also supports the key priorities set out in the Europe 2020 agenda and the  Modernising Agenda for Higher Education that were identified in the E.U. Education and Training Strategy 2020 in terms of the way the work will contribute to (i) the improvement of the quality and relevance of teaching and learning related to social enterprise through the development of case study research and evidence based curricula related to international trading practices; (ii) the promotion of mobility of staff and students on a cross border basis that will result from participating in this project; strengthen the knowledge triangle that links education, research and innovation related to the promotion of the social enterprise.

This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_27"]]}}}}
