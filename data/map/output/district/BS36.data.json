It offers 3 main courses in landscaping and horticulture, at different levels but all based on part-time education. \r\n\r\nThe Maison Familiale Landscaping and Horticulture School is organizing work experience abroad for a group of 18 students aged 15 to 19. The work experience is to take place in June 2016, for 3 weeks for all the students, as a group, for the experience is now part of the curriculum in our school. \r\n\r\nThe level of qualification this group is studying for is NVQ 2 / 3 (also A levels equivalent). \r\nAll the students of this group have worked part time at least a year before this programme, in large or small companies or city technical branches, so they all have a little experience. \r\n\r\nThe students of our group are young still and not very mature, they have not been abroad a lot except, for a majority, during school trips in England or Spain. They come mainly from villages (population under 10 000 inhabitants) and do not have a strong developped European culture (they have mainly prejudices on other countries)\r\n\r\n The aims of the project are \r\n- To improve the level of key competences and skills of students : communication in foreign languages, basic competences in science and technologies, and here to be precise the landscaping technologies ... (key competences for lifelong learning) \r\n- To raise awareness on European diversity and cultures. \r\n- To improve the teaching and learning practices, as well as the skills of the staff. \r\n- To give an international dimension to our school\r\n- To enhance the relationship between the world of education and the labour market, abroad through our partners as well as in France, through our local partners. \r\n\r\nWe have chosen 4 countries : England, for linguistic reasons (our students all study English) as well as professional reasons (English landscape is a model in landscaping). Belgium for its cultural diversity and the opportunity it offers for students with huge language problems to experience an international mobility nonetheless, Poland and Romania for their diversity and the awareness on European diversities and similarities\r\nIn all these countries we have networks of receiving partners who have been working with us for 7 years for England for instance so we work in trust but still discuss aims of mobility every year. \r\n\r\nThe activities of our project include not only the mobility in itself but also the preparation and follow up of all aspects, from the arrival of the students in the first year of their curriculum to  the communication on results and methods. The implication and skills of our Erasmus+ team is one of the key of its making, as well as one of our aims. \r\n\r\nAll our project is based only on the desire to help our student get a better start in their working life, as good professionals as well as human beings aware of their skills and opportunities in Europe.", "http://www.kendleshire.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014071_1"], [2016, "Toujours plus loin dans les jardins, direction le sud !", "The Kendleshire Golf Club Ltd", 18529.0, 3, 6, "The Maison Familiale Landscaping and Horticulture School organizes work experience abroad for a group of 16 students in BAC PRO, (3 years course, group in 2nd year, (NVQ 2 / 3, also A levels equivalent) aged 15 to 19.

Belgium for its cultural diversity and the opportunity it offers for students with huge language problems to experience an international mobility nonetheless, Poland and Romania for their diversity and the awareness on European diversities and similarities. Malta has been chosen for the different natural environment and English language. In all these countries we have networks of receiving partners who have been working with us for 8 years ( England for instance) so we work in trust but still discuss aims of mobility every year. Evolution of the mobilityWork experience for learners : 16 have been planned for the coming project : we have 14 students in the first year of the course and two students from a lower level course are planning to enter the BAC PRO course. It is less than our previous year due to lower number of registrations. Staff mobility : In the previous project, we are sending 3 members of staff to partner organizations (companies and VET school) in England, Poland and Belgium as asked by the staff. We plan to do the same amount of staff mobility for this project as discussed with enthusiastic staff. We will keep accompanying people for Romania ( as no staff project is yet organized), Poland and Malta, as a new destination,  for the beginning of the stays, and England because we take care of the meetings with partner organizations.  A new destination on offer : Malta : a relevant one for open-mindedness to the world, for the development of European citizenship and linguistic capacities as well, for its ecological issues. We are developing this new project through one of our English partners, which gives it a moral and technical backing.", "http://www.kendleshire.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA116-022257_3"]]}}}}
