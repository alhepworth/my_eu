Having managed during that time to answer the basic existential questions, the question that arises next is: What now?We have re-evaluated our conception and attitudes. We have been thinking about what direction to take next, relying on the experience gained during those earlier years. We have also looked at how the needs of children have changed over the past 20-30 years. We have not neglected questions about the requirements of the job market, and have taken into account the need to approximate European parameters. We have come to the conclusion that, even though (because of the huge interest in our school) we are in a position to choose elite students \u2013 children without problems in any areas, perhaps from well-situated families \u2013 it would be best for our school that we choose students with a wide range of needs, skills, and innate abilities. We believe the world is not black and white, and has problems that we need to deal with, without closing our eyes to them. That's why we consciously accept to our school children of all intellectual levels \u2013 from excellent students to those with special needs in areas of behaviour and learning. We even have a special class in which students with borderline intellectual abilities are integrated into the school. These special needs, and the need for quality inclusion and integration, have led us to focus on the personal career growth of teachers in this area. In each class, we have several special needs children that require proper integration into the class community.  We bear in mind that one day they will be adults and will want to find employment, which often poses a big problem for them. And so, in their education, we want to focus on their strong points, so that they can use their natural qualities to the maximum potential. In order to do this effectively, we ourselves need professional development in areas of special pedagogy, methodology, psychology, and the arts, which are tried and tested therapeutic tools in integration.In parallel with this, we are working on building a high-quality school management that will support our pedagogical team. Apart from taking care of the daily needs of operating the school, it is responsible for developmental activities \u2013 projects, communicating with partner schools and associations, PR, and communicating with the Ministry of Education, where there are live discussions going on about changes in our educational system. For us it is vitally important to have on board people who support the non-pedagogical side of the school's operation. That's why we make an effort to send our managers for further education, in order that they become familiar with other environments and gain resources to further develop our school. On this occasion we are sending 7 teachers for job shadowing to various Waldorf schools and institutions that integrate people with disabilities. We are sending a further 9 teachers to courses focused on integration and non-traditional forms of teaching. We are also sending 2 managers to self-development courses in the area of school environment management.Expected outcome: We have high expectations, especially from the job shadowing, where we anticipate that the environment and thinking of host organizations, being similar to our own, will have a strong inspirational influence on the everyday work of our teachers. The courses will benefit us by bringing newly acquired skills. The benefits of this project will be an improvement in the quality of our employees, and the creating of conditions for high-quality inclusive teaching focused on the individuality of each student and the fulfilling of his or her potential. In the area of management, we aim to improve our communication with the Ministry of Education and with other partners.The resulting suggestions will be incorporated into the school's development plan and the European Development Plan.

Despite preservation steps during production illnesses caused by contaminated formula as a result of Salmonella spp., Cronobacter sakazakii have been reported, which can often lead to brain damage or death in babies and infants. The use of extremely high temperatures during sterilisation can cause a great degree of protein denaturation. Considering the naturally lower content of lysozyme and lactoferrin of cow\u2019s milk, which is the base of infant formulation, these ingredients have to be added at a cost to match more closely human milk, and are severely denatured by excessive heat treatment. As such, there is a need to provide manufacturers with a reliable treatment method that is effective in the inactivation of microorganisms and does not diminish the nutritional quality of the formula.\nPast research has shown the effectiveness of light technologies for surface decontamination in packaging, for treatment of transparent and non-transparent beverages, and for the decontamination of vegetative microorganisms. Moreover, the combination of different light technologies can enable short exposure times. Researchers have successfully applied light technology to reduce the bacterial load in infant formula spread on a flat surface.

The system will be safe, effective, affordable, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly. By preventing the use of excessive temperatures, the risk of protein denaturation will be reduced.

Without doubt the quality and safety of milk and milk products is of paramount importance for safeguarding the health and safety of EU consumers. While pasteurisation has resulted in a dramatic decline in milk-borne disease outbreaks, consumption of raw or inadequately pasteurised milk has been associated with several outbreaks of enteric infections with pathogens such as Listeria and Campylobacter. Furthermore, not all consumers want to drink milk that has been pasteurised, and although a niche product, consumer interest in raw milk is growing as many people believe it contains a higher proportion of beneficial microorganisms and vitamins. Raw milk continues to be consumed directly by large numbers of people in rural areas across the EU. There is a need for a technology that will improve the treatment of milk and provide an alternative to pasteurisation. Research carried out by University College Dublin revealed that the treatment of milk with thermosonication (TS) combined with pulsed electric field (PEF) achieved a degree of inactivation of L. innocua comparable with conventional pasteurisation, while substantially reducing the severity of the time/temperature exposure. This project will build on this research and will build a TS and PEF- based pre-competitive prototype system called SmartMILK. It will be tested and validated in milk production facilities. A key innovativion of the SmartMILK project will centre on optimising the combination of TS and PEF, whereby TS can assist the treatment technology in resulting in a lesser degree of thermal damage in the milk, thereby retaining more of the organoleptically and nutritionally favourable characteristics of the fresh product, while potentially achieving similar or superior shelf life to the conventional treatment.", 158228.0, 1287314.0, 5, 13, "SMARTMILK", "http://www.smartmilk.eu/", "http://www.dairyconsultant.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-09/56268.jpg", "fp7_96180_985352094"], [1380585600000, 1443571200000, "Development of a novel control technology for ensuring high quality Powdered Infant Formula", "Jwc Services Ltd", "Powdered Infant Formula (PIF) is a milk-like food intended to supplement or replace the milk of the baby's mother. The quality, nutritional profile and safety of PIF are intrinsic for the health and wellbeing of the babies and infants that depend on it for their survival and growth. Since most infant formulae are required to be instant, the preferred drying approach is typically designed to allow for product agglomeration during drying. The agglomeration improves the reconstitution properties. It is important that the degree of agglomeration and its compactness can be controlled. The identified key physical parameters governing the agglomeration process include granule size/shape and the key chemical parameters include moisture content. Properties of individual agglomerates determine bulk powder properties such as powder flowability, bulk density and solubility. These are important product quality characteristics since, for example, the product is measured out on a volume basis (in scoops) whereas nutritional requirements are provided on a mass basis. Thus any changes in particle properties post drying, during conveying and packaging will have implications.\nFor dry blending, the ingredient distribution within granules and between granules has a critical effect on content uniformity, nutrient absorption rates and ultimately infant safety. The development of a hybrid technology that is capable of assessing the physical and nutritional characteristics of PIF in real time would significantly advance process control leading to greater product quality, process validation, and ultimately infant safety. In response the PURE-FORMULA project will develop a novel Process Analytic Technology capable of providing spatial measurements of moisture and ingredient identity from the forming PIF agglomerates.
