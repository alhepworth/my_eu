The two participants are Fionnuala Magee and Zoe Heatherington.  Both teach collaboratively in a job-share capacity and have a passion for anything creative, be it art, drama, music or dance.  They actively employ this creativity in their teaching and strive to create a fun atmosphere for learning.  They wish to enhance their teaching and develop new methods of good practice, specifically through the means of drama.  With information and computer technology being a key focus in the schools development plan, our two participants also wish to improve their existing skills in this area and build a bank of new skills that will be influence their teaching and in turn, the pupils' learning.   The participants will engage in training in a new and current methodology which addresses the needs of European students in a practical manner.  Interacting in Madrid is an excellent course to help Fionnuala and Zoe to meet their project needs as this training enhances teachers' skills, confidence and competence in communication, creativity and ICT.  The venue offered by the course providers opens many possibilities to interact with appropriate and comparative institutions working toward a common European goal.  Fionnuala and Zoe will be encouraged to cooperate integrating content across the curriculum and through this training learn how to do this in an effective and enlightening way which will motivate learners.  Upon completion of the training, these participants will be tasked with monitoring the effectiveness of the training as well as spreading the good practice throughout the school.  They will also continue to develop and build their links across the European Union through various means that will be introduced in their training alongside the methods they have already employed within their classroom.  Short term gain from the training will be the personal and professional development of each of the participants along with the renewed motivation and enthusiasm that comes with working as a team to support and learn from each other, share ideas and develop means of good practice.  This will then be disseminated to colleagues of the school and shared with the key stakeholders.  Long term, we would envisage the impact to be observed throughout the school through the teaching methodology as well as through the pupils' enthusiasm and learning.  Cross European contacts will be continued through various modes of communication to include eTwinning, MOODLE and other networking forums.", "http://www.millenniumips.org", "Millennium Integrated Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002038_coordinator"]]}}, "8AN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1480550400000, 1543536000000, "Open-Centre Tidal Turbine Industrial Capability", "Nitronica Limited", "OpenHydro holds a unique position in the tidal industry. It has  developed a state-of-the-art Open-Centre Turbine with a proven ability to generate and deliver electricity to the national grid and a patented method to deploy and recover turbines quickly, safely and economically on the seabed. Simplicity is at the core of OpenHydro\u2019s design philosophy: the turbine has only one moving part, minimising the number of interventions for maintenance. Fundamentally, the Open-Centre Turbine system is designed to deliver the lowest cost of energy. Since the installation of OpenHydro\u2019s first turbine in 2006, the technology has been developed and tested extensively, with prototype designs optimised to provide higher outputs and improved economics. Validation of the full-scale, 2.0MW 16 metre turbine system following the deployment, grid connection and operation of a two turbine array at the Paimpol-Br\u00e9hat test site in France brings the technology to TRL 7. OpenHydro\u2019s stated objective is to match and beat the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) of offshore wind. \n\nThe OCTTIC FTI Pilot project, which brings together a consortium of 4 industrial partners led by OpenHydro, will achieve this through advancement of the turbine system design to improve performance, efficiency and reliability. These advancements when combined with a reduction in operational and maintenance requirements, will deliver significant reductions in capital and operational costs to achieve LCoE targets. OCTTIC will establish a robust industrial production platform and the associated supply chain to produce, assemble and deploy the turbines at scale to deliver LCoE targets and lead the development of the tidal energy market. The outputs of this project will be implemented immediately through the deployment of commercial tidal array projects in partnership with energy utilities to make significant contributions towards the decarbonisation of the European energy system and securing energy supply.", 180572.0, 3730682.0, 4, 4, "OCTTIC", null, null, null, "h2020_207016_983104410"]]}}}}
