Project gives different mobility possibilities - True International Tredu-  for all Tredu's VET fields and actors and thus enables development of the long-term partnerships with international partners. Project also supports the strategies and goals of the learning organization, including staff development and training activities and worklife partners' participation on mobility actions from Tampere region and abroad.This project is helping the process of Tredu's development work and gives direct impact e.g. on optimal use and planning of the renewed VET-learning premises. There is ongoing large scale renovation and rebuilding process of Tredu's campuses. Many of them have been transferred to locate next to/in the same building with local companies. Tampere Region and Tredu has also pioneered in Finland with practical and functional cooperation with different education levels (e.g. upper secondary school and universities). Quality management and ECVET -elated processes with also international mobility partners are developed in a large network locally, nationally and internationally. Tampere Region is a dynamic growth area in Finland and this project support the local employers' needs, strategies and vision of the city of Tampere (education provider of Tredu) and also European growth strategies in the global ecomony.During the project, lasting two years, altogether 76 student mobilities (lasting from 2 weeks to 4 months) and 59 staff mobilities will be carried out. The duration of student mobilities varies from 2 weeks to 4 months. For 10 special needs students there will be 5 accompanying persons following and supporting them on their exchange periods. 37 staff exchanges last one week and 22 of them are two-week working life periods. Besides these, working life partners will be involved; Three Finnish company members will be taking part in mobilities and four foreign company partners will be invited to Tredu and local companies to bring a fresh update of the working life trends around Europe.Tredu has been realizing international exchanges for years and developed international support services and processes through many organisational changes. Organisationally Tampere Vocational College Tredu is a part of the City of Tampere and there are a total of 21 different campuses in the Tampere region. The background idea of Tredu@Work project is to increase international interaction and connections of Tredu's students and staff members. Multicultural skills are also needed in the local working life.  A special theme in this application is improvement of digital knowledge and skills of social media for staff members and students.

With the project, we want to achieve general and specific goals related to the professions of the participants.\r\nThe students will gain and/or enrich generic competences such as: health and safety, environmental protection, ICT literacy, social competences, sense of fairness, ethics, career orientation and planning, entrepreneurship, independency, responsibility, ability to organize one\u2019s life abroad, ability to establish contact with citizens of another country, discovering cultural landmarks, learning a foreign language, learning for life.\r\nVeterinarian technicians want to develop students' teamwork skills and improve the level of skills in care for animals. To achieve this they will work in clinics in the UK, Ireland and in an animal shelter in Cyprus.\r\nNature protection technicians will work in Finland in a forestation or in a tree nursery.  They will get familiar with the usage of biomass.\r\nConfectioners will work in workshops in Spain, France and Portugal and will learn how to make local deserts. They will experience the communication process with clients and suppliers. Food processing and nutrition technicians will work in olive plantation (picking olives) and in olive oil processing in Spain. \r\n We organize the activities in cooperation with several partners.

We need to develop our internships further to integrate the work based training better with the curriculum. We also see a need to strengthen cooperation with our company based trainers for quality assurance of the internships. We plan to send16 vocational teachers and trainers to visit some of our partner organizations to acquire professional as well as educational competence. We expect a better knowledge in the European development in the professional fields of the staff. We also expect an increased ability in integrating the internships into the courses. Our heads of departments also need to integrate work based training into the vocational programs on an organizational level both nationally and internationally. We plan to send 20 heads of departments with a pedagogical responsibility to The Netherlands to observe and learn from their organization of vocational training at Learning Companies. The expected learning outcome is knowledge of a better way to organize the cooperation with our national APL-trainers which will ensure a better integration of the students' work based training into the curriculum. These staff activities are expected to improve the match between education and the needs of the labor market within our professional fields which will increase employment of youths within the region.   Activity 2: We plan to send 110 students to different partner organizations with in agriculture. Many of our students need to acquire international experiences to encourage geographical mobility and to discourage racist tendencies since they often come from segregated, rural areas of Sweden. Many of our students that apply to our educations in animal care, have a history of negative experiences at school and are in danger of not fulfilling their education. We can see that a change of environment can be a way of increasing their motivation and giving them new perspectives.  In some professional fields, such as equestrian work and jobs at zoos, the work market is mostly international. It is crucial that the students acquire international contacts to ensure future employment.We expect fewer drop outs, more tolerant and culturally aware students. More students will dare to explore a European work market after the mobility. Altogether, this will improve employment rates and counteract racism in the region.Activity 3. We plan to send 20 students from our special school for intellectually challenged. To full fill their special needs we plan to send 16 accompanying staff. The students at special schools needs are often to develop their confidence and capability. We expect the students to come home with many new experiences that have challenged them and increased their personal growth. Their professional knowledge and independence are expected to grow. The long time effect are as role models they can give inspiration to other students as well as their parents which will change what is generally considered possible for students at special schools.Naturbruksgymnasiet \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland has an international coordinator for both schools who has an overall responsibility for international cooperation and projects.

It constitutes a vital part of our overall agenda in order to integrate theory and vocational learning. This way, vocational training, course and programme goals make up a unified whole within the upper secondary programmes. We would therefore like to continue our work to develop and improve the cooperation between staff and APL tutors throughout Europe in order to maintain a high standard of our vocational  learning. Vocational teachers and APL tutors are given the opportunity to visit partner organisations as a means of taking part of vocational knowledge as well as educational organisation. An increased knowledge of ECVET and the development of relevant trade branches within Europe as well as updated pedagogical knowledge in order to integrate APL into daily teaching are expected outcomes. As the world around us changes, the demands for digitalisation in education become more and more important. It is therefore vital that our staff is given the opportunity to develop and update their knowledge in order to maintain a global standard. International exchange gives great opportunity for this purpose. \r\nWhen staff is given international experiences they not only improve their langugage skills, but also their faith in their own ability to use these skills in their teaching. \r\nAll in all, we want to give our staff an increased insight into the importance of integrating the international perspective in our daily work. \r\n\r\nActivity 2 - Students: Our goal is to send XXX students on vocational training abroad. We have a continuous need to enrich our students with international experiences in order to strengthen an open attitude towards foreign cultures, and to encourage geographical mobility as many of them have grown up in a rural environment. Many of our students who apply to our programmes within animal care already have bad experiences of school and are at risk of not pursuing their upper secondary education. We have observed how a change of environment, such as vocational training abroad, can be essential when it comes to raising motivation and reaching their goals. We also have a continuous need to inspire and give our students new perspectives which many of them do not otherwise have access to. In certain fields, mainly zookeeping and horsekeeping, we have a great need of allowing our students to do their vocational training outside of Sweden as the labour market in these professions is largely to be found abroad. We expect fewer students dropping out and an increased tolerance and increased cultural awareness. We are also receiving an increased number of students who are open towards an international labour market following their mobilites abroad.

They are produced by embedding load-bearing fibres into a thermosetting or thermoplastic resin matrix. Depending on the choice of fibre, resin and their physical structure, a wide range of properties can be obtained and in large part this explains their widespread use. \n\nAvailable manufacturing processes include hand or spray layup, resin transfer moulding (RTM), compression moulding, vacuum infusion and the use of pre-impregnated materials, which are normally consolidated in pressurised autoclaves. The choice of fibre, fabric and matrix materials influence processing requirements, so that selecting a manufacturing process is a complex decision taking into account material properties, cost, quality, capital expenditure and the number of parts to be manufactured.\n\nComposite manufacturing processes are slow, labour intensive and consequently costly. For example, RTM requires high capital investment for tooling and resin injection equipment. Prepreg materials are expensive to purchase and the cost of autoclaves is only justified for high value applications. Vacuum infusion is slow with ongoing consumable costs. Although the use of composites has increased in aerospace and wind energy markets, high manufacturing costs continue to hold back composites growth, particularly in high volume markets. \n\nForward Composites has a solution to the above issues. We have demonstrated a new process where infusion time can be reduced by over 80% and materials costs can be reduced by up to 75% compared to prepregs.
