While analysing the dominant tendencies emerging in the sector of independent language schools, it has become clear for us that in addition to the age groups of secondary school students and young adults, the number of senior adult students aged 45+ is higher and higher year by year. Since in each member country of the European Union, including Hungary, there are new job-market related and demographic trends, it is the mutual interest of both the individual language learners aged 45+ and the language teaching institute involved in adult education, that bigger and bigger emphasis should be placed on the needs of senior students.

The project is a continuation of the 2010 certified Mobinardo projects 1-5 (2007-2014). Within this framework approx. 700 participants have completed practical placements abroad in various participating countries.\r\nThe main aim is that the participants are able to partake in the European job market. On the one hand, this goal is aspired to on an individual level through the attainment of necessary competencies, (e.g. foreign language knowledge, insight into company structures in other EU countries, understanding of the domestic market as a part of the European Economic Area etc.). On the other hand, the participants receive support in their personal development in that they have the opportunity to develop, for example, their self- confidence, intercultural competence, curiosity for things foreign, and their ability to change perspectives. Both aspects are reliant on and strengthen each other and contribute not only in a quantitative but also in a qualitative manner to the continuing development of the project according to the Erasmus+ Project aims. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the participation of vocational training personnel has not only triggered individual changes but also changes on an institutional level. Within the organisational and personnel structure of the participating vocational training institutions procedures must be developed to provide an official and meaningful project participation, in terms of content, for the vocational training personnel. For example, replacement arrangements, if required work, or rather, labour law requirements, agreements amongst colleagues, board resolutions, recognition of additional acquired competencies and expertise in advising students, building networks. The participation of vocational training personnel improves the quality of the practical implementation of the placements for the students, for example, through empathic and better informed support for the students during their placement abroad, and, if necessary, also through personal meetings and quality controls of the placement work place as well as improved communication with possible providers of placements for the students.\r\n\r\nMobinardo identifies four project areas:\r\n\r\n1. Mobinardo flow: is suitable for students who are not so confident and have little experience abroad. The journey to and from the placement is organised by the EU-GS. Additionally it arranges, with the help of the partner organisations in the participating countries, the placements and accommodation as well as preparing the students linguistically and culturally. It also sets the departure dates. During their stay abroad the students are looked after comprehensively by the local partners. Mobinardo flow can be used when there is sufficient demand. (Approx 20 individual enquiries)\r\n\r\n2. Mobinardo individual is suitable for participants who, with the support of the EU-GS, are able to organise their placements themselves (placements, accommodation, departure date, and journey), here the level of support can vary. The EU-GS ensures that the Erasmus+ Programme KA1 requirements are met at every stage of the individual planning, implantation and follow up phase of the work experience. Normally only applicants over 18 are eligible for this project area.\r\n\r\n3. Mobinardo groups is suitable for groups of vocational college students who require custom fit, highly specialised placements (for example, 8 weeks compulsory work experience). Vocational training staff at the vocational training institutes are partly responsible for the organisation and for the intercultural, linguistic and subject matter preparation. The allocation of tasks between the EU-GS and the vocational institutes varies according to requirements, depending on how much EU-GS support is necessary. This process does not only lead to high quality work experience, but also achieves, above and beyond this, a transfer of Know how to the institutes of vocational training in the field of Erasmus+KA1. In this project area the EU-GS is responsible for compliance with the programme.\r\nThe EU-GS especially ensures that this project area is made public and generally available in order to guarantee the pool character of this project.\r\n\r\n4.

It\u00b4s essentially adressed to prospective participants taking part in non-commercial trainings. Commercial trainees can also be considerd but in lower ranking. By involving their  vocational training colleges (BBIs) in the prozess of organisation and implementation of the project the mobinardo- foreign work placements are developed quantitatively but above all qualitatively. (eg, the precise description of the learning agreement is stipulated by experts versed in the subject, the placement is recognised as a component of the vocational course in the BBIs.\r\n\r\nMobinardo+ is based on the structure of the previous projects, mobinardo I \u2013 IV (2007-2014) certified since 2010. Within this framework approx. 600 participants of the target group \u201c initial vocational trainees\u201d have taken part in foreign work placements, usually of a duration of 4 \u2013 8 weeks. All mobinardo projects consist of the three areas, mobinardo flow, -individual and \u2013groups, but the emphasis in each case is different. \r\n\r\nIn mobinardo flow, the original form of scholarship allocation, the EU-Service Center (EU-GS)  arranges work placements in various countries, organises and supports the complete stay abroad. Experience has shown that this form of placement is especially suitable for inexperienced young candidates. In other cases taking only limited responsibility in the preparation for the trip, disposing of  limited support from the BBIs and sometimes bad matches for participants has all led to dissatisfaction. Mobinardo+ therefore offers small flows aimed at certain groups of candidates (eg. 3x5 nursery teachers). These flows relie on trusted partners abroad. This enables the special requirements of the individual candidates to be better met, for example, improved intercultural training and support, better recognition of the foreign placements in the development of the vocational courses as well as an increased formal recognition through the cooperation with BBI- teachers and -instructors. Small flows also provide the EU-GS with the possibility to gain initial experience in innovative contents and organisational forms. \r\n\r\nSince 2008, mobinardo individual has been offered in addition to mobinardo flow. This is aimed directly at individual candidates, who, independent of their BBIs, organise their own work experience abroad. Building on the growing interest of individual students and teachers in mobinardo, mobinardo+ wants to use the contact to individual applicants to win BBIs so that they become more active members of the mobinardo projects. This could be supported by assisting teachers in the intercultural and expert preparation of their students and relieving them of certain administrative tasks. Through this close cooperation with the vocational college staff, the EU-GS, as project promoter, can quickly utilise new developments in the courses and steer the project as required. During the further duration of Erasmus+ an extension of the project is planned for the vocational college teachers und instructors.\r\n\r\nThe third project area, mobinardo groups, is aimed at small groups in a certain course, who organise and carry out their work placement abroad together with the supporting teachers and the EU-GS. Since its introduction in 2010, mobinardo groups has seen a continual growth in demand so that this project area has developed into a strong transmission belt imparting practical knowledge and process related know-how to the BBIs. Mobinardo+ will continue to diversify in this area in order to better satisfy the needs of the interested groups and also to achieve the aims of the project more precisely. Mobinardo groups takes vocational courses into consideration, whereby long-term only a small percentage of the students can take part in the scheme. Vocational colleges which are as yet inexperienced in work placements abroad will also benefit from close monitoring, strong support and relief for staff. This systematic expansion and development of structures will be beneficial to each BBI carrying out activity abroad. Finally the conditions for participation in mobinardo for BBIs who want to apply individually for mobility are more transparent.\r\n\r\nIn this way preliminary considerations within the colleges are connected to a binding framework and the planning process is therefore pre-structured.

The cooperation also offers educational establishments the chance to build a network with the aim of establishing support for the individual and in the preparation of work places.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nApprox. 100 students attending business courses full and part time. \r\n\r\nDescription of the activities:\r\n\r\nThe participants receive the chance to take part in a work experience at a foreign work place. They are supported by selected foreign partner organisations in the choice of their work placement companies as well as in their accommodation and any language and intercultural preparations in the country of their work experience. These receiving organisations ensure the on-site support whilst the support of the sending organisations is ensured through the use of new communication and information technology (e.g. email, mobile phone).\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the positive experience made with the individual training companies and due to the personal commitment of the participants in the companies offering training, the participants are offered a funded foreign work experience.

Within the last years, the experiences the PSB has made, show that the participants have better chances to get a job and above that to develop their personality. \r\n\r\nBesides its economic focus the PSB also promotes students with a technical, commercial, health and socio-pedagogical orientation. The program is intended to be open for all students attending an eligible course of education. About 70 students can participate in the different offers of internship. The new Ave-Erasmus- program can be regarded as an innovation of the previous project. Besides being a German acronym, Ave is also Latin for \"be greeted\". In Spain the word is also used to refer to a big bird and a high speed train.

It is a project intended to be serving the interests of the whole school and has been developed further continuously.  Enlarging the project was one of the goals we were able to achieve with the new Erasmus+ program. 122 students of our school were able to participate in our AVE Erasmus-program between 2014 and 2015. The project was a huge success which is the reason why we would like to start the follow-up project AVE Erasmus 2 this year.Particularly interested and suited students and apprentices of the PSB are enabled to get to know the world of work in another European country. Furthermore, they are able to increase their theoretical knowledge and their jobwise skills as well as their command of different languages and get a non-touristic impression of the respective country. Within the last years, the experiences the PSB has shown that the participants have better chances to get a job and above that to develop their personality. Besides its economic focus the PSB also promotes students with a technical, commercial, health and socio-pedagogical orientation. The program is intended to be open for all students attending an eligible course of education. About 70 students can participate in the different offers of internship. The new Ave-Erasmus- program can be regarded as an innovation of the previous project. Besides being a German acronym, Ave is also Latin for \"be greeted\". In Spain the word is also used to refer to a big bird and a high speed train. Values like flexibility and mobility are therefore covered by the selected acronym. The AVE program contains three different modules: Ave-flow, Ave-individual and Ave-Canarias. In all three cases the PSB is the applying and responsible organisation.  There are four different partners in the Ave-flow module which host the students. These partners are located in Spain (Seville), England (Brighton), Ireland (Dublin) and Italy (Sizilien/Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto). The duration of the internship is four weeks from September till October, including the autumn break. The PSB and its partners organise the flight, transfer, internship, accommodation, language course and a cultural program for the students. The internships are selected to fit the students' course of study. This module is equal to the one that has been carried out over the past few years. The Italian organisation has been our partner since 2014. All other organisations have been well-known and trusted partners for several years. Within the Ave-individual module the students organise everything themselves. The PSB just checks the application and the suitability of the company and supports the students whenever necessary. The departure can, in this case, take place throughout the whole year and its duration can vary depending on the students' needs. However, both aspects have to be discussed and specified in detail. This module was especially created to serve the special interests of students whose training company has either a branch or close business partner in a European country.Last but not least, the Ave-Canarias module cooperates with a partner on the Canary Islands and offers internships in upscale hotels. The PSB is well acquainted with the partner organization on Tenerife by now. The jobs assigned are again depending on the students' course of education. The hotels can employ various professions from carpenters to hair dressers and office clerks. The duration of this internship is five weeks and includes three and a half weeks of the summer break.

During a 4-week period of practical training the students are supposed to improve their vocational, intercultural and also their language skills.\r\nAll of our 30 participating trainees are well-chosen and are only able to take part because of their great motivation and outstanding performances at work and at school. The companies in which they train are letting them go and work in England for 4 weeks. They only miss school for two weeks because the second two weeks of their period of practical training in England take place in the summer holidays.\r\nTo prepare the students for their stay in England they all receive lessons of vocational English. Many of them also take part in our school\u2019s business English courses that lead up to B2 exams of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI. EFB, Level 2).

Host families and companies are being chosen by our partner companies in England in correspondence with the wishes and needs of our students. The students also take part in a cultural programme.\r\nAt work the students work in administration or in sales. In admin typical tasks are:\r\n- General admin (e.g. dealing with mail)\r\n- Filing / archiving\r\n- Data entry\r\n- Accounting / controlling\r\n- marketing\r\nIn Sales typical tasks are:\r\n- product maintenance\r\n- product presentation and price tagging\r\n- working at the till\r\n- arrangement of products on the shop floor\r\n- serving customers\r\nBack in Germany the dissemination is achieved by the students presenting their experiences in their classrooms and with the help of PowerPoint presentations at a high-publicity closing event with representatives of the local politics and the local press. This is also where they receive their Europass Mobility Certificate and a certificate from the school to honour their achievements.

Many of them also take part in our school\u2019s business English courses that lead up to B2 exams of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI. EFB, Level 2). This means that they are well prepared for written and spoken communication in their vocational areas.\r\nIn their lessons at our school they learn a lot about Europe and our school offers excursions to Strasbourg, Brussels and other places which are interesting from a European point of view.\r\nDuring their period of practical training in England our students live in host families and work in companies in which they have to do similar tasks as in their companies at home. Host families and companies are being chosen by our partner companies in England in correspondence with the wishes and needs of our students.

Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Poland and Turkey. An internship of eleven weeks including the corresponding exam held and certified by a German-French board of examiners will be offered by the grammar schools Lyc\u00e9e St. Etienne and Lyc\u00e9e Ren\u00e9-Cassin in Strasbourg.\r\nWith that the students are given the opportunity to get their practical skills certified and, thus, obtain a more favourable starting position on the labour market. For already two years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.\r\nAll details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries.\r\nThe participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development. \r\n\r\n 1 The students of the triennial course do a combined degree course of AVCE and State-certified Commercial Assistant for Foreign Languages.\r\n 2 Dual courses are a combination of theoretical vocational training at school and practical training in a company.", "http://www.elc-brighton.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001963_11"], [2017, "Formation des personnels de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement public agricole", "The English Language Centre", 29291.0, 3, 3, "The agricultural school of Laval , already involved in the learners'mobility abroad has invited their staff to complete their skills as international cooperation is concerned.\r\nIndeed, in  the purpose of writing the new project of our school, of the agroecological transition brought about by the government policy implying that we would need to teach and produce differently, of the welcome we wish to give to new and diverse public, and of the refurbishment of two of our workshops, it is essential for us that our staff  train themselves, on one hand in English for those who feel the need for improvement in this international language, and on the other hand in the know-how, the cultures, and the tools of various European countries.\r\n8 members of our school, working in diverse services: managers, teaching, school life, technical service, and workshops have decided to come together for this training project in order to develop new practices and in return to create an impact on our entire structure: a facilitated communication with our foreign partners, the reinforcement of the welcome and mobility of students, the deployment of new educationnal tools, and the use of new techniques of production.\r\nOur school  is in the deployment phase, with an increasing workforce, the renovation of buildings, and the reconstruction of workshops.

We want to offer our students the best possible opportunities to develop their potential and at the same time meet the demands of the European labour market. \r\nIn order to meet these wide-ranging requirements, transnational activities are particularly suitable. As well as the obvious technical content, they always have a very high level of general education and usually also require the use of a foreign language. As a result, the training courses for our teaching staff that where chosen will increase the quality of our school. \r\nIn order to meet the requirements of the 21st century, we have aimed to improve teaching in the areas of language training, methodology and didactics and to make the school even more international. \r\nThrough the increased use of eEducation tools (teaching and learning with new media) and new approaches in language, mathematics and technical IT lessons, we aim to achieve higher quality in our training.

The unfavourable situation in the area of language education at primary schools supported our interest in participating in the project because we would be able to strengthen the position of foreign languages in education once again. We are convinced that an active citizen of the EU should be able to speak at least two foreign languages and it is extremely important to support their teaching, as well as the awareness of multilinguality and cultural differences in the EU from a very young age. Mutual tolerance and peaceful co-existence can only be achieved by means of language comprehension by representatives of different cultures.Main aims of the project:- to cooperate with foreign partners and thus participate in high-quality education focused on foreign language teaching in the context of European cultures- to become acquainted with innovative methods in foreign language teaching used abroad and to implement them afterwards in our teaching system- participating in educational mobilities to support the main idea of the project: Teaching a foreign language as a base of a working European society- to improve the level of key competences of our teachers and thus to improve the quality of foreign language teaching at our school- to create new relationships with other participants of educational activities and in the future cooperate with foreign partners in an active way- to raise the standard of education of our school nationally and internationally There are 5 pedagogical employees and 1 administration employee that will take part in the project. They  all have been chosen according to their previous activities at our school. Most of them teach a foreign language, but some of them also teach Slovak and History. They are involved in the education of pupils at our school and outside the school with some of them teaching Slovak as a foreign language to foreigners living in our city.  They prepare pupils for different competitions, take part in language activities organized by different educational institutions and participate with pupils in different projects to support the language skills of pupils as well as projects thematically oriented on the life of Eurocitizens in the EU in the past and present.The project is divided into several stages. We consider the educational mobilities of employees in the EU countries the most important part. The mobilities will be aimed at foreign language teaching concerning culture, society and new teaching trends. After completing the mobilities, we are planning to create a manual in the form of a document which will contain knowledge and experience gained during the mobilities. We will try to implement that into our foreign language teaching not only by means of the participants, but also other pedagogical employees to whom the manual will be introduced. We are planning to process and introduce innovative methods, new techniques and didactical aids gained in the project into our school system; to lead debate clubs and discussions and workshops about current issues in the EU; to present the process and results of the project and share the experience gained in the project outside our institution.By putting the project into action, we expect that we can improve the competencies of our teachers \u2013 not only the language competencies, but also pedagogical, social and cultural, thus improving the educational process. They will enhance their knowledge about the culture and society of the country they will stay in, broaden their horizons about current life and share opinions on current situations and events in the EU with other foreign teachers and colleagues. Thanks to this, we can implement new methods and procedures into foreign language teaching at our school, strengthen European awareness of our employees and share it amongst our pupils.

To achieve this, the project will focus on development of the Automated Tape Laying (ATL) process to selectively place reinforced thermoplastic tapes in 3 manufacturing routes:\n\n\u2022 Selective reinforcement of existing components\n\u2022 Direct additive manufacture of components\n\u2022 Manufacture of selectively reinforced tailored blanks for compression moulding\n\nThe manufacturing process developed will have a significant effect on the weight of structures, as for the first time it will allow different reinforcement fibres (polymer, glass, carbon) to be used synergistically in the same thermoplastic polymer matrix, to produce hybrid multi-material structural components with optimised performance and weight.", 86087.0, 3124702.0, 6, 10, "STELLAR", null, "http://www.cgtech.com", null, "fp7_109190_952231250"]]}}, "2PJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1462060800000, 1556582400000, "Secure Information Sharing Sensor Delivery event Network", "Cyberdefcon Limited", "SISSDEN is a project aimed at improving the cybersecurity posture of EU entities and end users through development of situational awareness and sharing of actionable information.

In the intentions, the themes of the project are modeled on those contained in the Piedmont Three-Year Plan 2013-2015, which assumes that the overall  targets are  development, strengthening and qualification of local touristic systems; completion and diversification of the local tourism; the touristic value chain development and with sustainable use of local resources. The Plan also places among the specific objectives the creation, expansion and the qualification of  value chains that make up the local touristic product in order to develop economies system. The project involves 100 students who are attending 5 Technical and Vocational High Schools located in the Province of Alessandria. The catchment area includes the south-east of Piedmont. Fields of study and training that will be involved in the project converge on the development of the touristic and typical gastronomic products considering the whole chain value of territory (from the urban redevelopment of the territory, the back and front office company management, to the accommodation).Since the project aims to strengthen and qualify the local touristic systems, the  fields of study linked to it are the following: - Economic Sector: Business and administration , Business and administration- marketing, Travel and Tourism; - Technology Sector: Agriculture, Agribusiness and Agro-Industry, Architecture and building- Land survey ; - Services Sector: Hotel, restaurant and catering \u2013 Cookery/ Confectionary/ Food and Drinks Service, Business Services.

This experience will develop through a five week abroad mobility which provides, after an initial preparatory stage during the first week stay, work placements experiences similar to those of the Alternating School Work project, performed by the member schools of the consortium. The project emphasizes the focus on the changes that are affecting the tourism sector: the first condition to attract tourism to areas located inland, and at the same time to face the change of tourism 2.0, it is to act on future operators\u2019 education and training. These are in fact already 'digital natives', but their skills have to be studied and addressed in an informed way in the direction of a professional growth, as well as personal and civil.

The different sectors are integrated in the knowledge that the tourist reception 2.0's needs on the one hand to strengthen operators\u2019 behaviours that have to become more and more engaging and customized, and on the other to optimize the management aspects of the front office, back office, business organisation, and the application of strategic, territorial, commercial marketing techniques. Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field.

The fallout of the project outcomes within sending schools, besides strengthening existing network ties and the sharing of methodologies (in particular on the definition of the learning paths in non-formal contexts, on validation and recognition of the results) will contribute to raising their internationalization, fueling the interest and willingness to carry out projects with foreign countries (language studies, exchange experiences).

This new industrial revolution can only occur if it is as simple for real world objects to be captured, and modified as it is for music, text, and images. This is not yet the case, with most professional design software requiring a significant amount of time and investment to master. There is a real need for tools that are focused on making it simple for amateurs to create new products without experience or training \u2013 expediting the path from idea to entrepreneurship.  Our network proposes a timely and innovative research training programme for the distributed capture, editing, and fabrication of objects - from the real world to digital and back again. We want to enable users to casually capture objects, which can then be easily shared on the Web and customised in simple yet powerful ways. \n\nThe research training programme will be conducted by our network, consisting of a mix of academic and private partners. Through collaborative research, secondments, and training events, we will educate a new generation of researchers that are able to solve complex research challenges but at the same time acquire transferrable skills.", 211896.0, 2682795.0, 4, 8, "DISTRO", null, null, null, "h2020_193953_952742925"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Learning to learn entrepreneurship for low skill young people", "EMPLOYABILITY TOWN LTD", 129495.0, 5, 6, "\u201cL2L entrepreneurship, learning to learn entrepreneurship for low skill young people\u201d is an EU wide partnership project designed to identify core and innovative learning methods that best encourages success in entrepreneurship activities for startup and entrepreneurs. The project is based on the results and experience acquired in a previous project called \u201cLet's, Learning to learn\u201d for senior workers.\r\nEducation of young people and entrepreneurship are one of the most EU important concerns. Indeed in this period of crisis the level of education is very important for the employability and successful entrepreneurial initiatives of young people which could revive the economic growth.\r\nThrough the guide of experts on this area our partners countries will contribute with their wide experience finding best practices, case studies, lessons learnt and future opportunities. During the project we will deliver training and practical entrepreneurship education among training providers from partner\u2019s countries. We will design an innovative training course for entrepreneurs that will serve as a guide to solve the special needs for low skill young people and entrepreneurs to get the proper training in essential aspects of the entrepreneurship process, through the cooperation of the partners. The training course will be complemented with an e-learning platform that will work in both ways, one as support for trainers in face to face course, but also in distance and on-line training and in a third place we will create a youtube channel with video lessons to reach the largest possible amount of public and video testimonials to encourage our audience to take the course through the testimonials of the users that will help as a dissemination tool.\r\nThis partnership focuses on the development of trainers\u2019 capability to motivate and enhance young employed and unemployed persons\u2019 participation in lifelong learning. Low skilled young people face many difficulties in acceding to training, mainly because of their low motivation/confidence in own capabilities to manage theoretical contents. They lack in the \u201cLearning to learn\u201d and entrepreneurship key competences. In order to develop their willingness to accede education, a team of specialised trainers must be built, the latter developing their own competencies through some different informal ways and a share of experiences with experts belonging to other Countries. \r\nTo fulfill these objectives we have created the international network, composed by 6 organizations, in five different European countries:\r\n- A young entrepreneurship association, AJEV (Spain)\r\n- An consulting company specialized in entrepreneurship, training and internationalization, FyG Consultores (Spain)\r\n- An organization for support and promotion of modern education and entrepreneurship, Employability Town (UK)\r\n- An University, University of Thessalys (Greece)\r\n- A non profit organization for research and training, ERIFO (Italy)\r\n- A supplier of innovative solutions ICT, ASSIST Software (Romania)\r\nThis consortium will collaborate during two years (from 1st September 2015 until the end of August 2017). During this time the consortium will work together and organize five transnational meetings (Kick off, Intermediate, Final meetings, more 2 pilot meetings). During those meetings we will put in place the e-learning platform, training course, and youtube channel.  L2L entrepreneurship for low skill young people partners will disseminate the future results in seminars and conferences to the interested parts and preferred stakeholders.", "http://www.employabilitytown.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA202-015594_5"]]}}, "7HY": {"nhs": {"data": [["RX2", "Mill View Hospital", "nhs_RX213"]]}}}}
