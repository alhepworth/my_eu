For instance, an \u2018e-booking system integrator\u2019, to improve access to commercial freight booking systems, will be established. Both strategic and tactical support mechanisms will be developed, and learning from past failures will be formalised as a mechanism for improving the work of the SPCs to promote short sea shipping and intermodal transport.   A media campaign, run by a large, professional media company will establish and test the campaign in enhancing role of the SPCs and the perception by business of the need to increase the amount of freight transport by short sea shipping as an integral part of logistics supply chains.", null, 2150705.0, 11, 16, "PROPS", null, "http://www.inlecom.com", null, "fp7_90311_997831726"], [1262304000000, 1372550400000, "European e-freight capabilities for co-modal transport", "Inlecom Systems Ltd", "The key issues that will be addressed in e-Freight are:\n\n1.\tIntra-European trade is complicated due to disconnected logistic chains. This hindrance conflicts with the legitimate ambition of achieving a European maritime transport space without barriers. Linked to these issues is the broader need for simplification and harmonisation of regulatory requirements and accelerated development of EU and National Single Windows  to streamline traffic and cargo reporting to authorities particularly in the context of co-modal transport.  Further, safety and security issues need special attention, particularly in establishing efficient collaboration between authorities and transportation stakeholders to improve the development of capabilities for proactive and remedial measures to protect the environment as well as the security of freight transport networks.\n\n2.\tOptimisation of road, rail, and waterborne transportation resources to achieve co-modality requires improved ways for transport stakeholders to establish co-operation and to integrate their processes. For this, the \u201ce-Freight\u201d project will introduce Information Highways for Co-modality to denote solutions assisting transport operators to establish common end-to-end transportation processes incorporating regulations compliance and \u2018intelligent\u2019 monitoring and control.\n\n3.\tIn centrally managed networks prevailing in transportation services, coordination is achieved through the network\u2019s formal structure and central communications. The movement towards a much more open environment for the realisation of co-modality goals is dependent on transport service providers publishing their services in the internet in a manner that can readily be used by independent web based transport management systems. This requires both stakeholder engagement in the promotion of open networks and innovative but practical utilisation of web services\u2019 standards and enabling technologies including a suitable registry of e-Freight services.", null, 10725097.0, 14, 31, "E-FREIGHT", null, "http://www.inlecom.com", null, "fp7_94475_997831726"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "INLECOM SYSTEMS LTD", 718518.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_8363"], [2017, "INLECOM SYSTEMS LTD", 487507.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_8615"], [2017, "INLECOM SYSTEMS LTD", 165074.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe and seamless European transport system (06.03.03.01)", "fts_2017_11775"]]}, "nweurope": {"data": [["Inlecom Systems Ltd", "ST4W - Smart tracking data network for shipment by inland waterway", "Waterway transportation emits three times less C02 than road transport. Transport by barge is predominantly used for big-volumes, as a barge replace a lot of trucks. ST4W aims to convince shippers shipping palletized freight to ship road freight by water. These flows are often small and highly diversified volumes, loaded, transported and delivered mainly by SMEs, with complex distribution schemes. Pallet flows, loaded directly in barges or bundled in containers, need to be consolidated for shipment by water. Effective logistics engineering is essential to ensure cargo consolidation, requiring an accurate synchronisation between operators and a collaborative approach demanding organisational and behavioural change from logistics professionals. Efficient, simple and low-cost communications tools, using worldwide standards are indispensable.\nAt present, there are no dedicated tools for waterway transportation, and maritime systems are too expensive for SMEs. This is a critical issue, especially as 85 % of European river freight is concentrated in NWE territory. Consequently ST4W proposes a management solution for shipment by inland waterway transport, providing to small stakeholders a simpler and cheaper access to secure data, and enabling them to share a hierarchical track & trace service of shipment, complementing the River Information Services, which localizes vessels. These tools will be tested, validated and rolled out during the project with the support of various partners (shippers, logistics operators, ship owners, ports and terminals, waterway administrations). A sustainable and closer cooperation between waterway actors and their supply chain partners will enable more clients to make use of waterway transportation (from mental shift to modal shift), and consequently to reduce CO2 emissions of their logistics operations: We forecast a modal transfer of 600 millions t.km from road to waterway, namely 40 000 T of CO2 saved by the tenth year after the project.", 1483228800000, 1609372800000, 153688.0, "nweurope_48_12"]]}}}}
