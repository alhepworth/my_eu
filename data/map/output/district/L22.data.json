The EURO-URHIS (www.urhis.eu) project funded by DG SANCO, identified urban health indicators and their availability. EURO-URHIS 2 aims to develop methodology and validated tools useful to policy makers at all levels to make health gains via evidence based policy decisions for urban populations. The objectives are to collect data at UA level; provide tools for evidence based policy; develop methods for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment for urban population health including all relevant determinants of health; validate these tools and methods by using existing population-based registries and databases; apply the tools in the field and ensuring they are easy and intuitive to use by policy makers.  The data will be collected using surveys of existing sources; priorities of policy makers in terms of policies and interventions for their urban area and a lifestyle/environment individual survey.  The strategy will be formulated, piloted, translated and disseminated.  Data collected will be validated and analysed to develop the specific tools for policy makers to use.  The meta-data collected will form the context to investigating trends in policy, major health problems and investigating the link between the two.  Differences in health indicators could be compared for benchmarking and to make changes.  The opinions of policy makers regarding the tools will also be evaluated. We will collaborate with policy-makers, researchers and civil society through a number of activities including consultation during the development stage, through training workshops and the conference.  Dissemination will be multi-modal co-ordinated through websites in formats adapted to different user-groups. Training of doctoral and post-doctoral students will ensure future researchers interested in this expanding field.

This mobility would incorporate both traditional learners & apprentices.DCEM submitted a successful Erasmus funding application in 2017, which has positively impacted learner engagement on current courses delivered.in conjunction with host partner organisations across the North West of England. DCEM is making an application to take a party of 40 learners & 7 staff for supportive vocational educational training in Spain to enhance learner development with the intention of up-skilling students & improving employability through undertaking study visits to top professional Clubs in one of the highest world ranking footballing nations. It is the intention to empower learners & improving their employability & competitiveness in an increasing challenging but growing marketplace.This mobility will provide a refreshing learning platform to enhance vocational education, allowing students the opportunity to experience first-hand innovations in coaching techniques & methodology in one of the countries shown in the top group of FIFA ranking (6th). Historically, many DCS learners come from areas considered to be socially deprived with extensive long-term unemployment (one of the highest in the UK).  Many learners have concentrated on their preferred sport to the detriment of formal education so are disadvantaged in the labour market & may be lacking in soft skills, so essential in the workplace. Whilst DCS is able to offer additional qualifications to run alongside courses which enables students of all academic levels to take part, many students were previously disengaged with education but have re-engaged solely through their love of football. This mobility project proposes to allow participating students who are undertaking recognised, formal qualifications, to have access to world class coaching methods & high intensity training / competition within the EU covering all aspects of football.  From a platform of sporting excellence in a country highly regarded in term of innovative coaching techniques, it is hoped learners will excel.DCEM have been providing full time educational courses for learners in the UK since 2003, one of the first training providers to do so.
