Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust LBG(UK)\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\n\r\nIn addition to protection, preservation and exhibition of heritage, the \u201cmodern\u201d museum becomes a public space, a place of enjoyment and expression of cultural identity for a wider audience. Museums are going beyond the traditional dichotomy between preservation and enhancement and rewriting the same mission in new terms. Successful museums have to be aware of the interrelated issues of cohesive leadership and visitor focused public programming and make sure that visitors have easy access to all that museums do. All these could be done by a skilled and trained museum professional who can also guide other staff for the long term success of the museum. In some of the larger national and private museums in Turkey, such a staff and resources have been dedicated, but often this professional profile is not available in most of the museums. This project has been designed in order to answer to those needs and will be implemented through transferring  the innovative best practices of  the F-MUSEUM project implemented by  Euro INNOVANET (http://europeanvirtualmuseum.net/evm/index.asp.html). The first  specific purposes of the Project  is to transfer  a vocational training program of F-MUSEUM project and to revise it in accordence with the needs of the museums in Turkey through conducting current situation and needs analysis as well as an impact assessment. The curricula  will use F-MUSEUM project's innovative methodology. This methodology   will use the ICT and other educational tools  aimed at training and retraining current and potential museum professionals through an e-learning portal . This portal  will be designed and functionalized in accordance with the curricula designed within the project .  The other purpose of the Project is to develop a training program ( academic curricula )  for the  Department of Museum Education of Ankara University to enhance skills and vision of the potantial museology students through develeoping capacities of the lecturers at the university. This academic curricula will be a reference program for the museology and other relevant departments in the other universities in Turkey \r\n\r\nTarget Groups: 1.

The project targets a multitude of forest owners and stakeholders to spread integrated, transferable solutions and viable policies to unlock immobile forest resources and ensure sustainable forest functions. A novel pan-European Information System, the \u2018MOBILISER\u2019, is a unique knowledge base of innovative practices and technologies, existing stakeholder initiatives and effective support programmes in the regions and an expert system to evaluate the impact of up-scaling solutions to the larger EU context. The MOBILISER links to Regional Learning Labs, fostering participative dialogues on enhanced forest governance to secure collaborative initiatives and build commitment for improved policies and solu-tions of sustainable development. As a proof-of-concept, SME partners jointly implement novel pilot projects showcasing targeted forest use and tangible impacts on rural economies. This European Information System incorporates a broad dissemination strategy via easily accessible, intuitive, multilingual interfaces to maximize the uptake of integrated mobilisation solutions by forest owners and stakeholders across Europe and beyond. The two major European research organisations, JRC and EFI, facilitate the wide transfer and ensure continuity of the cross-regional monitoring system beyond the project\u2019s lifetime. The project will help overcome socio-economic and technical barriers linked to ownership fragmentation and develop major opportunities in expanding wood and bioenergy markets. Focused recommendations and future RTD priorities underpin vital policy areas on multiple levels and raise awareness for wood mobilisation initiatives. Overall the project secures increased supplies of wood, enhances sustainable forest use and strengthens the forest-based sector as a key contributor to Europe\u2019s growing bioeconomy.", 117122.0, 5994219.0, 11, 28, "SIMWOOD", "http://simwood.efi.int/", "http://www.smallwoods.org.uk", null, "fp7_110708_951128845"]]}}}}
