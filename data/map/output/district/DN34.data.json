Motivated by common goals, our five establishments have chosen to unite in order to share our individual skills and experience for this European project. The two new partners are facing the same difficulties as the initiators of the consortium: economic (youth unemployment) geographic (enclosure) and the same profile of students (learning difficulties, lack of opportunities, little contact with countries abroad) and a strong fear of leaving their usual and familiar environment).\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n-to improve the employability of students through a European experience that allows them to develop personal and professional skills (autonomy, self-esteem, adaptability, self-confidence). \r\n-to develop the international collaboration of our institutions by means of the reception of young people of partner institutions and the training mobility of members of staff (reception and sending).\r\n-to develop European citizenship.\r\n                                                                           \r\nStudents involved in this project are both in the second or final year of their level three vocational baccalaureate (Bac Pro) or level 3 trade degree (BMA). \r\nStudents will be preferably placed in businesses or if not in training centres in respect of the requirements of each field of training since these internships are an integral part of the students\u2019 training and are taken into account for the attaining of the qualification. Places of internship will be tailored to the capabilities of students, especially language skills.  As far as it will be possible, cultural preparation will be provided for certain destinations as well as linguistic preparation provided by teachers or language assistants. In each institution the selection criteria will be clearly defined and provided to the candidates.\r\nPersonnel selected by the principals will be welcomed in partner institutions or companies essentially for observation activities in order to enrich their teaching methods, be they general or vocational.\r\nMobilities will be organized within each institution by the mobility referent and the school Steering Committee. The project evaluations will be conducted regularly whether it be by participants, their parents and partners but also by mobility referents at the consortium level.\r\n \r\nDissemination will be throughout the life of the project, from its beginnings through to the final report and on  .\r\nThe expected results are the improvement of participants\u2019 language skills and the acquisition of personal and professional skills. This will result in greater exam success and employability, a realization that professional mobility is possible and often required to find a job. It can also be a vector of ambition and confidence. \r\nMobilities of members of staff should allow them to question their teaching practices and thus evolve. \r\nIn this project, as in the previous versions, young European students and school staff will be welcomed. They will present and be ambassadors of their respective country and its culture and will deconstruct certain stereotypes.\r\nIn the short term, we expect that this project will raise and increase ambition amongst participants both  on a personal and also a professional level whilst increasing awareness of their European identity.\r\nIn the long term, we expect a greater recognition of our institutions so that students will enrol in our schools more by choice than by default. Thanks to our European \u2018footprint\u2019, we will be better recognized by both French and foreign companies with whom relationships are beginning to be woven.", "http://www.grimsby.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047214_4"], [2018, "Arts and Service Economy Traineeships", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", 78751.0, 4, 5, "Cultural and creative industries are at the heart of the economy: knowledge intensive, based on individual creativity and talent, they generate huge economic wealth and preserve European identity, culture and values. A recent study: \"Boosting the competitiveness of cultural and creative industries for jobs and growth\" shows that CCIs employ more than 12million people in the EU, more than 7.5% of the total workforce. Allied to this, Europe's rich cultural roots attract droves of tourists from all over the world. Therefore tourism and hospitality industries are a key component of our mutual industry sectors and a significant contributor to national and European economies.  However \"EU Skills Panorama\" (Cedefop), highlights recruitment difficulties for jobs as diverse as bakers, confectionery makers, textile workers and graphic design, partly because employers see a lack of technical skills. Adjusting VET education and training schemes to the realities on the ground has been identified as a top priority for the EU. Aligned to the European Skills Agenda, the UK is ushering in a new era of technical education through T-Levels and  Institutes of Technology in order to address the lack of relevant skills to meet labour market needs. \r\n\r\nWithin this context, ASSET presents an active 12 month cooperation between EU VET schools and colleges to develop creative collaborations in art, design and culinary programmes, with an emphasis on modern, future-oriented training through job relevant placements. Staff mobilities will observe, inform and transform L3 learner placements, working with employers and host partners to identify and instill a fresh European perspective on the current UK challenge to develop substantive work placements within L3 training programmes.\r\n\r\nParallel student mobilities will provide young learners with preparation for life and work through 3 week placements in world famous galleries (Galerie Julian Sander), textile houses (Esprit), theatres (Essen Theatre) and restaurants (L'hotel Paris), developing technical and employability skills that will make them an ASSET to any employer within a burgeoning international market. \r\n\r\nASSET will provide:\r\n - 26 x 3-week student mobilities to 3 European countries: Germany (Bonn and Dusseldorf), France and Malta;\r\n - 8 x 1-week staff mobilities to 3 European countries;\r\n - Reciprocal mobilities for four European partners, in Germany, France and Malta, welcoming 26 students and 6 staff to the Grimsby Institute. \r\n\r\nThe Institute operates in an area of entrenched social and economic deprivation, where over 50% of our learners are drawn from the three most educationally deprived wards in England (IMD) and levels of youth unemployment and NEET statistics remain stubbornly high. For our Level 3 (16-18 year old) learners, this project represents a groundbreaking chance to travel and work abroad, contributing to global industry in a form that we cannot currently provide for our students in North East Lincolnshire. Their tutors, who are all fully qualified and industry experienced, will be offered the opportunity to shine through CPD to develop their teaching methodology and practice in support of the Institute's strategic implementation of T-Levels. \r\n\r\nAs a result of ASSET, the Institute will develop its approach to curriculum (with a particular emphasis on work based training), develop teaching staff and managers and drive innovations in course design that will deliver quality improvements, enhance employer/education communication and relationships and provide high quality new T-Level qualifications that are \"right first time\".\r\n\r\nWhilst we reframe our teaching and learning by drawing upon best practice in the EU context, our ambition is also for learners to experience work placements build their own cultural, technical and employability knowledge, skills and competencies in European countries who are advanced to the UK on the work based training agenda.  \r\n\r\nASSET will impact 26 learners who will become more skilled and employable within key industry sectors and 8 staff who are more experienced and confident in delivering work based learning programmes, with indirect impacts on a further 500 Institute staff and learners through contact with EU colleagues during reciprocal mobility arrangements. \r\n\r\nProject results will be shared with 23,000 learners and1200 staff via films, presentations and social media, developing inclusive European culture and widening participation in mobility programmes. Our experience will be shared with 800 employers and and local, regional and national FE training providers via business development and industry networks, providing assurance of a \"tried and tested\" work based training model.\r\n\r\nLong term, ASSET will enhance 34 lives and future careers and impact a further 455 learners each year through related re-design of CCI and Hospitality curriculum, increasing positive outcomes for over 2275 learners and 400 employers by 2025.", "http://www.grimsby.ac.uk", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047197_coordinator"], [2016, "The Art of Learning in Partnership", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", 37505.0, 4, 4, "The objective is to:  * Improve work related outcomes for learners in the creative and cultural industries, engaging 4 partners in a new collaboration, through 60 mobilities over 2years.   * Develop teacher training and placements of teaching staff to support Continued Professional Develop (CPD)* Develop new strategies and approaches to achieving work-related learning, and integrate this into curriculumThe Institute and our partners are strategically committed to improving its quality of teaching and learning, which ultimately will be demonstrated through rising achievement rates and positive student destinations.  In seeking to broaden an International and EC dimension to our learning programmes by creating new EC collaboration, this project will help transform teaching and learning, work-related training and thus lead to the further improvement in outcomes for learners. The project is the first proposal (this is for staff mobility) as part of a four year transformational programme through Erasmus to improve the work-related learning and employability of students in Digital, Creative and Cultural Industries.  The creative industries, coupled with the visitor economy reflect upon society and create creative content, graphics, film, sculpture, performance and music that stimulate, enrich and entertain, as well as generate wealth and economic value within society. The arts are an international phenomenon, whereas, to the exception of excellence in arts, most training and development at a secondary/tertiary (Further Education) level is anchored within local institutions.

The CREATE project is designed to provide a \u2018bite sized\u2019 3-week encounter which can be integrated within the 2-year course structure and challenges students to push personal boundaries and develop new perspectives from the baseline of their own personal experience. In Jan/Feb 2018, 6 students will be hosted by a leading VET provider in Malta (MCAST) and 6 students will be hosted by an experienced German VET provider, becoming immersed in European culture through living with host families, being introduced to some of the world\u2019s most important cultural sights and experiencing the world of work through 3-days per week placed in industry. The Maltese mobility will also provide the \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 opportunity for budding artists to experience Valletta: City of Culture 2018, and support the European creative community through volunteering placements facilitated by MCAST. CREATE will help students to develop the transversal skills that are crucial to \u201cfacilitating the transition into employment maintaining the workforce\u201d (EC: A New Skills Agenda for Europe, 2016).
