We believe we have positioned ourselves to fully embrace the opportunities that are available in the current and ever changing education landscape.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that the children in all of our schools and happy, feel safe and are taught well. When they leave us we want them to have enjoyed their primary school experience and be fully prepared and ready to move into secondary phase of education.\r\nThe trust formed in April 2015, is a collaboration of 4 local schools with a focus of working together to improve the learning outcomes for all pupils. Our strapline is 'Stronger together for all our children' and to this aim we share good practice, challenge outcomes and support the trust school improvement plans. We are committed to providing the best possible opportunities to develop children's skills and competencies to be effective European and global citizens. \r\nAll of the schools within the trust are part of the Inspire Teaching Schools group. This means that we work closely with 42 other Primary schools across Northamptonshire. This includes sharing good practice, moderating children's writing and MathsEach of the four schools within the trust are set in an area of some low socio-economic means and low aspirations amongst the general community. Our children come from a range of backgrounds but many have limited experience beyond the very immediate area of the school and little experiences of different cultures. We know that we need to very actively promote other languages and cultures and the recognition that diversity and difference are positive factors. We do this every day through our curriculum and our\r\nactions and words but know that we need to do more to counteract some of the more negative views and stereotypes that pupils encounter outside of school. We believe that the Erasmus+ project can give the school and children this additional stimulus and input. We are fully committed to sharing good practice and collaborating with others to the benefit of all pupils. We strongly believe in the importance of Joint Professional Development and its relevance to improving provision and outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo prepare our children to live and work in a global society, we need to develop our European and then global links.

Staff will be selected based on their role, experience and ability to inspire change and will include, SLT, teaching and non-teaching staff.\r\n\r\nParticipants will receive quality training in all locations.
