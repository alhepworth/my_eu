Engaging young people in educational activities encompassing all key ICT learning areas is vital in ensuring that post-school options for students are broad, rather than limited in scope. Disadvantaged and marginalized youth, such as migrants and refugees, youth experiencing poverty, and those facing discrimination, are often excluded from access to ICTs. The challenge is to bring together all relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, and encourage them to provide an environment that enables this youth to realize its potential in the Information Society.\r\nThe \"Digital Youth\" Exchange is targeting young people with fewer opportunities (economic, social or cultural differences) from 5 European countries, with the objective to improve the consumption of ICT tools and youth's digital skills, while developing their key competences and positive attitude towards LLL. The activities will widely promote tolerance and respect of human rights as well as focus on enhancing critical thinking and sense of initiative of the young people. The provision of a comprehensive curriculum will enable the project participants to make positive future life choices and will facilitate their successful transition into employment and further training. \r\nThe Digital Youth aims to:\r\n\u2022 increase the technical skills and ICT literacy of young people with fewer opportunites;\r\n\u2022 support young people with fewer opportunities in acquiring competencies (knowledge, skills and attitudes) necessary to improve their personal development, social integration and job opportunities;\r\n\u2022 increase participants\u2019 understanding of other cultures and countries, offering the opportunity to build international networks, actively participate in the society and develop an awareness of European identity;\r\n\u2022 improve the foreign language competence of the participants;\r\n\u2022 motivate young people to be active, provoking their imagination and creativity, empowering their visions and abilities;\r\n\u2022 strengthen the international dimension of organisations active in the fields of education, training and youth, so that they can offer activities and programmes that best meet the needs of individuals in Europe.\r\nDigital Youth targets young people between 18 and 24 years old: \r\n- at risk of marginalisation; \r\n- migrants, ethnic minorities, refugees and third country nationals; \r\n- NEETs or long-term unemployed.\r\nTotal of 45 participants will be directly involved in the Project, attending activities as: APV to plan the project activities among the international coordinating team and representatives of the young people with fewer opportunites in Spain (May 2018); preparatory work of the national groups on specific topics and software programmes, related to use of digital tools in each partner country; Youth Exchange in Suhl, DE (August 2018) with total of 30 young people (15 girls and 15 boys) with fewer opportunities + 5 group leaders; development of project outputs; assessment of the knowledge acquired; delivery of Youthpass certificates; Project evaluation and Follow-up; dissemination of produced outputs and exploitation of the project results.\r\nThe exchange will follow participatory approach, promoting diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue reaching out to marginalised young people from different cultures and backgrounds.\r\nThe training in use of ICT may increase the technical skills of the young people with fewer opportunities at mid-term and further contribute to their better job opportunities. Moreover, allowing young people to connect to peers around the world via the use of ICT is an important factor in the fortification of informed and productive youth. The free use of all project materials will ensure multiplier and sustainable effect on the final beneficiaries, as these products will go on circulating in the youth networks, thanks to the planned dissemination strategy. \r\nYouth workers, trainers and staff of the partner organisations will benefit from the exchange of experience and multinational collaboration in the development of the Project activities. At the end, they will be in a position to suggest more effective non-formal education methods for vulnerable groups towards a more inclusive youth education and life-long learning.\r\nThe goal of Digital Youth is not to be a oneoff action. It is prepared to make a longterm change in the attitude of the participants and everyone else reached towards the digital inclusion of youth with fewer opportunities, empowering young people with abilities to participate actively in the society and the democratic life in Europe.\r\nThe proposal fully responds to the KA1 priorities, giving emphasis on enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and sense of initiative of young people in disadvantaged situations.", "http://www.datacentreinstallers.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE04-KA105-016291_1"]]}}, "3EL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1235865600000, 1362009600000, "Integrated Mobile Security Kit", "Selex Es Ltd", "The Integrated Mobile Security Kit (IMSK) project will combine technologies for area surveillance; checkpoint control; CBRNE detection and support for VIP protection into a mobile system for rapid deployment at venues and sites (hotels, sport/festival arenas, etc) which temporarily need enhanced security.

Currently, many missions cannot be accomplished or imply a high level of risk for the people involved (pilots and drivers), as unmanned vehicles are not available or not permitted. This also applies to search and rescue missions, particularly in stormy conditions, where pilots need to risk their lives. These missions could be performed or facilitated by using autonomous helicopters with accurate positioning and the ability to land on mobile platforms such as ship decks. These applications strongly depend on the UAV reliability to react in a predictable and controllable manner in spite of perturbations, such as wind gusts.On the other hand, the cooperation, coordination and traffic control of many mobile entities are relevant issues for applications such as automation of industrial warehousing, surveillance by using aerial and ground vehicles, and transportation systems.EC-SAFEMOBIL is devoted to the development of sufficiently accurate common motion estimation and control methods and technologies in order to reach levels of reliability and safety to facilitate unmanned vehicle deploymentin a broad range of applications. It also includes the development of a secure architecture and the middleware to support the implementation. Two different kinds of applications are included in the project:<br/>-\\tVery accurate coupled motion control of two mobile entities.
