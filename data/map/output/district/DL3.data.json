With Coop-in project our partnership aims to raise awareness about the advantages of implementing social innovation at work by developing a complex Social Innovation Training kit for the most important potential actors of the field, primarily focusing on corporate VET trainers and mentors.\r\n\r\nSocial innovation is often seen as a privilege of charity based organisations, and not as a skill/knowledge/know-how that has its well deserved place in a company's knowledge portfolio. However, social innovation can make an important impact on the world of work, reduce costs or lead to higher revenue (e.g. by creating a work conditions where employees are more satisfied and produce better; where diversity can bring an added value and new ideas, products, processes). As a topic it is still in its infancy in the partner countries and in Europe. There is a need for VET teacher/trainers and business coaches and advisors to better understand how to facilitate and support enterprises to exploit social innovation. \r\n\r\nCoop-in will encourage individuals, groups and organisations that would otherwise not participate in social innovation. In this sense, Coop-in partnership addresses all those actors whose cooperation would accelerate social innovation in the societies.  The project partnership believes that collaboration is a key, not only for the successful realization of the present project but also for the systematic promotion and sustainable management of social innovation. The target audience of Coop-in project therefore is fairly wide.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on the latest educational trends, applying gamification and micro learning approaches; enhances commitment, learning motivation by game elements; and micro-learning  and scenario-based learning approach to ensure learning efficacy.\r\n\r\nCoop-in Social Innovation Training kit includes a game based learning platform enhancing practical approach on social innovation and collaboration, b-learning course book, self-assessment tool for social innovation scrutiny, an offline toolkit comprising co-working exercises and group dynamics with major attention on the recent CEN/TS 16555-5 innovation management standard.\r\n\r\nBased on our background research in the partner countries, currently there is no such a multi-lingual open learning portal in Europe that enables a complex methodological, theoretical and practical training on social innovation like the one described in Coop-in project. Furthermore, the application of the European Innovation Management Standard on Collaboration Management in VET is a novelty as well. The standard ensures a systematic approach for VET training and enables the development of strategic business partnership between corporate sector, VET providers and educational institutions.", "http://www.sfedi.co.uk", "Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036640_coordinator"], [2017, "Developing the Employability Skills of Displaced Persons", "Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative Limited", 241302.0, 6, 6, "According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 65 million people worldwide who have been forcibly displaced from their homes, of whom about one in three are refugees escaping from conflict and persecution.  In 2015, over 1 million people made their way to the EU as refugees, displaced people and other migrants (European Commission, 2016).  Accordingly, there are a number of reports that highlight that the European Union is now facing an unprecedented displacement crisis because of violent conflicts, natural disasters, demographic shifts and economic change elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nAvailable evidence highlights that there is great diversity within this group of people moving to the EU in terms of motivations, previous experiences, age, gender and stage of their life cycle. This diversity, coupled with the increasing number of refugees and migrants, poses a key challenge to member states across the EU in terms of how to effectively manage migrant flows and integrate refugees and migrants into host communities and the labour market, in accordance with economic and social needs of the country. \r\n\r\nA review of current research and policies highlights that technology is increasingly being used to facilitate the integration of refugees and migrants with host communities and the labour market.  The EC Action Plan (2016) on the integration of third country nationals recognises the need to harness the innovative use of technology, social media and the Internet at all stages of the integration process. Available evidence highlights that the uptake/use of technology by refugees and migrants is influenced by prior exposure to technologies, motivations for use, ability to access resources, literacy levels, norms surrounding the use of technology in the host community and gender (Leung, 2009).\r\n\r\nTechnology not only provides an opportunity for refugees and migrants to maintain relationships and friends and families, it also provides a route to raising awareness about the challenges they face and it makes it easier to receive assistance and build \u2018bridging\u2019 social capital with others (Calhoun, 2010). Whilst technology, such as smart phones, is providing a tool for refugees and migrants to communicate with family and friends, it can also be used by them to take control of their integration into the host community and develop their own learning and skills.  For example, technology can be used to gain information on available resources and support services and access financial assistance and services. \r\n\r\nIn addition, technology has a role to play in the delivery of education and training.  At the moment, technology has been used to support the delivery of basic education and training including the use of computers and computer skills, numeracy, literacy and language training.  However, others have suggested that there is scope for technology to be used to facilitate the delivery of other forms of education and training/learning and skills development such as cultural awareness and enterprise and entrepreneurship education. \r\n\r\nUsing technology to deliver such provision would enable refugees and migrants to:\r\n\u2022 Effectively integrate in the mid to long term\r\n\u2022 Provide an understanding of how to transition from the informal to formal economy, thereby adding value to the local economy\r\n\u2022 Further develop transferable skills.\r\n\r\nThe use of technology to deliver enterprise and entrepreneurship education not only empowers the refugee and migrant to make choices about their own learning, it also provides training providers and those organisations working with refuges and migrants with a providing a cost-effective solution to the delivery of both formal and informal learning and skills provision. This proposal is developed in response to such evidence and will develop enterprise learning and skills curriculum which can be delivered to refugees using appropriate technologies (e.g. smart phones).  In so doing, the project will:\r\n\u2022 Undertake a needs analysis of refugees in terms of enterprise learning and skills development needs and the responses required to address these needs \r\n\u2022 Map the ways in which technology is currently used to deliver enterprise leaning and skills development, in order to identify what works well and what works less well\r\n\u2022 Develop enterprise learning and skills curriculum for refugees and pilot the delivery of the curriculum using different technologies\r\n\u2022 Create case studies of how enterprising learning and skills development has assisted refugees to effectively integrate into host communities and the labour market\r\n\u2022 Work with learning and training providers and bodies working with refugees to enhance their understanding of, and develop capacity in using technology to deliver enterprise learning and skills development to refugees", "http://www.sfedi.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IE01-KA202-025694_5"], [2016, "Green Entrepreneurship Training - Underpinning Prosperity", "Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative Limited", 239361.0, 7, 8, "There is little doubt that the development of the green economy can make a significant contribution to restoring Europe\u2019s economy to growth by harnessing new business and employment opportunities that green businesses offer and many countries are looking to green growth as the way out of the current economic crisis. The global market for environmental goods and services is vast and it continues to grow quickly. UN research indicates that green investment programmes create more jobs per Euro or Dollar spent than many other stimulus programmes (SEF Alliance, 2009).The Sustainability Imperative' published in the Harvard Business Review 2012, insists that \"sustainability and the green economy is the next transformational business mega-trend comparable to mass production, manufacturing quality movement, IT revolution, and globalization\". It further acknowledges that \"firms seeking to gain a competitive advantage must know what to do and how to do it\" and that \"countries must act now to support green initiatives as this unstoppable mega-trend will make or break economies around the world\". Although we are still at a relatively early stage of this new mega-trend, it can be expected to continue to grow exponentially.Educationalists can either fuel entrepreneurship of stop it in its tracks, however, responding to new mega-trends with fit-for-purpose curriculum resources is just the latest in a long line of challenges that educationalists have faced in recent years. It is this challenge that the GET-UP project consortium is committed to addressing by developing a suite of bespoke curriculum resources to support young green entrepreneurs. There is no green entrepreneurship curriculum at any level available in any of the partner countries and when one considers that tomorrow\u2019s green entrepreneurs will create sustainable jobs and wealth for their communities; commercialize new green innovations that will make people\u2019s lives better; and contribute to achieving national economic growth in harmony with environmental protection; there is significant need for educational and training interventions that make the ground fertile for young green entrepreneurs to thrive.A green entrepreneurship curriculum is not just an entrepreneurship curriculum with one or two modules added. Green entrepreneurship revolves around a set of core principles that set it apart from everyday entrepreneurship. Green entrepreneurs propose business models that are not only economically profitable but also create a positive environmental and social impact. Green entrepreneurs are aware of the need to change the way society has understood development and prosperity during the last century. They aim at integrating the environmental, economic and social axis into the core business of the company and strive to provide eco-innovative solutions to the way goods and services are produced, consumed and offered. Green entrepreneurs provide the breeding ground for starting and sustaining a green economy by providing green products and services; by introducing greener production techniques; by boosting demand for green products and services and by creating green jobs.While the primary innovation will be the bespoke green entrepreneurship curriculum, consortium partners will ensure that best practice in pedagogic instruction and the highest design standards in the production of learning content are achieved. More and more people are waking up to the innumerable benefits of on-line education and training. Flexibility, accessibility and affordability allied to a persistent need for up-skilling are the main reasons that this modern phenomenon will continue to thrive into the future. While the growth in popularity of on-line learning has brought about an increase in the number of on-line learning courses it has not had any noticeable impact on the quality of course-ware available. GET-UP will harness advances in technology to generate engaging and inspiring learning content. For many educators the growth of on-line learning has created uncertainty and many feel that their professional standing has being undermined. The realisation that the \u201dsage-on-the-stage\u201d model of education and training is no longer the pre-eminent or only source of learning has led many tutors and the establishments they work for to question the veracity and quality of on-line courses.
