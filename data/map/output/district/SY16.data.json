The outputs of the project will impact on the capacity of the social enterprise sector at organizational, local, regional, national and European levels. The project partnership (8 Nr organisations) is led by Glyndwr University, Wales and is both cross sectoral and pan European in its complexion as it includes a further / vocational education college (Ireland), four independent training / youth advisory agency (Poland, Romania, Lithuania and Italy) and two community interest company/ S.E. training agencies (Wales and Spain). Many successful S.E. in the more developed western and southern European countries have grown by developing their organizational capacity. This has allowed such organisations to achieve the needed investment funding to deliver their aspirations and mission statements. The former focus of social enterprises on looking for grant aid to support an exciting new idea needs to change; social entrepreneurs, S.E. managers and their potential investors must recognize that excellence in innovation is insufficient on its own to generate lasting business results. The co-production of local solutions to social problems needs S.E. organizations to be innovative and have the capacity to attract investors by being able to demonstrate their impact and develop the organisational profile, leadership and management approach to deliver the services and goods required in the locality. In the northern, central and eastern parts of Europe the concept of S.E. is not yet fully appreciated or understood and its potential as a vehicle to tackle youth unemployment, and consequent social and economic exclusion in disadvantaged locations is subsequently not as widely recognised.  As a result there is a need to build capacity in this sector on a cross European basis so as to enable existing social S.E. and new potential social entrepreneurs to develop, grow and become sustainable.Therefore this project aims to develop a digitally enhanced blended learning set of S.E. development, education and training tools (SEDETT) that can be used by, social entrepreneurs to learn how to assess their capacity development needs (IO1), educators and trainers in HE/FE and VET to deliver formal and informal courses of education and training (IO2) .  The materials produced will be open access and also include an e-tool that can be used by social entrepreneurs to identify creative education methodologies for use in their organisational development (IO3). These results will be based on case study research undertaken with 24 Nr S.E. organisations in urban and rural environments located in differing European national contexts. The synthesis of the data from the basic research will allow blended e-learning tools to be developed that are open access Thus the target groups for this project are  students/learners, teachers, partners institutions, other educational institutions, research centres, employers and their associations, unemployed youth, education, careers and youth advisory agencies and policy-makers, existing social enterprises & their employees seeking to up-skill and achieve life long learning.The short term impact of the project will be a toolkit of blended  e-learning SEDETT that can be used for formal and in-formal courses of HE/FE/VET and which in the longer term will help develop capacity in the S.E sector across Europe. The work will contribute to the emergent EMES research agenda on innovation in social enterprise. The work also supports the key priorities set out in the Europe 2020 agenda and the  Modernising Agenda for Higher Education that were identified in the E.U. Education and Training Strategy 2020 in terms of the way the work will contribute to (i) the improvement of the quality and relevance of teaching and learning related to social enterprise through the development of case study research and evidence based curricula related to mission, structure, governance, leadership and management practices and value impact measurement tools in use (IO1); (ii) the strengthening of lifelong learning and mobility of existing employees in social enterprise organisations through the development of the digital SEDETT toolkit (IO2), (ii) the promotion of mobility staff and students on a cross border basis that will result from participating in this project; strengthen the knowledge triangle that links education, research and innovation related to the promotion of the social enterprise.

The partners will share local developments & provide & share their specialist expertise with each other.The project has objectives to:- Improve & extend the offer of high quality learning opportunities through an inclusive educational opportunity- extend & develop educator competences to increase the capacity of communities to address local needs. - increase a productive connectivity within local communities & regions & nationally & with the wider European community number and profile of participants; The numbers in the project are:Directly: 100Assisting and occasional: 230Associates (supporting, informed, core groups at celebratory events): 700The outreach from these core activities may, in rural areas (based on previous experience) include over 50% of the local population. \uf0a7 description of activities; The partners will:- Create \u2018arboreal spaces\u2019 to be publicly accessible, for meetings & reflection. - Research, collect, collate & publish collections of local & regional stories & pictures re: trees & forgotten fruits.- Provide informal educational opportunities for learning of skills relevant to the activities & the development of entrepreneurial attitudes (social & individual). The process will be the cause of - Celebratory events related to & using the arboreal spaces\uf0a7 methodology to be used in carrying out the project; The methodology will be informal, creative & experiential using processes ensuring critical thinking, open dialogue, reflection & shared decision making. The experiences & skills of older community members will be engaged & shared skills with young members. Institutions will encouraging students, teachers & management to engage with local communities & community groups will engage with local institutions.The management will be \u2018flat\u2019 with local initiators of the project as \u2018facilitators\u2019 in the learning process. Dissemination of the process is essential from the start.\uf0a7 a short description of the results and impact envisaged; and The tangible results are:1. Creation of publicly accessible \u2018arboreal spaces\u20192. Collections of local & regional stories & pictures re: trees 3. New skills developed re: tree management & conservation4. Celebratory events for communities associated with the arborThe intangible results include an- increase in a wide range of \u2018soft skills\u2019- Increased competences & capacity for all participants including learning processes & entrepreneurial attitudes.The impact is expected to include individuals and groups with increased competences able, through sharing in community life and development, to- Enhance the social capital within their localities- Access other learning, economic & social opportunities- Further assist local individual & social action with & for others both individuals & community groups- Create connections regionally and internationally- Engage with others within the European community\uf0a7 the potential longer term benefits. Primarily the reduction of isolation of individuals & communities & improved social cohesion through continuation of development of practical activities that have increased competence, entrepreneurial spirit & engagement (educational, social, economic, cultural) at all levels.The partners also hope that the success of the project will allow a further development of the project - both by sharing with other communities & by a more formalised programme of further action-research, development & publishing of the whole process internationally.", "http://www.pathways-development.com", "Pathways: Inspirational Development C.I.C.", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024491_coordinator"], [2015, "Pathways to Growth", "Pathways: Inspirational Development C.I.C.", 11490.0, 5, 5, "The project aims to develop skills & competence of Pathway\u2019s management & teaching staff & improve organisational capacity relevant to existing, developing & potential opportunities.\r\n\r\nProfile & Background:\r\nPathways, a Community Interest Company, uses experiential methodologies concerned with personal, community & social education and training, providing support to groups in UK & with partners across Europe.\r\nThere is a staff of 14 volunteers - representing expertise in teaching & learning process & development, educational & commercial management, social enterprise, community development. A maximum of 6 staff members will be involved in the mobility aspects of the project. The organisation is based in rural Mid Wales\r\n\r\nPathways has strong links with groups working in post-communist countries and regions & other less economically & socially advantaged areas. These groups, include small scale community organisations, schools, not-for-profit educational institutes, universities & research centres & local authorities. They are all working to create new social opportunities & to develop appropriate skills, competences & behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe international work is two-way process. Regular visits of groups from across Europe and Turkey has assisted in developing international understanding and practical support in the small rural communities on the English - Welsh Border (the \u2018Middle March\u2019) with an increasing number of local groups meeting & sharing the work. Such groups include town councils, heritage agencies, village hall charities, festival organisers, church groups & very informal self managed educational groups.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Pathways has, following request for support, been providing advice & consultancy on skill development to partners.\r\n\r\nIn working with groups that feel marginalised, the learning, between a UK region that is recognised as disadvantaged & similar contexts abroad, has a congruity and a sense for all, of shared purpose.\r\nIn the past year Pathways has expanded this work & is developing & supporting new initiatives, including international links in China & Summer Schools in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility Project\r\nPrime Objective:\r\n\u201cSending staff to deliver and learn\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis project creates training delivery opportunities for Pathways staff with partners in LT, CZ, BG, RO. \r\nFor Pathways these will allow staff, through cooperative processes, to learn and use experiential learning programmes in contexts very different from the UK.\r\n\r\nAction:\r\nEach partner will receive a short \u2018Training Delivery Programme\u2019 (TDP) relevant to their expressed needs. \r\nThe process provides opportunities for Pathways to prepare, deliver, monitor & evaluate its work. \r\n\r\nThe methodologies to be used will be creative, experiential and informal  based on learning methodologies developed & used by Pathways in UK contexts & developed appropriately for the specific contexts of the 4 partner agencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two further important aspects to the chosen 4 partner approach:\r\n1. The considerable type and quality difference between the partners - each will require its own carefully prepared training approach. There are university research centres (LT), small not-for-profit educational agencies (BG), Local authority educational institutions (RO) and small rural community development groups (CZ)\r\n\r\n2. The sequential nature of the project: delivering training that will use the learning of one in developing the next (4 separate TDPs).\r\n\r\nTogether these contrasting situations, each representing the breadth of work available to Pathways & with very specific individual requirements, provide Pathways with learning opportunities that will enhance the value of the whole project. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged:\r\nThis project will have provided opportunities for Pathways to  develop competences & introduce change by the structured training delivery to partners whose background and experience is a reflection of the varied contexts with which Pathways works.\r\n\r\nThe project will have:\r\nImproved management staff skills: \r\n- communication & consultative decision making processes\r\n- Strategies for course development & marketing\r\nDeveloped Teaching Staff competences:\r\n- informal & creative teaching & evaluation capabilities\r\n- Adaptivity to differing cultural & learning contexts\r\n\r\nEnhanced the organisation:\r\n- New curricula relevant to Pathways\u2019 existing and future potential\r\n- Improved monitoring\r\n- Effective marketing using IT and web systems\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion, not only will Pathways, staff, management & organisationally have improved competence and skills & be more suited to the present expanding work and opportunities, but there will be partners whose skills and competences will have been developed.\r\n\r\nFor Pathways longer term benefits envisaged include \r\n- enhanced relationships locally and with EU partners\r\n- further development of innovative training programmes and support systems\r\n- a wider network of international partners\r\n- increased organisational capacity", "http://www.pathways-development.com", "Pathways: Inspirational Development C.I.C.", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA104-013219_coordinator"]]}}, "4HQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Be a Change - invest socially", "Pathways: Inspirational Development C.I.C.", 48497.0, 5, 5, "The aim of the project BACIS - Be a Change - invest socially is to make social impact and to inspire people to be a change in the world, to become an incentive for local societies from partnership countries to be creative and socially involved.

People who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias often face cognitive, behavioural and psychosocial difficulties, including impairment and degeneration of memory and of perceptions of identity. In a social context, this can cause difficulties of recognizing, relating to and empathising with other people. These difficulties often pose a challenge for engaging socially, reinforcing their effects and reducing personal well-being. \n\nDesign can offer novel ways of complementing existing care approaches to empower people with dementia in everyday social situations. Utilising the concept of mindful design, we will investigate innovative design solutions to enable self-empowerment and confidence building of people living with dementia. We will specifically focus on two areas: personal difficulties with social interaction and environmental influences on social engagement. In these two contexts, we will study how personal, wearable designs can help mediate perceptions of identity and emotion management; and how environmental aspects can reduce feelings of information overload and instill feelings of self-empowerment and control.\n\nThe outcomes and benefits of the project will include: the development of new uses of design for helping people with dementia to engage socially and improve subjective well-being; the presentation of a robust methodological co-design framework for the development and evaluation of the designs in dementia care settings; the development of a holistic mindful model of designing and of a model for mindful care for social engagement for people with dementia; policy recommendations for the inclusion of design within dementia care.\n\nThis groundbreaking project will be enabled through an innovative consortium of academic and non-academic partners that combines research in product and environmental design, ICT, and dementia care.", 15527.0, 461934.0, 8, 17, "MinD", null, null, null, "h2020_199934_918227124"]]}}}}
