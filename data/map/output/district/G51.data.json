In theory, we know very well how we should prevent, detect and mitigate domestic violence. However in daily practice this is often not taken into account. Also, there is less research on the factors that escalate family and partner conflict into high impact domestic violence. IMPRODOVA will focus on the police side of the gap between what we know and what we do, but will also include the aspect of police co-operation with other first responders. Why, in practical police work, is domestic violence often regarded as a low priority problem? Why is the reporting rate by victims low? What are the human factors that define effective response and best practice police work in networks of other first line responders, e.g. health practitioners, schools, and youth services?\nPolice frontline responder interviews expanded by fieldwork observation data will be weighed against intermediate and top police leadership expertise collected in the partner LEA's. The influence of human factor variables in frontline operations will be investigated, and the parameters of risk assessment, also of medical practitioners, will be established and compared. Training and study materials with a special focus on scenario-based learning modules will be designed to address the barriers to better domestic violence policing. IMPRODOVA will reach out across the boundaries of first and other relevant responders by disseminating the field research findings to other professionals and representatives of domestic violence prevention and mitigation.

Then the participants will be carefully and meritocratically selected through an expression of interest followed by careful preparation and guidance with each and every participant. The Job Shadowing experiences will be held in Early and Late September 2018 and in Mid-February 2019. Finally, all participants will be required to hold train the trainer sessions with the rest of their teams, write an article about their experience to be uploaded on EPALE, Esplora Website/Blog, Esplora's Social Media or the School Education Gateway and finally contribute to a short training seminar for the general public to be held in collaboration with MCAST on VET.\r\nA short description of the Results and impact envisaged:  \u2022 this staff mobility will be regarded as an opportunity for Esplora staff to learn from and to share best practices and experiences in the field of VET and Science Communication, to allow for self development, capacity building and personal growth and to allow individual staff members/teams to view processes they are involved in from a different angle. The impact envisaged will be that of creating better tailor-made education programmes, events and offer better visitor experiences and guidance on a day-to-day basis to school students and the general public. \r\nPotential longer term benefits: More uptake of Science and VET subjects at form 2, more uptake of Science and VET courses and careers at a local level.

Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1.

Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path.

The opportunity of skills advancement and enhanced performance through European mobility is a fantastic motivator for our apprentices.\r\n\r\nAll of the mobility participants will be apprentices employed by Rangers FC under the Scottish Modern Apprenticeship in Sporting  Excellence framework which is a work based learning programme combining training and playing experiences with study for academic qualifications. The main aim of the MA programme is to prepare the apprentice for a life as a professional player but also to provide additional qualifications so that a smooth transfer onto a second career pathway can be made if necessary i.e. a professional contract is not forthcoming or a serious injury occurs.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by Rangers FC following completion of the mobility.

This knowledge will enable us to see the possibilities of using humour in our work with children and in working in different cultural contexts.   The practical skills will enable the participants to create a performance in which the knowledge is applied.\r\nThis project aims to: increase expertise and knowledge by learning more about humour in an intercultural context, build a network, empower young teachers, share skills, stimulate participants to cooperate towards creating a performance, build self-confidence when performing and transfer learning processes.\r\n\r\nEach partner will send 2 representatives to an Advance Planning Visit in January-February.
