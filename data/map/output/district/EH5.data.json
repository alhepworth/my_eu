Our learners come from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds.  As part of the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) in line with Scottish government policy we are excited to be involved in the 1+2 initiative for additional languages learning.  We strive to support learners to achieve their potential in everything that they do.  Our staff have varied knowledge, skill and confidence in French and Spanish from complete beginner to University level.  During this academic year all staff are following the 1+2 approach of embedding French from nursery-primary 7 and giving learners in primaries 5-7 opportunities for progressive, re-visited experiences in Spanish.  All staff are keen to increase their experience and skill level to improve the provision of languages learning for all pupils.  Despite their efforts and achievement to date, many staff feel that an opportunity to interact with native speakers by attending immersion training in France or Spain would be a fantastic opportunity.  By attending an LFEE Europe course in either Salignac, Lyon or Malaga sixteen members of current staff would become more confident to plan, resource and deliver high quality learning experiences for our children.  An increase in confidence would allow participants to become additional languages champions; supporting colleagues, pupil support assistants and spreading enthusiasm to all staff.  Including members of the senior management team, champions at each stage/level of CfE, support for learning teacher, pupil support assistants and an early years practitioner from the nursery team ensures support for all children throughout our school, input into policy creating and sharing with our community.  Commitment to professional development would be clearly evidenced by involved participants.  The immersion courses introduce attendees to new and motivating resources and demonstrate how to adapt ideas for different ages.  They balance language learning with cultural activities.  There are opportunities to network with like-minded individuals encouraging sharing and supporting, perhaps with moderation of learning in France/Spain or on return to Scotland.  Relationship building between our own staff will also be fostered which supports development work.  The opportunity to gather cultural resources to facilitate comparisons between Salignac/Lyon/Malaga and Edinburgh are huge and naturally encourage global citizenship.  Even to share with our learners that we went to France/Spain as part of our job could be enlightening for some of them!  The expected impact of this training opportunity is that staff will increase confidence and skill level in French/Spanish leading to their greater ability to teach French/Spanish.  In turn this will filter through to the rest of the staff through our languages champions.  France and Spain and their respective languages will be promoted and all staff will be enthused.  Able teaching staff will transfer their positivity to their learners leading to success.  An increase in the quality and quantity of languages learning and teaching will lead to an increase in learner achievement so we will need to source new resources or develop ways to adapt existing resources.  This will certainly be supported by attending an immersion course.  Champions will suggest and model resources and they will have greater access to resources created by colleagues.  Friendships formed during the courses will ensure sharing and supporting outwith our school.  Our whole school approach will lead to adding a languages element to assemblies.  Parents will be included and encouraged to support children at home.  We will share the impact of our progress locally within our community, with our cluster schools and beyond.  We aim to raise awareness of the importance of fostering a love of languages and Europe within school, to all.  eTwinning is an established option in building global connections through existing projects and we will encourage staff to investigate potential links with schools in France and Spain so learners may interact with native speakers for a shared purpose.  Increasing additional language learning will assist our young people cognitively and give them the ability to compete in today's world.  In turn this will benefit the UK economically.  There are endless reasons why additional language learning is encouraged and we must be prepared for full implementation of the 1+2 languages policy by 2020 so learners access two additional languages and are supported to achieve second level CfE by the end of primary school; staff are supported to develop a range of languages; learner experiences balance linguistic competence, interdisciplinary learning and cultural awareness through regular, high-quality planned experiences and transition to secondary school is aided.", "http://www.wardie.edin.sch.uk", "Wardie Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047010_coordinator"]]}}}}
