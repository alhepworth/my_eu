While radio, with its rich editorial content, remains a highly popular medium, listening figures are slowly declining, particularly among youngsters. With the rapid rise of smartphones, radio faces competition from many new services including music steaming platforms. Regular radio today often does not include attractive features as known from vertical platforms. And if present, they are mostly not well integrated with the actual radio programme. This is where HRADIO will deliver.\nDriven by the industry need to create attractive new radio experiences, the project will leverage the full potential of hybrid technology for radio \u2013 enabling the integration of cost-effective broadcast distribution with new online features. Broadcasters will be enabled to personalise radio services (while respecting privacy), to provide intuitive functionalities like time-shifting and, eventually, to foster and to exploit user engagement. HRADIO will pave the way to bring these features not only to broadcasters\u2019 native mobile applications, but also to portals, to connected radios and into the car. The core approach is to integrate validated solutions and to harmonise APIs which together will provide broadcasters with an abstracted service layer accessible across any device and distribution platform \u2013 ensuring sustainability and return of investment. Therefore, consumers will be able to access their personal radio services on different devices and platforms enabled by a seamless broadcast-internet integration for radio content distribution. All features will be tested in 3 phases of large-scale pilots involving broadcasters, app developers for mobile and automotive devices. \nEventually, HRADIO will publish its developments as ready-to-use Android and HTML client implementations including an extensive set of well documented APIs fostering new service developments for the radio sector.", 201452.0, 2849907.0, 4, 8, "HRadio", null, null, null, "h2020_211079_916608194"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "UK RADIOPLAYER LTD", 200726.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_13527"]]}}, "1DG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "CASH FOR TRASH", "One Terrene International", 24829.0, 7, 7, "Our training course will look at the subject of upcycling, a process that converts trash into saleable items.

We will look at methods to use upcycling for raising funds for organisations and also ways to use upcycling to create job opportunities for young people. The training course will consist of trainers and young people so that we can get an even perspective of opinions and knowledge exchange. In addition to the upcycling aspect and the entrepreneurial theme we will also take into consideration the environment and see methods that we can keep young people involved and active in the field of environmental conservation.  We will look at methods to keep youth informed about environmental issues and also to be active in their community. \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

Both Dutch and Finnish partners also recognise the challenges increasingly faced by students within their schools and the important role that schools and colleges have in supporting young people with mental health challenges to enable them to complete their studies and take a happy and active role in society.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the study visits in this project are to enable those tasked with these areas of focus within their work in colleges (or at AoC) to learn about the challenges faced in partner countries, share experience and expertise and identify new approaches to these very important areas of work.\r\n\r\n60 participants will be drawn from AoC member colleges and the AoC staff team (15 participants per study visit).  Member college participants will all have a responsibility for safeguarding and Prevent or mental health and wellbeing and AoC staff team members will all be working within a policy setting around the two focus areas to ensure maximum benefit both individually and at a wider level.\r\n\r\nThe main activities will be the four study visit programmes, taking place across two academic years, in either Sweden, the Netherlands or Finland.  Each study visit will include a national overview of the VET system in each country and of the specific challenges around safeguarding, preventing radicalisation and equality and diversity or mental health support and wellbeing, visits to hosting partner colleges to meet and talk to staff engaged in these areas of work, gain an understanding of the local environment where colleges are based, finishing with a joint peer learning workshop with best practice case study presenters from both sides and round table discussions.\r\n\r\nIn terms of intended outcomes we envisage that these will be the opportunity to:\r\n*Share/gain knowledge around either equality diversity, preventing extremism/radicalisation and or supporting students with mental health and wellbeing issues;\r\n*Spend time away from the workplace with other UK participants who have a similar remit allowing for reflection on practice, the chance for discussion on national strategy and a group approach to discussions with EU partners;\r\n*Visit partner colleges, understand the context in which they are working and the learning environment;\r\n*Hear other countries' national strategies/directives around the key issues through briefings from national experts;\r\n*Engage in a peer learning workshop with Dutch, Swedish or Finnish staff who are implementing strategies within their colleges;\r\n*Forge professional partnerships for continued dialogue around this area of work;\r\n*Find potential partners for further EU partnership work.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits include:\r\n*Cultural understanding of another EU country and promoting EU experience to other staff and learners as a means to increasing skills and knowledge and potential future EU project partnerships;\r\n*The embedding of EU examples of best practice into Prevent and Safeguarding or Mental Health support training for staff across colleges;\r\n*More informed relationships for AoC and colleges with key government departments around these key priority areas.", "http://www.aoc.co.uk", "Association of Colleges", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-046980_coordinator"], [2014, "Professional On Line Life", "Association of Colleges", 60073.0, 10, 26, "The project POLL (Professional on line life) arises from the fact that the users of our schools, pupils and students, today show up in the class, while equipped with new technological tools with full-time connectivity. In particular tablets and Smartphones, which have made their raiding, especially the latter, are reasons for distraction and absentmindedness on the part of the students. News of experiences both inside and outside our country reach us and say that  some educators and teachers managed to encourage migration to a more intelligent and professional use of these tools, a shift from a previous recreational play usage. Our main goal is to gain more familiarity with this new frontier of technology, both software and hardware aspects, a multiplicity of applications that enrich the daily market of this sector and open up horizons very interesting of usage for teaching and learning. A second key moment of this project activity will be a direct comparison with the experiences that in some schools throughout Europe have been gradually accumulating with significant advance, compared to our educational environments. Sometimes people are not always immediate in their attempts to adapt the communication technology, and are instinctively tempted to consider these devices more than a hindrance to the educational process. Finally, we will configure as operational objective of this project, small teams of experts able to assist and train colleagues and staff schools of our region, in the use of new technologies in teaching. The experience of the schools in other countries, not only opens new horizons on the use of modern technologies, but it is part of an attempt to update and expand our idea of school and education, thanks to stimuli that only a direct contact with others can give. Italian schools participating in this partnership are part of DEURE Network (European Dimension of Education) they have been active for many years in the dissemination of European directives in education, with a large experience in European projects in many different types of Actions.  As always, the benefits in terms of language learning in Europe should not be overlooked, in view of the obligation to use the second language in CLIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Sending Schools :\r\n\r\n- Istituto Tecnico Industriale Statale G.

At it's heart is the is the Government's Prevent Duty for England and Wales.  Educational organisations must comply with the Prevent duty and take a due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism.  Indeed, in England this is now a mandatory part of the OfSTED inspection for Further Education (FE) colleges. Surrounding this, however, are the wider issues that support Prevent in FE colleges - namely equality and diversity, inclusion and safeguarding.  Colleges within the AoC membership (England) have appointed Prevent co-ordinators whose responsibility it is to undertake to develop and deliver Prevent training to colleagues at all levels across the organisation - from governors to senior leadership teams, from academic staff to support staff. This duty sits within a college's safeguarding responsibilities and links closely with equality and diversity.  Many colleges are tying all these areas in together when addressing the Prevent duty.   These are all issues that our partners in the Netherlands and Sweden face.  With large, ethnically diverse student populations, our partners share many of the challenges of those in the UK, but they also face particular issues such as forced marriages in the Netherlands and defection to Syria in Sweden within the locality of one of the partner colleges. The objectives of this project are to organise two group study visits (one to each country) to enable those tasked with this area of focus within their work to learn about the challenges faced in partner countries, share experience and expertise and identify new approaches to this very important and mandatory area of work.  30 participants will be drawn from AoC member colleges and the AoC staff team.

The aim is to train experts that can focus on the above-mentioned setting, creating new opportunities for innovative and sustainable growth,through new standards and best practices.It is important specifically:\r\nTo enhance skills and competencies of learners in the following sectors: tourist, commercial and nautical,in the three macro-areas of the supply-chain of the sea, to cover the needs of the professional profiles that are  required in this field and to encourage a greater extension of the Blue Economy in Sicily;Strengthen language skills; Strengthen useful knowledge for the creation of new business realities.\r\n80 beneficiaries will be split into two flows of mobility and the mobility will affect  following countries:France,United Kingdom, Belgium and Malta,where indeed it will be possible to also improve their language skills, taking advantage of mobility in order  to learn two of the most spoken languages in the world:english and french. \r\nThe project,which last for 24 months and it will be oriented to new graduates of Technical and Vocational Sicilian Institutes,who will have  achieved their high school degree  in the following addresses: Tourist, Hospitality and Tourism,Transportation and Logistic Commercial.The selection will take place with the support of an examination board who will evaluate the profiles of the individual at first according to what concerns both the linguistic skills and motivation. In order to draw up the final ranking  it will be necessary to involve also some foreign bodies, in order to make the choice  fall again  on  some candidates who have suitable profiles with the job opportunities offered by companies that will be identified for the internship.During the whole period of the project, all involved actors will work all together , sharing decisions,planning activities,monitoring the entire path, to reach a final evaluation, not only according to the experience of the candidates but according to the impacts too that SEAS  will have  both on them and on the territory. The project originated, in fact,from the desire to increase the opportunities for professional growth of learners through a working experience that can allow them to be in touch with the different social-cultural realities  but also with a concept of both living and working  in a different way.The intent is to let them get both a know-how and some good practices  to be internalized  and brought back when returnng in Italy,in order to use them then for their own professional future and for a greater development of the territory.\r\nThe project will have an impact not only on the current education of beneficiaries but also on the proponent and on members of the Consortium that will give life to new contacts with local and foreign companies and they will  both extend their network of schools and stimulate the staff to subscribe to European platforms in order to communicate with colleagues to share good practices and to increase the  visibility through the Erasmus mobility.\r\nIn a short term period  the project aims to generate,at least for the 70% of learners,the possibility to continue the work that  began   with the internship abroad and it wants to reserve a fast track because of searching  of employment for  beneficiaries,succeeding to ensure then some  proposals for further placements when returning from mobility abroad.\r\nIn addition,the dissemination step will alert not only the entire school community,but also families, institutions, agencies,local businesses and stakeholders,bringing the results in terms of learning outcomes and good practices in the

Hojskole (DK), Elegast (BE) and Sons and Daughters of the World (DK) as project partners and the London Borough of Newham (UK) as associate partners. It is set against a context of social polarisation, in which there is a strong need for educational methods which emphasise tolerance, inclusion and active citizenship. \r\n\r\nIts main activities will be fourfold. It will design supporting materials for the Citizenship curriculum for secondary school students, already developed under the successful TERRA II programme ( www.terratoolkit.eu). It will develop a citizenship lesson materials for primary schools based upon mindfulness and inclusion, and supporting materials to accompany it will develope materials and a framework for school based family support programmes for parents who are worried about radicalisation. A network of people who have formerly been members of radical organisations will be established who , along with protocols for their contacts with schools and young people, and that contact will be initiated during the funding period.\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of our activities will be to contribute to community cohesion through education, providing innoculation against the radical messages of extremist groups, fostering bonds between schools and families and promoting inclusion, tolerance and omniculturalism. \r\n\r\nConsortium partners have been carefully selected from several years of experience in working together on other European projects relating to radicalisation on the basis of their expertise in this area, their solid network both in the fields of counter narratives and education and their capacity to fulfill their tasks within the project, including dissemination activities. \r\n\r\nOther participants, mainly schools who will be trained and supported, will initially be selected from within their existing networks, but we confidently anticipate on the basis of past experience that this basis will broaden during the course of our project as a result of a snowball effect. We will reach above 10,000 participants who do not recieve funding as part of this project. \r\n\r\nThe methods and networks which we will establish during this project will be self sustaining and continue to impact beyond the funding period. \r\n\r\nOur project is designed to make a significant contribution to resilient societies by supporting tolerance and inclusion. In doing so, it will develop and deliver new eductaional methods, benefitting current and future teachers at both primary and secondary school level and fostering closer ties between schools and the families they serve.", "http://www.quilliamfoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA201-035188_3"]]}}}}
