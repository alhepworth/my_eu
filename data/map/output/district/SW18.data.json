Our innovative solution meets these needs by providing a value for money, light sensitive sensor that produces high definition images of non-illuminated areas at night and in low light conditions.\nCurrent technology suffers from poor light conversion and sensitivity therefore, to see at night and in low light conditions, the scene needs to be illuminated. Our proposal is to improve sensitivity by using sensors with organic compounds that are sensitive to background sky radiation (1.5 micron). We will also develop Application Specific Integrated Circuits to process the sensor output. The novelty in our innovation is the integration of new technologies and the processing of data produced by a 1.5 micron organic sensor. This will deliver high resolution images at night and in low light conditions.\nOur solution will reduce the energy required to illuminate urban soft targets and critical infrastructure. Added benefits include a reduction in light pollution and that surveillance can be carried out in areas which have lighting restrictions. The development of a proven, production ready system is the ultimate aim of the project. In Phase 1 we will carry out a feasibility study to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of our proposal. Our feasibility study will consider the results of relevant European and International research.\nWe plan to further develop our prototype and carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative solution. The results of Phase1 will inform the direction of our future development activity in Phase 2.

This project addresses needs reported by YP consulted for this application which include lack of motivation and direction and uncertainty about their role in the world. Most of the project\u2019s target group of young people have fewer opportunities because they are NEET, in poverty and lack key skills and competences. Many are marginalised which can lead to loss motivation, to mental ill-health and sometimes extremism. The project offers youth workers new tools and informal learning materials to provide inspiration and practical activities for youth workers.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nThis is a highly collaborative project with youth workers and young people.YP and youth workers will co-design the informal learning programme and materials used to support the planning and implementation of the Takeover Days and also participatory impact assessment tools \u2013  these elements will comprise the \u2018TO:DAY Toolkit'.\r\nAs the UK is the only partner with experience of Takeover Days, it will provide the initial model for partners to explore. This will be supported by research and mapping of activities promoting youth empowerment and participation in each partner country to inform the development of the TODAY kit. A series of participatory workshops combining critical thinking and the \u2018mango tree\u2019 approach will be held with young people to create the Toolkit. Intellectual outputs have been carefully planned to cover different elements of the TO:Day Kit with the 4th and final IO a substantial document detailing the experiences and lessons learned and policy recommendations. \r\n\r\nINNOVATION\r\nThe project provides youth workers with an innovative, in 3 of the 4 partner countries, tool - the Takeover Day Toolkit, to use informal, experiential learning to encourage the participation and empowerment of young people .It will develop a participatory evaluation framework (which is an innovation for all 4 partners) to help youth workers and YP assess the impact of the 'Takeover day' on their lives. YP will be involved in co-creating the project's intellectual outputs and have been involved in the preparation of this application through Wandsworth's Youth Forum.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nYOUNG PEOPLE will become empowered through an improved understanding and awareness of civil and other institutions and active citizenship. YOUTH WORKERS will improve professional development and skills and gain access to new learning methods.

The target group are child care workers and nursery school teachers in VET (second year of education). The participants will be doing a six-week-internship integrated in accordance with their training and examination regulations with Paris (Cr\u00e9teil), Prague, Dublin, Brighton, Pevensey-Westham and London (Wandsworth and Croydon being the places of venue. The task-based main focus will be on acquiring and broadening skills and competences in the fields of language, culture and interculturality, nursery and child care as well as personal development and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, it is the aim of the project to enable the participants, by means of comparing the relevant pedagogical approaches, to get to know and learn about European educational concepts, in particular early childhood education. To that end, the participants will have the opportunity to compare both the concepts and the practical work in Germany and the European partners with a clear focus on educational and social backgrounds as well as pedagogical concepts and methodology. In that connection, the salient points are the challenge of early learning and inclusion. By intensifying adaptability, coooperation, linguistic competence, flexibility, ability to reflect, independence and generally broadening horizons, the participants will enhance their personal, interpersonal and professional skills. It has become characteristic of our school policy to implement European internships which have contributed immensely to the quality of our syllabus and pedagogical work.\r\nIn order to achieve and substantiate those goals and targets, we are using ECVET elements to ensure quality under operational parameters. To that end, we are using evaluation sheets approved on 17 February 2014 by the national agency for ECVET (Ms K\u00fc\u00dfner) that are available in German and English. On the basis of these evaluation sheets we have - in collaboration with the national agency for ECVET - developed an ECVET-tool of our own which has been accepted by the national agency for ECVET (see attached). We are also planning to implement the relevant ECVET tools, like the learning agreement forms and the memorandum of understanding. \r\nThe project will be running from the beginning of November to Mid-December 2014 and 2015.

It triggers confidence and faith in their own strength and the desire to use the individual abilities. On the other hand is shown the lack of acceptance for each other, which manifests itself in highlighting their shortcomings and not noticing or not appreciating what they have already achieved.\r\n\r\nProject\u2019s aim is to help teachers and our school in helping our students to see their strengths. Teach them how to beneficially present and reinforce faith in their own abilities. Create a climate in which self-acceptance and self-esteem is constantly created, developed and strengthened. We want to look at ways of motivating students with disabilities find in themselves their dormant talents in order to use them later in gainful employment. The essence of the school is not teaching for teaching, but for the personal development and to build a personality ready to take responsibility in all aspects of their adult life.\r\n\r\nThe fact that encouraged us to cooperate with the Beatrix Potter Primary School in London is a model partnership in the framework of the Partnership School Project \"Unvoiced Narratives of students\", started in 2013. \r\n\r\nWhat is more it is a school which has been awarded with many prestigious awards for continuous improvement of the quality of work and the use of innovation visible in almost every area of its work.

That's why our common decision of cooperation in order to \"look into\" the methods used by the school to motivate students to learn and \"look into\" teaching methods was taken. We are also looking for the ways that after the critical analysis could be adapted to our native institution as inclusive school where children with special educational needs and educational represent 25% of our students. Beatrix Potter Primary School in London could increase our power of influence and enrich our educational and education products, and thus contribute to improving the quality of teaching and education in our school.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to increase the language skills of the project participant, which in the future will result in the acquisition of his qualifications in the field of English language teaching. We are convinced that staying in a natural language environment is the best way to learn English, and our school is constantly in need of true professionals to work with children with various disabilities. \r\n\r\nNoteworthy is also the fact that the partner school has a lot of Polish pupils - children of Polish immigrants.

Underfloor insulation is one of the most effective ways of preventing energy loss and draughts but traditional methods are expensive, very disruptive to occupiers and can be hazardous for installers. \n\nQ-Bot is developing an innovative underfloor insulation system that has the potential to improve the energy foot print of millions of Europe's least energy efficient buildings by as much as 25% while reducing installation costs by 50 to 75%. The small robotic device is unique and superior to other underfloor insulation in that it can access uneven and tight spaces and underfloor voids in order to install insulation. The device enables homes, which would otherwise be difficult, expensive and potentially hazardous to treat, to be made much more energy-efficient, at much lower cost and with minimal disruption for the occupier.\n\nQ-Bot's technology has been proven to work in prototype trials (TRL6) and is currently being tested in the field at a small number of customer sites (TRL7). The technology is highly scalable and can be deployed easily within existing distribution systems.
