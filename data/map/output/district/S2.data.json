In addition to this we also have quite high proportions of children with EAL (20%) and some Roma Gypsy .\r\n\r\nMany of our children lack opportunities for travel and to meet people outside of their immediate surroundings. The majority of children leave school early and potentially end up unemployed. We believe that our school\u2019s role is to give our pupils every opportunity to succeed.

Current graduate levels (both male & female students) in STEM subjects are not sufficient to fill these vacancies.

There are 14 hosting partners from 10 different countries all in all.\r\n\r\nAll the 9 vocational schools and all the sectors provided by SASKY are involved in the project. The content of the student mobilities is mainly on-the-job learning, realised according to the field-specific objectives while doing the field-specific work. The students\u2019 objectives are to improve their professional, linguistic, entrepreneurial, social and cultural skills and to reinforce their self-confidence and independence, both at work and in life in general. Some of the longer placements may be realised at vocational schools if that is consistent with the students\u2019 objectives; the reciprocity is an important means to support our internationalisation at home measures.\r\n \r\nA particular case is the short group exchange. Sasky plans to realise one such exchange each year within a different field. This year, the plan is to assemble 8 students and two accompanying teachers from our two different agricultural schools and to send them to a partner school in the Netherlands. The accompanying persons are needed because this opportunity is offered also for students who are somehow disadvantaged or have special needs \u2013 and to students who would not dare to do a longer placement alone. We are also applying for exceptional costs funding to give additional support to students who could not afford to go abroad without it.\r\n\r\nAs for the staff, the goal of most exchanges is to scout the on-the-job learning opportunities for students in order to extend the mobility prospects to a new field and to do the ECVET work in practice, i.e. discuss the students\u2019 objectives, skills and assessment. As a result, the teachers will gain a clearer idea of the kind of learning outcomes the students will get, how those learning outcomes can be recognised and what kind of professional preparation the students need. At the same time, the teachers\u2019 own international skills are enhanced by means of peer learning, through the dialogue of vocational subjects teachers and international coordinators. While assembling the teacher groups, we always see that the group are equipped with skills related to student placements, knowledge of the field in question and sufficient linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the group exchanges for the staff, we are also applying for a few staff work placements. Their objective is staff development, both personal and professional, and both from the perspective of the organisation as well as that of the individual. Our objective with receiving entrepreneurs from abroad is to increase opportunities for internationalisation at home and to reinforce the labour market relevance of the teaching, which is in line with the Finnish VET reform.\r\n\r\nWe also want to contribute to the implementation of the VET reform by developing the identification and recognition process of the international skills. Earlier we have made some development work on this in another project, but because of the reformed curricula, some further development is needed. We aim to develop clear, OLS-compatible rules for the recognition of linguistic skills and a vocational module for international skills based on the regional requirements for vocational skills. To support its assessment by our partners, we are also applying for a KA2 project during the Call 2018.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project include first and foremost improved international skills and interaction, presentations and reports, and the development of shared ways of work and processes. As an impact, the students\u2019 improved skills improve their employability, whereas the staff mobilities and the development work contribute to the quality of Sasky\u2019s international activities and its attractivity while supporting Sasky with the implementation of the VET reform.\r\n\r\nThis project supports Sasky\u2019s internationalisation strategy in the following ways:\r\n- equal opportunities for internationalisation: common selection procedures, the group exchange for the disadvantaged, the exceptional costs for the financially impaired, internationalisation at home opportunities through reciprocity\r\n- the quality of mobility: the ECVET work and the development of the recognition of the international skills\r\n- Sasky is a genuinely international organisation: enhancing the international skills of the staff as well as their motivation for internationalisation.

We believe that language learning is a way for pupils to succeed, and we want to offer them the best possible quality learning experience.\r\n\r\nWe need to train our staff so that they have the confidence necessary to teach languages themselves.

The focus on teaching methodology will give staff a bank of activities, improving enjoyment and attainment.\r\n\r\nChildren will be excited about languages, value them and see the relevance and purpose of learning.
