Mainly focused on vocational training courses concerning the tourism, hospitality-catering and animation sectors, the project will enable 115 VET learners and 60 recent graduates, as well as 10 staff members to participate in a professional placement in one of the eight European countries concerned. INFA considers international mobility as an asset for professionalization and access to the labour market for the youth and participants in VET. Thus, INVEST in Europe advocates for those mobility periods abroad as an integral part of the vocational training as well as the lifelong learning process, which will lead to the acquisition of new professional skills and soft skills in another European country, it will enhance the professional competences already acquired and promote the global employability of the participants. \r\n\r\nBased on an expertise regarding the professionally-focused mobility projects, INVEST in Europe is implemented by INFA Europe, department in charge of the European projects for more than 10 years.

We propose the creation of a novel polymer processing technology. We will develop the ability to foam engineering grade thermoplastics without the need for chemical blowing agents or speciality moulding equipment. Our technology offers many advantages for SME injection moulders & extruders in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and construction. We will: \u2022 Eliminate the need to invest in expensive processing machinery to make foam parts \u2022 Eliminate the need for chemical blowing agents \u2022 Reduce material consumption \u2022 Reduce energy consumption through lower process temperatures \u2022 Produce low density, consistent foams with excellent mechanical properties \u2022 Reduce part cost and finishing operation requirements \u2022 Increase manufacturing flexibility We have selected engineering grade thermoplastics, which will be saturated with nitrogen gas at temperatures above Tg, where diffusion rates of gas within the polymer are significantly increased. The granules will then be cooled below Tg, \u2018trapping\u2019 the nitrogen molecules within. The granules will be packaged and shipped to SME moulders for use in standard moulding machines. During processing, melting of the polymer will release the trapped nitrogen, producing foam in the moulding machine. We will develop our understanding of melt processing technology to ensure optimum processing speed, density and mechanical performance. Initial trials have already indicated the potential of this process but the technology needs considerable further development for successful commercialisation. We strongly believe that our technological breakthroughs will benefit the European polymer processing community, which is facing significant threats from lower cost imports", 131597.0, 2232442.0, 6, 10, "LIGHT-FOAM", null, "http://www.zotefoams.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148723.jpg", "fp7_93391_998440983"]]}}, "4ND": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Keys to Employability", "Croydon Coaches UK Limited", 162623.0, 5, 8, "The partnership  \u201cKeys to Employability\u201d  is being  submitted by a Consortium of  three secondary schools located in the Province of Varese, together with the entrepreneurs' association of the Province (Univa), the Chamber of Commerce, the Regional School Board, the Region Lombardy and a Consulting Company, Noviter. the Consortium cooperates with three large multinationals (PZL-Swidnik, CKA GmbH and Bauknecht Hausgerate GmbH) and three  important education and training centres  in Ireland and in the UK to organize and implement :\r\n- 100 traineeships for students in initial vocational training in order to motivate young people  to open up to training opportunities and professional vacancies beyond frontiers and  to experience mobility in an international environment, while getting familiar with the ongoing changing of the labour market.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBJECTIVES\r\nThe project \"Keys to Employability\u201d  \r\n\r\n- Contributes to the growth and improvement  of education from a European perspective and for the development of occupational mobility in Europe;  \r\n- Contributes to enrich the beneficiaries\u2019 training process;\r\n  \r\n- Foster the acquisition  of cross skills  needed for the faster and faster changes in the modern labor market;  \r\n- Allows to integrate the activity of transnational traineeship as a complementary tool qualifying the educational path of the students sent by the vocational schools.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n- To develop and acquire basic communication skills in an international working environment;  \r\n- To practice and enhance the competences to acquire in the field of  business and information and communication technology such as: cultural interaction, teamwork,  foreign language skills in multicultural social and operating contexts, the ability to make comparisons between the National and International work systems  in an intercultural perspective\r\n- To foster  entrepreneurship while offering a better understanding of the advantages of mobility and job     opportunities abroad;\r\n- To widen their horizons and boost their job chances in the future. \r\n\r\nMOTIVATIONS AND NEEDS\r\n\"Keys to Employability\u201d meets the need  to enhance the exchanges and the mobility of  the students  in initial training and of their teachers  and allows the participants to comply with the challenges of  Lisbon aiming at developing knowledge in Europe,  promote  employability, social  cohesion and, last but not least,  personal and professional fulfillment. \r\nThe project of transnational traineeship  contributes to improving the quality of the teaching planning of  the last two years of studies, in harmony with the activities already planned such as the work related learning, the use of virtual enterprise and the experimentation of real case study  in  the teaching of vocational subjects. \r\nThe importance of the learning mobility abroad lies in the cooperation of different stakeholders, companies, education, associations and other boards operating in the territory and supports the development of a quality education and vocational training,  necessary to strengthen the competition in Europe. \r\nThe project opens up the schools\u2019 doors to the Wider World, promotes the exchange of ideas and the culture of reflective practice and transparency by using Europass Mobility and the Common Framework for Europe Competence.\r\nThe project also moves a first step to create a net of long-term collaborations , meant to innovate and to put in contact the different European education systems, in order to overcome the barriers limiting the chances  of a work placement abroad and to cooperate in the acquisition of those skills and qualifications in accordance with the  rapid evolution of the modern labor market.\r\nIt represents a pilot experience of good practices we can transfer in the future to the other high schools of the Province of Varese which cannot boast  an experience in the organization of placement activities abroad.", "http://www.coachesetc.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004452_7"]]}}}}
