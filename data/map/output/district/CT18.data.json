Whilst similar failure modes are seen around the EU, the triggers (precipitation, earthquake loading etc.) are regional. The DESTination RAIL project will develop management tools based on scientific principles for risk assessment using real performance measurements and other vital data stored in an Information Management System. This will allow for a step-change in the management of European rail infrastructure. \nThe objectives will be achieved through a holistic management tool based on the FACT (Find, Analyse, Classify, Treat) principle. \nFind - Improved techniques for the assessment of existing assets will be developed. \nAnalyse- Advanced probabilistic models fed by performance statistics and using databases controlled by an information management system. \nClassify- The performance models will allow a step-change in risk assessment, moving from the current subjective (qualitative) basis to become fundamentally based on quantifiable data. \nTreat - The impact of proposed remediation or reconstruction will be assessed using the a probabilistic whole life cycle model which includes financial and environmental costs and the impact of work on traffic flow.\nThe FACT principles will be implemented in a holistic decision support tool for infrastructure managers.\nDESTination RAIL will result significant impact in relation to the objectives of the work programme. It will reduce the cost of investment by using the IMS to manage the network, (ii)  Monitoring and real-times analyses will prevent unnecessary line restrictions and closures. (iii) Lower maintenance costs by optimisimg interventions in the life cycle of the asset and (iv) optimise traffic flow in the network.", 78750.0, 3211183.0, 9, 15, "DESTinationRAIL", null, null, null, "h2020_193391_937611313"]]}}, "7PU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1472688000000, 1598832000000, "DAFNE: Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.", "Atec-3d Ltd", "Global trends in population growth and rising economic prosperity will increase the demand for energy, food and water, with more severe impact in fast-growing economies, such as in several African countries. The constraints on water, energy, and food could well hamper economic development, lead to social and geopolitical tensions, and cause lasting environmental damage. DAFNE advocates an integrated and adaptive water resources planning and management approach that explicitly addresses the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus from a novel participatory and multidisciplinary perspective. This includes social, economic, and ecologic dimensions, involves both public and private actors and is socially inclusive, enhances resource efficiency and prevents the loss of ecosystem services in regions where large infrastructures exist or are being built and intensive agriculture is expanding. A decision-analytic-framework (DAF) will be developed to quantitatively assess the social, economic, and environmental impact of expanding energy and food production in complex physical and political contexts, where natural and social processes are strongly interconnected and the institutional setting involves  multiple stakeholders and decision-makers. The DAFNE approach will be demonstrated by analysing two cross-boundary case studies, the Zambezi and the Omo river basins. The WEF nexus will be quantified and analysed as the trade-off between conflicting objectives such as hydropower production vs irrigation, land exploitation vs conservation, etc. The nexus will be translated in economic values and impact on growth, ecosystems and ecosystem services. DAFNE will allow a better understanding of the WEF nexus, and generate and explore alternative planning and management solutions based on the cooperation of public and private stakeholders, which foster the profitable but equitable use of resources without transgressing environmental limits or creating societal and/or stakeholder conflicts.", 162711.0, 4725685.0, 11, 14, "DAFNE", null, null, null, "h2020_203272_928595939"]]}}}}
