Our institution is situated within a well-established, seasonal touristic location, which has and will continue to have a great impact on the community and its inhabitants. Tourism is the foundation for most of the economy in Mallorca and provides employment to a large part of our student population. Thus, employability is one thing we can contribute to.Although a majority of the students are diverse in key competences, they can be can categorized into three main groups according to their needs and origin.The first group consists of students who dropped out of secondary school before graduation, probably due to a history of absences and lack of motivation. Despite the lack of formal education, many of these students have an acceptable understanding of various foreign languages. The second group is made up of foreign students who come to our institution in search of training, either to become literate, or to achieve basic linguistic competency in any of the official languages. In this diverse group we find a wide range of people including immigrants, refugees, and a large population of German residents that have moved to the island. However, due to various circumstances they have not learned the native language. For this reason their assimilation into the culture is not easy. Language competency is essential in order to be able to integrate into our community without facing communicative obstacles. The third group consists of those who work and study to further their education through the preparation of standardized access exams. Students will be required to be proficient in foreign languages, mainly English.  The faculty of our school is more than qualified in their areas of expertise, but still there is a need for improvement in foreign language competence following the new standards that the European Union promotes for 2020. Linguistic competence is essential for social cohesion, personal and economic development, and professional mobility. From our perspective, multilingualism is a key value that not only favours different cultures living together, but also greatly increases the probability of job placement.Our objective as a professional institution is to not only work towards improving the linguistic skills of our staff in order to strengthen the European dimension of our school as a whole, and break communication barriers, but also to develop strategies to minimize the student drop out rate. If the linguistic competency in foreign languages is not proficient this has a direct impact on the range of courses that we can offer, as well as the communication with the students. By eliminating these barriers of communication it may enhance the dedication of the students within their educational communities.  On a broader scale the advancement and the impact of this project will be disseminated in different ways throughout the community. On the one hand institutions related to adult education in other European countries, will host us for job shadowing and  serve as a platform for future collaborations. On the other hand the conclusions extracted from this job shadowing experience regarding the diminishment of the drop out rate will be diseminated to other teachers throughout organized conferences in the regional teacher training centres in our area. Lastly, on a local level, our training courses will be able to meet the needs of the touristic development plan, \u201cArta Sorpr\u00e9n\u201d (Arta Surprises), which is designed to offer, among other things, language courses that focus on English for specific purpose, in order to meet the needs of businesses in the area.", "http://stirling.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA104-023714_1"]]}}, "7RG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Spanish Language Training", "Braehead Primary School", 1687.0, 1, 1, "This development project will help enable the School to deliver the Scottish Government's recommendation of 2 Modern Languages to be taught within the Primary setting.

The difficulty in exploiting open data seems surprising if we consider the huge importance data have in modern societies e.g. in business intelligence, research models and evidence based policy-making.The main tenet of OpenCube project is that the real value of OGD will unveil from performing data analytics and advanced visualizations on top of open statistical data that were previously resided in disparate sources and can now be combined to provide unexpected and unexplored insights.

Reasons include, amongst others, the technical complexity and cost of publishing and providing access to the data, lack of monetization incentives on the provider side, and lack of simplified and unified solutions for data consumption in a multi-platform way. The DaPaaS project directly addresses these challenges by developing a software infrastructure combining Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for open data, with the aim of optimizing publication of Open Data and development of data applications. Addressing the data consumption aspect by developing novel cross-platform interfaces to data applications, DaPaaS extensively covers the life cycle of cost-efficient data publishing and consumption. Backed by the development of a methodology for data use in the DaPaaS infrastructure, the project will deliver an intuitive platform that simplifies data publication, as well as cross-platform data consumption, thus enabling a sustainable infrastructure for efficient and simplified reuse of open data.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.
