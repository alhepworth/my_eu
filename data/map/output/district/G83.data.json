In Britain it is restricted to sites in the west of the country, many of which have been subject to management - including forestry practices - which have degraded their nature conservation interest. Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.\n\nThe project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.\n\nAt each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken.

ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.
