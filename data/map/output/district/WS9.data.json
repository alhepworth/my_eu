With continued European growth in demand for water, finite reservoirs of readily-treatable water, rising energy costs and increased environmental legislation, EU industry is experiencing significant competitive threats with regard to cost-efficient supply and treatment of water.\n\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) utilise electrochemically-active microbes to convert the inherent energy of organic chemical bonds to electrical energy. MFCs encompass unique features that offer advantages for the treatment of wastewater, including: efficient electricity generation; minimal sludge formation; operation at low temperature; and modular cell design, enabling operation at small scale and customisation to specific end-user requirements.\n\nA core group of SMEs have identified a unique opportunity to advance MFC technology for industrial wastewater treatment, thereby generating sustainable and competitive business growth. Key innovations include MFC integration with photocatalytic advanced oxidation and a membraneless MFC air cathode design; and a scalable cost-efficient MFC and architecture design incorporating innovative process monitoring & control strategies. System features and benefits include:\n\n- Capital cost equivalence with existing aerobic treatment solutions\n- Significant operational cost savings, realised through:\n- Recovery of organic content as electrical energy & achieving system sustainability (self-powering);\n- Enhanced treatment efficiency enabling water reuse for on-site non-potable applications;\n- Significant cost reductions for sludge disposal and treated wastewater discharge to sewer\n- Flexible design and operation customised to specific end-user (sector) requirements and enabling treatment of wastewaters of varying composition and containing hazardous micropollutants\n\nThe project will result in a pilot-scale MFC system demonstrated for a target industrial wastewater.

The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development and tolerance.

Thirteen of 20 trainees of the class in the \"Duales Berufskolleg\" are going to do their job placements in the UK, France,  Poland, Spain, Austria and the Czech Republic. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several weeks or months during their training.

Recognising and addressing skills gaps and enabling the personal development of well-trained and skilled employees to support  growth will make a significant contribution to the advancement of the key Europe 2020 aims of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In particular, the AEERO project will contribute towards the objectives of the 'Agenda for New Skills and Jobs' by equipping people with the right skills needed for jobs in aerospace; a sector with enormous potential and need for growth within the supply chain in the face of non-EU competition.The size of potential growth for the sector is indicated by the unparalleled demand which will see the number of passenger aircraft in service more than double over the next 20 years. This has been documented by a number of respected sources, including the Aerospace Growth Partnership (a UK aerospace collaboration between government and industry) and SEMTA (the UK sector skills council for science, engineering and manufacturing technologies). This indicates how imperative it is that high quality training is produced and delivered which is both relevant to the sector needs and is also engaging to the target audiences.AEERO fulfills this need by creating an innovative online learning resource in English, Italian and Portuguese (3 key languages in the global aerospace industry). The platform will be designed to meet user needs and contain easily accessible, media rich learning materials and resources that are pertinent to the vocational skills required by engineers across the EU aerospace industry, from supply chain to preventative and breakdown maintenance.The learning outcomes and the delivery methods will be informed by the needs identified through detailed and project specific analysis of the training requirements of sectoral employers and employees. Training partners in each of the partnered countries have independently undertaken previous analysis of employer demand wither through EU projects or commercial activity which will provide a sound basis for a cohesive project methodology.  Ongoing engagement with key aerospace industry stakeholders across Europe, particularly in the 3 partner countries, the UK, Italy and Portugal will underpin development of training materials and delivery mechanisms. Many of the partners are VET providers and have extensive experience and knowledge in this area of provision. Employer engagement will be sustained throughout the project via an Advisory Steering Board composed of appropriate experts from the fields of aerospace, VET provision, digital learning and project management, quality assurance and evaluation.
