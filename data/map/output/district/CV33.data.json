To fight counterfeiting, the European Central Bank has implemented strict requirements under the Banknote Recycling Framework which require that no counterfeit notes are re-circulated by cash handling devices. In Northern Europe, today approx 15 000 point of sales systems are already equipped with both coin and note recycler systems and market in Europe is at a tipping point where self-service and self-checkout systems are gradually gaining in acceptance as a mainstream retail technology. These systems, integrated with the proposed EUROTHENTIC Cash Checking Machine system, will enable efficient and secure recycling of money. The advantages for the stores are secure and lower cost for cash handling due to amount of cash in store is reduced and also back-office work and CIT will be minimized. This will also enable cash back function - consumers to be able to withdraw cash directly at checkouts. While automated systems for validating bank notes are currently available, they have yet to find wide acceptance in the retail sector due to high capital costs and in particular performance considered slow by the sectors standards. The EUROTHENTIC project aims to overcome the current technical barriers to wide scale adoption of cash authentication technology by creating a low-cost, retrofitable cash validating module. The module will have the capability for high performance note processing and image recording, intelligent image analysis utilising a neural network approach and secure networking to provide remote system updates and a database facility for the secure tracking of bank note serial numbers and other characteristics such as location and time.'", 280309.0, 1258758.0, 7, 9, "EUROTHENTIC", null, "http://www.v-viz.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/149760.jpg", "fp7_100630_964486327"], [1380585600000, 1443571200000, "Innovative Non-Destructive Corrosion Under Paint Integrated Detection System", "Intervision Global Ltd", "Corrosion under paint (CUP) is a ubiquitous and persistent problem which affects almost every part of the entire infrastructure of modern civilization. Apart from the great economic damage which it causes annually, it also compromises the safety, environmental and aesthetic characteristics of the affected structures, machinery and other artifacts.\nMetals in their natural state exist as the various oxides that form ores and it is only with the application of large amounts of energy to process, refine and form them, that they are converted into useful industrial artifacts. However, it is thermodynamically inevitable that metals in such an activated state will always return to the energetically lower state of being oxides.\n\nThis project shall deliver three novel, fully developed and complementary NDT Techniques. These techniques, both individually and in combination, represent a truly disruptive technology: they are completely non-contact and can instantly detect CUP under very large areas of painted surfaces from stand-off distances of up to ten metres or more. It is even possible for to perform rapid stand-off detection of CUP on painted surfaces which are underwater.\nSuch a CUP detection system would offer an immediate market advantage and SME participants currently active in the CUP NDT sector shall be able to both negotiate favorable licensing terms and also be able to control and direct product development in line with their specific commercial requirements.
