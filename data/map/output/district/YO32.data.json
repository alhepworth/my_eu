The project, involves 5 partners with expertise in experimental and theoretical physics, biological science and technology. Building upon a detailed analysis of the physical properties of the individual motors, and their dependency on their magnetic and material properties, the team will develop methods for incorporating the motors into elastic membranes (MEMs). We shall analyse the mechanical and optical properties of these constructs and the ways in which they can be modulated by the external magnetic fields. These novel properties will then be used to produce prototype devices: \n\u2022 Pumps for fluids and tuneable filters for dissolved solutes, operating down to microscopic length scales and based on magnetically driven membrane deformation and changes in internal pore structure.\n\u2022 Tuneable optical devices such as lenses and filters based on magnetic strain-induced changes in the optical and photonic properties of the constructs.\n\u2022 Substrates for biotechnology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

It was demonstrated that such micromotors can function as microfluidic pumps, valves and stirrers, to manipulate liquids at microscopic scale. These properties show high potential in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, since they allow for minimal volume of sample extraction, instantaneous application, and no reliance on the medical expertise or laboratory tools. The main objective of MagElastic is to set up a start-up/spin-off company for commercialising a blood plasma separation component which will enable to produce a range of point-of-care devices for diagnosis of many known illnesses. With only a prick of blood such a component can help saving a significant amount of time and costs, which are currently being lost in the necessity of involving specialised equipment and staff support to extract blood plasma. Because of it\u2019s time efficiency, in some cases (such as Sepsis described below), such devices will allow to save lives. MagElastic will bring the current technology from TRL5/6 to TRL7 by engaging with early adopters that will test the new device in operational environment. Moreover MagElastic will pave the way for the commercialisation of the new device by meeting with potential customers, clients and commercial partners and facilitating access to potential investors.
