In 2009 Opera Circus began to develop a long term series of youth and school's exchanges, cultural and arts programmes between Dorset UK and the Srebrenica region. Participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe, Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people by developing their own creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of youth exchanges and youth workers mobility and with non formal learning at its heart. Combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists, will lead to the establishment of an international network of socially engaged young cultural leaders and organisations with last-long impact locally, nationally and internationally.  \r\nAs well as 6 extraordinary European partners, we have also invited 5 UK organisations to take part in TCFT phase 2. The UK has a reputation for being highly advanced in influencing inclusion, social disadvantage and disability through non formal cultural and arts activities and we are keen to share the UK experience with our partners and to learn from them. There are 12 partner organisations in total raging from youth centres, youth theatre groups, a university, leading international cultural organisations, a city and local authorities making TCFT a unique, exciting and robust melting pot of expertise, knowledge and disciplines. TCFT will work directly with 180 young people, 24 group leaders and 48 youth workers over the 24 months period in a combination face-to-face meetings and ongoing online training.  Young people involved in the project are socially disadvantaged and TCFT will work directly with at least 70 disabled young people. The numbers above reflect the individuals engaging directly with the project, many more will be impacted via the work of partners, youth workers and young people locally. Furthermore, we estimate a significant reach to new audiences in every country TCFT operates in via partners\u2019 websites and networks, TCFT Online Platform and public events. \r\nOC is delighted to welcome its first Romanian EU partner. With Romania becoming a full member of the EU, it is important that we can contribute to the spread of knowledge, culture and history that surrounds this beautiful country, helping to combat the current spread of racism and xenophobia connected with their people.  Our programme partners in Serbia and Bosnia have also taught us about their countries and we have learned a great deal from our active engagement with their cultures since 2004.  Cultural awareness, tolerance, inclusiveness, deeper learning, understanding of the other, is at the heart of this creative process.

The Kuratorium can make various suggestions and recommendations and fosters and supports the education and well-being of the HLW's students and graduates. Consequently the HLW students graduate as young adults highly qualified for the workforce.\r\n\r\nAs a public school the HLW Rankweil is the only school of its kind in Vorarlberg. Each of the five grade levels are separated into classes. Roughly 60 teachers are responsible for the education of all 476 students ( 475 girls and 1 boy) Students at the HLW acquire an extensive, well-rounded education in preparation for further study at the university level, as well as technical and vocational colleges. The knowledge and skills that students gain enable them to exercise professionalism in all areas of business, management and the social and health services. The practice-oriented method of training at the HLW is supported by a required 3-month internship, which takes place between the 3rd and 4th grade.\r\n\r\nThe maturity and diploma examination from vocational secondary schools and educational institutions, such as the HLW, represents a graduation standard that corresponds to that of the \u201cShort Cycle Higher Education Programmes\u201d (Bologna process). This is also verified by the regulation in the European policy 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications and through comparisons in the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2015, 86 out of 92 students going into their fourth year at the HLW Rankweil will partake in the Erasmus+ mobility project and complete their required internship at a European hotel abroad. At the HLW, students begin learning French in the first year and carry on with their English training (after four years in lower secondary schools). They continue their foreign language education by learning a third modern language in their third year, when they can choose to take either Spanish or Italian. Economics and Physical Education are taught bilingually (German, French, English). Furthermore we offer a separate optional subject \"Multilingualism in Education\".\r\n\r\nStudents can choose where they want to complete their internship based on which languages they study. All students complete their internship at a hotel, where they are introduced primarily to the areas of service, housekeeping, kitchen and reception. \r\n\r\nThrough practical experience, students get to know companies, develop their own business mindsets and deepen their understanding of good work ethics and business procedures.\r\n\r\nDuring their internship, students also have the possibility to use and expand their foreign language capabilities working in the hotels and in every-day situations outside of work. \r\n\r\nThe students have the chance to work as a team, as well as gain experience working alone. They learn to critically analyse their work attitudes and results and to scrutinize their work ethics. Individual, independent and lateral thinking, the acquisition and expansion of trade and methodological skills and social and personal skills are an essential building block for a successful start to their career or for further education at colleges and universities. \r\n\r\nThe quality of education is enriched by the implementation of mobility projects and collaborating with international companies. Teachers and management are required to respond quickly and flexibly to changing economic conditions in the businesses, which result in the changing of demands from the employees. \r\n\r\nThe internship leads to the increased mobility of our students and graduates. The trainees\u2019 progress can be visualized by using national documents like e.g. Europass - Mobility, Memorandum of Understanding, Learning Agreements and Personal Transcripts and so the comparison with other vocational trainings is possible.

In an attempt to encourage student mobility, the HLW gives the students the opportunity to partake in the ERASMUS+ programme.\r\nThe intended project can be seen as an integral part of the school-intern LINGUA programme.  In this programme pupils gain an extra qualification and through the networking of foreign languages in various vocational subjects, the students achieve a higher level of linguistic competence. The  completion of an internship abroad assists gifted students willing to take certificate courses in foreign languages: for example First Certificate in English/Certificate of Advanced English of the University of Cambridge or the CLIDA (Italian) or DELF (French) Certificates.\r\nThe main aim of this project is a fostering of international experience and linguistic and intercultural competence in our students. They should also experience the importance of key skills such as a capacity for teamwork or the ability to work under pressure and thus also develop their own personality. This is entirely in keeping with the LINGUA philosophy, which encourages the students to actively use their foreign languages and develop a love for language which will form a basis for life-long learning after their time at school. Integral parts of the LINGUA concept are the application of drama in education, CLIL , the language certificates and these very internships in EU member-states.

The United Kingdom has more of this lowland heath than any other country in Europe and at the time of project inception contained 20% of the Union\u2019s total. One of the most important remaining areas can be found in Dorset, where 40 distinct sites totalling some 7 900 ha have been identified. For hundreds of years, Dorset heathland was at the basis of a rural economy. The poor soils, together with such farming practices as pony and cattle grazing, turf cutting and controlled burning, meant that only hardy plants - such as heather, ling and other dwarf shrubs - could survive. This also created a unique environment for a particularly rich variety of species, including - in the United Kingdom - the entire British population of Dartford warbler, and other rare birds such as the nightjar and the woodlark. All six species of native British reptiles, including the Annex IV species sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), occur within the Dorset heaths. However, once the agricultural practices came to an end, the Dorset heaths lost their economic value and, consequently, declined dramatically over the next century to only 30% of their original surface area. The Dorset heathlands continue to decrease at an alarming rate as a result of neglect and changing vegetation.<br/>(See also LIFE95 NAT/UK/000832 Conservation and re-establishment of Southern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica ciliaris and Erica tetralix and Dry coastal heaths with Erica vagans and Ulex maritimus in SW England and NW France.)", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=515", "http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/regions/south_west/ourwork/heathlands/default.aspx,", "life_71"]]}}}}
