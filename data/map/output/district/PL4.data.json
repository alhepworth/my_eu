Two key aspects of the Strategy: 1) the promotion of a \"sustainable, smart and inclusive\" economic growth; 2) the reduction of early dropout in charge of young people. The overlap between the current economic crisis and the data, that emerge from ISTAT surveys on training poverty of young people, give us a complete inescapable picture: in Italy there are more than 113.000 young people between 14 and 17 years old out of the school\u2013training channels and they represent 5% of the resident population in the same age group; there are more than 2 million young people who do not work and do not study, representing 22% of the population, the incidence is significantly higher than in other European countries; the proportion of NEET is prevalent in the South, where the incidence of the phenomenon reaches 30,9%, although in recent years is also growing in the Central-North, especially the Northeast, where the crisis has intensified the phenomenon of non-employment.

These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua.

The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing).

The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.tellusgroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_10"], [2014, "Hayat Boyu Beceri E\u011fitimi", "TELLUS LIMITED", 578641.0, 4, 36, "Life Long Skills Training Project aims to contribute to the improvement of related vocational education fields and to empower skills and abilities according to the sector\u2019s needs, after observing the implementations in the EU countries through improving the teachers\u2019 ability and skills.

Mobility activity will be realized through one week for school experience and 3 weeks for hands on training experience in a company. The mobility activities aim at increasing the competencies of the teachers serving in the fields of Child Development, Food-Beverage, Accommodation-Travel, Radio-TV and Journalism, Marketing- Retail, Regular Nursing, Nursing of old people, Beauty-Hair Care, Furniture-Wooden Technology, Motor Vehicles, Photographing and Metal Technology in the identified provinces of VET schools affiliated to DG of VET. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project is proposed to enable VET teachers; to observe how to transfer vocational skills to the students through implementations based on the EU standards, creating an opportunity via school experience to make an observation on the subjects, such as; school management, functioning and sectorial cooperation of VET Schools in EU countries, and following school practice to gain experience within the sector through observing and experiencing the improvements and innovations. The Project will also enable VETteachers to observe the communication and balance between demand and supply in terms of providing adequate human resources through analyzing the sector\u2019s HR need. In the vocational environment, sectorial experience, thought and point of view, which are special for the field, will certainly redound a new perspective to the education.  The aim of this point of view is to contribute to the gaining of the knowledge skills and gains that demanded by the sector primarily to the teachers which then to be transferred to the students. Increasing the vocational knowledge, cultivation and the competencies of the VET teachers is to contribute to the improvement of all the actors in the VET system. Hence, the skills training of trainers will provide a positive contribution to the improvement of the quality of VET, to provide a closer link between labor market and educational institutions, to the integration with the EU and to the creation of a balance between demand and supply in the labor market will also enable the participants to provide appropriate competencies for these priorities. Another aim is to create an opportunity for stopping the statis in terms of teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills, competency, manner and behavior and to create a movement. In VET, handcraft skills and according to the sector\u2019s specialty behaviors and attitude is such an important issue. Therefore, gaining these competencies one by one through doing and living has a positive effect on the participants. Theorotical education is definitely not enough for education. The most important thing for the participants is that they know how to transfer information and they interiorize the information by seeing and applying. Without application, no information is persistent. Hence the Project expects participants to do and learn and interiorize the information they learn. The project's goal will contribute to the integration process with the EU in the field of VET. Besides, participants will obtain information about living in abroad and in a foreign culture, foreign behaviors and attitudes and vocational foreign language and in their respective fields. Before mobility activities , all partners and participants will take place in the pedagogic, cultural and language preparation process as well as the dissemination activities that will take place after the mobility.

ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment.

Italy sports a high number of galleries whose offers are highly sought after by both national and international clients. In a European context, this clientele is used to deal with a professional figure generally known as the Art Gallery Manager, as distinct from the Gallery\u2019s owner. The AGM is responsible for the day to day management of the Gallery, liaises with clients and artists, chooses the works of art, co-ordinates the setting up of exhibitions, evaluates the possible risks involved in any of the activities and devises budgets. In Italy, as well as abroad, the job market of professions linked to the art world and to that of cultural heritage has undergone many changes over the last few years. Whereas in the past these profiles would traditionally be drawn from an almost exclusive humanities background, today both museums and galleries call for more managerial roles with cross competencies that vary from artistic knowledge to commercial awareness to legal and financial skills. It is because of this that it has been made sure that the Schools taking part to the Project offer different curricula options, especially in view of the fact that coming from diverse academic backgrounds can only add value to the composition of such complex role as that of the AGM.The Consortium makes provisions that the activities planned to take place both during the VET traineeships abroad and the preparation phase are personalised according to the different academic backgrounds of the students taking part, to favour cross-fertilisation. This, in the underlying belief that each different field can act as a complement to the other ones and the students can only benefit from being exposed to a more holistic view. The final goal being that at the end of the experience, all the students taking part would have acquired the same level of skills and competencies regardless of their academic background, by going through comparable learning experiences that would complement and supplement their original ones.Thirty bodies from five different countries, Italy, Malta, Spain, Slovenia and the UK, take part to the Project. The national Consortium is composed of 26 bodies of which 18 are the Secondary Schools sending partners from the Lazio region (16 Licei Secondary Schools and 2 Technical Secondary Schools).The Project aims to achieve three macro-objectives:1. In the preparatory phase, to provide all the students taking part with the professional competencies that will complement their academic background and will allow them to approach more confidently the VET learners traineeships in companies abroad and enhance their overall experience abroad;2. To facilitate the access of the students taking part to the job market, through professional skill building activities that will take place during the 3 weeks of mobility abroad, in co-operation with museums, galleries and local bodies that already avail themselves of the help of this professional figure. Each of the 18 sending Schools will select 10 students and an accompanying tutor for a total of 180 students taking part to the Project. The choice of offering VET learners traineeships stems from the belief that in order to take proper advantage of an experience with real professional skill building outcomes the students need to learn \u201con the field\u201d how to develop their own skills and competencies and how to network in the job market.3.

The use of light-based treatments of GBM by activating tumor-localized photosensitizers, such as in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been clinically evaluated, but with limited success. This is mainly due to the limited penetration of light into tissue and the efficient spread of tumor cells typically up to at least 2 cm from the resection margin. Moreover, the existing photon based treatments (photodynamic therapy) are highly invasive and usually require open-cranium surgery, due to the need for external light sources.  In the Lumiblast project the photons are produced inside the tumor cells in the form of chemiluminescence avoiding the major limitation of using external light to treat solid, deep-sited and inaccessible tumors. The principle utilized in Lumiblast may also be relevant for cancers of other origins. Due to its nature Lumiblast is expected to act on  individual cells, rather than the collective lesion; it could thus completely eliminate the hitherto incurable GBM. Each GBM cell is expected to become a small lamp providing the light required for the photosensitive agents to become activated, killing the tumour cells from the inside.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

Concrete industry consumes a majority of natural resources and produces a large amount of construction waste.

Plymouth has reviewed and researched potential health impacts of climate change and how healthcare providers are addressing climate change and sustainability. Scenarios for practitioners dealing with supply interruptions have been piloted and embedded in the nursing curriculum. Sustainability education has been explored through innovative mechanisms using social media. For Esslingen University, sustainability is a central political issue, with expertise in implementing sustainability in leadership. Esslingen brings experience of behaviour change, and running European projects and dissemination strategies. Ja\u00e9n University promotes social transformation through active and participatory learning and is committed to the development of a sustainable society model and embedding training for pro-environmental awareness and intentionality. Ja\u00e9n brings expertise in ecology and global change, developmental health and immigration, public health policies, health guideline development, and environmental risk factors in disease outcomes. Maastricht University (UM) is well-known for the system of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). Sustainable development is being integrated as a curricula topic e.g. Masters in Sustainability Science and Policy and the new course-module Climate Change and Public health in the BA European Public Health. UM brings experience in designing sustainability curricula and adopting innovative didactical PBL approaches. UM has relevant (research) expertise on climate change (and its health impacts), as well as other sustainable development issues. Three of the four partners are engaged in teaching over 2000 nursing students and supporting continuing professional development. All partners have links with other nursing schools, providing opportunities for testing project outputs with stakeholders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe output of the project is an Open Access Sustainability Literacy and Competency (SLC) framework, evidence-based resources and teaching and learning course content.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main activities of the project are:\r\n\r\n1. A detailed review of evidence-based resources to provide sustainability, climate change and health resources\r\n\r\n2. A scoping exercise of partner and stakeholder curricula to identify examples of good practice and opportunities for integrating sustainability into the nursing curricula, and  Delphi consensus development study of partner and other stakeholder organisations to identify and agree sustainability course content and key competencies.\r\n\r\n3.

Indeed, early learnings are the requirements to acquire basic skills to reinforce the capabilities of pupils to have an easy access to the higher classes. \r\nFor these children, the rythm and contents provided by traditional learning is most of the time difficult to follow without adaptations. \r\n\r\nThe ALS project aims at addressing these statements by providing a tool to develop in Europe a common personnalised and inclusive learning contents. \r\nThe solution provided by the consortium will be to create a digital learning tool that allows the adaptation of content for children during early learning. This tool will be created thanks to the development of a cognitive approach of learning and will aim at allowing children the access to a personalised learning system. Strict definitions of troubles will be deconstructed to provide learning profiles based on the cognitive behaviour and motivation of the pupils (pupils can be represented by various profiles). The final result will be the possibility to adapt traditional contents with the appropriate modifications for each level of difficulties. \r\n\r\nTo develop properly this tool and to test its relevance, the consortium is based on 4 organisations, complety complementary. Haikara, coordinator of the project, will bring its expertise in e-learning and contents creation, as well as on development of IT solutions to provide the project with both the pedagogical requirements and the final learning tool. It will be supported by the Cognition Institute of Plymouth, to implement research activities and assessment regarding the children psychology and disabilities. \r\nTo reinforce the research part, two associations will act on the project to bring their practical point of view. ICEPE, with its strong international networks and high relationships with institutional organisations in Europe will be highly involved in the dissemination and demonstration requirements. Moreover, from its expertise regarding teachers behaviour when it comes to special educational needs, it will help during the research phase to implement policies that fit with the schools demands. Finally, Ecole2Demain will be the stronger partner for demonstration as it will bring its large scale networks of demonstrators, especially schools. \r\n\r\nThrough these developments, research and demonstration, ALS will test and prove the utility of a new learning tool, consolidating needs of diverse European Countries. Indeed, the project will provide profiles on the European scale, that will lead to a general cultural awareness increase towards the development of common policies tackling the needs of disabled pupils. \r\n\r\nThe project will have high potential of transferability as the adaptive aspect of the tool can be implemented through a diverse range of end-users after the project end.", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-008734_2"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", 276217.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035622_coordinator"], [2014, "Detecting and Preventing  Drop out from Higher Education or Supporting Students to Switch Successfully to VET", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", 241720.0, 5, 7, "Background\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess in higher education is vital for jobs, social justice and economic growth and therefore highly qualified professionals are indispensable for each society. As one of its headline targets, the European Union proposes to lead at least 40% of the younger generation to a third level education. Additionally, it claims to reduce the number of dropouts in higher education. Despite various efforts in recent years the reality in most European countries is a different one. Still too many students in the EU drop out before they complete their higher education degree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDropping out can be a positive decision when students realise that the time, place or degree is not right for them. However, even though most of those who drop out from an initial course of study want to transfer to another course or to return to study at a later date, currently most countries do not help them sufficiently with flexible arrangements. Students, who leave university without a degree, are usually well-trained persons. However, their potential for the labour market is still underestimated and not used adequately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to tackle the problem of early dropout in higher education throughout the European Union, experts amongst others proposed the development of an \"early warning systems\" in order to identify persons at risk. It is also proposed to offer counselling and personal support to students at risk as early as possible in order to be able to offer them adequate assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the process counselling students who face dropout risks two groups play a crucial role: student counsellors at Universities and career counsellors at employment agencies or centres. Both groups, however, have differing interests. While students\u2019 counsellors are primarily interested in students\u2019 academic achievments, for career counsellors at employment agencies VET and the labour market is in the foreground of their work. When it comes to dropout risks both groups should cooperate closely. Nevertheless, as experiences suggest in most countries this is hardly the case. If at all, cooperation mainly takes place at an informal level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims and objectives of the PrevDrop project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing located both at the sectors \u201cHigher Education\u201d and \u201cVocational Education and Training\u201d of the Erasmus+ Programme, the PrevDrop project targets the situation outlined above. The project aims to equip student counsellors at Universities, careers counsellors at employment agencies as well as students themselves with tools, knowledge and resources that help to detect dropout risks and to provide or find adequate support. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project targets two groups of students that face dropout risks: a) students for whom a successful continuation of their studies appears to be probable and b) students for whom a successful continuation of their studies is highly improbable. While for the first group measures will be provided that promote students\u2019 successful completion of studies, measures for the second group focus on integrating them into Vocational Education and Training and/or the labour market. In the course of the project the partners qualify student counsellors from Universities, career counsellors from employment agencies and multipliers working with these two groups. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvisaged outcomes and products\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn more detail the project will provide:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 An \"early warning system\" in form of a self-assessment tool that will help students themselves as well as student counsellors from Universities and career counsellors from employment agencies to detect dropout risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Face-to-face trainings for student counsellors and career counsellors as well as multipliers in which participants will be provided with knowledge on students dropout, the handling of the PrevDrop self-assessment tool, strategies to preventing dropout from higher education and ways to support students to switch successfully to VET.

Common for all is an engagement for and use of outdoor learning practices. The GOaL project is aimed at improving pupils\u2019 skills in basic competences; maths, science and literacy through outdoor learning. By sharing practices through cooperation between schools and universities common guidelines for good practices in outdoor learning will be developed. \r\n\r\nAround 20% of young people, do not have the desired level in basic skills. These people are at risk for socially and economically marginalization. Research show that outdoor learning can increase the motivation and ability to learn.

It promotes transversal skills such as collaborative learning and cross-curricular problem-solving.  \r\n\r\nThis project provides impact on; individual level, institutional level and on national and international level.\r\n \r\nOn the individual level, the projects aims for a positive effect on learning and inclusion. Outdoor learning implicates first hand experiences in local environments and situated learning. Methods and learning strategies emphasized in pedagogical theories for lifelong learning.  As these methods promotes stronger performance in basic skills, the pupils would be expected to do better later in life.

They promote development of basic competences such as, communication, digital skills and basic skills in mathematics and science. In addition outdoor practices includes  horizontal skills such as learning to learn, social and civic responsibility, initiative, cultural awareness, and creativity. In this way, outdoor learning has a potential to strengthen \u2018key competences' \u2013 knowledge, skills, and attitudes. \r\n\r\nOn the international level the projects connects to and is a contribution to the development of international education policy strategies. Development of curriculum based outdoor learning practices corresponds with two of four pillars of learning, defined under the UNESCO projects, global networks for learning: Learning to know and Learning to do.

Professionals in primary care are increasingly  expected to answer patient queries about genetic conditions, deliver genetic information and triage patients who require genetic or other specialist services.    This requires appropriate skills and genetics knowledge to deliver care in daily practice that addresses patient needs, reduces morbidity and mortality and maximises the use of health resources.  Genetics education is only very slowly starting to become a common part of medical curricula and continuing medical education that is case based and grounded in daily practice of primary care practitioners is urgently needed.   However, postgraduate training programmes in primary care and public health are currently failing to meet these perceived educational needs, for example for general practitioners and midwives. This project has been designed to help primary health care workers to identify patients who may have a condition or healthcare concern with a significant genetic component and to manage the patient appropriately.   \r\nThe aim of the project is to implement adult education via an innovative Train the Trainers programme in genomic healthcare among European primary care practitioners.  The education will be embedded in a Care Bundle that includes appropriate tools and resources for use in daily clinical practice.  This project will be achieved via a partnership between expert patients and specialists in adult education, primary care and health genetics to achieve the long-term outcome of improvement in care of patients with genetic conditions or concerns.  The objectives are to:\r\n1) conduct an educational needs assessment in genetics for primary care practitioners and produce a course curriculum \r\n2) produce a Care Bundle with both education and practical clinical tools to facilitate primary care practitioners to provide care for patients with genetic conditions or concerns   \r\n3) deliver adult education for primary care practitioners in six countries\r\n4) create a sustainable online educational training course for primary care practitioners in Europe. \r\n\r\nA needs assessment (systematic review and stakeholder meeting) regarding education and training required by primary care practitioners to deliver effective genetic healthcare will be undertaken as a basis for the curriculum.  The educational programme will be embedded into a 'Care Bundle' for primary care practitioners that will include not only the training component, but tools and resources for practical use in clinical settings.  We will use 'Train the Trainers' methodology to deliver the adult education programme to a core group of practitioners, who will then also be equipped to train others in their own countries to provide genetic healthcare to patients.  This will be interactive, case based and incorporate feedback from actual patients in each country.    Using links with European and national patient groups, we will include interactive training sessions with real patients and online sessions with simulated patients: this is innovative in medical education in general and genetics education in particular.  After an initial pilot course, the training programme will be modified according to feedback, translated for use and delivered in at least six European countries.  In addition, the online course will be available in an asynchronous version for those who wish to undertake training in their own time.   Sustainability will be assured through publication of outputs for use of educators and hosting of the course webpages by the European Society of Human Genetics, a stable pan-European organisation, the mission of which includes support of professional education and adoption of the programme by national professional organisations.   \r\nUsing Kirkpatrick's model of educational outcomes (Kirkpatrick 1967), we will test changes in knowledge and skills of the adult learners via an online survey, but will also evaluate changes in clinical practice and patient care through interviews with a proportion of learners three months after they have completed the course.  \r\nThe programme will enhance understanding of the appropriate management of patients with genetic conditions or concerns in primary care practitioners, improving the quality of healthcare in Europe.  Through use of the Train the Trainers model,  we will create a cohort of peer trainers that will exponentially increase the impact of the programme, as will the availabiity of the online  training programme for at least five years beyond the project.

The overarching theme is the development and dissemination of a common pedagogy based on the rapidly changing developments and requirements for ICT including computer programming and robotics. In response to developing economic and social needs of countries across the EU, elements of computer science have entered primary school programmes of work. These new curricula aim to provide a high quality education in the burgeoning field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), empowering pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Engagement with this new discipline ensures that pupils become digitally literate, i.e. able to use and express themselves and extend their ideas through ICT, to become competent for their future workplaces and as active participants in the digital world.

In particular, thorugh:\r\n\r\n- the Mapping phase, state of the arte and networking among  EPGs operating in each partner country and in EU; \r\n\r\n- the Methodological framework development; \r\n\r\n- the definition of the Learning Path through the Curriculum Development and Learning Modules; \r\n\r\n- the Experimentation, through the  set up and management of EPGs and the validation of the Methodology ;\r\n\r\n- Several multiplier events organized in formal and non formal activities will be held to support project dissemination and capitalization, ending with the  \u201cSOCIAL START UPs -\u201d Fair, to  unlock the Entrepreneurial Talent of Ethical Purchasing Groups, combining the interest of citizens toward food, model of consumption, sustainable development with personal empowerment, professional development through social entrepreneurship, and lifelong learning. \r\n\r\nThe main methodology will be focused on learning-by-doing approach. The innovation relies on the fact that EPGs are already existing entities but the project will make them a tool for life long learning. New EPGs are borne every day stressing their vitality and the interest that citizens have for them. \r\n\r\nMain expected results of the project are, among participants, an increased level of key and technical competences and in particular sense of initiative for employability and business creation (including social entrepreneurship); increased level of technical competences related to food safety, hygiene and quality; increased opportunities for practical entrepreneurial experiences; more active participation in society of the participants\r\n\r\nAt systemic level, results refer especially to the assessment of key and technical competences; increased opportunities for professional development; the improved use of ICTs and open educational resources (OER) and a reinforced interaction between non formal, formal and labour system; promoted take-up of practical entrepreneurial experiences; production and adoption of OER, curricula and new methodology in diverse European languages supported. Furthermore, also members of the participating organizations will gain increased level of knowledge and experience, increase their cultural awareness and expression, and their  level of technical competences on Entrepreneurial mentoring and food safety, hygiene and quality, due to specific training for partner staff and the participation to the technical training for beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe project results can be used and exploited in the longer-term, as the project support the user through self learning and assessment.

It is a close-to-the-heart subject, which attracts the students\u2019 attention and can lead to rich and enjoyable educational activities while building positive attitudes in the citizens of the future. It is also a topic that can provide deep intellectual stimulation and satisfaction through drawing upon a wealth of data to analyse and discuss at a scientific level. Children from the earliest age can be fascinated by the observing small changes that occur in living organisms throughout the seasons: this is the science of phenology. Phenology is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events, and how these are influenced by seasonal and inter-annual variations in climate together, and it is highly pertinent to subjects such as science, mathematics and geography in both primary and secondary education.  Collection of phenological information is a long established activity across Europe, with national and even international associations gathering individual data sets provided by thousands of people each year. However, it is still a science that for the most part continues to use pen and paper to gather data.\r\n\r\nOur proposal, the project PhenoloGIT, is focused on the  designing, building and testing of a collaboratively created educational environmental information platform, supported by state-of-the-art mobile technology and Geographical Information Technologies (GIT), to be used by teachers and students in primary and secondary schools. The platform will allow them not only to make scientific observations in their local environment and gather new data in an intuitive and engaging way, but also to acquire complex knowledge by collaboratively creating and sharing new information using open-source tailored educational tools to analyse and reflect on graphical, spatial and mathematical data sets. These tools and resources will be based \u2013 and released \u2013 as open source/free license resources, to promote their use and evolution in the following years and so offer great potential benefits in the longer term for schools across Europe. \r\n\r\nMany activities can be developed using phenological information, like regional planning (according to natural resources, climates, microclimates) for agriculture, leisure or forestry, or discovering bird and insect migration routes. Using everyday mobile devices (phones and tablets with GPS), accessible and open source tools, together with attractive learning materials and study guides that follow compulsory STEM curricula, will support European students and teachers to create a social network where reflection on data from local environments can lead to an engaging learning experience. \r\n\r\nTeachers and students will be given free tools and guidance, not only to learn and share information about environmental facts, but also to create their own materials, reflections and use this knowledge in class. The project will be designed and implemented by teachers and technologists to ensure that any teacher with basic ICT skills can be part of the Virtual Learning Environment or ICT platform for schools. \r\n\r\nThe project will have three main phases. Firstly, needs and possibilities will be analysed and tools, learning-teaching strategies and contents identified and developed. In the second stage these tools will be tested in real situations in pilot schools, and training given to a group of pilot teachers. The final stage of the project will be devoted to the design and implementation of a social learning network of GIT based school projects, not limited to phenology, but including other subjects identified by teachers in the first phase. This stage will multiply the benefits from the project, generating online resources for teachers, as well as an active community of schools working and learning with GIT and related technologies.\r\n\r\nThe main beneficiaries of the project products will be primary and secondary school educational communities. In addition to the products described above, the project is expected to have a fundamental and lasting impact on science teaching across Europe, increasing relevance and motivation in science classrooms through the use of new technology, with major potential for enhancing student understanding, reflection and collaboration to the creation of knowledge in school and environmental life subjects.  The project also aims to influence students\u2019 (and teachers\u2019) attitudes to and awareness of major issues such as global climate change, nature observation and knowledge and respect for the environment.

It underpins many national curricula and guidelines but, on closer inspection, has different interpretations - to respond to the children's needs and interests, to support their development, to offer them children choice and agency \u2013 which reflect the context and history of ECEC services.\r\n\r\nThere are potential tensions between the different interpretations of 'child-centredness' and what these mean for the support of children with different needs or from diverse backgrounds. Questions arise as to how, in reality, ALL children can be at the centre of pedagogical practice, how ALL children\u2019s developmental needs can be supported and whether democratic approaches can be combined with a focus on tracking individuals' progress against developmental milestones. Furthermore, in supporting the needs of children from communities towards the margins of society, there are strong arguments against adopting an approach centred exclusively on the child\u2019s own interests or cultural background in favour of an approach that offers child and family a bridge between their home community and the mainstream society.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate \u2018child-centredness\u2019 as a component of high quality ECEC to support children\u2019s development, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. Through taking part in specially designed training modules, practitioners from a wide range of early childhood contexts will develop awareness of the different facets of child-centredness. The aim for these modules is to enable participants to develop greater confidence in their own capacity to address the individual needs, rights and interests of diverse learners, while working within national curricula and guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe project will start with analysis of existing academic literature and examples of practice of child-centred approaches to supporting diverse learners in six countries:  - Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK \u2013 with different structures, histories and approaches to ECEC.  The analysis will inform an assessment of training needs, which in turn will lead to the development of innovative approaches to extend and develop educators\u2019 child-centred competences.  This will include transnational online modules, webinars and video capture of workshops, supported by a toolkit of resources offering advice and guidance on supporting diversity and child-centred practice.  Questionnaires and reflective writing tasks will both evaluate  the success of the modules while probing practitioners'  understandings of child-centred practice and what these might mean in practice. Evaluation of the modules will also explore the effect of the training on both the quality of ECEC and the effectiveness of support for children with diverse needs. It is anticipated that the findings from the module evaluation will be pivotal for informing future European Commission recommendations on the provision of ECEC services, building on the existing ECEC Quality Framework. Finally a Manual of Good Practice will draw on all stages of the project and provide an easily accessible document that offers both interpretations of child-centred practice and examples from practice. The manual will include activities and guides to support the wider ECEC community to consider their own understandings of child-centred practice and how it relates to their views on quality ECEC and supporting diverse groups of children.\r\n\r\nProject findings will be shared through presentations at academic and professional conferences and publication in journal and professional magazines. The modules will be freely available as open access educational resources with potential longer term benefits. Through taking part in the project, practitioners will have opportunities to engage with learning materials developed in different contexts, prompting them to reflect more deeply on their own practice through making the familiar strange and the strange familiar.

Increasing patient acuity means access to specialty training and high quality intensive care nursing (ICN) education is imperative. There is a need to raise the level of practice to more advanced nursing practice (ANP) roles in order to accommodate these changes.  However not all countries have developed programs to do so and there is a lack of consistency of content among the existing programs. Our recent survey of intensive care units across Europe (n=24 countries) identified: considerable variation in eligibility requirements, how students were assessed/examined and duration of programmes (30 days to 24 months); challenges in providing ongoing education (n=22 countries); and lack of access to educational resources in 6 countries. This variation in baseline creates role confusion between countries, impeding mobility across Europe and career progression for the ICN workforce. \r\nObjectives\r\n1. Use consensus methods to develop a set of competencies required of an advanced level intensive care nurse.\r\n2. Map these competencies against country-specific and multi-country policies and evidence for advanced practice nursing.\r\n3. Identify the feasibility and support the application of these competencies in a number of countries\r\n4. Develop an outline curriculum based on the competencies, freely available online.\r\n5. Map the competencies and curriculum against existing web-based curriculum resources.\r\n6. Develop a prototype online educational resource to support the competencies and curriculum.\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nParticipants will be involved in four activities for the project: \r\n(i) A Delphi study (WP 2): n= 75 -100 drawn from VET & HE sectors, the nursing profession and patient representatives.\r\n(ii) validation of competencies (WP4): n= 72 patient representatives and n= 80 multi-professional team members, including VET educators \r\n(iii) pilot of the online educational resource (WP7): n= 150 ICU nurses and educators \r\n(iv) dissemination activities (WP8): (n= 250 minimum)\r\nDescription of activities\r\nThe INACTIC Project is a 2 year project and will be delivered through a series of Work Packages. In the central WP (WP2) competencies will be developed, using a three-round, online consensus process across 24 countries. At the same time a review of evidence and policy will be undertaken (WP3), the initial outcomes from which will feed into the second round of the WP2 consensus Delphi process. Following development of the competencies, these will be tested in WP4 to determine the applicability and feasibility of the competencies for individual countries. Content validity testing will also be undertaken during this WP, to ensure individual competency statements have wide acceptability. A curriculum will be developed (WP5), mapped against existing resources (WP6) to enable the competencies to be used on completion of the Project. A prototype online educational resource (WP7) will be developed from existing ESICM resources. WPs1 (Project management) and 8 (Dissemination and Exploitation) will underpin the whole project. \r\nMethodology\r\nThis project applies established methods in new situations, across a culturally diverse group of professionals who share the same title. Specifically, we will:\r\n1. Apply the principles of competency-based training in a new situation, developing a pan-Europe model of curriculum for advanced nursing practice in intensive care. \r\n2.

Specifically, school field trips related to the curriculum involving contact with nature are beneficial for school students on various levels. At a cognitive level, field trips are justified by the need for direct contact with materials and phenomena that help achieve higher levels of cognition. OL facilitates the understanding and application of abstract concepts, positively impacting long-term memory. Further, these are experiences not available in the classroom or laboratory, so it is necessary to integrate practical opportunities into the curriculum. OL also provides health and well-being and psychological benefits, such as: individual growth, improved social skills, social cohesion and links between affective and cognitive domains. For NANOL's specific purposes, evoked emotions and learning help foster environmental education and pro-environmental behaviours, essential for informed actions that lead to protect and enhance the environment. Nurturing affinity with special places fosters the emotional as well as the cognitive.\r\nIn all European countries, non-formal education facilities linked to protected areas promote environmental awareness and help the public value their natural and cultural heritage. Schools located in these special places are well placed to take advantage of these educational offers and integrate them into their teaching practice, but the fit between provider and school needs is not always ideal. One of the key objectives of protected areas is the promotion of environmental values and the involvement of the population in their protection. Connecting learners to the physical and social reality, contextualizing learners' curricular experiences in these stimulating settings, promoting interactions that create relevant personal meanings and fostering a 'sense of place' in the local area, are effective ways to achieve this aim. \r\nSo, our main objectives in the NANOL project are:\r\n\u2022 To support primary teachers to use OL settings and implement innovative OL school practices linked to curricula. \r\n\u2022 To encourage collaboration between schools and local Natural Parks or other special places' organisations by sharing different frames and practices between educators to stimulate affinity to nature. \r\nPartners in NANOL project are from 5 different countries (Spain, United Kingdom, France, Finland and Slovenia) and from different educational institutions (2 universities, 4 primary schools and 4 non-formal educational organisations). Participants will be 14 school teachers and 8 educators with different backgrounds that will work together to co-create and assess educational activities that involve OL for primary education. Around 200 students of primary education will benefit directly of the project. \r\nNANOL project is organised in 3 phases:\r\nPhase I: TRAINING and CREATING. In year1 school teachers and members of educational organisations will work together to share experiences, detect needs, learn about the places and different pedagogies related to their interests, frame learning objectives, create pedagogical tools, didactic units or other educational proposals that incorporate OL including active learning strategies in the protected area related to clear educational objectives and curriculum.  \r\nExpected results are: didactic units, learning toolboxes or other educational materials linked to OL and curriculum and created to be applied the following year.\r\nPhase II: APPLYING and EVALUATING. In year 2 teachers test out what has been created in the previous year by applying it to their students. They will have the support of educators of the organisations with who have been working together the previous year. So, OL will be applied and monitored and feed-back of students will be also contemplated. \r\nExpected results are: evaluation, conclusions and improvement of the application.\r\nPhase III: DISSEMINATING, SHARING AND COMPARING. Participants will write their results and conclusions and this will lead to a final meeting and conference where we will share experiences from what has been done in the different schools, compare them and learn from each other. \r\nExpected results are:  individual final documents of  experiences in each country and a final electronic report with the compilation of all experiences, comparisons, conclusions and guidelines that will be open access published. \r\nThe whole will contribute to wider dissemination and help other schools and special places develop material to nurture affinity to nature.", "http://www.plymouth.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA201-038635_8"], [2017, "VET learners and staff mobilities 2017", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", 91045.0, 10, 15, "This project builds on a previous nine-year\u00b4experience with mobility programmes at our school, thanks to which our students and VET teachers can gain priceless both personal and professional experience by completing a short-term study programme at the workplaces of our foreign partners. \r\nWithin this project, we plan to realize 56 mobilities, out of which 50 are intended for students and 6 for teachers.

If we consider disabled people, their unemployment rate is twice higher than for people who are not disabled and one way to tackle the issue is to facilitate their access to qualifications and certifications.\r\n\r\nThis project will target IVET and CVET learners with cognitive disabilities. It means people who are dyslexic, suffering dysphasia, attention deficit disorders, high functioning autism, implementing functions disorders... the project will focus on EQF 3 level which is the first level for a vocational diploma. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project will be to provide our target group with tools enabling them to have access to certifications in order to ease their professional inclusion.\r\n\r\nWith this project , we will design versatile apps likely to meet the needs of an heterogeneous group with learning difficulties and introduce digital technologies to these learners by developing innovative and customizable solutions to: \r\n- Facilitate the understanding of instructions and tasks to be carried out.\r\n- Contribute to a better link between theoretical knowledge and their practical implementations.\r\n- Facilitate memorizing.\r\n- Enable the portability of tools in different environments.\r\n- Help teachers/trainers to present the activities carried out  when oral expression is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach this goal, we will undertake several activities such as, at first, a comparative analysis, then the design of an assistive digital tool; a protocol of implementation will be devised in cooperation with stakeholders as well as a \"training the trainers\" programme and session.\r\n\r\nThe work and the outputs are innovative and will allow our organizations to strive to achieving equal opportunities for any type of learner. Each of our country has passed laws in favour of equal rights and opportunities for disabled and this project is certainly a way to help disabled, to whom up to now, very few solutions were proposed to move forward and get the chance of a smooth vocational inclusion as any other citizen.

This resource will include a comprehensive evaluation of the different practices exchanged and exploited during the lifetime of the project. At each partnership meeting (6 in total), the host partner will present 2 one-day workshops of best training practice in terms of how they help young people explore their feelings and empower them to make positive choices - to take more control in their lives. Each workshop will include a contribution from a young person to talk about their lived experience, having been the recipient of the host's workshops prior to the meeting. This resource will be presented at a final international conference in March 2017 in Siauliai, Lithuania.\r\n\r\nContext / Background:\r\nEarly School Leaving and Low Academic Achievement is a priority of the Europe 2020 agenda, in terms of addressing issues of poverty and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nSix  participants:\r\nPADMA (UK): Mental Health Charity working with young people in schools\r\nZISPB (Lt): an NGO providing social and educational initiatives in the field of vocational rehabilitation for disadvantaged groups, especially young adults\r\nSSP&MH (El): Non-profit scientific organisation providing high quality psychiatric support services and promotion of social inclusion in young people, particularly those with mental health issues\r\nBEHDER (Tr): NGO working in field of Youth to improve health at local, regional and national levels\r\nAUTH (El): Higher Education Institute using art therapies and workshops in the field of youth\r\nBUCOVINA (Ro): NGO working in the field of education and young people\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nEach partner will bring a total of 3 persons to each externally hosted learning activity / transnational meeting (15 \"mobilities\" each partner); each partner will host a learning / transnational meeting.\r\n\r\nMethodology in carrying out the project:\r\nEach partner will prepare 2 one-day workshops in presenting their best training practice; emphasis being on the \"bite-size\" learning activities that can be practised, taken away, implemented and then evaluated prior to the next round of learning activity.\r\n\r\nEvaluation to take place immediately after each meeting.

Since several years mindfulness is also being increasingly integrated into education. The evidence shows that as benefits educators and learners demonstrate increased resilience and ability to better cope with stress, difficult moments and relations. Educationalists agree on the fact that relationship needs to be nurtured long before the moment of crisis, both from the educators' side (teachers, parents, social workers) and the children side.\r\nThe project partners either had experience in mindfulness or in parents training and education and both were supportive to each other for the benefit of the project learning, process and results.\r\n\r\nThe project aimed at exchanging practices in the field of parenting, parents' education and mindfulness for children and schools, at learning from each partner\u2019s experiences and practices as well as from what was available in their national contexts, at exploring the contact points for laying the foundation and verifying the feasibility for the development of a mindfulness course for parents based on the different approaches of the partners involved; at bringing mindful parenting to the attention of a wider audience and to get recognised as significant stakeholders in the field.\r\n\r\nThe project's core activities were local parents' workshops where the educators and parents together practiced mindfulness and together reflected on the impact on themselves as educators and persons. The impact is presented in a form of stories collected by the partners from some of the parents and educators that did attend the local workshops.
