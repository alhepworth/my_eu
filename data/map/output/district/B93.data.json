Only these eco-efficient mines will contribute to improved access to domestic mineral resources, secure the supply of mineral raw materials for Europe and reduce the import dependency.\nIntelliMine will contribute to realise these concepts of invisible, zero-impact and safe mines. The mine of tomorrow will run an integrated concept. All operations necessary for the eco-efficient provision of the minerals including waste management will be carried out underground. This will drastically reduce the volumes being transported, minimising above ground installations and thus the environmental impact.\nIntelliMine will develop innovative methods, technologies, machines and equipment for the safe, eco-innovative, intelligent and economical exploitation of mineral raw materials in the EU, including maintenance issues, especially at greater depths. It will investigate autonomous, highly selective mineral extraction processes and machinery based on new sensor technologies as well as innovative concepts for mass flow management and transportation. Such investigations have to be accompanied by rock mechanics and ground control issues as well as health, safety and environmental issues.\nThe concept of an invisible, zero-impact mine requires a refined process underground that selectively extracts the minerals and therefore reduces waste production closer to the mineralisation. Therefore improved near to face processing methods including backfill procedures need to be developed. The necessary level of automation in mining operations can only be achieved by reaching a higher level of integration in all parts of a mine.

The concept is to use hydrofracturing for stimulation and bioleaching for winning of ores. The final process will consist of a so-called doublet, which is two deviated and parallel wells.\nIn order to avoid high costs for drilling from the surface, the BioMOre approach is divided into two phases. Phase 1 will be research on the intended bioleaching process whereas phase 2 will aim at a pilot installation to demonstrate the applicability of the process in large scale including hydro-fracturing and access of the deposit from surface.\nThe first phase should cover the intended work of the current BioMOre approach without drilling from surface.\nThe BioMOre project aims at extracting metals from deep mineralized zones in Europe (Poland-Germany, Kupferschiefer deposit as a test case) by coupling solution mining and bioleaching. Selected sustainability indicators based on regulatory requirements of the European Commission will be applied for feasibility considerations.\nThe main objective of the BioMOre first phase is to design and build an underground test facility for testing the concept of combined hydro-fracturing and bioleaching. The test facility will comprise a 100 m\u00b2 ore block, where boreholes will be drilled horizontally using standard equipment. All necessary equipment for testing different parameters of the intended bioleaching process will be established underground.\nThe intention is to test the bioleaching process in high detail in an in-situ environment at the same time avoiding time consuming and risky permission procedures. On the other hand, the application for the permission of underground test operation must contain detailed information about monitoring of tests and all material controls. No harmful substances will remain in the mine after the tests are completed.

The goal is to improve energy efficiency and to reduce CO2 on quarries, through the develop of a new and highly effective modeling and monitoring Energy Management System technique. The use of crushed stone could increase at a quicker rate than any other major material use. Given the market size, ample resources and stable growth potential of this industry, the understanding and dissemination of energy efficiency opportunities is paramount for European energy efficiency goals. Further, since there are literally several thousands facilities throughout Europe, there is a huge opportunity for replicability of identified energy efficiency measures. This project will first review the stone mining and crushing production processes. It is also important to show that energy use is focused in rock blasting, shot-rock transportation, rock crushing, conveying and screening. As such, standard building energy efficiency measures such as lighting retrofits and support system optimization have small impacts on overall plant energy use. The identification of energy opportunities thus relies heavily on systems optimization. System optimization not only encourages energy efficiency, but typically benefits production as well. Coupled with productivity improvements, the economic incentives for energy efficiency measures in this industry have the magnitude and quick payback that could facilitate industry-wide replication. Once the whole extracting industry process is over, and the quarry plant arrives to the end of its life cycle, many CO2 neutralizing activities will take place. The goal is to generate EE opportunities and CO2 compensation activities due to the environmental impact created in its life time cycle.", null, 5361693.0, 6, 12, "EE-QUARRY", null, "http://www.miro.co.uk", null, "fp7_100467_997753350"]]}}}}
