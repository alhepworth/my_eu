It is a whole school priority to ensure that every child makes as much progress as possible. We need to ensure that all of our pupils make substantial and sustained progress in their language learning, that we have effective systems in place to monitor their progress and enable us to measure impact within our subject.\r\n\r\nWe need to change our approach to language teaching, giving more responsibility to class teachers and creating a more sustainable approach. We need to refresh our curriculum to ensure progression across all 4 key skills and introduce assessment systems.\r\n\r\nWe need to develop a new Scheme of Work and new teaching materials that will support a more progressive approach where children\u2019s learning is built upon year by year and will include references and materials that will appeal more to our pupils and keep them interested in their learning.\r\n\r\nWe need to support to our two \u2018lead teachers\u2019 and the rest of the staff to be able to play a more active role in children\u2019s learning.\r\n\r\nThe key to achieving our aims is to give key members of staff the opportunity to increase skills and confidence in the French language and culture and find new and innovative teaching strategies to engage pupils and inspire \u2018awe and wonder\u2019. We want to equip them with the skills to teach high-quality, engaging, progressive lessons, cascading knowledge to the rest of our school staff, and supporting them so that we are working as a whole school team.\r\n\r\nWe are planning a two-year project involving a group of key staff taking part in a series of two intensive immersion courses in Rouen, France, developing a core group able to lead language teaching in their year groups and involving more staff as the project develops. \r\n\r\nThese are progressive courses and the second course builds on the learning of the first, with a linguistic task in between. We have particularly chosen these courses as our staff are very much lacking in confidence and we are making an important change to our approach to language learning in our school. We feel that it will be more effective to enable key staff members to have the intensive learning opportunity offered by the two progressive courses. We believe that these teachers will be able to launch the project effectively and support a wider group of teachers and support staff in developing the project.\r\n\r\nThe project will greatly increase staff knowledge and skills, and will enable us to change the way we approach language teaching. We will move towards a more effective and sustainable model where each class teacher takes responsibility for language teaching in their own classes. They will be fully supported by the two lead teachers and by other staff who have taken part in training activities. This way we will develop more sustainable provision.\r\n\r\nParticipants will increase their language knowledge. The course will provide direct instruction on relevant vocabulary and grammar. Concentrated lessons over a short period of time will help teachers to make quick progress and become more confident. Most importantly, learning French in France gives the chance to apply learning while it is still fresh. They can prepare for interactions with native speakers in classes then try it in a nonthreatening context. This is the best possible way to become confident using transactional French.\r\n\r\nInvolvement in this project will have a major impact on participants, pupils, our school as a whole, and beyond, supporting us to fulfil our long term aspirations for our children.", "http://www.thelifecloud.net/schools/SpotlandPrimary", "SPOTLAND COMMUNITY PRIMARY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047134_coordinator"]]}}, "9EE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "\u201cLanguages: Gateway to the Future\u201d", "Kentmere Academy and Nursery", 10448.0, 1, 1, "In summary, we aim to improve the language teaching and learning at our school through the development and implementation of our project \u201cLanguages: Gateway to the Future\u201d. We will do this by sending six KS2 teaching staff on an immersion course in Spain, and using experiences and learnings to build an effective MFL department in our school.We need to make the transition from teaching French to introducing Spanish as the core MFL at Kentmere. Our teaching staff do not currently feel confident enough in their own skills to deliver the Spanish curriculum and therefore require considerable training in both the language and support to understand the cultural nuances in Spain.  They are highly motivated to embark on this new learning journey, and keen to make a lasting impact within the school. Given the priority that at least one language must now be taught at KS2, we are focussing on developing teaching practice in KS2 only. However, we have a longer term view to involved the whole school, and will carry out training for EYS/KS1 and those not directly involved in project i.e. TAs to develop their language skills and enhance their cultural understanding.Thus teaching and learning will be improved through participation in this project, and standards of language delivery will be enhanced through new experiences and learnings. Lessons will be planned, taught and assessed to a consistently high standard and Spanish language will be embedded into every day routines, and not just spoken in designated lesson time. Use of new technologies will be integral to the teaching and learning of Spanish, as well as the communication between link schools in Spain.There will be an enhanced awareness of the significance of languages spoken in our school, and local community. We will celebrate the multicultural diversity that is characteristic of our school, and use the project to raise awareness of the importance of Spanish as a key international language. We are keen to involve the learners themselves as much as possible and will ask them, at regular intervals, to share their feedback about language learning and the impact the project is having on their learning experiences. We will use the project to interact with a number of key stakeholders:\u2022 Identify and maintain communication with link schools in Spain, through relationships with teaching counterparts, and also as a platform for sharing information for pupils\u2022 develop key relationships with cluster primary schools to share experiences, resources and learnings\u2022 develop links with our local secondary schools to support transition to KS3\u2022 involve parents and the local community as part of our \u2018languages days\u2019.Throughout the project we will monitor and measure success and report these at regular intervals to SLT, the Board of Governors and the wider school team.", null, "Kentmere Academy and Nursery", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023258_coordinator"]]}}, "9JW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "St.James' CofE Language Curriculum Development", "St. James' CofE Primary School", 16084.0, 1, 1, "St. James' CofE Primary School is located in the village of Wardle within the metropolitan borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester.  This is an area of north west of England.  The school serves the immediate community and is over subscribed each year.  The children of St. James' are almost entirely from a White-British background. (98%).\r\n\r\nCurrently the school does not offer the children the teaching of a foreign language.  This stems from a lack of staff confidence and competence in this area of the curriculum, coupled with staff unskilled at leading curriculum developments.  As the teaching of a foreign language is a statutory requirement of England's National Curriculum, this situation is a concern to the school's leadership team, governing body and parents.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, it is of concern to the school that our children do not have an understanding and appreciation for cultural diversity.  Attending a school where 98% of the children are from a White-British background does not prepare them adequately for life in the wider community, country and indeed the world. Rochdale has experienced significant racial tension in recent times due to a number of high profile criminal cases.  Through pupil interviews, we have found that this has tainted the children's viewpoint on cultural diversity and the benefits and opportunities it brings.  For this reason, we believe the Erasmus+ project will help develop the children's appreciation of being a European and global citizen and gain an understanding of the potential benefits to their life as they move into adulthood.\r\n\r\nWe plan to use  Erasmus+  to access high quality training as part of this project via the training provider PQ  France.  8 participants will take part in training over a period of two years in France.  The first round of participants will include a new language co-ordinator, recruited with the specific intention of implementing our new language and cultural project.  Three further groups of 2 participants will attend, each developing their own skill-set through an individualised learning plan and providing incremental developments for the school's long term aims.  It is our intention that each round of training will target the individuals needs alongside the school's developmental needs.  The training provided will not be a repeat schedule.\r\n\r\nDuring this training week, the participants will further their own language skills, whilst developing a greater understanding of effective pedagogy in language acquisition.  This will give them the confidence and competence to teach well in school, improving the outcomes for the pupils of St.James'.  \r\n\r\nA secondary benefit from the project will be the enhanced leadership capacity of my staff.  A newly appointed language coordinator will be supported through this project by the school, PQ-France staff and wider colleagues in order to become a highly effective leader in school.  This will provide improved opportunity for career progression that might otherwise not be available.\r\n\r\nWe aim to introduce an educational visit to France.   Through this the children will gain first hand cultural experiences that will develop and challenge their understanding of European culture and its wonderful diversity.  This will give the children a real life context in which to apply their new language skills.  The Erasmus+ project will allow us to create appropriate partnerships and develop learning networks that will help us deliver our aspirational intentions.  \r\n\r\nIn order to monitor the impact of this project, both participants and pupils will be assessed throughout the two years.  participants will complete a baseline assessment using a Language Passport before the project begins and will update it each term.  This will formally be reviewed throughout the school's appraisal cycle.  This will allow for clear accountability to ensure the project is successful and its outcomes are achieved.  These assessments will help contribute to a personalised learning plan for each teacher that will be used within school and during the proposed training week.\r\n\r\nThe children will also be assessed in a similar way, using Language Ladders.  This will allow us to track the progress of children's language development.  We will also conduct pupil interviews against  scoring criteria to quantify the development in cultural appreciation and individual confidence.\r\n\r\nIIn summary, we hope that after two years, the children's cultural appreciation and understanding will have been broadened and they will have acquired new language skills that they are legally entitled to.  The most notable outcome will be for our children to confidently partake in a residential visit to France, engage in local culture and converse in another language.  It is hoped that they will be able to articulate the benefits of being a 'European minded' and appreciate the opportunities this can bring them as they grow up and enter adulthood.", "http://www.st-james.rochdale.sch.uk", "St. James' CofE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035889_coordinator"]]}}, "9QB": {"nhs": {"data": [["RW6", "Birch Hill Hospital", "nhs_RW605"], ["RT2", "Watergrove Day Hospital", "nhs_RT2C2"]]}}}}
