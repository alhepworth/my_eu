Furthermore, monitoring of treatment of endocrine diseases are often severely limited by lack of multiple measurements at different time points, which is impractical in an out-patient setting.\n\nTo overcome these hurdles academic and commercial partners propose to: \n\n\u2022 Develop a novel microdialysate sampling and analysis system for adrenal and pituitary hormonome profiling\n\n\u2022 Validate the method in healthy vs. six populations with endocrine disorders \n\n\u2022 Promote the system for demonstration in routine clinical practice by dissemination of results to relevant European stakeholders\n \nThe portable fraction collector for subcutaneous microdialysate combined with state-or-the-art ultrasensitive assays by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LCMS/MS) and multiplex proximity extension assays (Proseek), will allow collection of 10 minute fractions for up to 72 hours while the person tends to daily life activities.
