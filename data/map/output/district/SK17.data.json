Five academic institutions and five CSO partners dealing with alternative agriculture and rural development from five EU member states will co-operatively carry out literature review, design and conduct participatory action research including stakeholders (focus group discussions, scenario analysis workshops) on the following issues: a) how AAFNs are defined by social, political, commercial and cultural frameworks involving motives beyond direct material interests in practice, b) how current policies facilitate or impede the development of AAFNs, c) how alternatives may be complementary or oppositional to conventional agro-food networks, d) how AAFNs contribute to regional development, and e) how AAFNs link different types of innovation as a basis to broaden EU research policies on the \u201cknowledge-based bio-economy\u201d.

This upstream approach will identify further research relevant to AAFNs, in order to inform future research agendas. The project will contribute substantially to the evidence base and the understanding necessary to foster more desirable types of agricultural innovation within the European Community, and we will point out how policy frameworks could better facilitate such improvements.

Bioresorbable  devices do not need a removal operation, reducing patient trauma and significant healthcare costs. Due to the ability to add antibacterial or antibiotic drugs and to control the release rate at the implant site, such devices can reduce the number of post-operative complications and open up possibilities for new therapies.\nHowever, development times for new devices can be lengthy and extremely expensive. Bioresorbable materials have a high cost and are difficult to process, resulting in high scrap rates. The addition of fillers such as bioactive particles further complicate the manufacture. In Bio-PolyTec, sensor technology - centering on optical spectroscopic techniques - will be developed for in-process monitoring of the key quality measures of polymer degradation and additive dispersion. The availability of this information in real-time rather than after time-consuming and expensive laboratory testing represents a significant improvement in Quality Control for bioresorbable devices as well as enabling better process control. The influence of typical processing procedures on the degradation and mixing and hence subsequent bioresorption/release behaviour and mechanical properties will be fully investigated for the commercial products of the consortium SMEs to optimise their processes to achieve specific and consistent product requirements. In particular the processing of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and dispersion of bioactive Calcium Phosphate particles for orthopaedic implants will be investigated among other polymer/filler systems.\nThe innovations in sensor technology will extend outside the consortium to enable other device manufacturers to reduce scrap rates and hence production costs for bioresorbable devices.

It consists of a series of electrochemical-optical sensors and microsystems suitable for various biomediators (microrganisms, DNA, proteins or cells) and based on new technologies studied and developed by the research performers in the consortium. The transduction approach is suggested by two main biomediator properties, often exploited in biosensor operation in response to analyte or modification of a physical-chemical condition: the variation of the bioluminescence/fluorescence emission and the internal electrical behaviour. These changes when transduced to readable electrical signals can give complementary information: the modification of a current signal is correlated to the electrogenic property of the biomediator (e.g. inhibition of Photosystem II electron transfer in the presence of a pesticide), while a modificaton of fluorescence is often correlated to a conformational modification (e.g. interaction of Photosystem II protein with ionizing radiation).
