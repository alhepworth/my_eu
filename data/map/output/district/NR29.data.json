Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland.

It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.
