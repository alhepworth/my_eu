A multispecific T cell product targeting several viruses and tumors as well as a primary regulatory T cell product targeting GvHD will be developed to market maturity. These two cell products will improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT. A significant improvement in the outcome and this coupled with a significant reduction of the costs for a large number of patients in Europe will further broaden the application in other forms of cancer of this curative treatment.

Regenerative medicine still is in the experimental phase and kidney transplantation is only available for a small number of patients. Indeed, the everyday reality is the growing number of dialysis patients. Haemodialysis treatment is the current standard of care for the vast majority of patients with end stage kidney disease. It is a substantial burden to the patient and for society. Haemodialysis treatment is associated with high risks for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, for infections, hospitalisation and low quality of life. Improvement in the currently available standard is urgently needed. \n\nOver the past decade an alternative for haemodialysis became available, i.e. haemodiafiltration. Both are accepted by regulatory authorities. Haemodiafiltration removes waste products that are accumulated due to kidney failure, more effecticvely than standard hemodialysis. Present evidence supports the idea of superiority of haemodialfiltration compared to standard haemodialysis. However, definite proof is lacking and as a consequence haemodiafiltration is not yet widely applied. \n\nThis consortium aims to determine the best possible dialysis treatment by comparing the conventional guideline based haemodialysis treatment versus high-dose haemodiafiltration by carrying out a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial addressing clinical endpoints, quality of life and a cost-utility analysis.

Hearing loss can limit communications skills: not to hear means not to understand what is being said. Hence deafness does not produce compassion but do often produce a sense of irritation.  Despite the prevalence and burden of hearing loss, hearing impairment is largely underdiagnosed in older persons and undertreated.
