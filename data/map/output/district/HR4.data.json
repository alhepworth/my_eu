This school is unique in Austria regarding its curricular emphasis on economics and environmental issues, leading up to the A-level exams after 5 years of schooling. A further unique aspect, in addition to the curriculum, are additional qualifications, a tight cooperation with international schools and local economy.In the course of the five years, it is obligatory to do a three-month internship, in which the pupils have to gain practical experience in fields relating to the curriculum: laboratory work, office work, and production work. These internships can be done locally or abroad. In order to give all pupils, even those from financially weaker families, the chance to do their internship abroad, we are trying to get support from the Erasmus+ project. Regarding the partnership with Erasmus+, the HLUW can look back on years of successful co-operation comprising 11 Erasmus+ (formerly Leaonardo) projects with 43 companies in 11 different countries.This year, there are 13 pupils from our third form are looking forward to their internships abroad with the help of Erasmus+. Suitable partner companies have been found in Ireland, Great Britain,  Denmark and the Netherlands. All pupils have already signed learning agreements with the partner companies. Support from Erasmus+  enables us to ensure a good quality of the internships.The project always starts in September with informing the parents and pupils about Erasmus+. After finding suitable partner companies, the framework of conditions is defined. During the internship stay, we constantly try to maintain the quality of the training by adopting parts of the ECVET. After supervision by a contact person, a Personal Transcript and a Europass are compiled.The aim of the project is improvement of the competences required by our curriculum. Due to the wide scope of our curriculum, the focus in the various internships will vary, with this year\u2019s activities focussing on production, sciences and sustainability. By doing the internship abroad, further aspects gain importance: improvement of linguistic competence (this year especially in English), improvement of personal and social competence, increasing knowledge of different approaches and ways of work and quality management. This all intensifies the idea of a common Europe. These diverse aspects are expected to increase the competitiveness and employability of our pupils and thus, indirectly, boost the competitiveness of Europe as a whole.Besides the positive effects on the pupils, the school itself and its partner companies also profit from the cultural and technical exchange, since international internships are supposed to increase the transfer of knowledge and thereby the quality of the training at our school as well as the competences within the partner companies. By means of a thorough documentation of this project and by publishing (project reports, publication in the school yearbook and on the school\u2019s homepage, in local newspapers, project presentations and information on our school\u2019s open days) the results of these projects and the idea behind Erasmus+ will be made more widely known.", "http://www.wyevale-nurseries.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016411_6"]]}}, "8QU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1380585600000, 1443571200000, "A portable device for Early detection and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury based on advanced qEEG and HD-TES to prevent major Health problems and specially for use in emergencies and telemedicine", "Primasil Silicones Limited", "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is recognized as a major public health concern, especially for teenagers and young adults, since it can lead to significant disruption in education, working ability, and quality-of-life in general. It is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. 1.2 million EU citizens are hospitalized with TBI each year and of which 50.000 die. The total economic burden in Europe for TBI of all known severities is estimated EUR 33 billion annually. Currently, there is no objective method for diagnosing TBI in an early stage or in emergency, which is a premise to prevent serious health impact. Our idea is to develop a portable medical device for objective and reliable emergency diagnosis of TBI and a monitored personalized treatment based on qEEG (quantitative electroencephalography) and HD-TES (High-Definition Transcranial Electric Stimulation). We propose to create innovative technology for the early detection and treatment of one of the most severe cognitive diseases for the use in emergency, telemedicine, hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. We will achieve this by 1) developing a novel vacuum based helmet device that will enable an accurate positioning system of up to 32 electrodes, 2) developing an instrumentation system that will combine qEEG recording and HD\n-TES treatment, 3) developing a data processing system that will control all measurements and data analysis including the algorithm for early detection and treatment of TBI.

For example, the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association has abundant evidence about the effectiveness of their members\u2019 technology in reducing loss of life and property in office, residential, retail, storage, public venue buildings and in special sites such as ships, control rooms and hospitals.\nThe proper functioning of fire sprinkler systems can be catastrophically undermined by corrosion. The water in the system pipes is stagnant and, if inhibitors are inactive, then this can give rise to microbiological induced corrosion (MIC), which leads to leaks. This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing. MIC may occur in both dry and wet sprinkler systems.\nLong range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) has been developed for screening long lengths of pipe (up to 100m from one test location) for corrosion, especially in otherwise inaccessible areas. It has been used to a limited extent on the feeder pipes and risers in sprinkler systems. However, the pipe lengths are too short (typically <5m) and the defects too small in comparison with the ultrasound wavelengths for current LRUT systems. Moreover the numerous features such as pipe elbows and branches, makes interpretation of ultrasound echo-signals difficult.\nSprinkTest aims to inspect automatic fire sprinkler systems by developing a medium range ultrasonic test (MRUT) system, using higher frequency ultrasound (100KHz -500KHz), smaller flexible transducers to gain access to confined spaces, lower power electronics to allow hand-held portability and sophisticated software to process signals and extract information from the numerous guided ultrasonic waves present at the higher frequencies.", 172528.0, 1061068.0, 6, 10, "SPRINKTEST", null, null, null, "fp7_110842_950321126"]]}}, "9SL": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "SPECIAL METALS WIGGIN LIMITED*", 123562.0, "Research programme for coal (08.05.02)", "fts_2016_17414"]]}}}}
