Among those countries was the United Kingdom and a Primary school in NewCastle. The children at the school in NewCastle are aged between 3 to 11. During a visit at the school, the idea of letting our students at the Child- and Recreation Program have practical experience among these children and teachers, started to grow.\r\nThe school is in a socio-economically deprived area. Engaged and enthusiastic teachers use interesting and instructive methods concerning teaching, special needs teaching and integration.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the project:\r\nis to let students from the Child- and Recreation Program have practical experience for two weeks in NewCastle. Totally will 8 students and a teacher realize practical experience during different periods. The students have defined tasks to execute at the school.The documentation will be carried out in form of notes, blogs, films/photos. The students will communicate with Karlfeldtgymnasiet through mail, skype and Twitter.\r\n\r\nThis is one item in the International development plan of Karlfeldtgymnasiet and to increase the mobility among the students at the Vocational Programs. The effects desired are to increase language skills among students, the status of the Vocational Programs, employment ability and to learn new pedagogical methods. Focus is to learn from the English school how they work with children from socio-economically deprived areas, integration, individual adaptions, to encounter future challenges in the community.\r\nThe project will encourage other Vocational Programs to become more interested in practical experience in other European countries and to attract more students to the Vocational Programs. This is a step to fulfil the goals that our school, the community, the nation and EU have concerning education.", "http://www.thedriveprimary.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034451_1"]]}}, "8DN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Improving teaching and learning", "Lingey House", 1804.0, 1, 1, "Our outstanding school benefits from excellent teaching, but we are looking to give our children a wider perspective of community.  Courses in leadership and MFL methodology and culture will allow our staff to improve their practice and enthuse our children to notice and take part in the wider European community to which we all belong.  The resulting improvements in pedagogy will benefit the school and the wider community by giving us access to the very latest in methodologies.  The three participants are all enthusiastic europhiles and pedagogues, who very much welcome the chance to improve their own practice and to have access to up-to-date perspectives of teaching and learning in School Leadership and MFL teaching.  The result will be improvements in the governance of our school, as well as improved teaching of French and Italian, and new links with other European schools.  With all children at our school learning at least one foreign language, and most learning two, the impact of the project will be wide and deep, and we expect the impact to extend beyond the children to the local community and beyond.", "http://www.lingeyhouseprimary.org", "Lingey House", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002192_coordinator"]]}}, "8LT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Lernen in und von Europa", "Hill Top Specialist Arts College", 7238.0, 2, 2, "Learning in and from Europe\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this project we would like to gain valuable experiences and new ideas by witnessing the school life of our European partner schools firsthand. We hope these new experiences will help to further our school development.\r\n\r\nRegarding the European dimension of inclusion we hope to profit from the vast experiences of Norwegian schools. We intend to include parts of their professional and evaluated experiences in our own process of school development.\r\n\r\nBy sitting in on classes we hope to gain insight into the concepts for successful, effective and inclusive teaching and learning (including methods and resources) which are put into practice at our partner school in the United Kingdom. Further, we are very interested to witness the use of modern media in the classroom regarding the realization of the inclusive principle. The use of the interactive smartboard with the corresponding programmes is of special interest to us.\r\n\r\nIn our school vocational preparation is a key factor and of great relevance in Years 7 to 10 . Therefore we would like to have the opportunity to witness a successful realisation of vocational preparation in Spain. We hope to be able to transfer successful concepts of vocational preparation and thus increase our student\u00b4s learning motivation and as a consequence lower the rate of school absentism and truancy.\r\n\r\nBy gaining valuable insights and experiences in the European partner schools and institutions our participating staff will strenghten their competences and expand their horizons as well as their set of professional skills.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement the newly gained knowledge and experiences in our daily school life we intend to conduct regular teacher training sessions. During the course of these sessions the insights are supposed to be evaluated and modified so they fit our school\u00b4s needs.\r\n\r\nThe insights regarding the inclusive principle will be presented to the think tank of the District Government of M\u00fcnster which deals with the topic of inclusion in schools. The think tank not only deals with the topic of inclusion in schools, it also offers the opportunity to receive advice and exchange ideas. This service reaches several mainstream and special needs schools in the county of Steinfurt.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish concept of vocational preparation is supposed to be presented at StuBO meetings (study and vocational choice coordinators) held in the county of Steinfurt. At the meetings the transferability of the Spanish concepts to German schools will be discussed at lenght.\r\n\r\nThe six participating staff members are extremely motivated to join this project. A few of the participating staff members already have experiences of working abroad. The staff will be delighted to have the opportunity to witness the `good practice\u00b4 examples in Europe. We sincerely believe that gaining insights firsthand will support our school development greatly.", "http://www.hilltop.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA101-000076_1"]]}}}}
