Evidence of the bespoke delivery and \"entrepreneurial learning\" philosophy championed by SALT can be seen in the Liverpool FC Foundation College (LFCFC). Created in 2012, and delivered in partnership with Liverpool FC (an English Premier League professional Football Club), LFCFC aims to equip students with the skills and experience to progress into education or employment within sport.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of students at the LFCFC. Working with host partner Escuela Futbol Huesca (EFH) in Spain, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into SALT, the LFCFC programme and students.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding lifelong learning principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThere are currently 160 students at the college of which approximately 86% are male, 14% are female and 11% are from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups.
