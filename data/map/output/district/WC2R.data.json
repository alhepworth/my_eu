Most of the elements of the aerodynamics of conventional aircraft are modelled and understood to some degree but reliable solutions are not available due to new challenges appearing as the technology matures. One of the most common problems is related to stability analysis for configurations in the limits of the flight envelope or when unsteady effects are dominant.

The occurring risks are bigger than production of big series such as automotive. Thus, new ICT-based approaches are required. The aim is to develop mitigation strategies to respond faster to unexpected events. Therefore the knowledge base has to be enriched for real-time decision support, to detect early warning and to accelerate learning. Our approach is based on a new generation of service orientated enterprise information platforms, a service orientated bus integrating service-based architecture and knowledge-based multi-agent systems (MAS). A holonic MAS combined with a service architecture will improve performance and scalability beyond the state of the art. The solution integrates multiple layers of sensors, legacy systems and agent-based tools for beneficial services like learning, quality, risk and cost management. Additionally the ecological footprints will be reduced. The ARUM solution will run in two modes: predictive and real time simulation. The predictive mode supports the planning phase whereas the real-time operations mode supports dynamic, time-, cost- and risk-oriented re-planning of operations. The provision of information for engineering to alter in case of immaturity or late requests for changes is supported equally. ARUM is strongly end-user driven and the results will be tested on three industrial use cases with a focus on aircraft, aircraft interiors and ship manufacturing. The solution will be validated in a real industrial environment by industrial partners and benchmarked against today's ICT solutions.

It has a direct relevance to both skin friction and flow separation. Manipulation of the Reynolds stress can directly lead to changes in the viscous stress at the wall so as to effectively control the flow for effective flow control.\nHowever, there is a lack of current understanding of the inter-relationship between the various flow control devices and the Reynolds stresses in the flow field they produced. An improved understanding can potentially significantly improve the effectiveness of flow control as the Reynolds stresses are closely related to the flow behaviour at the surface for effective separation control or drag reduction. A variety of control devices are available and new ones are invented but which one for what purpose is an open question yet to be fully answered.\nMARS proposal proposes to reverse that process and consider the long term goal of controlling dynamic structures that influence the Reynolds stress that changes the mean flow. This radical approach recognises we are still some way away from hardware to implement it at flight scales but if successful, would establish a first important step towards our ultimate ambition.\nThe focus of MARS will be on the effects of a number of active flow control devices on the discrete dynamic components of the turbulent shear layers and the Reynolds stress.

Dysregulated mitochondrial activity results in generation of free radicals which cause damage to cellular components. We reported that mitochondrial quality control by autophagy is essential for normal cardiac functions (Nat Med 2007). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains bacteria-like unmethylated CpG motifs, which are inflammatogenic. We reported that mtDNA that escapes from autophagy-mediated degradation leads to inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes and heart failure (Nature 2012). Damaged mitochondria in failing hearts are selectively removed by mitochondria-selective autophagy, mitophagy. Mitophagy is preceded by mitochondrial fission, which divides elongated mitochondria into pieces for autophagy. Although Atg32 is essential for mitophagy in yeast, no homologue has been known in mammals. Recently, we identified Bcl2-like protein 13 (Bcl2-L-13) as a functional mammalian homologue of Atg32 which induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy (Nat Commun in press) in mammalian cells.

Despite its significance, measuring metastatic potential as well as potential indicators of therapy efficacy remain unmet clinical challenges. Recently, it has been demonstrated in vitro, that aggressive metastatic cells pull on their surroundings suggesting that metastatic potential could be gauged by measuring the forces exert by tumours. Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is no non-invasive modality that can directly image these forces in vivo.\nOur objective is the non-invasive measurement of both IFP within tumours as well as the forces they exert on their surrounding environment. This will be used to predict a tumour\u2019s metastatic potential and importantly, changes in these forces will be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy of drug therapy. To attain this goal, the biomechanical properties of the tumour and its neighbouring tissue will be measured via MR-elastography at various measured deformation states.

Here, we first propose a number of novel developments to order to extend this approach from a tool for small systems to a widespread disruptive technology, with application to a variety of challenging problems. This involves development of the scope, scaling, accuracy and capabilities of this sampling, including admitting time-dependent, spectral and relativistic extensions. Next, we aim to take the successful philosophy of this sampling and exploit its powerful approach in order to reformulate a number of well-established electronic structure tools. Allowing stochasticity has the potential to yield low-scaling formulations of these methods, able to naturally exploit inherent sparsity, and have a revolutionary impact on their use and success.

For this reason neurons employ different strategies to maintain their excitability within reasonable bounds.

By these means, I will illustrate how Western thought has been nourished by the ethos of a particular religious order and by Islamic thought, pointing up a shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity that is often overlooked but urgently needed to overcome severe fractures in today\u2019s society. At the same time, I will emphasize that Franciscan ideas only became modern once removed from their practice-led context. In juxtaposing the cultural paradigms of philosophy and religious practice, consequently, I will advance knowledge by producing the first nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought.", 1182681.0, 1307091.0, 2, 2, "INNOVATION", null, "http://www.kcl.ac.uk", null, "h2020_207376_999981052"]], "extra": 373}, "creative": {"data": [[1477180800000, 1510704000000, "Live Cinema EU", "KING'S COLLEGE LONDON", 45212.0, 4, 6, "Live Cinema EU will for the first time, bring together international leaders in creating live cinema events (film screenings enhanced with live music, theatrical performance or increased audience participation), to explore whether audience size for European films can be increased through the development of live elements at film screenings as part of core festival programming.

There is a clear need for modernising higher education by making students more active in their education and encouraging them to take ownership of their studies. This approach fosters the skills graduates will need to be successful in the 21st century: innovation and creativity, participation and responsibility, as well critical thinking and informed judgement. However, this approach is still not widespread in European HE, which sometimes appears stuck in the 19th century. In part this is because there is a great deal of scepticism towards this kind of education. Even in those institutions that are committed to this approach to education \u2013 as all partner institutions of CREATES are \u2013 difficult questions remain such as: \u201cHow to design, implement and assess courses which are co-created by students?\u201d and  \u201cHow to provide effective advising for sound curricular choices?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe first objective of CREATES is to answer these questions, by producing and disseminating transferable tool-kits for better implementing this approach to education. The second objective is to inform decision-makers at HE institutions and in public policy about the relevance of this kind of education.\r\n\r\nPROJECT TEAM: All partners in this project are committed to providing responsive, engaging and tailored education and have extensive experience with it. Together, they form a genuine European community of practice, that is at the forefront of educational innovation. The partners involved are:\r\n\u2013 Leuphana University L\u00fcneburg  \r\n\u2013 The University of Freiburg \r\n\u2013 King\u2019s College London \r\n\u2013 Maastricht University \r\n\u2013 Sciences Po Paris\r\n\u2013 Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa\r\n\r\nA key elements of the joint project will be the production of:\r\n\u2013 4 versatile tool-kits for learning practices\r\n\u2013 a academic paper\r\n\u2013 a position paper \r\n\u2013 policy recommendations for policy makers \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS: The four tool-kits will contribute to the first major objective of CREATES. They will explore two ways of enhancing students\u2019 engagement and responsibility: firstly, effective design, implementation and assessment of responsive and engaged learning on the module-level (design; process; assessment) and, secondly, effective support for students in shaping a personalised curriculum (faculty advising, peer advising, self-advising). These tool-kits will be developed through intensive cooperation, in small teams made up of faculty from the partner institutions, practiced in training events, tested twice, and disseminated through open-access platforms. Throughout this process, students will be actively involved, mirroring the rationale of the project. \r\n\r\nThe second major objective of CREATES will be realised through the production of three outputs: a academic paper for the higher education research community, a report, describing justifications for and ways of implementing the educational strategies developed, targeted at decision-makers within HE institutions, and a policy-paper for HE policy makers on the national and European level. \r\n\r\nThe quality and timely implementation of each step of the project will be monitored by a central steering committee, together with a group of experts from various civil society and a group of exemplary graduates from the partner institutions. \r\n \r\nIMPACT and SUSTAINABILITY: CREATES is designed to benefit a variety of target groups, including:   \r\n\u2013 Those directly participating in the project, by forming a sound community of practice; \r\n\u2013 Faculty and staff, both at partner institutions and at third institutions, who will be able to realise better learning practices\r\n\u2013 Students, who will be directly involved in the development and testing of the tools\r\n\u2013 The national community of HE innovation; \r\n\u2013 Higher-Education leaders and managers, who can initiate change within their own institutions in particular on the national level\r\n\u2013 Policy-makers on a national and European level, who will be able to base their decisions on better information, best practices and sound evidence.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the results from CREATES  is an integral part of the project. Special importance is given to an open access website on which the toolkit and documents will be available and to the four multiplier events. The dissemination strategy ties into the long-term sustainability of the project in three ways:\r\n\u2013 The results of CREATES will  become part of each partner institution\u2019s educational culture and learning practices \r\n\u2013 The open access web page will serve as a dynamic platform for a wider European network of institutions committed to this educational approach\r\n\u2013 All partner institutions are committed to further co-operation beyond the funding period and will be conducting researching, in a next step, how exactly these innovative practices stimulate students to take responsibility for their education and for society.", "http://www.kcl.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE01-KA203-003599_1"], [2015, "Jean Monnet Centre for Europe in the World at King's College London", "KING'S COLLEGE LONDON", 72330.0, 1, 1, "The primary purpose of the proposed Jean Monnet Centre for Europe in the World at King's College London is to act as a catalyst and impetus for joint activities of staff and students across Law, Humanities and Social Sciences.

The users need tools to assess the available counter-measures, the current and future threat situations, identify and quantify the risks and aid their decisions before and during their voyages.\nPROMERC aims to reduce the vulnerability of EU merchant fleets and maritime supply lines to criminal abduction and extortion and thereby reduce risk to mariners, shipping, and the environment, while also reducing costs. This will be delivered through the provision of:\n-        Independent review and recommendations about non-lethal technologies for pirate avoidance and opposing the boarding of vessels by pirates.\n-        An automated voyage planning support tool to aid shore based authorities, which will balance routeing to mitigate risk against incurring additional fuel costs due to re-routeing and increased speed.\n-        An automated decision support tool to provide seafarers with real time threat assessment, evaluation of possible courses of action and a recommended course of action. A manual to aid in the selection and use of appropriate counter piracy measures in a layered holistic defence.\n-        Recommendations on the further development of counter piracy measures.", 75389.0, 2389433.0, 7, 10, "PROMERC", "http://www.promerc.eu/", "http://www.seasecurity.org", null, "fp7_185492_952371027"]]}}, "3DX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1201824000000, 1259539200000, "Europe's evolving security: drivers, trends and scenarios", "Inernational Institute for Strategic Studies (Iiss)", "The objective of the FORESEC support action is to tie together the multiple threads of existing work on the future of European security in an attempt to provide a more cogent guidance, orientation and structure to all future security related research activities. The project will enhance the shared vision and facilitate the emergence of a coherent and holistic approach to current and future threats and challenges for European security amongst the community of official and non-official constituencies involved. In particular, it will identify security responses in which there is particular added-value and shared interest to work at the European level. The project builds a pan-European network around the European security foresight processes and initiates a societal debate on European security and security research. The FORESEC support action is targeted at providing critical policy support and advice for security researchers and decision-makers with view to providing recommendations in the medium- to long-term timeframe. The support action also produces results relevant for the broader security policy community and policy makers. FORESEC uses participatory foresight methodology apt for the attainment of its objectives. The foresight process includes the following elements: scanning, with a view to exploiting relevant elements, previous pertinent work; creating and using participatory methods (an e-platform for exchange and interaction among stakeholders and experts in between face-to-face meetings, Delphi studies and focus groups where expert and non-expert opinions on a specific issue are collected and analysed); the development of descriptions of possible future crisis situations in order to anticipate and prepare for potential future scenarios; and the analysis of technological opportunities on the horizon with a view to analysing their impact for use in policy-making contexts.", 177180.0, 794192.0, 6, 6, "FORESEC", "http://www.foresec.eu", "http://www.iiss.org", "/docs/results/images/2011-01/45461.jpg", "fp7_88096_999906168"]]}}, "3HY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1222819200000, 1341014400000, "Initial Training Network for Wave Energy Research Professionals", "Wave Dragon Ltd", "The proposed action builds strongly up on the logics of its predecessor with the same name. The overall objective is to create a pool of specialised wave energy research professionals to support an emerging industry in a field with a very strong anticipated growth and no dedicated existing training curriculum. Although most jobs can be done being a trained engineer in one of the adjacent fields, the existance of interdisciplinary skilled researchers trained in direct connection to the technology development is vital for successful development. In the predecessor, almost all fellows where immediatley absorbed by industrial players in the field or continued research in the host institution. The work plan for WAVETRAIN 2 fellows is specifically directed towards a wide range of challenges that industrial-scale wave energy implementation faces in the present situation, with some bias towards technical issues, from hydrodynamic and PTO (Power-Take-Off) design, to instrumentation issues and energy storage and cost reduction show to be critical for successful deployment. On the other hand, also non-technical \u201cbarriers\u201d, typically less tangible difficulties related to legal issues (licensing, conflicts of use, EIA procedures, grid connection, regional differences) and the non-sufficient representation of socio-economic benefits of the sector, will be dealt with, as they are seen as a major obstacel for fast implementation on a European scale. The methodology to achieve the desired results is to provide (i) in-depth training in one applied research topic (host institution), (ii) good interdisciplinary background and understanding of industry environment (short courses and secondments), and (iii) active participation in wave power plant testing in the sea (some of the profiles; others: site visits).
