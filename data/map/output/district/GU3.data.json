Unfortunately, signal intensities in conventional MRI images are expressed in relative units that depend on scanner hardware and acquisition protocols. While this does not hinder visual inspection of anatomy, it hampers quantitative comparison of tissue properties within a scan, between successive scans, and between subjects. In contrast, advanced quantitative MRI (Q-MRI) methods like MR relaxometry or diffusion MRI do enable absolute quantification of biophysical tissue characteristics. Evidence is growing that Q-MRI techniques detect subtle microscopic damage, enabling more accurate and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, due to the long scan time required for Q-MRI, causing discomfort for patients and limiting the throughput, Q-MRI methods have not entered clinical practice yet. \n\nB-Q MINDED aims to overcome the current barriers by developing widely-applicable post-processing breakthroughs for accelerating Q-MRI. The originality of B-Q MINDED lies in its ambition to replace the conventional rigid multi-step processing pipeline with an integrated single-step parameter estimation framework. This approach will unlock a wealth of options for optimization of Q-MRI. To accomplish this goal, B-Q MINDED proposes a collaborative cross-disciplinary approach (from basic MR physics to clinical applications) with strong involvement of industry (2 MRI vendors and 3 MRI-software SMEs). \n\nB-Q MINDED proposes a unique training platform that enables young European researchers to develop a holistic view on Q-MRI research and development. The fellows enrolled in B-Q MINDED will have access to a variety of network-wide training events and will gain essential transferable skills that will positively affect their employability in academia and industry. By combining research, innovation, and education, B-Q MINDED will pave the way for introducing Q-MRI into the clinic.", 476525.0, 3366221.0, 5, 13, "B-Q MINDED", null, null, null, "h2020_211569_923682113"], [1325376000000, 1419984000000, "Sustainable Cleaning and Disinfection in Fresh-Cut Food Industries", "Modern Water Services Ltd", "SUSCLEAN will contribute to the development and implementation of a new generation of environment-friendly equipment sanitation and food product decontamination technologies ensuring food safety. Susclean is focused on minimally-processed vegetables (MPV) i.e. vegetables physically altered from their original form by slicing and cutting but remaining in a fresh state. We will develop knowledge, methods and tools aimed to; a) design new decontamination approaches for MPV and sanitation strategies for their processing equipment along the supply chain; b) propose guidance and recommendations to renew the best available processing techniques (BAT); c) consider the impact of sanitation and decontamination strategies in line with the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) 2008/1/CE, and d) improve the hygienic design of equipment for the fresh-cut product industry.\nThe hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) method will be carried out from post-harvest to processing, taking into account shelf-life after packaging. For each critical point considered, we will study the microbial colonisation patterns, improve the equipment geometry and surface features, and propose innovative and/or optimised current sanitation and decontamination strategies. This will lead to holistic cleaning and disinfecting strategies combining the design of alternative equipment geometries and surfaces (preventive), proposals for innovative cleaning techniques (curative) and application of alternative disinfecting agents (remediation).\nThese achievements will lead to reduction of the use of water and chemicals (chlorine) up to 20-50%, whilst ensuring food safety, sustainable practices and preserving fresh-cut food European quality and competitiveness.

Inorganic hydrates, such as C-S-H, are used in applications from construction to dentistry. In every case, there is need to optimise the hydrate properties for the application. More reactive cements are needed to lower the CO2 impact of construction. Dentistry needs improved mechanical stability. The traditional way to improve hydrates is by trial and error. This is ineffective. ERICA offers a transformative materials science approach based on gaining detailed understanding the associated nanoscience. ERICA seeks coherent understanding and control of hydrate nucleation and growth as a means to control properties; of the first water sorption cycle when hydrates undergo structural change the consequences of which for performance are only just becoming apparent; and of water transport in hydrates that severely impacts degradation. To do this ERICA exploits recent developments in understanding of hydrate chemistry, in 1H NMR relaxometry and in numerical modeling. Success with ERICA will (i) give industry ways to target design hydrates; (ii) create numerical software tools to model hydrate performance; and (iii) leave good practice and know-how to adopt emergent methods. ERICA trains 13 multi-disciplinary researchers: ESRs ready to find employment with cement product manufacturers, instrumentation manufacturers, in numerical modeling and in academia. This cohort is much needed by industry. The ESRs receive comprehensive academic and transferable skills training comprised of residential schools, workshops, peer learning and industry secondments. Training and dissemination are delivered in collaboration with the industry-academic cement science network: NANOCEM. Courses will be made into MOOCs.

Mobilities, over a period of two years, will take place in young, dynamic and avant-garde companies operating in FR, DE, ES, DK, UK, S, FI, SLO, IE and LT. The work experience will be implemented with on-the-job training methods and through the direct practice of tasks relating to the relevant professional profiles.\r\n\r\nThe high potential of the initiative appears even more substantial if we look at the target to which it refers, in fact the surveys conducted by the Consortium on the condition of the students that are about to take further education or try to find a job, outline an updated picture showing that they: \r\n-  possess limited awareness of their knowledge and inadequate ability to apply this knowledge; \r\n-  complain of a general lack of operational skills and a lack of familiarity with the professional world;\r\n-  show a general lack of trust in future employment prospects;\r\n-  tend to postpone further education in order to have a first investigate the work market;\r\n-  require guidance on how to make best use of their informal and non-formal training. \r\n\r\nThe realization of 4 week internships in companies, as well as the pilot experimentation of the ERAMUS PRO mobility, will offer the participants the opportunity to develop their skills, in an attempt to reduce the negative aspects above listed. The experience abroad will be carefully prepared by a linguistic, cultural, pedagogical and sectorial reinforcement program (OLS, digital skills for the professional world, health and safety in the workplace, specific technical seminars). The qualitative management of all the planned activities, the recognition, certification and validation of skills will be guaranteed by the application of ECVET tools.\r\nThe expected results, with regard to the identified needs and objectives, are:\r\n- development of communicative-linguistic and technical-professional skills in the participants with respect to the project sectors;\r\n- strengthening of technical and professional skills and consequent improvement of the professional curriculum through a certified, recognized and validated path;\r\n- acquisition of increasingly qualitative mobility experiences to be transferred, through the testimony of the beneficiaries themselves, into the local, cultural and professional reality, families, social partners and companies;\r\n- training experience designed to promote employability, thanks to the inclusion of the 10 new graduates (who will experience the Erasmus PRO measure), in one of the world's leading companies in the field related to this initiative;\r\n- strengthening of the project\u2019s synergies with other initiatives, to promote the creation of a stable network and the realization of successful projects.\r\n\r\nThe capitalization of the experience will be achieved through the active participation of beneficiaries in national and European initiatives (meetings with companies and social partners, week of Digital Cultures and Crowddreaming Competition), supported by the use of the e-CF and ECVET.
