The term was coined in 1950 by Erik Erikson to denote a concern for establishing and guiding: in Erikson\u2019s Stages of Psychosocial Development, generativity is defined as a struggle against stagnation that ascends during adulthood, when a process of guidance left the place for a process of guiding the next generations, fin education as on social fields, from raising a child to stop a tradition of abuse, from writing a family history to starting new organization, from designing and implementing innovative ICT tools for PCM and to develop effective and sustainable services. The project aims to make a difference with one's life, to give back and take care of one's community.The substantial objectives are to strengthen the quality of the competence in design and implementation of effective and sustainable social interventions through the offer of learning materials, creation of collaborative empowerment field and the acquisition of ICT and PCM skills.To achieve them, the partnership is composed by high-level organizations creating a multi-levelled integrated consortia in term of:- legal entity: varies from 1st level (local associations IT, EL, PL, UK, CY), 2nd level (regional and national umbrella organizations IT, FR) and 3rd level ( EU-federations BE); private and public bodies; the consortia has direct impact in 28 Member States- level of impact with dissemination: locally-based (in BE, IT, FR); country specific (BE, FR, IT, EL); EU-wide (BE)- range of activities: from high-education (EL); quality management (CY, PL, IT); evaluation (UK); ICT expert (PL, IT); inclusion policies for homelessness (BE, FR, IT, EU), migrants, refugees (BE, FR, IT, EU)The project sets a clear distribution of the target groups on 3 different levels:1- high-level/senior staff (IT, PL, CY, EL) as trainer and expert to confront and further develop their skills in adult education and PCM, with the opportunity to pass their competence & skills within a generativity scheme2- educational staff and professionals in adult education and PCM (BE, FR, IT, EL) that need to be trained in new tools and innovative PCM methods, implemented in 2.0 environments, they will receive Europass-certified training; the group is based on \"train the trainers\" methodology in order to foster the passing and the acquisition of transversal competences from high-level senior professionals3- adult learners and end-users of social and educational interventions, as expression of the civil society (BE, IT, FR, PL, EL, CY, UK), which belong to different social categories, such as unemployed, immigrants, pensioners, that have the need to benefit from sustainable and effective intervention within an increasing inclusive educational community, to develop their skills and competences. The project is designed on the following process to reach the following outputs:- IO1: educational platform on PCM:  O1A1: initial research on relevant frameworks and libraries  O1A2: setting up the OER platform - beta version  O1A3: populating the OER platform with materials  O1A4: piloting and evaluation  O1A5: final improvements, adjustments ongoing constant updates- IO2: training modules on innovative, effective and sustainable project cycle management  O2A1: experienced-based research on relevant literacy on PCM  O2A2: design and text of the training modules  O2A3: editing of the training modules  O2A4: final implementation, use and adjustments- IO3: online tutorials on effective PCM targeted to social interventions  O3A1: preparation of the structure  O3A2: preparation of learning contents  O3A3: final adjustment to the learning contentsThe dissemination plan is clearly structured on the methodology of the cascade effect:- 22 participants to the LTTA Shortterm joint staff training event- 70 particpants to 7 workshops to pass the IO2 training modules on PCM- 1080 minimum individuals receiving the IO2- 270 participants minimum to 9 multiplier events- minimum 1000 contacts to IO1 and on LinkedIn existing groups receveing all dissemination materialsThe evidences strongly enlighten that the most educated and competent the staff is, the more sustainable and efficient are the interventions, the more positive they impact on the end-users, maximizing the investment and cost/benefit ratio", "http://www.eec.uk.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE01-KA204-016279_7"]]}}}}
