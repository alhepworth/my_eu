This is essential to allow us to meet the requirements of the Scottish Government policy to ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to learn two languages in addition to their mother tongue. Given the challenges of accessing quality teacher training from our remote location, the mobility project requires attendance on two follow up immersion language training courses, in France and Spain.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to develop staff confidence and therefore pupil experience in learning in MFL, and to inspire a continuing love of language learning that will extend to study in secondary school and beyond. The project will embed language learning across the curriculum, and develop the European dimension in our small, but outward looking school. The use of new methodologies and ICT will enhance language learning also, and this will be complemented by the development of an eTwinning project. The participant is the Teaching Head of a small rural primary, with a passion for language, and the desire to extend and share this within the school and wider management group. The project will involve total immersion in the target language, professional discussion around key language learning methodology and pedagogy, and access to new resources for inspiring language learning. It is expected that this project will enable Glenlyon Primary to meet (or exceed) the requirements of the Scottish Government's 1+2 programme by the deadline of 2020, with L2 (French) being embedded across the curriculum through all stages of the school, from Nursery to Primary 7, and L3 (Spanish) from Primary 5 to Primary 7. It is envisaged that attainment in MFL will increase, and cultural awareness of Europe will develop also, particularly through the use of eTwinning.\r\nThe potential longer term benefits are that pupils will develop and maintain enthusiasm for life-long language learning and have a greater cultural understanding of themselves as global citizens, and their responsibilities as such.", "http://www.glenlyonprimary.org.uk", "Glenlyon Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047195_coordinator"], [2016, "Language Training", "Glenlyon Primary School", 1628.0, 1, 1, "I am the teaching Head of a very small rural school in Highland Perthshire. As part of my teaching remit I teach French daily. I now want to prepare for introducing Spanish as my L3, in line with the national expectations of the 1+2 initiative. As part of a small cluster of schools in a geographically challenging situation, I need to develop my skills in language teaching, for the benefit of all of the children in my school, to ensure that they have the very best chance of developing a love for language, and the knowledge of what benefits that can bring. My aims in this project are to develop my own understanding of the best, most current methodologies in language teaching, including the use of ICT as an effective tool for learning and recording learning. I also want to develop my understanding and cultural awareness of modern day Spain, within the framework of Europe as a whole, to allow me to teach this in an inspiring way that will motivate learners and spark curiosity about the diversity that is such a strength of the whole European Union. This will allow me to fully embrace the Scottish national guidelines of the 1+2 initiative, and embed language learning in my school curriculum, over the coming years. The immersion aspect of the course is a model that is proven to be effective, and I feel that it would provide the framework vital for continued success in effective learning and teaching of modern foreign languages. The longer term benefits will be increased capacity for improvement in language learning and teaching within my group of very small schools, the ability to share and network good practice, and improved attainment in language learning for pupils in our schools. The heightened profile of language teaching and the joy of language learning will be shared regularly with parents and the local community.", "http://www.glenlyonprimary.org.uk", "Glenlyon Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023978_coordinator"]]}}}}
