However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 202917.0, 4193116.0, 8, 29, "CloudSME", null, null, null, "fp7_109223_951739169"]]}}, "1JL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "R\u00e9gion et Acad\u00e9mie Mobilis\u00e9es pour des Stages Europ\u00e9ens Strat\u00e9giques", "Glasgow City Council Education Services", 726030.0, 5, 12, "The RAMSES project - Region and Academy Mobilized for Strategic European Work Experiences - is part of an ambitious strategy aimed at increasing the level of international scope of the academy and reach over 50% of vocational high schools with a mobility program.\r\nThe academy is facing significant social challenges creating forms of segregation. In 2016 the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy ranked second in France and the number of people with \u201cvulnerabilities in economic, family and cultural terms\u201d is the highest in France - 45% of the population. Within the age group of 15-24 years old the Academy has a dropout rate of 28.8% in comparison to 25.4% for France. (CEREQ)\r\nWithin this dropout rate, the highest number comes from vocational high schools. An effective way to limit early school leaving and contribute to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives is to create a dynamic environment in vocational high schools. This will allow students from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds, often coming from migrant families or rural areas with fewer mobility opportunities to do their work experience in a European country.\r\nDue to the severity of the issue as described above, along with our previous successes, we the steering committee (DAREIC, GIP FCIP and the PACA Region) wish to support 42 vocational high schools in the implementation of work experiences in Europe for 902 less privileged students studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel during a 24 month period (689 Erasmus mobility grants and 213 Region co financing).\r\nThe main objective is to give them the opportunity to live an experience that will be an essential added value for their socio-professional integration. In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services. The DAREIC will coordinate the preparation, mentoring, implementation and enhancement of mobility activities of each school working together with the PACA Region. The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons. This could be achieved through the dissemination of information, personalized pre-departure coaching and by making the most of the experience gained thus creating the conditions for success within schools.\r\nGIP-FCIP, DAREIC and Region will work as a steering committee that will evaluate and measure the impact of the project, in order to develop a strategy to improve practices as well as the quality of mobility and capitalize on acquired experiences. \r\nThe impacts of this project are numerous.

They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her. Every year we have some pupils from the Euro section being on one of the three first ranks.\r\nOur expectations for the future :\r\nWe hope to motivate pupils to integrate our European section in the future years. Indeed, it is still new and pupils don't really know what it is. It stays too abstract for them. \r\nIf our current pupils can go on a work placement abroad, they could talk about it to the future pupils wishing to study administrative management and promote the European section when they participate in different students or professional fairs, or at our school when we organize our open day event.", "http://www.glasgow.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036897_2"]]}}, "1QE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1209600000000, 1317340800000, "Distributed Control of Large-Scale Offshore Wind Farms project proposal", "Industrial Systems and Control Limited", "A key socio-economic challenge for Europe is: how to deal with a climate change, while meeting rapidly increasing demand for energy and ensuring security of supply? Wind energy can be a significant part of the answer. The new frontier of the wind industry is large-scale offshore wind farms. While promising, considerable research and development tasks remain to be carried out before it reaches its full potential in terms of the efficient, stable, safe, predictable and controllable supply of energy. Closed loop control of wind power installations has historically been decentralized and a collection of wind turbines in farms is a highly complex system with interdependencies through the shared resource, the wind. Wind turbines are affected by the wind but they also changes the wind field within the farm through the control. To address objectives related to cost, quality of power and mechanical loads, models and control paradigms must be developed that allow wind resource allocation to individual turbines. Inspired by the industrial case of complex large-scale distributed offshore wind farms, the Aeolus project will research and develop models that allow real-time predictions of flows and incorporate measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensor devices.

The centre has 9 ESRs, 2 Experienced Researchers and 10 supervisory UStrath Academic Staff.\nThe aim of the APESA EID is to train ESRs in an industry-centred research environment that will equip them with a range of scientific, business and transferable skills while enhancing the research capability and competitiveness of WMNL to provide a clear, distinct advantage over competitors.", 1141044.0, 1141044.0, 2, 2, "APESA", null, "http://www.strath.ac.uk", null, "h2020_196833_999974068"], [1317427200000, 1475193600000, "Single-atom-resolved detection and manipulation of strongly correlated fermions in an optical lattice", "University of Strathclyde", "I propose to realize single-atom- and spin-resolved in-situ imaging of strongly correlated fermions in an optical lattice.

Direct observation of individual atoms and analysis of their quantum states and their spatial order in the lattice, including individual defects, are then possible. I will use this novel detection method to characterize, e.g., temperature or entropy distribution of the quantum phases such as fermionic  Mott insulators, Band insulators or  metallic phases.\nTogether with the possibility of local spin manipulations, I will investigate the effect of local perturbations on the system by spatially resolving the ensuing dynamical in-trap evolution. In this way, propagation and healing of artificially created defects can be studied. Local scale density modulations such as Friedel and Wigner oscillations of one-dimensional systems with hard boundaries will become observable. The local manipulation of the trapped atoms will be the key to implement novel cooling schemes that can remove regions of high entropy from the system.

EXCILIGHT is characterised by an innovative multidisciplinary approach, based on i) a combination of synthesis, physical characterisation and development of devices with the lighting industry, ii) an appropriate balance between research and transferable skills training, and iii) a strong contribution from the private sector, including leading industry and SMEs, through mentoring, courses and secondments.\n\nEXCILIGHT will positively impact the employability of its ESRs in the OLED industry through scientific and industrial training at the local and network level.

Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics. The most promising schemes will be presented to policymakers and other stakeholders with attendant implementation and risk-management strategies.\n\nThis ambitious project will not succeed if it is developed and championed merely by one sector of society, be it academia, \u201cbig pharma,\u201d or public health. The robustness and applicability of the proposed alternative models will only be proportional to their level of input from all involved players. All work from beginning to end will be performed in close collaboration with the consortium\u2019s stakeholder partners, which run the gamut from patients and clinical societies to small- and medium-sized enterprises, large pharmaceutical companies, healthcare payers, public health officials, and government officials. The DRIVE-AB consortium will dedicate considerable resources to this collaboration and to the final dissemination of information to policymakers and the wider public.\n\nOverall, we are confident that the work of the DRIVE-AB consortium will have an immense impact.

Bigger size offers bigger opportunities and economics of scale, but when a bigger ship accommodates more passengers there may be a higher risk, if evacuation is needed. Thus, new approaches have to be used and further developed in order to have the flooding under control if the watertight integrity of the ship is lost.  In the worst case, all flooding accidents may lead to the capsizing or sinking of the ship within a highly variable time frame.\n\nThe need to ensure safe return to port or at least sufficient time for abandonment, will form major challenge in ship design. However, the assessment of the available time and the evacuation decision are not easy tasks. This process is complicated and there is a notable lack of data. Thus, guidelines and methods to tackle these problems must be developed. New tools are required in order to increase the designers' and operators' possibilities to reliably evaluate the ship's capability to survive in flooding accidents.\n\nThis project sets to derive most of the missing data for validation of time-domain numerical tools for assessment of ship survivability and to develop a standard for a comprehensive measure of damaged ship stability, as a means of addressing systematically, rationally and effectively the risk of flooding.\n\nUnlike any current regulations the envisaged standard will reflect the stochastic nature of the damaged ship stability in waves. It will be based on first-principles modeling and thus it will reflect the nature of foundering as a process comprising loss of either (or both), flotation and stability, but also and more importantly ultimate loss of human life.\n\nSince risk-based, the standard will form a basis for decision support.

The module has introductions and aims for each workshop, comprehensive facilitator notes, clear methods, activities and timings, easy-to-use materials (e.g. websites, Activity sheets), learning outcomes for each session, assessment strategies linked to learning outcomes, suitable for curriculum and non-curriculum-based delivery. adaptable to the needs of language students.\r\n\r\nThe project's focus is the employability of language graduates as statistics show that languages skills are quite low in some of the partner countries. Objectives are embedding employability within language teaching and successful collaboration between careers professionals and academics, and employers in relation to languages and employability.

Implementation of diverse ways of delivery will also be part of this transfer and supported by P7.\r\n\r\nThe project partners are from Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland (3 partners), Italy, Poland (2 partners) and UK. AHECS (P2) and SAP (P3) are both based in Ireland and will advise the partnership when working at their intellectual output number one. This will ensure that previous experience when developing this innovative example of best practice is not lost (AHECS) and that the industry's perspective is included when designing the new content (SAP). As the first phase of the needs analysis (what skills are employers looking for when employing language graduates?) is vitally important for the quality of the content of the employability module. P4 will take the lead here. P1, P5, P6, P8 and P9 are all responsible for the transfer of the module and including innovative examples of best practice in the language sector. This also ensures the cooperation between industry (led by P3), language staff and career services in HE. \r\n\r\nProject target groups are in the tertiary education sector; focusing on Third Level students, who are the main beneficiaries. The adapted AHECS module will also be disseminated to secondary schools\u2019 career advisers in each partner\u2019s country (e.g. IGC in Ireland)  in order to maximise the impact of the materials that are developed. Career advisers and academic staff in third level institutions will take an active role in the adaptation of the AHECS Employability module supported by AHECS staff participating in the project.  Language staff in collaboration with local career services will develop, pilot and deliver the new content of the revised module to language students in their institutions.\r\n\r\nMain outputs:\r\nAn adapted AHECS Employability module in different target languages and specified for the country specific language sector.

The European Commission as well as the Council of Europe have elaborated policies to support multilinguism and interculturalism in order to enhance businesses\u2019 competitiveness and citizens\u2019 mobility and employability, e.g. \u201cEuropean Strategy for Multilingualism: Benefits and Cost\u201d (2016). The motivation theories are already available (D\u00f6rnyei et al., 2014). We propose to apply these to energise young people to perform better multilingual and intercultural skills. An example for this is \u2018creating the vision\u2019, that is, to construct vision of who they could become as multilingual users and what knowing several languages could add to their lives. \r\nHowever, recent findings on European level (http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/multilingualism_en) or on local (national) level, for ex. in the \u201cDanish National Language Strategy\u201d (2017), show that there is a large percentage of young people who do not have sufficient language skills, and, simultaneously, there is a growing demand for multilingual labour market. This project addresses both challenges.\r\nThe project has three primary target groups. Within, the project, we will attempt to path the complex relationships among the different target groups that exist and can increase the awareness of young people and their motivation to become more proficient in different languages and more interculturally competent. The running of the project consists in three steps:\r\nThe first target group is business. The dialogue between education and business is vital if the supply of language skills from education systems is to be better matched to the needs of the labour market. The task of the businesses (our associated partner in this project) is to help define a profile for the multilingual workforce and create a demand for it. The second target group are career staff/consultants, policy makers, school leaders, university staff, and curricula writers. Associated partners from this group will help to provide and find a practical solution regarding the dual competence based on the demand from business. The third target group of the project are young people \u2013 both European citizens, and migrants and refugees. Teachers and parents have to be also included in the third and the last phase of the project. Ideally, the young people, participating in the project, should be motivated, they should welcome the solutions proposed in the previous two steps, and finally, try to implement the guidelines proposed here.\r\nThe project aims:\r\n- To change attitude toward language learning, more specifically to increase the awareness of value of multilingualism (foreign languages and mother tongue languages) as well as Intercultural Communicative Competences (ICC) as dual competences, \r\n- To increase awareness in careers/skills organisations and staff to be more knowledgeable about dual competences and languages/ICC skills relevance,\r\n- To elicit employers and businesses to recognise and demand Languages and ICC skills,\r\n- To equip the users better for the labour market through an increased level of languages and cultural knowledge and thus combat skills deficit that currently exits, \r\n- To develop, test and implement innovative approaches to motivate young people to choose more languages and be aware of intercultural similarities and differences.\r\nTo achieve these aims, the project\u2019s team will design and create a website, which will be updated as the project progresses, being one of the final products at the end of the project. To do this, short videos for the website presenting professionally successful people who combined their multilingual skills with another profession, will be created. Guidance for different audiences (i.e. language teachers, career staff, parents, etc.) will be also elaborated as well as examples of good practices and case-studies. The official start of the project will symbolically be on the 26th September \u2013 the European Day of Languages when Europe is celebrating the language and cultural diversity. The dissemination plan includes local events in every partner country as well as involvement at interdisciplinary events organised by the key-organisations (e.g. business conference, parent conference, career advisors) to promote project\u2019s development, get feedback and present ongoing results. We also plan school visits where we can meet young people.\r\nThe long-term impact of the project should be to initiate changes in the national curricula and to create integrated studies and new study programmes.

Austria has served as a role model in this sector of higher education and it should retain and even strengthen its position in this field. Our project is intended to contribute to this goal by enhancing the image of vocational colleges and, in the future, promoting the international mobility of their teaching staff.It is evident that the students taking part in this project are expected to get to know new working methods and test their competences in the world of work: that applies for foreign language skills as well as competences required in the hospitality industry or in event management.

This kind of richness creates, on the other hand, a major complexity in the management of both the group dynamics within the students and also in the transfer of knowledge for each and every school subjects. It is also equally true that each and every students, of each and every social or ethnic group have an averagely easy access to media on the whole, with particular reference to the social media such as Facebook, Twitter and so on. How they  use and, sometimes,  abuse the social media becomes part of the process in which they built their own identity, social image and it is, without any doubts, the major carrier of communication and relationships exchanges between them. All this are unquestionable facts that educators and school teachers have to acknowledge and accept, it is a realistic picture of the young people, and not only, and of the society nowadays. Therefore, given these premises, how can education use \u201cthe use of media\u201d  to improve its teaching methodology in the aim of fighting school disaffection, managing the students social dynamics (a better relationship and communication within the group it is proved to improve the students\u2019 learning and emotional skills) and also convey the curricula subjects at the same time?\r\n\r\nImages and new media play a vital role in education  and not considering it would make it impossible to keep up with the evolution of the concept of education itself. It is however necessary to ensure that the images and media become a means for conveying both disciplinary and cultural contents and explore a wider meaning of communication that is both verbal and not verbal. The sensitization to not verbal communication in school can help the students develop a better emotional education as, for example, body language is well known to be universal. Trainers and teachers should therefore find a new balance between the use of words (spoken and written) and images and between tradition and new technologies in a perspective of a more contemporary concept of education, in order to better and properly deal with the complexity of society today. A major focus on the education to the use of images, movies and media can become the base for the creation of a common language among teachers and  students coming from such different and complex  cultural, social, political, religious and, last but not least, linguistic backgrounds. The use of media as common language could help find common points and common languages, common meanings, common emotional reactions that can definitely create the base for a major sharing and understanding between them, it can slowly help to enhance the complexity and differences as a strength other than a weakness so to eventually point out the richness and potentiality of such a heterogeneous composition of the class, with a wider repercussion of their perception of society itself.   \r\n\r\nProject MOVIE intends therefore to create a Prototype Model of Training and related didactic materials for teachers, parents ans students, innovative, replicable and sustainable at European level, in order to provide them with such instruments that have to be cross curricula, that means teachers have to be addressed in improving both their technical and psychological skills.
