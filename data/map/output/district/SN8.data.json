Our client base includes private, public sector and significant numbers of non-governmental organizations.  \n\nDelAgua is researching an innovative, rapid, microbiological pathogen water test for field use in routine monitoring, surveillance and disaster relief situations. This test will identify bacterial species, their viability and numbers present in less than 2 hours.   \n\nUser feedback has indicated that the device must meet the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 Simple to use\n\u2022 Portable\n\u2022 Rugged\n\u2022 No need for mains power\n\u2022 Have an automated means of recording and analysing results\n\nCurrent test equipment offers a choice between rapid absence/ presence indicators with no quantification; or tests which offer quantification and specificity but with significant process time (from 18 hours to several days) for a result. There is real demand for this new rapid test which will have applications globally for the testing of drinking water and more widely irrigation, bathing and recreational waters, and water/wastewater treatment plants under private and public management.\n\nUnique features of our new test offer an opportunity to go beyond our current retail and distribution model. We wish to test radically innovative business models which could offer greater value and flexibility to both DelAgua and its customers. We believe a different model could open entirely new markets and impact on the health of millions of people worldwide through the provision of near real time regional water safety monitoring systems, something never before achieved.\n\nA European supply chain will be created to manufacture both the hardware and consumables and DelAgua will create R&D facilities and jobs to support the new test.\n\nIf successful this project will help drive Europe's growth and global competitiveness and reinforce Europe's contribution to global healthcare solutions.", 39178.0, 55969.0, 1, 1, "RapidBact", null, null, null, "h2020_199232_927740884"]]}}, "3HL": {"nhs": {"data": [["RN3", "Savernake Hospital", "nhs_RN313"]]}}, "3LD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1262304000000, 1356912000000, "Diagnosis, Error Modelling and Correction for Reliable Systems Design", "Transeda Systems Ltd", "Increasing design costs are the main challenge facing the semiconductor community. Assuring the correctness of the design contributes to the major part of the problem. However, while diagnosis and correction of errors are more time-consuming compared to error detection, they have received far less attention, both, in terms of research works and industrial tools introduced.Another, orthogonal threat to the development is the rapidly growing rate of soft-errors in the emerging nanometer technologies. According to roadmaps, soft-errors in sequential logic are becoming a more severe issue than in memories. However, the design community is not ready for this challenge because existing soft-error escape identification methods for sequential logic are inadequate.<br/>The DIAMOND project addresses the above-mentioned challenges. The aim of DIAMOND is improving the productivity and reliability of semiconductor and electronic system design in Europe by providing a systematic methodology and an integrated environment for the diagnosis and correction of errors. DIAMOND will develop:<br/>- A unified, holistic diagnostic model for design and soft errors;- Automated localisation and correction techniques based on the unified model, both pre-silicon and post-silicon;- Implementation of a reasoning framework for localisation and correction, encompassing word-level techniques, formal, semi-formal, and dynamic techniques;- Integration of automated correction with the diagnosis methods.DIAMOND reaches beyond the state-of-the-art by proposing an integrated approach to localisation and correction of specification, implementation, and soft errors.  In addition, it considers faults on all abstraction levels, from specification through implementation down to the silicon layout. Handling this full chain of levels allows DIAMOND take advantage of hierarchical diagnosis and correction capabilities incorporating a wide range of error sources.", 290315.0, 3275344.0, 6, 8, "DIAMOND", null, null, null, "fp7_93760_993058065"]]}}, "4LD": {"life": {"data": [[2000, "Salisbury Plain - Improving the management of Salisbury Plain Natura 2000 sites", "English Nature", 2827596.0, 1413798.0, "One of the largest unbroken expanses of chalk grassland in North-West Europe can be found at Salisbury Plain.
