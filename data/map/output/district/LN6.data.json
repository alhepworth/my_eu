The general aim will be that we secure better personal development and educational progress for all children. We will do this in cooperation and close association with primary schools but with a clear focus on schools for secondary education (12 until 18 years old students).\r\nIt\u2019s of great importance that we personalise also school improvement by engaging the staff in the process, through distributing leadership and responsibility and other stakeholders (including governors, parents and children and young people) as part of the learning community.\r\n\r\nThis project accelerates the development of Personalised Learning. The project can feed on the Dutch national project \u2018Leerling2020\u2019 where learning labs on personalised learning are installed. These learninglabs share knowledge on a regular basis and the website and digital platform form the foundation for the accelaration in this project. It also feeds on the experiences of the different partners from Finland, UK, Sweden and Poland. \r\nAmbitious target setting is critical if pupils are to achieve the educational outcome of which they are capable. Every partner will before the start of the project have set those targets with a clear relation to national learning goals. What we also need is rigorous and accurate teacher assessment alongside a variety of teacherprofiles. Where targets are appropriately challenging and teacher assessments are accurate, these become powerfull drives for improvement.\r\n\r\nWe will have 5 intellectual outputs:\r\n1. Framework Schoolprofile Personalised learning \u2013 the Swedish partner is responsible\r\n2. Description of \"teacherprofiles\" with the focus on personalised learning \u2013 the British partner is responsible\r\n3. Description of the learning environment for a succesful execution of personalised learning \u2013 the  Polish partner is responsible. Important part of this description will be the use of ICT!\r\n4. Curriculum teachertraining academy with the focus on personalised learning \u2013 the Finnish partner is responsible\r\n5. Guideline for implementation of personalised learning \u2013 the Dutch coordination partner is responsible for this output.\r\n\r\nCrucial to personalised learning is the knowledge that the teacher has of a particular pupil or group of pupils. Assessment tools are necessary when an intervention is considered f.i. when a pupil does not progress the way he or she or they should. \r\nPersonalised dissemination\r\nIn the European context every partner will have a different learning outcome. A different need for change in the local context. \r\nThe common goals and outputs we genereate will be dissiminated on local level in every country in a different way. Local learning communities will be formed. For instance with a innercircle and outercircle.\r\nGenerally all partners will be focussing on assessment on a day-to-day basis, on a periodic and longer term basis.\r\nThis results in:\r\n- Every child knows what they are doing and understands what they need to do to improve and how to get there. They get the support they need to be motivated, independent learners on an ambitious process of improvement.\r\n- Every teacher is equipped to make well-founded judgements about pupils\u2019 attainment, understands the concepts and principles of progression, and knows how to use their assessment judgements to forward plan, particularly for pupils who are not fulfilling their potential.\r\n- Every school has in place structured and systematic assessment systems for making regular, useful, manageble and accurate assessments of pupils, and for tracking their progress.\r\n- Every parent or carer knows how their child is doing, what they need to do to improve, and how they can support the child and their teachers.", "http://www.srpa.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA201-035227_6"], [2017, "Rytmy sukcesu - muzyka i ruch w rozwijaniu kompetencji kluczowych", "Sir Robert Pattinson Academy", 71479.0, 3, 3, "The Project \u201cRhythms of success \u2013 music movement to improve literacy and other key competences\u201d will be carried out within two years and will involve three countries (Poland, England, and Germany) and teenagers aged 11-18. Around 100 people, both visitors and the community of host school will take part in meetings. The effects of their work will be publicized locally and in media registered in the EST database and other educational portals. \r\nThe main aim of our project is to develop of key competences through music. Organizing attractive eurhythmics, music, singing and dance classes for pupils through implementation of pieces from the canon of fairy tale/film music and using these pieces to improve competences in different fields of knowledge. Improvement of communication skill by stimulating students\u2019 openness and self-confidence in a conversation. Practical use of Mathematics and the native language as school subjects through attractive methods and teaching aids. Encouraging students to make music and to study \r\nWithin the selected subjects \u2013 eurhythmics, native language, English as the language of communication and mathematics \u2013 the most important areas will be specified on which we shall work. As for eurhythmics, movement, dance and body coordination will be used. As regards the native language, work concerning the lexicon and text structure will be in focus. Mathematics will be used to systematize measurement units concept, location, direction, size, geometrical figures and special relations on a plane.\r\nWithin the framework of the project we have planned four short students meetings, one short training session for the Staff, one international Project meeting, workshops, training, demonstration lessons, thematic trips, reportages and regional legends. The project will involve using attractive teaching methods, which will enrich teaching resources with interesting and innovative lesson plans, which will enable achieving the curricula objectives in a manner attractive to students.\r\nDiscussions, workshops and trainings will serve the purpose of raising qualifications of the teachers involved in the project implementation. Common educational activities as well as music-movement games will enable integrating the participants and developing their communicative skills. The students involved in the project implementation will have the opportunity to gain thorough knowledge thanks to project\u2019s interdisciplinary character. Inter-subject correlation used in mathematics, native language, eurhythmics classes will make it possible for the students to develop comprehensively and improve their communicative skills as regard the English language.\r\nIn the course of the project we will be working on a fragment of a film/fairy tale performance. This will advertise and promote the international project in the region, it will encourage students to work on similar undertakings, enable sustaining international contacts, integrate both the students\u2019 community and the local one.\r\nThe final effect will include innovative teaching guide, lesson plans, multimedia chronicles, fragments of a film/fairy tale performance. The most sustainable effect of our work will be cyclic St Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas concerts as well as a fairy tale played by the staff to celebrate Children\u2019s Day, which will make use of the developed methods of dance, movement, acting, singing, recitation, playing on instruments, working on text structure and scenario, etc. Teacher\u2019s resources will be enriched with the innovative teaching guide, recording of series of tutorials and participation in international competitions.\r\nThe aim of our activities is also to overcome social and mental barriers between Europeans. It is worth noting that the ideas covered by the project are complementary with school curricula. One of the effects of the project will be gaining knowledge of European cultures and promoting the visited regions. Thanks to such actions we have a chance to educate citizens of Europe who are self-confident, open, communicative and who respect one another. Thus, personal and civic competences will rise.\r\nThe Project \u201cRhythms of success \u2013 music movement to improve literacy and other key competences\u201d will allow us to accomplish aims which are timeless in the process of education by improving competences concerning various areas of science, by international integration of school communities, by raising teaching staff competences and by providing school with a European dimension.", "http://www.srpa.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA201-038724_1"]]}}}}
