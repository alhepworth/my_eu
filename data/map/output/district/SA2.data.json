It is therefore a strong focus for piloting labeled establishments, particularly through contracts for progress and the resulting evaluation.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the mobility of learners in vocational schools increases the sense of belonging to Europe but also to the educational community, strengthens skills and improves employability, the Creteil educational authority wishes to encourage and support the Lyc\u00e9es des m\u00e9tiers already involved in a quality assurance approach, through the implementation of a group mobility project for the learners and which endeavors to integrate families from the preparation of mobilities to dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe PALOMA project was born from the desire of 11 lyc\u00e9es des m\u00e9tiers to organize a network. The latter is based on the pooling of resources at all levels. Since September 2015, all the lyc\u00e9es have participated in a joint work, which has become particularly collaborative since September 2016. All the tools and teaching tools were produced by the high school teams (sharing Resources, address books of European partners,  common approaches of pedagogical engineering, project engineering (selection, preparation, evaluation of students ...). Teachers from one institution will be able to visit / evaluate a student from another Lyc\u00e9e.

After authorization, both students will be filmed in their families, school / company before / during / after mobilityAll the pupils and accompanying persons will bring back the film material produced on their mobile phone as well.\r\nThe project foresees the mobility of 156 high school students in vocational baccalaureate trades in 16 certified pathways in 8 partner countries, in training centers and / or in companies for periods ranging from 3 to 5 weeks according to the schedules of the establishments in France and Europe and the degree of autonomy of the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for high school students are related to better employability, based not only on stronger professional skills but also on developing self-esteem and developing a sense of belonging to Europe (European citizenship), but also a feeling of belonging to its establishment and its sector.\r\nThe rise of intercultural and linguistic skills is obvious.\r\nIn the wake of PALOMA, we hope to encourage many of the 112 professional institutions of our academy in this European openness that is a necessity today.", "http://www.reivers-education.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036923_2"], [2018, "Level Playing Field", "Work Experience Wales", 46555.0, 3, 3, "The \"Level Playing Field\" project to strengthen employability and cultural competence for  11 students at full-time vocational schools on the part of the Euro-Berufsfachschule f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Fremdsprachen Bamberg - with special consideration of beneficiaries of disadvantaged families- is seamlessley embedded in the full-time vocational trainings offered by the school.

The ACARE Vision 2020 document set the ambitious goal of a 50% reduction in aircraft emissions that can only be achieved through a step change in aircraft technology. Adaptive structures and morphing aircraft are novel technologies that can provide this step change, and this proposal provides an efficient method to model, optimize and realize these structures. Morphing aircraft have the ability to alter the shape of their wings to improve fuel efficiency or to increase control effectiveness. The Wright brothers employed wing warping for roll control, but as aircraft speeds increased compliant structures were replaced with small, rigid control surfaces. Bird flight motivates the search for more efficient solutions, where a compliant structure is continuously optimized in flight using distributed sensors and actuators. From the structural perspective the objective is to produce fully integrated, hierarchical structures with compliance control. However the requirements are conflicting: the structure must be stiff to withstand the external loads, but must be flexible to enable shape changes. The solution to this conflict is to design the structure to decouple the two actions, through components with significant anisotropy and integrated actuation. The components may be modelled at the micro scale, but these models are too large for system optimization studies.

One molecular property that is essential for molecule surface interactions, but also particularly difficult to control and resolve, is the orientation & alignment of the rotational axis of the molecule i.e. the quantum rotation projection states. The existing paradigm is that control over this molecular property can be obtained either by photo-excitation schemes and/or by deflecting experiments using strong electric or magnetic fields. Using these approaches valuable insight was obtained, and the crucial role the rotation projection states have on the outcome of molecule-surface collision was demonstrated. However, the two approaches mentioned above can only be applied to a very small sub-group of systems, (typically on excited/paramagnetic species). Here, we propose a completely different approach which utilizes the rotational magnetic moment, which is a general molecular property, to control and resolve the projection rotation states of ground-state molecules. Our matter-wave approach involves passing a molecular beam through a specific series of magnetic fields, where the different wave components interfere and produce Rabi-oscillations characteristic of the molecular wave function before and after scattering. We present proof-of-principle results demonstrating the validity of our general approach, and describe the novel molecular interference and molecular spin echo measurements we will perform to obtain the much-awaited experimental benchmarks in this field.", 1941198.0, 1941198.0, 1, 1, "Rotational Waves", null, "http://www.swan.ac.uk", null, "h2020_214696_999862033"], [1491004800000, 1648684800000, "The true costs of bird flight: From the laboratory to the field", "Swansea University", "Flight is thought to be one of the most energetically costly of bird activities. These costs matter by virtue of their magnitude, as factors affecting flight costs can have a disproportionate impact on the overall energy balance. Flight costs are fundamentally linked to airflows, as well as behavioural responses to them, because birds react to horizontal and vertical currents by changing flight mode (i.e. flapping/ gliding), speed and route. Even minor route adjustments can radically affect the flow conditions that birds experience due to the uniquely dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the aerial environment. Yet our understanding of how airflows impact birds is in its infancy, being constrained by a lack of information on the metabolic costs of flight. Currently, the main methods for measuring flight costs in the laboratory either restrain the bird (thereby increasing energy expenditure) or suffer from low resolution, and field methods do not allow costs to be resolved in relation to fine scale movement paths. FLIGHT will use interdisciplinary approaches, integrating laboratory and field techniques, to address these grand challenges. Breakthrough methodologies will be used to (1) measure the costs of unrestrained bird flight in the laboratory and (2) derive a new proxy for power use in flight that is linked to flight performance, using accelerometry measurements from cutting-edge data loggers. Loggers will then be (3) deployed on wild birds to quantify their responses to airflows and the energetic consequences over fine scales. This will provide completely novel, mechanistic insight into the way the physical environment impacts flight costs, and (4) enable variation in flight\u2013related energy expenditure to be modelled geographically and seasonally in model species.

The visible RGB fibre laser will produce the first high-brilliance source for laser projection displays (15 mill.\u20ac p.a.). New future-oriented manufacturing tools based on higher-power pulsed fibre lasers (80 mill.\u20ac p.a.). The high-reliability laser for large-scale manufacturing with High Speed Laser Remote Processing - means a new level of performance for 2kWatt materials-processing lasers with raised MTBF to 50.000 hours (accessible market 1 bill.\u20ac p.a.). The Horizontal integration and networking in Europe\u2019s high brilliance laser industry in this project will enable a greater market share for existing applications, create new areas of exploitation for manufacturing, and build a European network of component suppliers, laser manufacturers, universities and research institutes. As a result, LIFT will cause the following results to emerge: 1. Europe would take advantage of novel laser sources to be employed for various processing applications, many of which cannot even be treated by today\u2019s lasers. 2. European companies will benefit by the exploitation of the knowledge by the LIFT consortium in the field of fibre lasers, thus creating new markets and improving productivity in existing ones, thus building the competitiveness and the technological role of Europe; 3.

The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary.

The MAiSI will support students in developing a sophisticated ethical mind-set and a range of transferable skills that are indispensable for addressing the ethical and integrity issues facing national and international sporting federations, national Olympic and Paralympic Committees The MAiSI graduates will benefit from extensive international collaboration and training opportunities, preparing them for decisively taking moral responsibility from the inside and the outside of the sports world. Horizontal/Sectorial PrioritiesThe MAiSI promotes the development of  (i) transversal skills: the identification and critical engagement in ethical dialogue; the capacity to translate decisions into ethical actions and policies; and (ii) partnerships with sport stakeholders to enhance good governance.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_574393-EPP-1-2016-1-UK-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_coordinator"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 499774.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047063_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 448033.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035560_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 314363.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000103_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 306169.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023373_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 275154.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012658_coordinator"], [2016, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 271610.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The EU also states that students pay the price: \u201cfinancial burden is increasingly being shifted to students\u201d; hence the immediate need to address financing of HE for students: \u201csubsequent social challenges need to be offset\u201d (Modernisation of HE in EU).\r\nFinancial inclusion of HE students to fund their education is hence an utmost priority for EU: such priority is recognised by Erasmus+ Horizontal Priority 6, p 121 of Programme Guide: \u201cSustainable investment, performance and efficiency in education\u201d. SHIFT will develop a model able to attract private actors and capital. In addition, SHIFT is a \u201cpriority topic\u201d as it is an innovative approach to increase efficiency of public expenditure and investment in education, including new funding models such as public-private partnerships.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, SHIFT has the objective of alleviating the financial burden of access to and participation in HE of students while increasing the efficiency of public spending in HE by developing an innovative model of virtuous Public Private Partnership based on a financial instrument and model (mix of endowment fund and investment fund) that will generate increased financial resources to be distributed as grants, matching grants and soft loans for HE students. SHIFT is a new funding model that pools financial resources from both the public and private sectors, serving the dual purpose of\r\n1. increasing efficiency of public expenditure: SHIFT enhances sustainability of public resources by generating additional funding opportunities for scholarships of university students. The public funds allocated into the SHIFT model (the endowment fund) will be invested (through the investment fund) and only the profits generated will be disbursed (through grants and soft loans) to students, hence keeping intact the capital (here the sustainability of the public funds)\r\n2. mobilising private resources: SHIFT establishes a virtuous mechanism of public and private partnership. Not only SHIFT pools funds from public and private sectors, but also will consolidate public and private attitudes towards facilitating access to finance for HE students. \r\n\r\nSHIFT brings together 7 partners from 5 countries representing HE system, students association and NGOs, private sector. Such diversity adds value to the partnership that has the complementary skills, experience and expertise to carry out the following activities:\r\n1. Map Financing Dynamics of HE\r\n2. Develop the SHIFT Innovative Financial Model\r\n3. Test and Validate through Stress Testing the innovative financial model\r\n4. Develop the SHIFT Implementation Package for its adoption in HEIs\r\n\r\nThe methodology is technical (i.e. financial engineering) and operational (i.e. governance structure) and is based on the sequenced approach of\r\nMapping -->Development --> Validation/Stress Testing --> Implementation\r\n\r\nSHIFT main results are:\r\na) innovative financial model, developed, tested and validated through financial stress testing: partners will develop and validate the model and will outline the structure of the financial instrument (size; investment horizon; asset class; risk profile; etc) and the governance mechanism (composition of the governance structure; representation of public, private and social sectors; division of responsibilities between financial management and operations; etc)\r\nb) the implementation package to apply and deploy the innovative model: SHIFT will produce an implementation package detailing the technical, operational and administrative aspects of how to implement the SHIFT model and formalize the involvement of public and private participants (i.e. Memorandum of Understanding, Terms of Reference for fund managers, etc)\r\n\r\nSHIFT will produce tangible impact at systemic level for the HE system across EU: the innovative financial model will bring about threefold impact:\r\n1. increased financial resources to enhance HE access and participation\r\n2. improved sustainability of public resources for HE\r\n3. innovative PPP mechanism\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, SHIFT \u201csupport HEIs to implement necessary reforms in line with the 2011 EU Modernisation Agenda and its priority areas\u201d. The whole EU Modernization Agenda pivots around the 2 crucial aspects of governance and funding of HE: SHIFT tackles both governance (it introduces an innovative mechanism for the management and governance of HEIs) and funding (it established an innovative model for financial measures in favor of HE students).", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "ASTON UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036510_4"], [2016, "Communication competences for migrants and disadvantaged background learners in bilingual work environments", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 259889.0, 5, 7, "In bilingual or multilingual countries where several languages coexist, it is usual to use (one of) the local language in some labor sectors. In such cases, people who do not speak the local language can encounter a barrier to enter the labor market: they either remain outside the  regulated labor market, or, even though they are integrated into the labor market, they have difficulty to maintain a long term and sustainable career. This is especially true for the healthcare sector. Immigrants are a case in point. Due to the fact that their priority is usually exclusively learning the main language spoken in the state rather than the local language of a region. To highlight the importance of being able to use the regonal language in a healthcare setting and especially elderly care: By 2025, more than 20% of Europeans will be 65 or over, with a particularly rapid increase in numbers of over-80s (http://ec.europa.eu/health/ageing/policy/index_en.htm). Hence, the number of bilingual elderly people with cognitive disabilities will increase dramatically as well. An extra complexity in this matter is the role of the use of dialects or minority languages with clients in healthcare settings for their well being during treatment. Language is of vital importance for an individual\u2019s well being as well as ensuring trust in healthcare settings. This plays a vital role in power dynamics between clients and staff such as nurses. A minority language or dialect also shares a stronger \u2018emotional attachment\u2019 (Dewaele 2004; Heinz 2011).      (II) Rationale of the Project and Innovative CharacterIn the last decade, there has been a wide range of experiences in language training at the workplace. However, they mainly focus on the major European languages (English, French, Spanish, German) and do not take into account the specific language needs of some European regions and working environments with a strong presence of a regional/minority language. Even with increasing multilingual societies, language training is mostly standardized and homogeneous and does not take into account the role that each of these languages plays in society or even in the workplace. Workplace communication needs are very often not teachable and neither measurable by standard language reference guidelines, but have to be planned and evaluated in relation to determined working fields. The project would therefore combine both communication and psychological skills, which is unique to the focus of previous European projects.The rationale of this project is hence to develop innovative methods, focused on acquiring communication competences in the (local) languages required in a multilingual workplace.(III) Project DescriptionOverall objective:  To offer a versatile training material toolkit for its use in the language teaching area of any regional language of Europe.Project Objectives\u2022Improving the language skills of people currently applying for work or working part-time in the  elderly care and health care sector and where knowledge of the local language is of high importance and improving the quality of work\u2022To train trainers to be able to teach regional languages to migrants disadvantaged learners focusing in the communication needs at their workplaces \u2022To train trainers to be able to teach communication skills for a bilingual work environments (e.g. continuous switching of the language, oral communication and written communication in different languages)\u2022Improve the wellbeing of clients in healthcare settings\u2022Taking steps towards integration: addresses the multilingual needs of immigrants in diverse communities as well as the multi-sited nature of integration.\u2022Increasing opportunities of migrant workers due to the improvement of their professional communication skills.Main Target Group\u2022language teachers (teachers in public and concerted schools for adults)\u2022adult education trainers\u2022language and vocational training teachers\u2022stakeholders in the field of adult vocational training and support for disadvantaged learning).(IV) Expected Results1. To develop language competence skills and improved levels of skills for employability, increasing opportunities for professional development.2. To design a communicative competence acquiring methodology for the health care/elderly care sector.3.

The OPTIMALE online survey of language industry employers\u2019 competence requirements showed that awareness of and the ability to implement professional procedures throughout the translation process are key factors in the employability of university translation graduates. This led to the definition of good practice in specific areas of translator training, in particular in the integration of professionally-oriented practices in the curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OTCT project (Optimising Translator Training through Collaborative Technical Translation) aims to enhance the professionally-oriented content of university translation degree programmes via intensive collaborative technical translation sessions in simulated professional conditions (referred to as \u201cTradutech sessions\u201d), and by exchanging good practice and resources on the implementation of project-based teaching and learning in the field of translator training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will involve students and staff in advanced translation degree programmes from seven academic institutions (Rennes 2 University, France; HE Vinci, Brussels, Belgium; Swansea University, UK; Univerzita Karlova V Praze, Prague, Czech Republic; Universitatea Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, Romania; Universita ta Malta, Malta; Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Sevilla, Spain). It will primarily involve 1st and/or 2nd year Master\u2019s degree students (i.e. 20-80 students in each institution) but may also involve students in the final year of Bachelor\u2019s degree programmes where relevant (i.e. Sevilla). Two to three members of the teaching staff from each institution will be directly involved, but a larger number will benefit from the outcomes of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will center on the \u201cTradutech\u201d intensive sessions, with preparatory activities leading up to the sessions and material from the sessions feeding into further resources for use in the classroom. \r\n\r\nFour \u201cTradutech\u201d sessions will take place during the project. Each five-day session will involve students setting up simulated translation companies (i.e. teams of 5-10 students, with specific responsibilities and roles assigned to each team member), who will then carry out large-scale multilingual technical translation projects according to the specifications and deadlines set by their \u201cclients\u201d. Source documents will be authentic technical manuals, reports or multimedia materials which will be translated into the main target language(s) of the partner institutions. The source documents will be in English or French as the case may be. Projects will be managed in turn by students from each partner institution, using collaborative software to exchange resource materials and files and computer-assisted translation software to carry out the translations. \r\n\r\nPrior to the Tradutech sessions, students will receive training in technical translation, project management, quality control and translation technologies, using resources produced by different partner institutions and shared with the other partners within the project. Participants will be briefed on the conditions and implementation of the Tradutech sessions, using tutorials produced by students from Rennes and Cluj with prior experience of such sessions. A joint terminology project will involve students from all the partner institutions, in order to promote cooperation and familiarize them with the use of the collaborative platform set up for the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput from the student \u201ctranslation companies\u201d will be assessed according to professional criteria by language industry professionals and feedback will be provided to the students and used as learning materials in classes following the Tradutech sessions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll students who have completed a Tradutech session (i.e. have successfully carried out the responsibilities and tasks allocated to them within one or several translation projects) and the preparatory work prior to the session, will be awarded 4 ECTS credits as part of their study programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of Rennes Tradutech sessions will be attended by teaching staff from the other partner institutions, who will take part in a parallel training of trainer session. Two other sessions will be attended by students from the other institutions, who will be integrated as full members of the Rennes teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSustainability will be ensured by teaching and learning resource production and dissemination, the training of trainer sessions, and the production of a Handbook on the implementation of project-based translator training which will be made freely available to other institutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipating students will benefit from the hands-on experience and professional feedback, while teaching staff will gain experience of project-based collaborative learning methodologies.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA203-008533_2"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 97828.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Unfortunately, although the importance of parents in sport is well known, support, and education for parents remains scarce. If parents provide children with incorrect information, inappropriate support, or insufficient guidance it can have extremely detrimental effects on their physical and psychological health. For example, inappropriate parental support has been associated with reduced levels of self-esteem, increased levels of anxiety and stress, as well as excessive physical training and injury. Thus, ensuring parents are well educated and informed about how best to support and guide their children in sport is critical to minimizing physical and psychology health risks. Recognising the need to better educate and support parents of young athletes, this project seeks to unite academics, organisations, and practitioners from across Europe who work in the field of youth sport, and have particular expertise in working with, supporting, or educating the parents of young athletes. By uniting these experts, this project will provide a platform from which we can share knowledge, identify best practice, and subsequently improve parent education to increase the positive influence of parents in sport and minimise health risks to athletes. The project will proceed in three stages: First, collaborative partners will meet to discuss issues regarding parental involvement in sport and key areas in which parents require further or better education.

These academics are working together with industry to develop a circular economy solution to create wealth from waste.\n\u00a0\nWhy is the project necessary?\nThere is an urgent need to develop sustainable food and farming. \u00a0\nNorth West Europe is a densely populated and intensely agricultural area. It thus contributes disproportionately to food and farm waste produced in the EU each year.\nIncreasing amounts of food and farm waste are processed using anaerobic digestion (AD). AD converts waste to biogas used for energy and a liquid nutrient rich digestate, most of which is returned to land as a biofertiliser.\nHowever, there are strict limits on the amount of digestate which is allowed to be put back on agricultural \u00a0land. Strict limits are imposed with EU legislation and so-called Nitrate Vulnerable Zones.\u00a0This is increasingly creating excess unwanted nutrients.\u00a0\nThe ability to use these excess nutrients to produce new products presents a circular economy solution.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow can ALG-AD help?\nALG-AD combines algal and AD technology.\u00a0 Microalgae, mainly photosynthetic microorganisms will be cultivated, converting the unwanted nutrients into biomass. The cultivated algal biomass is rich in protein and other useful compounds, and can be used to generate sustainable animal feed products and other useful bio-products.\n\u00a0\nWhat will ALG-AD be doing?\nALG-AD is building three pilot facilities at 3 distinct \u2018real life conditions locations in North West Europe: Devon, Ghent and Brittany. \u00a0Each facility will use local conditions to grow the algae and record results.

There is constant pressure on management and staff for educational change, higher quality and better retention while financial resources are scarce. It is not easy for a topic like internationalisation to be present and heard in this tense environment. Still it can offer welcome opportunities for students and staff and a break from the relentless requirements for reporting and testing. \r\nInternationalisation has also received a welcome boost from the introduction of the excellence programme in 2015. At ROC MN about 40% of the excellence programmes for students is international and placements of students both in Europe and outside of Europe are now seen as being programmes for excellent students. This has led to a more coherent approach of opportunities for excellent students called UP 9more information on www.rocmn.nl/up.\r\n\r\nOverall development\r\nNumbers of students and staff taking part in international programmes is increasing at ROC MN. There is substantial pressure from students and staff on available funds and available places abroad. The Erasmus Plus grant has been matched in recent years by funds made available from the excellence programme and professionalisation. Students are doing placements in countries such as China, New Zealand and Malawi. Students are also going on shorter challenges as part of their personal development to countries outside of Europe such as Japan and Argentina. These additional opportunities have provided a boost to the visibility of internationalisation in the roc and to a recognition of their importance of international links. \r\nThe focus of the international office and the international coordinator has therefore shifted to quality improvement instead of more students or staff going abroad. \r\n\r\nThe shift towards higher quality can be observed as well in a number of different initiatives:\r\nMore regular and higher quality meetings of the international team: The team of the international office and international coordinators meet every month under the chairmanship of a college director, following a pcda quality process. There is an annual agenda with regular evaluation sessions and feedback. Developments and processes are brought to a higher level and standardised by the group. \r\nProfessionalisation of the international coordinators: The team of coordinators is being trained by NUFFIC to achieve a higher impact in their respective colleges; to become more involvement in strategic processes there and to be seen as the expert in this field to be consulted on policy matters.\r\nDevelopment of the Virtual International Office: the central organisation has invested heavily in the development of VIO, an online tool for students going abroad. This tool is aimed at making the whole process of going abroad (with or without an E+ grant) more transparent and easy for the student. However not only that, it is also aimed at creating a higher quality experience with the involvement of other members of staff (such as the stage begeleider) and a bigger emphases on the learning experience through a better learning agreement, a progress section and a letter of reference. It has also freed up valuable time of the coordinators to focus students and staff instead of on forms and bureaucracy. Other rocs have expressed an interest in implementing this tool as well.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of \u201cKeuzedelen\u201d: several colleges within the roc are now developing \u201ckeuzedeel II: Naar het Buitenland\u201d. This will open up a new avenue for students to give their international experience more quality and a better, more coherent, place in their portfolio. \r\n\r\nSetting up partnerships and networks: an important element in the quality drive is also to better integrate international activities with the world of work and with the partner abroad. On 21 April the NAVE2 network will officially start with the signing ceremony of the presidents of 4 large schools / associations in Italy. This partnership with institutions from Spain, Italy, Finland and the Netherlands) will increase mobility between the partners and improve quality of arrangements. At the same time a network of international (export oriented) companies in the region is set up, to look at staffing issues and to increase offers of internationalisation at home.\r\n\r\nIn general it can be said that very important steps are being taken to develop internationalisation to a high quality important element of the strategy of ROC MN.

The project hopes to broaden the horizons of our students and help them gain self-confidence and self-reliance whilst completing units of their course in an innovative way.   Students from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) curriculum areas have been chosen as they are priority areas for the Welsh Government and the European Union and are curriculum areas which offer employment opportunities across Europe.   We are also looking to develop these opportunities into the Sport curriculum as Wales has a sports sector that embraces collaboration and encourages new ways of delivering opportunities to increase participation and improve elite performance and this project supports this ethos.

The EUX curriculum also focusses on developing and strengthening the students\u2019 international competences.\r\n\r\nThe overall purpose is to strengthen the international dimension of the EUX education at KNORD and thereby motivate the students to become more international and see the possibilities for potential apprenticeships and jobs around the world.\r\n\r\nThe mobility exchanges focus on the oral competences and also to strengthen the students\u2019 English competences. English is a topic the students must take at the EUX education and at a very high level. During the mobility exchange stays, the students will improve their intercultural competences and get vocational experience from another country.\r\n\r\nThe focus on internationalization will contribute to preparing the students for a job and they will become more able to compete when they apply for apprenticeships in a time where apprenticeships are few. The project will add a European dimension to EUX at Knord.\r\n\r\nEnglish teachers at both EUX and HHX at Knord wish to train their linguistic competences by taking courses at Gover College in Wales.

The project hopes to broaden the horizons of our students and help them gain self-confidence and self-reliance whilst completing units of their course in an innovative way.  Wales has a Sports Sector that embraces collaboration and encourages new ways of delivering opportunities to increase participation and improve elite performance and this project supports this ethos with our partners Sport Lisboa e Benfica (SLB) in Portugal. The objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To provide students with an enhanced learning experience allowing them to gain knowledge and skills to help them achieve their qualification and improve their employability.\r\n\u2022 To enhance the existing Vocational programme by providing an innovative opportunity for participants to experience a different culture and way of learning and working. \r\n\u2022 To enable participants to experience an exciting and different pedagogical approach to learning and work experience, providing them with the relevant skills and knowledge sought by employers.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will return from their placement having gained valuable knowledge and skills to enable them to achieve their qualification and a wealth of experience to help them progress into either further education or employment. This project will provide opportunities for 80 full-time (male and female) students aged 16+.\r\n\r\nActivities and methodology:\r\nDuring their placement participants will experience a number of different teaching styles which differ from those used within the UK.  Participants will enhance their skills and gain valuable knowledge towards their professional and personal development.   The participants are aged 16-19 and their learning needs will be based on their CV and the learning plan has been developed based on the skills and learning needs of their course as well as the individual learning needs of each participant.  Work experience in a foreign country will present the participants with a number of challenges and barriers to overcome, which will help stretch the individual students. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe accompanying staff will work with host staff to assess and record the skills and learning competencies demonstrated by each participant.  These will include competencies in essential employability skills such as appropriate behavior, attitude, team working, communication and initiative as well as subject-specific skills.  We expect students to achieve academically whilst gaining confidence, independent decision making, self-reliance and motivation.  All students will have their experience validated via college certificates and a mobility certificate.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nBased on previous experiences we expect these activities to have a really positive impact on the participating students' attitude, coursework and behavior having gained real experience and an understanding of teaching practices in another European country.  Being exposed to different practical tasks and techniques will be of real value to future employees and will enhance their coursework.   As an added value students will also have gained a wider understanding of the European economy.\r\n\r\nLonger-term benefits:\r\nThis project will have long term benefits for the participating students by gaining this type of experience and being exposed to some of the soft skills that will have been developed by traveling, studying and working in a foreign place will have a really positive impact on the participants.  Their aspirations and desires will change and that their self belief to achieve more will be enhanced.  Again these thoughts are based on seeing the changes in previous participating students.  \r\n\r\nThe impact on the college: \r\nThe improvement in the pass rates and grades on courses where students participated in mobilities and a recognition across the curriculum spectrum of the benefits both to individual students and the departments.  There has also been an increase in demand for such opportunities throughout the College for students to participate in future projects.  This has been achieved through disseminating project results via the use of ambassadors, College website, the Colleges Wales newsletter and Europemobility network.  This work will continue to build a greater interest in the wider Erasmus+ programme in Wales through our partners at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe industry in which these participants will be entering are highly competitive and the college is looking to give them every possible opportunity to gain an advantage to achieve and succeed.

This helped them gain the self-confidence and self-reliance to motivate them to broaden their horizons and to encourage them to look outside their immediate locality when it comes to employment.  Students from STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) curriculum areas were chosen as they are priority areas for the Welsh Government and the European Union and are curriculum areas which offer employment opportunities across Europe. \r\nObjectives?\r\n- to complete a work placement which will directly relate to their course and form part of their final qualifications\r\n- to provide students, who are also studying for the Welsh Baccalaureate alongside their vocational course, to have an invaluable opportunity to additionally complete the Wales, Europe and the World, Work Related Education and Languages elements of this qualification\r\n- to enhance student understanding of their vocational sector in a European context\r\n- to provide students with an opportunity of learning and working overseas\r\n- to consider employment opportunities in the wider context of Europe\r\n- to enhance students professional and entrepreneurial skills, evidenced through daily logs and evidence portfolios\r\n- to promote the mobilities to future students in the marketing of these courses to encourage greater participation\r\n- to increase self-reliance and motivation to look beyond their local environment for future training and employment\r\n- to gain skills and knowledge that cannot be gained within their local area.\r\nParticipant Profile\r\n56 full-time students aged 16 - 18 undertook vocational training, including a short period of work experience in either Netherlands, Germany or Denmark in 6 groups of 12 students each. The participants all studied Level 3 courses leading to qualification in either IT, Automotive, Engineering or Electronics. Each mobility took place at different times during the project at times to best suit both the sending and receiving organisations.\r\nActivities and methodology\r\nEach mobility flow followed a similar pattern where participants will spent the first week full-time in the host organisation joining in classes and practical workshops with students in the host organisation. The second and third weeks were spent four days on work experience in organisations and companies in the locality of the host college and one day on vocational training in the receiving college. Classes and placements were selected to meet the individual skills and learning needs of each participant based on their CVs and detailed action plans. The action plans were developed based on the skills and learning needs of specific units of each vocational course as well as the individual learning needs of each participant.\r\nResults\r\nThe accompanying staff and receiving subject staff, along with workplace supervisors, assessed and recorded the skills and learning competencies demonstrated by each participant. These included competencies in essential employability skills such as appropriate behaviour, attitude, team working, communication and initiative as well as subject-specific skills. We expected students to successfully complete new tasks that will count towards the achievement of their course units as well as gaining in confidence, independent decision making, self-reliance and motivation.\r\nImpact\r\nOn returning to the UK the expected short term impact will be on the students' attitude, coursework and behaviour, all of which are expected to be an improvement on, or of higher standard than, prior to the mobility. \r\nParticipants will have the added value of having gained real experience and an understanding of teachin practices in another European country and a knowledge of different practical tasks and techniques that can enhance their coursework as well as being of value to future employers. They have also gained a wider understanding of the European economy and an enriched cultural awareness of the wider Europe. \r\nLonger-term benefits\r\nIn the longer term they will have higher career expectations. More students will look to higher education to further their skills and will have the confidence to look for work across the wider Europe. \r\nThe impact on the college: It has seen an improvement in the pass rates and grades on courses where students participated in mobilities and a recognition across the curriculum spectrum of the benefits both to individual students and the department as a whole of a European experience, leading to increased demand from curriculum teams for their students to participate in future projects.

Students are at the start of their career and while studying for a vocation need to plan ahead as a worker and citizen of the future. For a number of students an international experience is part of this equasion as it offers them new opportunities to acquire skills such as:\r\n- personal skills (independence, flexibility, problem-solving)\r\n- intercultural skills\r\n- language skills.\r\nROCMN promotes these international activities and supports students who would like to participate. Promotion is organised in several different manners of which the most important are: presentations to students by the coordinators, special page per college on e-learning system, Facebook and special attention to international opportunities at open days. Furthermore it is a regular topic during mentoring as part of career development. \r\nMost students go on a long-term placement (12 weeks or more) on an individual bases in the period that is set by the vocational department.

Each student receives personal attention by the coordinator who will discuss the students needs and requirements extensively with the partner institution. These are complementary to the standard requirements of the qualification that have to be met as with any other placement in the Netherlands such as  accreditation of the host company and an agreement (POK). The student uses an online step by step approach to prepare for the placement and to fulfil all the requirements of the ERASMUS+ programme. There is also a preparatory programme on Blackboard with helps the students to be better prepared for the circumstances in a different country and in a different company.\r\nDuring the placement the student is supported by the placement coordinator (through telephone, e-mail and Skype) and by the partner institution. This network of experienced support around students is working very well and much is due to the long standing relations ROC Midden Nederland has with the partners of this project. Of course ROC Midden Nederland also provides these services to students of partner institutions. \r\nAfter their return students have to provide documentation to proof that they have met requirements of the qualification as well as the requirements of European funding.\r\nFor teachers the system is also very flexible in time and place.

In times of globalization, UNO and European Union, long-term benefits of such a project cannot be underestimated as the students will have a lot of professional and private foreign contacts in the future. All of the above mentioned aspects are reasons why we would be more than delighted if we received the opportunity to take part in this European project.", "http://www.gowercollegeswansea.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002797_1"], [2017, "SUD GIRONDE et SOUTH WALES: Quand les SUD se rencontrent!", "GOWER COLLEGE SWANSEA", 8201.0, 2, 2, "Sud Gironde College is located in Langon which is a rural area near Bordeaux, with small sized companies in crafts, forestry and wine sectors. There are 380 pupils, 93 are boarders.\r\nFor the first time, we have the opportunity to offer them an open professional, cultural and linguistic environment while they find it hard to leave their region.\r\nTen motivated volunteers who will be studying Industrial Maintenance will be able to open their awareness to new technical and professional practices, to adapt to different lifestyles and to get a wider vision of the world. We want them to get more self-confidence and to consider their future with more opportunities and more choices.\r\nThe strength of our project is based on the reciprocity and the eagerness to learn from one another: April-May2017, we intend to meet our Welsh partners (self-funded visit) to organise our stau and to prepare their visit. Over two years, 13 Welsh and 10 French students would undertake a two-week internship in the partner\u2019s country.\r\nOur pupils\u2019  families will be involved in the different steps of the project from its preparation to its assessment.\r\nAn ongoing and efficient communication will be established between the two coaching teams in order to insure a caring monitoring to the participants. Moreover, English courses will be given to our staff members to enable them to communicate with the Welsh team in France and in Wales.\r\nIn the long run we intend to build a lasting relationship between our two colleges and to encourage new applications in all the technical fields taught in our schools as we teach the same professional sectors.", "http://www.gowercollegeswansea.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036389_1"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1441065600000, 1551312000000, "Skills for Industry 2 SO 2", "Gower College Swansea", "Work-based learning opportunities to increase vocational skills and qualifications in the workforce to meet the needs of employers and drive productivity in companies", "ESF", 6202474.0, 8860677.0, "esf_wales_80832"], [1441065600000, 1551312000000, "Skills for Industry 2 SO1", "Gower College Swansea", "Work-based learning opportunities to increase vocational skills and qualifications in the workforce to meet the needs of employers and drive productivity in companies.", "ESF", 5582598.0, 7975140.0, "esf_wales_80831"]]}}}}
