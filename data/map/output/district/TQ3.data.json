The focus will be put on participants\u2019 placements in Finnish nursery schools (for the students of our Adult College, GRUPPE 1) and English nursery schools (for the students of our Higher Vocational School, GRUPPE 2). The positive feedback we have received so far from the Austrian National Agency for Lifelong Learning motivated us to apply for a project again. We have been trying to react to the suggestions the agency has made to improve our project.\r\n\r\nProject goals:\r\nWe want the beneficiaries to gain insight into institutions of early childhood education in the EU member states Finland and the United Kingdom in order to get to know ways of developing quality focusing on qualities of structure, orientation and processes in elementary education on a European level. They should be able to compare their findings to their experience in Austrian placements and thus to improve aspects of quality, which will also further and improve their own professional competence. The participants should get to know European diversity by this co-operation and exchange on a European level. Overall, the EU-funded project shall be part of the European transfer of knowledge and an exchange of information across borders.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nThe 4 beneficiaries of the Adult College and the 41 beneficiaries of the Higher Vocational School are training to become nursery teachers, focusing on subjects like Didactics and Nursery School Education. The Higher Vocational School also trains teachers-to-be in after-school care. In the year of the intended mobility (2019) the participants of the Adult College will be of full age and be in-between the second and third semester of their studies. The participants of the Higher Vocational School will attend third grade and will be aged around 17 years old. In the first two grades, they spend two hours a week in placements and from third grade onwards, they spend a day a week in placements including two week-long additional placements. The beneficiaries of the Adult College do three one-week practicals, in total equivalent to a weekly 5-hour placement.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe beneficiaries' activities comprise a minimum of 30 hours per week in placements for students of the Adult College and a minimum of 20 hours per week in placements for students of the Higher Vocational School over a course of two weeks (in total a minimum of 60 and 4o hours, respectively). The students of the Higher Vocational School also take a language course focusing on nursery-relevant language. In their placements, the participants will offer learning opportunities to children in various competencies (literacy, music, games, creativity, movement) and will practice supporting the daily routine in nursery schools. With the help of tasks that are carried out during the preparation for their placements in Finland and England, the beneficiaries will do the tasks as defined in the goals and will reflect upon their results in the post-learning phase.\r\n\r\nCarrying out the project:\r\nDue to past EU mobility projects, the staff at Sacr\u00e9 Coeur has acquired know-how on carrying out such projects. In a well-tried system, the participants will be prepared by their teachers in inter-disciplinary lessons. In England, carrying out the project is supported by our long-time partner. In Finland, we will rely on our new partner, who has  experience in supporting exchange students, as a graduate of the Adult College worked there in her placement and did research for her diploma thesis.\r\n\r\n(Long-term) Effects:\r\nThe beneficiaries get to know quality criteria in elementary education and reflect upon these. This has a long-term positive effect on their professional development. Observing qualities of structure, orientation and processes entails core elements such as qualification and pedagogical concepts of staff, health and safety of children, etc. (see above). In the project, the beneficiaries get to know ways to develop and maintain quality in their field of work leading to great improvement in their professional development.
