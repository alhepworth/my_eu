The aim of the project is to increase the awareness and engagement of the pupils of the world beyond that of their own experience focusing on the language and culture of France. French is a widely spoken language and the school believes that it is beneficial for the pupils to gain skills in language acquisition for lifelong learning.The objectives of the training are:\r\n1. to up skill, further motivate and empower teaching staff to deliver French with enthusiasm, skill and accuracy using a wide and creative variety of teaching methods including ICT and for the staff to be aware of the expectations of the new national curriculum in relation to the  teaching of MFL\r\n2. To develop and use a realistic and comprehensive policy for the teaching and learning of MFL within the school\r\n3. To develop a workable and systematic progressive scheme of work for French which builds on the skills of language acquisition throughout the school, with a love of language learning being put into place in Key Stage One, so that the foundations are there to be developed in Key Stage Two.\r\n4. To develop and sustain a link with a French primary school through the e-twinning project which will develop a European awareness and interest in the world outside of the local area of the school.\r\n5. To create a variety of authentic and motivating resources which can be used to enhance the teaching of French. \r\n6.To share and disseminate the learning gained from the training opportunity with other schools in the local cluster group in order to provide CDP opportunities.\r\nTwo teachers will participate in the immersion training, one from each key stage so that the impact of the training can be felt directly throughout the school. The impact which the school envisages that the project will have on the culture of the school will involve a rise in attainment in MFL- children leaving with higher level language skills when they make the transition into their secondary schools,a greater enthusiasm and success in the learning of French throughout the key stages, a more European flavour and awareness in the culture of the school, and a greater enthusiasm for French as learners experience a greater level of success through having been taught in a more organised, creative and motivational way by teachers who are more confident in their own linguistic abilities.", "http://www.penruddock.cumbria.sch.uk", "Penruddock Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000154_coordinator"]]}}, "8HX": {"nhs": {"data": [["RNN", "Penrith Hospital", "nhs_RNNBE"]]}}, "8ST": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "LONSDALE SETTLED ESTATES LIMITED", 293.0, "Operational technical assistance (05.04.60.02)", "fts_2016_28983"]]}}}}
