Even the basic principles of barrier free communication are hardly known.\r\nYoung people with disabilities want people to know more about their feelings, and want to communicate, in order also for their peers to gain a better understanding of disabilities, also in adult life. EU Disability Matters launch package (UK) stated that 25% of Britons do not feel confident communicating with a child with disabilities.\r\n\r\nNEEDS:\r\n(Young) people with disabilities encounter many different forms of attitudinal barriers that hamper a communication with mutual respect:\r\n\u2022 Inferiority: Because a person may be impaired in one of life's major functions, some people believe that the individual is a \"second-class citizen.\" However, most people with disabilities have \u201ccompensating skills\u201d.\r\n\u2022 Pity: People feel sorry for the person with a disability, which tends to lead to patronising attitudes. People with disabilities generally don't want pity and charity, just equal opportunity and be part of their youth peers community.\r\n\u2022 Hero worship: Most people with disabilities do not want accolades for performing day-to-day tasks.\r\n\u2022 Ignorance: People with disabilities are often dismissed as incapable of accomplishing a task without the opportunity to display their skills.\r\n\u2022 The Spread Effect: People assume that an individual's disability negatively affects other senses, abilities or personality traits, or that the total person is impaired.\r\n\u2022 Stereotypes: The other side of the spread effect is the positive and negative generalisations people form about disabilities. Aside from diminishing the individual and his or her abilities, such prejudice can set too high or too low a standard for individuals who are merely human.\r\n\u2022 Backlash: Many people believe individuals with disabilities are given unfair advantages, however  they do not get special privileges rather just equal opportunities.\r\n\u2022 Denial: Many disabilities are \"hidden,\" such as learning disabilities, psychiatric disabilities, epilepsy, arthritis and heart conditions. People tend to believe these are not bona fide disabilities needing \u201caccommodation\u201d.\r\n\u2022 Fear: Many people are afraid that they will \"do or say the wrong thing\" around someone with a disability. They therefore avert their own discomfort by avoiding the individual with a disability.\r\n\r\nMaking youth aware of these very basic aspects in interaction with a peer with disabilities is a first step in solving the problem, while in a next step barriers need to be broken down by applying proper and accessible interaction/communication methods.\r\nThese 2 steps are at the core of the project, aiming to impact young people, thus investing in the future, and providing the proper basis for spill over effects into society, and into the working environment.\r\n\r\nThe project wants to help youth communities increase their understanding of disabilities and reduce the fear of approaching or being approached by an individual with disabilities, by applying the peer support model.\r\n\r\nTARGET GROUPS:\r\n- Youth workers and leaders\r\n- Student leaders\r\n- Disability youth organisations responsibles\r\n\r\nBENEFICIARIES:\r\n- Youth volunteers, youth organisation members\r\n- Student bodies/Youth council members\r\n- Youth with disabilities organisations and informal youth communities\r\n- Youth NGOs\r\n- Policy makers\r\n- EU Disability/Youth related organisations\r\n\r\nThe project will therefore create the following open educational resources as INTELLECTUAL OUTPUTS (languages EN, BG, NL & DE):\r\nIO1: Guide for youth workers on inclusive communication youth awareness campaign\r\nIO2: Handbook \"ABC to inclusive communication with my peers with disabilities\"\r\nIO3: Inclusive communication peer support hub\r\n\r\nEXPECTED IMPACT:\r\nOn youth community:\r\n- Develop a greater understanding of the definition of disability\r\n- Help them recognise and overcome any assumptions they may have about people with disabilities and examine attitudes towards disability\r\nOn youth workers/leaders:\r\n- Promote a greater awareness of the effects of inclusive communication among youth community and in the society\r\n- Provide guidance on a variety of disabilities to enable youth to understand how this impacts on a person\u2019s day-to-day life\r\n- Help them to identify the potential barriers of disabled learners in education\r\n\r\nThe proposal is supporting also the priorities of Council Resolution on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018) - EU Youth Strategy.\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP:\r\nThe project consortium brings together 4 partners from 4 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Austria and United Kingdom) which are including national umbrella representative disability body (P1), organisations working with youth with disabilities (P3 & P4) and EU counseling body on inclusive practices and advises for youth (P2).", "http://www.davebanesaccess.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-BG01-KA205-036420_1"]]}}, "5TL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1225497600000, 1351641600000, "Frequency Agile Microwave Bonding System", "Industrial Microwave Systems Ltd", "The cost of packaging in microelectronics is around 30% of total production costs, but this is rising at an alarming rate due to the increasing consumer demand for smaller and smarter portable electronic devices. In micro-systems, the costs of packaging can be up to 80% of total production costs. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies. Moreover, with the exodus of high volume packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries such as China and India, the manufacturing industry in Europe needs to revitalise itself by encouraging design and innovation that will allow European companies to produce assembly equipment and materials of tomorrow that will feed into the Asian market. Our approach of using microwave technology in bonding has significant advantages over technologies made available in the market. In our approach we don\u2019t need a closed microwave oven. Through the open design we can do the placement, alignment and curing at the same time. The use of this technology in reel-to-reel manufacturing will be possible. Due to the higher level of integration and signifcantly shorter cycle times this new technology will give European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage particularly over their US competitors. Quality of the bonds will be improved as well due to better selectivity and special designed materials as well as the precisely adaptable frequency of the microwave. It uses pulsed microwave sources and relies on the selection of a few resonant cavities frequencies that are jittered (mode hopping). The two characteristics permit not only the avoidance of electrical discharges through arcing, but also the accurate curing of the paste at the location of interest, i.e. at the interface between a die and the substrate for example in the case of DCA.

The NDT techniques, systems and sensors to be developed for sub-sea ROV deployed applications include: 1. Phased Array Automated Ultrasonic Testing (PA - AUT) for the volumetric examination of critical sub-sea jacket welds on structural tubulars, support legs and node sections 2. Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM) for the surface and near surface examination of critical sub-sea jacket welds on structural tubulars, support legs and node sections 3. Long Range Ultrasonic Testing (LRUT) using guided ultrasonic waves for the examination of sub-sea flow lines, oil & gas import and export lines and risers for corrosion and other volumetric defects. Although the above are recognised established NDT techniques, their application to offshore sub-sea structures by ROVs has yet to be developed and constitutes a significant challenge. The use of ROV deployed NDT techniques is now preferred to those applied by divers because of personal safety and dive depth limitations. In the North Sea there are about 150 fixed platforms and over 60% of them are older than 20 years and beyond their original design life.
