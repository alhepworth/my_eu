This system will include optical non-contact monitoring and innovative Human-Machine-Interfaces, which are easily manageable for the worker. Based on thermal and optical models embedded into integral process simulation tools combined with novel machine and laser technologies, for the first time a tape winding system will be realised which is able not only to drastically reduce the occurring waste, but also predict potentially arising failure in order to reduce machine downtimes. Statistical reliability and maintenance models for detection of critical elements and definition of their reliability will also prevent sudden machine breakdowns and allow defining the most cost-efficient maintenance schedule. \n\nThus ambliFibre will be a major breakthrough for the continuous and discontinuous production of neuralgic tape-winded tubular composite components, such as gas tanks for automotive application, pressure vessel housings for the desalination of sea water or composite ultra-deep-water risers which are all affected by rapidly changing product requirements concerning both, material and design. With respect to changing and challenging environmental influences, quick adaptability, failure-free quality and safe operation over the complete life-cycle are mandatory. \n\nThe successful application of the ambliFibre results will dramatically accelerate the replacement of metal components in these domains, reducing the carbon footprint thanks to the low weight and long life cycle of FRP components and provide new opportunities for European manufacturers in global, high-value multi-billion \u20ac markets.\n\nambliFibre is conceived as a small collaborative project lasting 36 months and will be submitted to the call FoF 14 \u2013 2015:  Integrated design and management of production machinery and processes.", 191461.0, 3963931.0, 7, 12, "ambliFibre", null, null, null, "h2020_198352_951591535"]]}}, "3DY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Autonomie/Adaptabilit\u00e9 - Int\u00e9gration/Immersion de Scolaires en Europe", "EDVENTUREPLUS LTD", 30885.0, 2, 2, "- The AISE\u00b2 project  (Autonomy/Adaptability \u2013 Inclusion/Immersion of Students in Europe) is intended for  the students of the vocational/technical school \u201cLes Menuts\u201d, located in an Educational Priority Area. They study in commerce, service and management-administrative fields. They are from different origins, from disadvantaged backgrounds. The students  aim at reaching the main objectives pointed out in the title of the project : increasing their autonomy, supporting the professional and personal adaptability, improving the competences and skills involving the professional integration and the social and cultural inclusion in a European environment.- 20 participants will be involved over 24 months. They are volunteers, involved and integrated in the European section and taking part into many European projects..During their mobility in a company in Bristol for 4 weeks in the final year (upper 6th), the trainees will give a European dimension to their professional, scholar, personal and cultural learning. They will apprehend a culture, a theoretical subject until then, they will join a professional team. They will learn and might put into practice different working methods. They will compare their professional competences and skills with the ones of the host country (transversal competences) and will apply all the well-being rules they have learned. They will deal with a new social background.The whole of these aspects will be beforehand mentioned by the teachers in accordance with the professional reference source of the exams and by the intermediary organism during the several days of training.- On the one hand the professional experience and the new skills will be recognized through the Europass Mobility, they will complete the training they had in the European Section and they will allow to pass the European Section distinction for the exam \u201cBaccalaur\u00e9at\u201d.On the other hand, the monitoring and the assessments of the internship done during the time of the project will be incorporated to the final mark of the exam.

Above all else, giving a European extent is also giving a professional value.- These students who are from disadvantaged backgrounds will find a way to live a European professional, human, cultural and language experience. Getting these students into an Erasmus Plus Programme  is giving them the opportunity to reduce social barriers and to get better professional equity and then, to cope with a future job. Through the professional  European dynamism this experience will give them the opportunity to develop their capacity of adaptation and autonomy, their professional skills in the commerce, service and management-administration sections, their multilingualism and their knowledge of more cultures.It will be a matter of giving the students all the possible assets to ensure a better professional integration and a personal fulfilment.It will be a matter of even more putting them at ease\u00b2, \"\u00e0 l'AISE\u00b2\" (Autonomy Adaptability, Inclusion Immersion of Students in Europe)", "http://www.edventureplus.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022553_1"]]}}, "4DD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1275350400000, 1380499200000, "Semiconductor Equipment Assessment Leveraging Innovation", "Metryx Ltd", "SEAL is a project for an integrated project consisting of 17 equipment assessment sub-projects in the area of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

In addition, three important processes are addressed: low temperature oxidation, cleaning of sensitive interconnect stacks/structures and ion implantation for ultra shallow junctions and defect engineering. For metrology and analysis, the main focus is on enabling innovative systems to efficiently contribute to at-line and in-line monitoring and control within semiconductor facilities. Without such equipment, it will not be possible to validate progressively advanced processes during development and manufacturing.Cross-cut R&D activities relating to all equipment assessment sub-projects are covered including APC, model based control, equipment simulation, enhanced wafer and equipment logistics, advanced communication and man machine-interfaces, and virtual equipment engineering. A common approach for the assessment activities will be utilised with specifications that will be refined for each equipment type for the progressively emerging technology nodes.Overall, SEAL will strengthen the European equipment manufacturing industry in an ideal and sustainable way by combining advanced R&D topics in equipment sub-projects involving a wide community of users, research institutes and equipment suppliers with many SMEs.", 279991.0, 11868543.0, 12, 39, "SEAL", null, "http://www.metryx.net", null, "fp7_95776_985700421"], [1380585600000, 1475193600000, "European 450mm Equipment Demo Line", "Metryx Ltd", "The aim of the E450EDL project is to continue the engagement of the European semiconductor equipment and materials industry in the 450mm wafer size transition that started with the ENIAC JU EEMI450 initiative and proceeded with subsequent projects funded with public money, amongst others NGC450, SOI450, EEM450PR.
