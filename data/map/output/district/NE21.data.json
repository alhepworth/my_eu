It is envisaged that through the medium of art pupils will develop a deeper understanding of their own cultural but of also the rich variety of cultures and diversity found within Europe.The partnership was developed through the use of the E-Twinning partner finding service, personal friendships and links that had been previously developed. Together we devised an acronym for our project, @Museart. This acronym summarised our thoughts that the project would involve museums, art, technology but also amusement and fun to facilitate an exciting and challenging project. The target aims of this project are to improve achievement in relevant and high-level basic and transversal competencies in a lifelong learning perspective through the promotion of art as a universal means of learning and communication. This will be an inclusive project that involves all members of school communities regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic background or academic achievement. We aim to strengthen the profiles of our teachers by sharing the variety of excellent, didactic practice within our European Community of schools. Our aims are:To enrich our culture by experiencing the main artistic places of each community and exploring the different cultures, traditions and places associated with art and creativity. We will use art as a means of developing curriculum material to enhance the life skills and competencies of the students. Through increased motivation the children will be able to enhance a wide range of life-long learning skills such as literacy, numeracy, ICT and an appreciation for aesthetic beauty. To address inclusion within our project we will use art as a means of inclusion for all our children. Art allows all children to express their talents through a variety of media.To strengthen the profile of teachers we will improve their cultural knowledge, share innovative teaching methodologies, exchange excellent practice and provide learning opportunities and cultural stimuli. The project involves 9 schools from 8 different countries around Europe. The schools serve a wide variety of socio-economic communities and a wide variety of ethnic diversity.The designed activities will empower the European citizens of tomorrow with the knowledge, abilities and attitudes vital to create a society that appreciates the unique artistic differences between cultures and backgrounds.  The dimension of communication and language skill development is a natural progression and project activities will provide scope for much creativity and innovation. In order to have sustainable impact this project has the focus of sharing and developing staff practice whilst still addressing key areas identified as European priorities and in individual schools. This project will provide entrepreneurship opportunities by creating on line resources, blogs, research tools, books, exhibitions, open laboratories and artistic creations that will be utilised by each visiting team.", "http://www.stjosephscatholicprimaryschool.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IE01-KA219-016860_5"], [2016, "We are a sustainable community.

CREATING SCIENTIST GROUPS TO SHARE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES is a cross-curricularproject to enhance sustainable actions in our schools, institutions and towns as educational communities in the European frame through experimental activities carried out in jigsaw cooperative learning groups. It involves the whole community: pupils, teachers, families and local people.On the basis of many science projects developed in our schools during the last years, using cooperative learning groups and experimental methodology, we have designed this project to share good practices about a more sustainable use of natural resources in Europe.  Moreover we will  apply innovative methodologies such as jigsaw collaborative groups of expert students, following the CA-AC theory, COOPERATE TO LEARN AND LEARN TO COOPERATE. Six schools, from United Kingdom, Romania, Italy, Portugal, Bulgaria and Spain, create the strategic partnership. We all share the need of improving scientific methodology involving all school teachers and students. We also believe in cooperative learning groups as an inclusive and effective methodology to enhance the basic competences achievement in a long-term period.We plan a three years project. We are going to investigate and learn about three topics, adapting some of them, like natural resources, to our context and country.1. REDUCING, REUSING, RECYCLING, RETHINKING (year 1)2. WE USE NATURAL RESOURCES. SAVING WATER. USING WOOD, OUR FOREST IS ALIVE.3. RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES. SOLAR POWER Starting with a deep context's observation, students will ask initial questions to be answered through experimental activities. Hypothesis will be formulated in cooperative learning groups. Then we are going to plan and do experimental activities, inside and outside school, collecting data to answer initial questions.  Applying scientific methodology students will learn how to collect and organize data, information and experiment's results, using graphs, charts, drawings, etc.  Results and conclusions will be summarized  in scientific reports. To develop the three topics we will follow these steps : - analyzing context : preconceptions, previous knowledge about the topic- asking initial questions : scientifically oriented questions to investigate and to answer at the end.- starting: awareness step, hypothesis- discovering: experimenting, investigating through different activities inside and outside school.- collecting data- connecting, structuring: students structure knowledge and write scientific reports. - applying: students do an activity to apply concepts and knowledge.- communicating: students communicate findings, results and conclusions in front of an audience and justify explanations.- reflexion and assessment.Each organisation will be able to adapt the analyzing context activities and research according to its context. So that we are going to learn about different natural resources used in Europe.  Implementing this project we pretend to introduce the jigsaw cooperative learning approach working with groups of experts in different skills and processes , such as topic vocabulary, taking pictures, searching information, speaking, collecting data, reading graphs, etc. Each student has an important role to achieve the objectives which will be shared with students from the beginning of the project.Every year students will apply their Knowledge, findings and learning to create final outputs, which are real and useful to enhance sustainability. They will also make a personal project's portfolio.   Students, teachers and families will see the research results and outcomes through different channels, like project's website, digital magazine, exhibition, social media and presentations. All project's outcomes will enhance long-term good sustainable practices among local and regional communities. The last step will be the assessment and reflection. Al partners agree in using quantitative and qualitative indicators to monitor the project every year.  To support the project a training activity in the second year will be followed by the key teachers from each school  at UVic (University of Vic).Five transnational meetings are planned to implement and follow up the project.We expect that all our project activities and results, shared through the project's website, will be relevant to disseminate among our school community and local people  in each country. The 12 Recycling Tips leaflet (year1) using all partner's languages will have a long-term benefit in our communities.The final exhibition with the two panels created every year and the project's outputs will be a public dissemination activity at local and regional level.The jigsaw cooperative learning technique will enhance the learning outcomes and the basic competences achievement.

It is designed to give teachers the skills and confidence to teach mathematics, focusing on subject knowledge and pedagogy. In line with the national picture to enhance teaching and learning, our project which focuses primarily on primary education will provide children with secure and necessary skills. \r\n\r\nWe aim to develop a positive attitude towards mathematics, including the acquisition of higher-order skills, such as the ability to explore,  to reason and  to communicate mathematically. We want children to use their mathematical  skills effectively to solve mathematical problems with confidence in daily life. In addition, we strive to develop a positive attitude toward mathematics, seeing mathematics as a powerful way of looking at situations, and becoming confident in one's own mathematical ability.\r\n\r\nThe project will allow sound pedagogical approaches to mathematical teaching and learning to be shared as well as develop essential resources to support high quality mathematical experiences for all young children.

They will perform a series of hands-on, fun mathematical activities which they share between participants. The children will exchange and take part in sharing; skills, strategies and techniques for problem solving and improving pedagogy.\r\nCommunication -  The pupils and staff of all partner schools will continuously develop many new ICT skills and new technologies. This will be through; e-mail.

Even worse, large quantities of food produced actually never reaches the consumer. Due to distorted consumer demands it is sorted out and thrown away. Food decays during transport and storage or it is taken out of stores due to over-regulated shelf-life prescriptions.

The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healthy races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Mono-cultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Artificial spices, colors,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. \r\nBut there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. \r\nWe design this follow up youth exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves.

The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healthy races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Mono-cultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Artificial spices, colors,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. But there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. We design this follow up youth exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves. They will learn from each other about developments in their countries. They will study the importance of transport, storage, sorting, packaging and positioning to influence their consumer behaviors. The will be visiting farmers, wholesale markets, supermarkets to inquire and discover themselves the mechanism of price and production. They will train themselves to read, study, understand and analyze the prescriptions of food. They will attempt to design an own youth-friendly diet by buying, tasting and by cooking food together. We will experience in person the difference between industrial farming and ecological farming. They will be helped by activists, researchers and inspection services. We want this Youth Exchange to be one of several, through which youth workers can learn from youth, how it is possible to mobilize and train young people of their age to become more aware and receptive to a more pleasing food diet, that instantly reduces the ecological \u2018food\u2019 print of generations to come. To award the effort of the participants and to achieve an intimate link between this and future youth exchanges we will introduce the certificate of \"food activists\".", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", "Silver Fox North East CIC", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024810_coordinator"], [2016, "ARTrepreneurship", "Silver Fox North East CIC", 21225.0, 10, 10, "CONTEXT & BACKGROUND With ARTrepreneurship we are seeking to address the issue of Youth Unemployment and to promote Entrepreneurship Education as a way out of it. The project is a continuation of successful local and international trainings organized by SEAL CYPRUS to promote Entrepreneurship among the youth. In February 2016, 4.381 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU-28. High youth unemployment rates do reflect the difficulties faced by young people in finding jobs, especially females and youth with disabilities.At the same time there is a lesser appetite for entrepreneurship in Europe compared with our main competitors. Only 37% of the EU citizens prefer to be self-employed or an entrepreneur to being an employee (51% in USA and 56% in China) according to the DG for Enterprise and Industry. OBJECTIVES Main aim:To improve competences linked to the professional profiles of Youth Workers, Youth Trainers and Youth Leaders with an emphasis on the Key-Competence of \u201cSense of Initiative and Entrepreneurship\u201d.Objectives:A. To develop key skills and competences of Youth Workers, Youth Trainers and Youth Leaders in Non-formal Entrepreneurship Education andB. To reinforce the capacity and international scope of organisations active in the youth field to promote Entrepreneurship with educational activities and initiatives to address the needs of young people.  NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThe training is going to bring together 30 participants from 10 countries-Cyprus, Albania, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia, United Kingdom and Ukraine.Participants of this project are Youth Workers, Youth Leaders, and Youth Trainers active in the youth field and willing to build their skills and capacity to develop quality initiatives and educational activities to promote entrepreneurship. They all have diverse backgrounds and levels of experience in the field of entrepreneurship. Priority will be given to people who hold a disability status, to those who are as registered as unemployed in their Public Employment Service and to those who have low income based on their income-tax return certificate. We know that 5 of the participants are going to be people with disabilities. (More detailed description has been provided in part E. Participants' Profile). ACTIVITIES & METHODS The project includes the 7-day training course and 10 days for personal learning commitments, peer learning, online work, etc. We will use:-Non-formal participatory methods (team building activities, energisers; world caf\u00e9, live library, case studies, brainstorming, \u201cspeed-dating\u201d with successful entrepreneurs, presentations, info-sessions, simulation games, reflection groups, buddy system etc);-Learning by doing;-Learning by experience;-Improvisation theater;-Creative learning (through drawing, textiles, photography, music, etc.);-Mentoring, to support participants to develop their project ideas and guide them in their further learning journey.RESULTS AND IMPACT Participants are going to improve their skills and competences certified with Youthpass.The training will develop and broaden the understanding of entrepreneurship, its dimensions and relations with the labour market. Participants of the training will be able to support their organisations in addressing unemployment and promoting entrepreneurship.The presence of 5 people with disabilities in this training will have an enormous impact on the participants and will empower many young people. This project ARTrepreneurship is going to have an important impact beyond the participants. Through their involvement, the people involved in all the phases either as project managers, staff members, board members or volunteers will develop a wide range of leadership and management skills.Partner organisations are expected to extend the international dimension of their work, to learn about non-formal methods of entrepreneurial education, to strengthen their relationships with their stakeholders. The training will provide an opportunity to establish sustainable partnerships for further cooperation and projects.As a result of this project, the participants and their organisations will be prepared to encourage entrepreneurship among youth in an efficient way, as well as to organise quality projects within Erasmus+ Program of the European Union and beyond.On the long run the project will bring benefits to communities, which participants are coming from, as well as an international community, since after the training participants are going to implement transnational initiatives based on the network of organisations which became a part of the training.", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-CY02-KA105-000783_5"], [2016, "Camera.
