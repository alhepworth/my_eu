Total duration of the project is six months. In that project participating 49 young people and 11 leaders. We are involved partners from Estonia, United Kingtom, Chezh Republic, Austria, Germany, Greece and Slovakia. From each partner country are involved 7 youngsters aged between 16-18 who have given input to youth exchange program. In addition project involves 11 leaders. In that project have involved 17 young people with fewer opportunities, who is facing economical, social difficulties and health problems. \r\nThat project main aim is to develop youngsters social skills (as team work, self-expression, listening and respect each other) and to encourage youngsters to be who they are the way to support their mind and body. Other important goals: intercultural learning, better self-expressing, experiences in international level and growing participants self-awareness. \r\nTo reach project goals we are using non-formal methods, where are important place for arts workshops, discussion in small groups, sport activities, team building games and different evening cultural programs. In the middle of everything are essential part of giving feedback and analyzing activities that all young people can write down their knowledge and share experience with each other.\r\nThe project results will be booklet and video that will be shared in social media. In addition youngsters make a presentation that will be represented in school in front of 9-12 grades to explain what each of participant learned. Beside that they representing possibilities about Erasmus+. \r\nOn the basis of future perspective the project offers for young people opportunity to increase their self-awareness and hold mind and body balanced. Project gives to young people new motivation and help to support sense of initiative to work out idea to action.  \r\nInternational experience increases youngsters tolerant and understanding of each other that is important nowadays environment.", "http://www.williambrookes.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EE01-KA105-034730_1"]]}}, "6NZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1483142400000, "Integrated Biotechnological Solutions for Combating Marine Oil Spills", "Uk Spill Limited", "Kill\u25cfSpill delivers innovative (bio)technologies, which can be integrated to the real sequences of state-of-the-art actions used currently to cleanup oil spills. The catalogue of Kill\u25cfSpill products & technologies is based on a review of technology & knowledge gaps in approaches of oil spill disasters and brings appropriate tools for 1st response, follow-up, and longer-term actions, specifically tailored to the versatility of oil spills.
