The partnership covers Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the United Kingdom.The main objective of E4S is to develop innovative mechanisms to promote ethics in grassroots sports and ensure its effective enforcement, by enhancing the capacities and skills of sporting bodies and allowing them to give more efficient responses to risks threatening the integrity of sport.In order to achieve the general objective of the project, PPs will pursue the fulfilment of the following specific objectives:1. develop and/or improve new Codes of Ethics for sporting bodies to spread ethical values in sport, following an inclusive and cross-cutting approach;2. develop a set of verifiable indicators to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the Codes of Ethics\u2019 enforcement;3. effectively enforce the Codes of Ethics developed and make the most of new technologies (through the so-called \u201cEthics App\u201d) to fulfil this aim, by conducting pilot tests;4. test, monitor and evaluate the enforcement of the Code of Ethics, hence gathering lessons learned for replicability around Europe;5. set-up a public-private network of institutions aiming to cooperate in the field of ethics in sport and identifying new members to be engaged in the future and enrich the alliances", "http://www.afcbarwell.com", null, "erasmus_567220-EPP-1-2015-2-ES-SPO-SCP_4"]]}}, "8FU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Interwork between Generation Z and Employers", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 304560.0, 7, 7, "A survey, conducted for the European Business Forum on Vocational Training (Brussels, 2014) concludes that \u201eEmployers, education providers and youth live in parallel universes. Each have different diagnoses of the problems, because they do not engage with one another.\u201d The main goal of our project is to try and close this gap, building up cooperation between the two major players of job markets - employers and youth, creating an effective and successful work environment.Companies face several challanges due to changes in labor market trends, such as a trend of labor demand exceeding labor supply in the near future, or the already three different generations (baby boomers, X and Y) present in the labor market augmented with the new generation, so called Gen Z, recently entering the job market with whole new expectations, and so little known about. Our project\u2019s 2 main target groups therefore are companies who already, or will have gen Z employees, and members of gen Z, with the aim of harmonizing the needs of both sides, and bringing effective solutions to help them be more prepared for the new ways of cooperation. Within companies, we have chosen small and medium sized companies (SMEs) as the primary target group, as, according to studies, gen Z prefer to work at SMEs rather than multinational companies, added to which, SMEs represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. We will involve HR managers, company owners, supervisors, team leaders and mentors in our project.We will conduct two exhaustive surveys using the methods of focus group sessions, semi-sructured interviews and questionnaires; one of them involving members of gen Z (16-21yrs) with relevant work experience, who are able to compare their expectations with existing conditions (which makes the research unexampled); and the other researching company demands and experiences with the generation. Our first intellectual output is a methodology providing methods, tools and best practices for SMEs to create an attractive, supporting and retaining working environment, based on the results of the gen Z survey and further research. It aims to help companies gain better understanding of the attitudes, motivators and drives of gen Z, learning how to support and motivate them to work more productively, how to satisfy their needs as employees and how to manage and deal with conflicts. The second intellectual output closely linked with the methodology is the Mentor training, developed based on our surveys of European SMEs\u2019 and gen Z\u2019s demands. A survey of The European Foundation for Management Development and the European Mentoring and Coaching Council reported that, while organizations are experiencing substantial benefits from their investments in this area, in-company mentoring is still a \u201cwork in progress\u201d. Our project addresses this issue by focusing on in-company mentoring, as we believe it to be the bridge between education and work. The mentor training provides valuable knowledge and instructions on how to build a strong, two-leveled in company mentor program. Firstly, the mentor training focuses on developing the key competences mentors need in order to support the integration of new employees from gen Z appropriately. Secondly, the mentors will be trained to train future mentors as well, ensuring the system to be independently and autodynamically working. It will be available in all partner languages, covering all the steps needed to establish a mentor program, assuring the perpetuance of the project.The third intellectual output of the project is a soft skill training material produced for members of gen Z, based on the company survey and further research, prepared in a form adjusted to gen Z\u2019s learning ways. This will help young employees to be more prepared for,  and more confident and content at work, more assertive and able to solve problems due to understanding the demands of the job market and the working styles of older generations.Due to and besides these, we expect the employment rate of gen Z members to increase, the role of SMEs in the labor market and in the local and national industry to grow and the project conception and achievements to reach the decision makers of the educational sector, HR professionals and mentors of the companies, or similar organizations in partner countries. The partners\u2019 extended networks, both embracing the corporate sector (P2, P3, P4) and the field of education (P1, P5, P6, P7), will be connected, raising a bridge over the gap which often divides the fields of education and industry.Ultimately, the main expected result of our project, as detailed above, is a strong, well-established, prosperous relationship, and a foundation of cooperation (with a special focus on working environments) between employers and their (future) employees from Gen Z, based on deep understanding, acceptance, fluent communication, consciousness and grounded knowledge about one another, as well as practical experiences.", "http://www.exponentialtraining.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA202-023939_6"], [2016, "TeamMate360", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 293605.0, 7, 7, "The so-called \u2018digital revolution\u2019 is changing the world in which we live and work. Trends such as home-working and globalisation are contributing to increased use of remote teams. The London Global Leaders\u2019 Summit reported that more than a third of executives expect that over 50% of their full-time employees will work remotely by 2020 (LBS, 2014). Teams are becoming increasingly geographically dispersed: team members might work just a few kilometres from their colleagues, or in different countries and time zones. Whilst remote teams bring benefits for both employers and individuals, they also bring some new challenges. For enterprises such as Google, remote working is embedded in their culture, but for most organisations it is still early days. Although the technology exists to support remote working, management practice is not keeping up with the demands of managing remote teams (CIPD: 2014) and requires a re-think of the role and competences required by both managers and employees (ILM: 2015). TeamMate 360 aims to address this problem.  Using a new on-line 360\u00b0 assessment tool TeamMate 360, partners benchmark the remote team-working practices of 150 managers from the public and private sector, SMEs and larger organisations and social enterprises. To achieve this, a team of trainers will take part in a blended learning course. Trainers will then be equipped with the skills and know-how to pilot TeamMate and to deliver a new VET course designed to provide managers with the skills and behaviours necessary for the management of remote teams.The project will create a new tool, TeamMate, and an innovative VET solution designed to develop the transversal competences managers of remote teams. Through the use of ECVET, participants will also be encouraged to progress toward a full qualification.  The project will culminate with a series of dissemination events designed to demonstrate the impact of the TeamMate. During the events, a series of case studies will be presented illustrating real performance improvement made by participants within their organisation.

However, the adoption of these technologies remain slower than seen in other industries. One study by the European Commission (Survey of Schools: ICT in Education) found that only 25% of students in the European Union are taught by digitally confident and supportive teachers, while another study by the OECD found that 56% of teachers report that they have \u201cmoderate to high development needs\u201d when it comes to using technology at work. In addition, teachers fail to appreciate the digital opportunities which exist and those which are due to open up in the near future.\r\nBuilding the digital skills of teachers & students is a vital step in actually benefiting from technology in education. Various teachers are ready to accept the wave of digitization but more effort still need to be exercised when it comes to teacher training. Outmoded teaching and training methods need to meet with 21st century teaching & learning trends. The IDEAL project aims to help educators, teachers & trainers in (in)formal adult education to understand & put digital education into practice. IDEAL will promote modern pedagogies, training methods & teaching practices, and develop learning materials and tools that support the effective use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education & training. As a result, the project will promote digital literacy, skills & inclusion for both teachers & learners.\r\n\r\nThe IDEAL project will be executed by a partnership of seven organisation from 6 different EU countries:\r\n- Ense\u00f1a (ES), a training center for employment providing training services to contribute to the development and qualification of both workers & companies.\r\n- Eolas (ES), provides services & support to all enterprises, organisations & entities with demands in the field of the design & management of projects.\r\n- Inqubator Leeuwarden (NL), provides training & coaching to starting companies to firmly establish their business and to help them maximise their personal growth.\r\n- Expontential Training & Assessment (UK), is working with learners in over 50 countries undertaking professional development & qualifications in management & leadership, coaching & mentoring, business support & management consulting.\r\n- CrystalClearSoft (EL), expert in e-learning, develops its own learning tools ranging from e-learning platforms offering personalised learning environments, serious games, simulations, immersive environments etc.\r\n- North-East Regional Development Agency is authorized as provider of training & education by the National Authority for Qualification and carries out this activity under their North-East Regional Studies Center (CRS).\r\n- Eurocrea Merchant (IT) is a consulting & training company that aims to improve the competitiveness of the European society through business development, training & creation of transnational partnership.\r\n\r\nThe project uses a clear, complete & high quality methodology, including the 3 phases:\r\n1. Strategy (activities Preparation & Research)\r\n2. Development, Implementation & Testing (activities Development & Alpha testing, and Implementation & Beta testing)\r\n3. Review, Finalisation and Dissemination (activities Review & Finalisation, and Dissemination)\r\n\r\nWhat makes this project innovative is that the IDEAL project aims to provide a complete package of materials and tools which has been divided into steps that are built on a very logical succession and therefore form a whole. The following results will be developed in the IDEAL project:\r\n\r\n- IDEAL Campaign (IO1) to inform and convince educators, teachers and trainers involved in adult education about the opportunities and benefits of digital education\r\n- IDEAL Teacher Manual (IO2) describing step-by-step HOW digital tools and ICT can be implemented in their teaching practices and strategies\r\n- IDEAL Toolkit (IO3) that provides teachers, trainers and educators with a comprehensive toolkit that offers the best digital & modern tools to use and easily, quickly and directly implement in their course or training\r\n- IDEAL online platform (IO4) to make the materials easily accessible & free of charge\r\n\r\nThe IDEAL project expects to have an impact on:\r\n- Teachers & learners in adult education as IDEAL will lead to professional development\r\n- Organisations involved in adult education (including the project partners), as through the project, organisations look at how digital technology can support the development of new training and teaching methods and improve the effectiveness and impact of courses. In addition, IDEAL will contribute to the development of modern & digital education focused on 21st century skills. It will also change the perceptions of the importance of digital skills.
