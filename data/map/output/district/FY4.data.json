The teachers should come to know new educational ideas, methods, teaching materials and aids.\r\n\r\nAs the main objective of jobshadowing mobility we delimit to ourselves to improve the quality of education at our school and to establish cooperation with the school in a different social and cultural environment. Thanks this mobility we would like to give our teachers a reflection of their work by attending foreign school and becoming familiar with the situation in the British educational system. We chose Great Britain, as we successfully found a reliable partner who is willing to prepare for us the program according to our requirements: visit of art lessons, cooperation with school choir, demonstration of IT capabilities and school equipment, demonstration of teaching according to specific topics and themes, consultations with experienced teachers from the partner school.\r\n\r\nThere will be total of 11 participating teachers in the project which represents all major groups of employees: school management, language teachers (English, German and French) and teachers of vocational subjects (ecology and environmental education, mathematics, geography, music and art, physical education). All participants are proficient in communication, are competent in the field of ICT and their language level varies from A1 to A2.\r\n\r\nProject activities directly reflect the needs and goals of the project. For teachers the project means studying and comparing the foreign language, its use in teaching vocational subjects (CLIL), the use of IT resources, establishing cooperation for future potential partnerships and exchange of experience with foreign colleagues.
