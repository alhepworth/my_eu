Over the last few years the ethnic mix of the area has altered considerably from a mainly white indigenous population to a community of many ethnic origins.  The impact of this change has been huge in this community. In recent local elections the community has recorded the highest percentage of votes for right wing candidates than in any other ward in the city. The socio economic background places our families in the highest multiple deprivation groups in the city. \r\n\r\nThe school tackles the factors of high unemployment, low aspirations and lack of community cohesion in many ways. One of the main strategies used is restorative justice as a means of increasing a sense of community and responsibility within our pupils. We are constantly seeking and finding ways to improve our practice in this area, and indeed have many links with schools both in our immediate area and beyond. The idea of working with another school in the international arena, whose ethos and belief in community cohesion is similar to ours is extremely attractive.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for this project are: \r\n- Developing the European dimension within the teaching and learning in our setting. \r\n- Improve the quality of education through sharing of experiences. \r\n- Develop new strategies and tools using Information Technology and Communication \r\n- Encourage a climate of  respect and conflict resolution, applying emotional intelligence through restorative practices.\r\n\r\nThere will be a total of sixteen staff involved in the mobility. Their job specifications vary. There are a number of teachers and teaching assistants who will be observing and shadowing colleagues in the receiving school. The head of our pastoral team, together with our senior learning mentor will be a part of this project. These are key people as it is their responsibility to instill and maintain the sense of responsibility, tolerance and community within our school. There will be a member of the school senior leadership team to ensure the smooth running of the project, and to ensure the longer term sustainability of the link.\r\n\r\nOur project aims to build a shared learning. The job shadowing activities are aimed at developing the pedagogical skills of teachers and their expertise in research methodologies. We can all learn from each other , share experiences and exchange views and ideas . Before mobility we will prepare various consultation activities with our Spanish counterparts , including their culture , language, customs and educational system. During mobility we will participate in different activities, workshops and seminars during the days of the visits. We will need to make two visits to the school. The first, early in the project to make the initial contact and another in the second year in order to make the exchange of experiences and learning , implement the necessary improvements and internalize the methodology , teaching and learning strategies, and strengthening the links between the schools. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this project, the staff involved will be subject to new and different ideas to support the needs of the pupils in our school. They will disseminate these ideas to their colleagues, ensuring that all staff have exposure to them and will demonstrate the strategies through informal observation and team teaching. There will be a wider aspect to our curriculum, based on the international dimension, which will ensure that our pupils are constantly working with this in mind, therefore embedding the wider community idea in their lives. There will be a sustained link between the two schools, with regular communication between pupils using email, skype video conferencing and any other new technologies available. Longer term, our pupils will will become more aware and tolerant of the wider community and cultures. Their aspirations for travel and work will be raised, and as a result, the current climate of worklessness and low income reduced.", "http://www.hightersheath.co.uk", "Highters Heath Community School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002269_coordinator"]]}}, "5AL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "L\u00e4ra genom internationalisering", "St Alban's Catholic Primary School", 25831.0, 2, 18, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden, has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work. The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan.

They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.st-albans.eschools.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_4"]]}}, "5RY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "The Oaks Early Excellence project", "The Oaks Primary School", 17738.0, 1, 1, "The school is an average-size primary school.

The staff at The Oaks want our school to be an outstanding school providing the best care and education for children. In order to inspire children to be involved with their education the objectives of this projects are to enhance Early Years provision for the best possible start for children who enter school already below national developmental levels. Therefore, the project aim is then to build on an excellent start with an effective creative curriculum throughout the school and inspiring and strong leadership across the whole school. The objectives of this projects are:*To enrich our school provision with a creative approach to teaching and learning from Early Years to Year six that will enhance learning opportunities for all children. *To include the wider community including playgroups, peer mediators and family support workers within a creative and reflective approach to education and work with children. *To raise teaching standards of our school using effective feedback and reflective skills gained through developing leadership  in a European context*To enrich our curriculum through observation of excellent teaching practice and leadership in Europe.*To develop leadership skills for disseminating good practice across a whole school and to the wider community.These objectives have been chosen following senior leadership meetings which focused on writing the school development plan and considering how this would best be implemented whilst motivating staff  and enthusing children to learn. The school governors and leadership team discussed the focuses of development for the school and prioritized the up skilling of staff to meet the needs of the children. The Early Years team have looked to adopt a more creative approach to learning based on individual needs and interests of children. The intention is to inspire and motivate young learners and encourage a passion for education that will then be adopted through school life. The staff who have expressed an initial interest in the Erasmus+  training courses have in the past read/researched the practice in these countries as part of their own continued professional development. The training courses have been chosen after careful consideration of the needs of the children, staff, school and community that the school embraces. The courses provide a focus on projects for staff before attending training  which will allow staff attending to finely tune the focus of their visit. The daily reflection and  sharing of good practice that the course provides will ensure staff are prepared to disseminate skills to meet the objectives listed on their return. It is also the intention of our school to build and maintain links with other schools. The intention is to provide structured training in Italy and Finland for ten key staff across all key stages of our school to ensure that a coherent vision is embedded and understood by all staff . Also that the  leadership team is developed with a shared understanding to move the school forwards.  Selection of such staff will be based on enthusiasm and willingness to attend, ability and passion to lead change and motivate staff prior to, during and on return from the course. The ability to lead staff through change with a clear vision will be taken into account.The chosen training courses will enthuse and impassion staff to share good practice across the school and create children who are involved and passionate about their own learning. Our staff  will work collaboratively to develop the RAP and  ensure that the activities and projects carried out before during and after the training are understood by and involve all staff and meet all staff needs.We envisage that the impact of the training will be to raise teaching and pedagogy standards  and give our leadership team confidence and a tool to move learning effective teaching and learning forward.

The project also aims to help the participants grow professionally, keep them active, involve them in multi-cultural discussions, develop a number of skills and competences and create new partnerships across Europe.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, a range of NFE methods developed by all the partner organisations will be employed. Main activities will identify benefits of social entrepreneurship, teach the competences needed, and create the means of spreading information about the concept to the public. Involvement, creativity and initiative of all the participants will be encouraged throughout the activities, which will include: 1) interactive workshops, 2) generation of new NFE methods, 3) discussions in non-formal environment, 4) meeting social entrepreneurs, 5) country presentations, 6) visits to social enterprises, 7) application of art and sport as NFE methods, 8) analyses of relevant video materials, 9) quizzes, 11) specialized group exercises, games, 12) feedbacks, reflections, evaluations and much more. In order to facilitate integration of the participants: 13) cultural evenings, 14) energizers, 15) ice-breaking and socializing activities will also be organised. Since the project goal is to reach the public and disseminate the results effectively: 16) special videos, 17) workshops for unemployed and 18) e-booklet will be prepared by the participants. All of this will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups in regional, national and international levels. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will not only improve a number of skills and competences, but will also get a chance to extend their networks by meeting potential investors, social entrepreneurs, etc. This would make them more competitive professionally and help them in creating their own social enterprises. The participating organisations would increase their knowledge on social entrepreneurship and learn new NFE methods, all of which could be used in their future initiatives. At the same time, the project would help them grow internationally, increase public awareness of their actions and enhance their capacities of reaching the objectives of youth development.\r\n\r\nGeneral public and unemployed youth within it are expected to be impacted as well.  Firstly, the participants will share the knowledge acquired throughout the project in workshops for the unemployed within their own communities. Likewise the participating organizations will employ social media and similar future projects to promote the concept of social entrepreneurship. The results dissemination will be also facilitated through involvement of mass-media and spreading of videos and e-booklet prepared during the project. As a result, unemployed youth in participating countries are expected to increase their chances of getting employed and/or actively involved in the society.\r\n\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help participating youth enhance their skills and get involved in social entrepreneurship, but also increase general awareness of this concept in participating countries. As a result, long-term benefits of minimizing youth unemployment and solving social problems through social entrepreneurship are expected; thus, making the project results very important.", "http://www.praxiseurope.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-2-LT02-KA105-000393_3"], [2015, "We are multipliers", "PRAXIS EUROPE CIC", 25974.0, 10, 10, "Erasmus+ Mobility of youth workers \u201cWe are multipliers \u201c is aimed for youth workers directly working with young people from different target groups or responsible for sharing and providing information about different opportunities (especially Erasmus+ programme) to young people, youth organizations, decision makers etc. Project will take place in Istanbul, Turkey and involve 44 participants from 10 countries across Europe (Denmark, Turkey, Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia, Poland, Spain, Hungary, United Kingdom and Czech Republic).

Our purpose is again, to raise awareness that no matter how distant from each other, actually they have many similarities. Each participant will study the characters they choose in details and they will make a costume to represent it thanks to the recycling activity that each participant will carry out by using old clothes. By coinciding our final activity with the candy feast following Ramadan, we will try to let our participants make them feel a festival which belongs to Islam and make a connection between their festivals and Eid al-Fitr. While our participants go out for trick-and-treating with costumes, they will tell the families and shopkeepers about Halloween, our project, Erasmus+ programme, and invite them to the opening of the Tolerance Town as their guests. In our opening, we will express our purpose of acquiring a world without prejudice in which there is tolerance, and that there are many common points between religions by basing our thoughts upon the similar messages of different religions and the similarities between Halloween and Eid al-Fitr.\r\n\r\nWe will also produce a magazine in which all the details about our project will take place in order to contribute to the results of our project. Many people will have information about the activities and the results of our project thanks to our participants and partners delivering the magazines in and out of the country.\r\n\r\nIn addition, during the project we will also carry out social activities such as the activity in which we will socialize with the local people by discovering the city centre, trips to the historical places and natural beauties during which we will introduce our country, project idea generating and informing activities so as to inform our participants about Erasmus+ programme, and cultural nights in order for all the countries to introduce their culture.\r\n\r\nOur long term expectation from the project is that our participants visit our country  again for various reasons and promote our country by sharing their positive thoughts about Turkey with their inner circles, bringing new Erasmus+ projects into action by making new partnerships among our participants and by methods of distributing our project magazine and photograph album and verbal discussions, and spreading the impacts of our project wider thanks to trying to break prejudice against Islam and Judaism in particular.", "http://www.praxiseurope.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-TR01-KA105-047863_4"], [2017, "Cycle and the City", "PRAXIS EUROPE CIC", 20145.0, 6, 6, "BACKGROUND:\r\nPollution in European cities, unhealthy lifestyle as well as extensive car usage and traffic jams are just a few of social problems that the EU institutions and separate member states are trying to address. Surely, these issues could be tackled by more cycling, which is still not popular enough in some of the countries. With this in mind, youth organizations from Italy, Poland, Spain, Lithuania, UK and Denmark have united for this project with the aim to make cycling more popular as a mean of healthy, cheap & sustainable transport. To reach the aim, a youth exchange - Cycle & the City will be hosted in Lithuania on September 4 - 10, 2017 (+a 2-day APV in August). It will involve 36 open-minded youngsters (18-30 years old) willing to change cycling culture in Europe.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo achieve this aim, the following objectives were set: (1) promote cycling as a means of transport both for leisure and work, and the health benefits that come along; (2) lobby for the maintenance of a safe, convenient, efficient and accessible cycling network in participating regions; (3) reduce the actual and perceived dangers faced by cyclists; and (4) appeal to drivers to respect bikes on the road.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES:\r\nA number of activities have been planned in order to help fulfill the project objectives, which include 1) interactive workshops on cycling initiatives, and the benefits they bring; 2) discussions on cycling as a mean of transport in non-formal environment; 3) assessing cycling routes and bicycle rental points in the cities to propose strategical actions to the local municipalities; 4) interactive sessions with experts on cycling, healthy-lifestyle, and public route planning;  5) creative art sessions on the topic;  6) cycling events: critical mass, games for kids, info sessions in the city;  7) visit to local municipality to propose cycling initiatives, 8) analysis of relevant video materials, and much more.\r\n\r\nSince the project goal is to reach the public and disseminate the results effectively participants will: \r\n- prepare an e-booklet focusing on the ways to promote cycling to youth;\r\n- create open cycling events in Kaunas, where participants would engage the public to various activities; \r\n- share good cycling practices from Denmark, UK and Valencia to the public and local decision makers;\r\n- use social media, press and other on-line tools to deliver results further.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups (young people, youth workers, local authorities and the wider public) in regional, national and international levels.\r\n\r\nIMPACT TO PARTICIPANTS:\r\nParticipating youth will learn about cycling activities across Europe, including the ways they are organized and maintained. They will also gather all the necessary knowledge needed for responsible and safe cycling. On top of that, they will learn more about healthy lifestyle and other positive aspects associated with cycling. This will be a base for them in eventually becoming \"Cycling Ambassadors\" in their countries. \r\n\r\nAll the participants will also learn how to effectively communicate in team (as most of the activities will require teamwork). They will also acquire the knowledge and experience needed to: 1) generate ideas; and then 2) create and implement public cycling and sports initiatives. This includes: their understanding of the key organizational things, including vision and mission, values, long-term strategy, marketing, public relations, budget and financing. The participants will learn how to attract the necessary investments for social activities and what are the EU laws for setting up an initiative. Our anticipation is that all this learning will make them self-sufficient in any future endeavors (not just cycling).\r\n\r\nFURTHER IMPACT:\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help participating youth enhance their skills and competences, but also increase general awareness of the urban cycling culture in participating countries. The essential lasting impact of the project will be the necessary positive policy changes on cycling  that could be made as a result of participant interaction with and suggestions to policy makers. We believe that this will help increase the usage of bicycles as a mean of transport in all the project countries.", "http://www.praxiseurope.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-LT02-KA105-005470_3"], [2017, "KNOW ERASMUS+, IT IS MORE (Conoce Erasmus+, es m\u00e1s).", "PRAXIS EUROPE CIC", 19961.0, 13, 16, "El proyecto es un Seminario (KA1) llamado SABER ERASMUS+,ES M\u00c1S.
