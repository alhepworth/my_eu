The ultimate goal of this training is to enable our school to formally introduce Spanish as an additional modern foreign language into our academic curriculum. This has been discussed at length departmentally, with school leadership and with our Board of Governors, and all stakeholders are supportive of our goal to introduce Spanish. Hamilton College is undergoing a period of curricular change and with planned staffing changes envisaged in the near future, we feel that this is the right time to introduce an additional modern foreign language.\r\n Our proposed participant Mr David Summerville has already completed a postgraduate diploma in Spanish for teachers and a place on this course would fulfil the criteria set down by GTCS with regards to residency requirements for language teachers. Mr Summerville would then be our only member of staff to have met this requirement and it would enable our school to move forward with our plans to introduce Spanish as a subject into our academic curriculum. Without GTCS recognition, our school will be unable to offer Spanish.\r\nThe impact of this training for our pupils will be that they will have a choice when it comes to their study of Modern Foreign Languages. Currently we are one of the very few schools not to offer Spanish in South Lanarkshire and this training will allow our pupils to have access to the same variety of languages as those in other schools. We aim to offer Spanish in our Senior School curriculum from August 2018, with formal SQA examinations being offered in the near future. \r\nThe training will have many other benefits for our school too. Our staff will be better prepared to embed the target language into classroom practice. This in turn should have a positive impact on our pupils who will be taught by motivated and informed staff, who will be able to transfer their linguistic and cultural awareness to their pupils. The course should also have a positive impact on our modern languages department and beyond. As is normal practice, all new resources created will be shared with colleagues in school and beyond, helping to improve methodology and the quality of learning and teaching. As we look for and create new partnerships with schools in Europe, this should also have a positive impact on our whole school curriculum. Whilst Modern Languages provide an ideal starting point for creating links with other schools, we will also aim to create links with other departments so that pupils and other stakeholders can see the relevance of learning languages across the curriculum.", "http://www.hamiltoncollege.co.uk", "Christian Schools (Scotland) Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046731_coordinator"], [2016, "Language Training", "Christian Schools (Scotland) Ltd", 1758.0, 1, 1, "In essence, the project consists of one Modern Languages Teacher from Hamilton College participating in a 3 week language immersion course in Lyon in July 2016, with the objective of updating his French language skills and competencies and enhancing his cultural awareness of 21st century France. This will serve to help Hamilton College meet the ongoing challenges of delivering the new CfE curriculum in French and preparing pupils for the SQA's new National Qualifications.The rationale for the project is to update the course applicants\u2019 pedagogical and French language skills and competencies. The language immersion element is very important to enhancing his leadership of language teaching and learning in the classroom, as this will facilitate an authentic language learning and cultural experience in a genuinely French setting, which could not be replicated in the UK. The deeper learning that will take place in a 'real life' setting will have a far greater impact on the quality of the course applicant\u2019s own learning and subsequent teaching of French. His pronunciation and listening skills will improve as a result of hearing the language being spoken constantly by both native speakers and fellow course participants. On his return to Scotland, it will also be beneficial for the course applicant to network with European colleagues with a view to establishing both formal and informal contacts with European schools.The associated benefits for his institution will flow from his increased confidence in the French language. This will be a springboard to bringing forward new initiatives in French at Hamilton College, for example the possibility of developing e-twinning links with a French school. The project\u2019s core objective from Hamilton College\u2019s perspective is to ensure and underpin the continuity of modern languages learning across the 3-18 spectrum. We do not have access to a native speaker French Language Assistant in our school, therefore it is a priority to further develop linguistic competencies amongst the French Teachers in the Modern Languages Department and source up to date, authentic French language and cultural resources to support and enhance pupil learning. These enhanced staff competencies and experiences will also be leveraged to develop pupil appreciation of French culture and to raise key stakeholders' awareness of the European dimension in every aspect of their lives.In conclusion, the above-noted project benefits and learnings will be translated into identified action points that will be captured in an Action Plan - with priorities and timings - to implement the key training outcomes in order to raise the levels of teaching and learning in French within both the primary and secondary schools of Hamilton College.", "http://www.hamiltoncollege.co.uk", "Christian Schools (Scotland) Ltd", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023485_coordinator"]]}}, "0FT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Mobility as a Catalyst for Apprentice Success", "HAMILTON ACADEMICAL FOOTBALL CLUB LIMITED", 291392.0, 4, 13, "Adjuvant Limited, since it's incorporation in May 2009, has been involved in the delivery and financial management of EU Vocational Education and Scottish Government projects with the cumulative project values exceeding \u00a37 Million. \r\n\r\nThis application for VET learner mobility on behalf of apprentices employed as professional players at seven Scottish football clubs (our sending partners). Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. Improved tactical, technical, physical and mental competences for participants as a direct result of mobility.\r\n2. Improved employment rates for mobility participants either as a professional footballer or in alternative career pathways.\r\n3. Accreditation and validation of mobility informal learning and soft skills.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within Europe.\r\n5.

This is an application for two applicants who have just begun a 12 week course on primary language learning delivered by LFEE. The LFEE immersion course will provided tuition, cultural activities, resources and copious opportunities to develop partnerships and professional connections. Chatelherault Primary School have embraced a 1+2 approach with all teachers becoming familiar with South Lanarkshire Councils \"Primary Language Framework\" policy . The '1+2 Languages' strategy is being implemented across the whole school, children are introduced to their second language in Nursery and this is continued and progressed upon up until Primary 7. The children are taught a third language, Scots was selected for this session, throughout their time at school. The 1+2 approach is a priority for improvement this year for Chatelherault and a steering group, which Patricia leads, has been set up, Stacey is a member of this group.  Patricia McGowan has recruited  a number of staff from across all areas of the school to develop the schools language programme.  By participating the LFEE immersion course, we hope that Patricia and Stacey can return to school with more knowledge, skills and ideas to lead future whole school developments in French which build upon these projects and help us to achieve our improvement priority, and to embed languages across the school. Currently, our school has no links with European Projects or partnerships with French schools and so it is hoped that by taking part in this project; these important links can be made and the skills needed to maintain them will be created.  In line with \"Teaching Scotland's Future\" (Donaldson Review) the immersion course will help Patricia and Stacey to extend their understanding of modern languages through building links with teachers across Europe which they are looking forward to sharing with their colleagues. As a result there will be a stronger understanding of relevant pedagogy leading to improved learning and teaching. By completing the immersion course, it is hoped that Patricia and Stacey will enhance their language skills in French and learn from native French speakers by visiting a French town and engaging in the target language with the locals and tutors. It is hoped that Patricia and Stacey will learn new teaching methodologies for the delivery of French in the primary school and share good practice with other participants on the course. We hope that Patricia and Stacey return with new resources and ideas to embed French in the every day school routine and that this will, in turn, impact on the national drive to develop responsible, global citizens in Scotland. Importantly, in order to develop meaningful links and partnerships; we hope that this course provides Patricia and Stacey with the opportunity to create partnerships with French schools and teachers. This experience will not only equip Patricia and Stacey with the expertise in which to teach the target language to young learners but will also provide them with resources suitable for primary level. Patricia and Stacey's understanding of contemporary French culture will be widened and this will then be brought back to school and will influence their decision making when planning French events or curricular developments. We hope that this will particularly enhance Patricia and Stacey's knowledge of using ICT to teach and embed French language. This is a very exciting time in education and for Chatelherault Primary School with the introduction of the 1+2 Languages programme and the immersion project will enable Patricia and Stacey to take this forward within the school and the cluster area.
