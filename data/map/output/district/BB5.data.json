The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad by strengthing their skills in foreign languages, personal and professional competences hereby  improving their employablity at both the Danish and the European labour market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation at our colleges and to enhance internationalization sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad. For students the stays last 1 month,  for teachers typically 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Memorandum of Understanding / Letter of Intent to fulfil the demands of the project. However 4 of the educational stays for teachers will take place at new partners. The traning center at SOSU-Fyn has established contact to M\u00f8llehagen skolecenter in Stavanger, Norway. In the autumn of 2015 a group of teachers from Stavanger visited SOSU-Fynto obtain knowledge about how we work with rehabilitation and nursing and how we create learning activities that resembles situations at work. During the visit it became clear that SOSU-Fyn also can learn a lot from M\u00f8llehagen Skolecenter with regard to the mentioned areas, so we plan to sent 3 teachers to Stavanger. The fourth member of staff plans to go to Accrington and Rossendale College, UK, a relatively new partner. In February - March SOSU-Fyn will receive12 students and 2 acompanying teachers for practice placements at kindergartens from this college. The pedagogical coordinator at SOSU-Fyn, who will tutor these students, wants from an organizational perspective to investigate  how the college works with students in danger of dropping out. Secondly the coordinator wants to investigate the possibility for creating a virtual communcation platform for PA-students at SOSU-Fyn and students at Accrington College. In the comments to the Charter for our Consortium it was stated that some important points are missing: 1) more definite plans for our activities in the international strategies of our colleges 2) the frame and intentions for our work with receiving students and teachers form abroad for practice placments and staff traning  3) considerations about future demands for adding new partneres to our project. With regard to item 1 it is a topic that we will address  on our next meeting in the consortium. Here we will discuss how we in cooperation with our managers and principals can develop our international strategies in line with the European and Danish political objectives  . With regard to item 2 we  typically receive students and staff from colleges that have proven their ability to organize stays  with a high degree of quality for our students and members of staff  and we want to repay this in the same way. Furthermore the intention also is to give our students and members of staff a possiblity to exchange experiences about relevant topics an hereby enhance  the interest for and understanding of international activities in VET. Concerning item 3 it is a topic that we currently discuss. At our last meeting we concluded that right now, apart from M\u00f8llehagen Skolecenter and if possible another partner in Norway, since students that have difficulties with foreign languages are interested in going to Norway due to the similarity between Danish and Norwegian, we will not need new partners. This is also our estimation fwhen looking at the near future.  We also want to adjust the requests  for stays with us for students and teachers from our foreign partners with our capacity to organize these stays and at the moment we experience a significant increase in requests for practice placements for students and educational stays for teachers from our present partners abroad.", "http://www.accross.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022029_5"], [2015, "International Working Experience for Staff and Students, 2017-2017", "Accrington and Rossendale College", 132585.0, 11, 27, "The four Social and Health Care Colleges in Region Southern Denmark have for several years cooperated about student mobility within Leonardo and Erasmus+ programmes. In this project for 2015-2017 we also work together about staff mobility (Annex 1).\r\n\r\nFirstly student and staff mobility is an important part of the colleges' initiatives to strengthen the international perspective in our educations and an important contribution to make our educations attractive to future students. Secondly student and staff mobility is vital in order to profile our colleges as competent partners concerning international projects both in Denmark and Europe. The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad in order to strengthen their skills in foreign languages, personal and professional competences in order to improve their possibilities to become a part of the European labor market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation in both teaching and administration and to enhance internationalization at our colleges by sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad.\r\n\r\nThe project encompasses 102 social and health care students and child care students, 9 teachers and 1 administrative employee. The stays abroad will take place at relevant institutions. For the students the stays will last 1 month for members of staff the stays will last 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Letter of Intent to fulfill the demands of the project.\r\n\r\nThe sending organization is responsible for preparing the participants pedagogicaly, linguistically and culturally, making sure that the insurances and health insurances comply with the demands of the Erasmus+ programme. Furthermore the sending institution is responsible for transferring the grant from the Erasmus+ programme to the participants' accounts. The receiving organization is responsible for finding suitable practice placements to the students, organizing a programme to the members of staff that will fulfill their objectives, finding suitable accommodation, making sure that there will be a mentor at the practice placement to guide the students, providing a tutor from college that will support the students in obtaining their objectives and be available if the students need help in unexpected situations. \r\n\r\nFor the individual student it is expected that the learning outcome for the practice placement will be achieved and that the student will graduate in due course. It is furthermore expected that the students will improve their skills in foreign languages, develop their personal, vocational and intercultural competences and as result improve their possibilities to become part of the European labor market. With regard to the members of staff it is expected that they fulfill the objectives for their educational course and develop their intercultural competences in order to ensure a continuous positive development of the international perspective at our colleges contributing to fulfill the international strategies at our colleges.  As a result it is expected that the obtained knowledge and experiences will be reflected in a development of the teaching methods and administrative practices at our colleges. The participants (students and members of staff) are expected to share their knowledge and experiences with their colleagues and fellow students in order to contribute to the development of the international perspective of our colleges. If the management of our colleges consider it to be of relevance it is expected that the participants in meetings with our local and regional employers inform about their experiences in order to enhance the understanding of internationalization at our colleges and for the educations as such.\r\n\r\nIn a broader perspective it is expected that our participation in activities within the Erasmus+ programme will improve the participating colleges development of the international dimension in our educations. We also expect that the project will contribute to improve the relations between us and our European partners, so the four Social and Health Care Colleges appear as reliable and desirable partners for future projects with international scope.", "http://www.accross.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA102-004175_21"], [2014, "International Hotel, Food and Beverage Exchange Programme", "Accrington and Rossendale College", 95867.0, 5, 7, "JB Kompetens is a privately owend Hotel and Restaurant school that educates students within adult education.
