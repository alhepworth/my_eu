The approach encompasses a variety of different types of requirements, relating to security, airport operations and societal aspects. An ethical framework will be defined which enables designers and operators to proactively introduce ethical factors in the checkpoint. The project team will identify and develop requirements and criteria at integrated system level. A key element of the project is the development of a design tool that allows the design of innovative new CPs and modification of existing CPs to meet changing threats. A major challenge comprises a validated set of protocols and tools for evaluating and monitoring the performance of the CP at the overall system rather than component level. The approach will be demonstrated in two integrated demonstration CPs at two airports. The activities are focussed towards aviation security but may be extended to mass transportation and other applications.", null, 11526471.0, 8, 16, "XP-DITE", null, "http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/158335.jpg", "fp7_104801_954604452"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "THE MANCHESTER AIRPORT GROUP PLC*MAAG", 2830518.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_17"], [2017, "THE MANCHESTER AIRPORT GROUP PLC*MAAG", 147679.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_28160"]]}}}}
