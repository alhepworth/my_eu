Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy are an innovative class of non-destructive techniques providing an extreme sensitivity in diagnosing manufacturing defects such as porosity, component assembly contact conditions, and incipient damage in the form of microcracks,  delaminations, clapping areas, adhesive bond weakening, which are superior to what can be obtained with traditional NDTs.\nFollowing the automated -monitoring, the next natural logical scientific step lies in the development of material with in-situ \u201cwound\u201d healing, that will move the intrinsic limiting material boundaries encountered by aerospace manufacturers.\nClassical healing self-healing concepts are based on the embedment of hollow-fibers/microcapsules in the resin. A new potential class of self-healing materials can be introduced by adopting thermally reversible crosslinked polymers. This new class of polymers is capable of healing internal cracks through thermo-reversible covalent bonds formation.\nThis new approach eliminates the needs for additional ingredients such as catalyst, monomer. Moreover, these new healable resins have the built-in capability to restore mechanical properties several times through multiple cycles of healing. This allows multiple damages occurring at the same location to be \u201crepaired\u201d.\nThe goal of this project is to develop and build an autonomous modular system for monitoring and healing aircraft structures and demonstrate its efficiency in a life-cycle simulated environment starting from the production to the in-service loading.

There is a growing emphasis on \u2018housing-led\u2019 solutions, which involve promoting sustainable exits from homelessness into permanent housing as rapidly as possible. The Housing First service model for tackling long-term homelessness amongst people with complex support needs has been identified as an evidence-based innovation. In the above context, a shift is currently taking place in the EU, whereby homeless services increasingly focus on \u201cending\u201d rather than \u201cmanaging\u201d homelessness. There is a need for field workers to engage in continual training in order to help their clients efficiently. According to the experience of the Ways out of homelessness in Central Europe Erasmus+ strategic partnership, as well as own national data collection in Hungary, there is almost nothing in form of training offered to those working with homeless people moving into independent housing. Support workers learn as they go, often from their own mistakes \u2013 which also means that they might gather negative memories and be less enthusiastic to work with homeless people in real housing. Peer-support work or hiring experts with lived experience has been growing in the social sector, mostly in the area of substance abuse and less so in the field of homelessness. However, people who have experienced homelessness can offer support in a unique way as they have knowledge, skills and abilities that cannot be taught in courses. Still, to be able to work efficiently, as well as for their own protection, they need to acquire new knowledge, skills and abilities on how to support people.
