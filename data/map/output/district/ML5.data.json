The majority of participants will be resident in areas of multiple deprivation and face multiple, complex barriers such as lack of confidence, employability skills, linguistic skills and inexperience of traveling abroad. Activities will be managed by the External Funding and International Business Development Team and co-ordinated by a mobility Steering Group who will ensure consistency and equality of selection, preparation and support of participants. All participants will undertake a 2-3 week work placement in either France, Italy, Spain, Lithuania, Ireland or Malta. \r\n\r\nPlacements will be facilitated and supported by experienced and trusted host partner organisations who have worked in collaboration with the College for many years. As well as organisation of work placements, host partners are responsible for organisation of a holisitic package of support which includes cultural activities and linguistic training delivered whilst abroad.\r\n\r\nA range of results are anticipated as activities will make a positive and lasting impact on participants:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improved participant employability\r\n\u2022 Improved confidence, motivation and self-esteem\r\n\u2022 Improved levels of communication \r\n\u2022 Enhanced team working skills\r\n\u2022 Enhanced cultural awareness \r\n\u2022 Additional skills and qualifications gained whilst on placement\r\n\r\nA comprehensive process of monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the External Funding Team, in co-operation with faculty staff and participants to ensure that key milestones are met and anticipated outcomes and results achieved.Potential long-term benefits of this project include:\r\n\r\nIncreased number of participants successfully gaining employment on completion of their training programme\r\nBroken cycles of deprivation within the communities served by New College Lanarkshire\r\nImproved internationalisation of New College Lanarkshire", "http://www.nlleisure.co.uk", "New College Lanarkshire", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013101_4"], [2018, "Accueil des Allophones et Migrants", "North Lanarkshire Leisure", 136239.0, 10, 14, "The so-called ADAM Consortium of the local education authority of Strasbourg (Welcoming speakers of other languages and newly arrived migrants) is topically rooted in a context of an ever increasing number of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers across Europe in the last decade. Its objective is to identify ways to improve the education and inclusion of these students, to strengthen their skills in the language of the host country, to allow access to culture and facilitate employment, to better train teachers of French as a Second Language (FSL) and all teachers who participate in the inclusion of these students in regular curricula. \r\n \r\nThe consortium counts 24 members and cooperates with 13 international host institutions. Different profiles of staff are concerned by the inclusion of migrant pupils and students not speaking the language of the host country, and participate in the project: teachers involved in UPE2A \u2013 classes meant for newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, regular class teachers, senior management teams of schools and executives of the local education authority of Strasbourg, inspectors and pedagogical counsellors, \r\nproject managers of different departments of the local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe welcoming and training practices in Alsace are managed by the CASNAV - academic centre for the schooling of newly arrived students and students from traveling families - and can be enriched according to each situation - initiation, improvement, enhancement, broadening, diversification) by the expertise of our European partners and the devices they have put in place.\r\n \r\nThis is why the local education authority of Strasbourg has decided to set up a consortium to apply for an Erasmus + mobility project, in accordance with European values and its regional educational priorities: inclusion in schools, social integration, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality, employability of youngsters, fighting against school dropout and radicalization.\r\n \r\nThe host organizations were selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- diversity of their experiences in the field of welcoming migrants, refugees, asylum seekers not speaking the languages of the host countries, \r\n- situations in countries which are first faced with massive waves of migrants;\r\n- quality of the historical cooperation that binds them to the local education authority of Strasbourg\r\nTaking into account the destinations of the mobility and therefore the choice of the host partner for each delegation, the steering committee considered it relevant to take into account the matching with the teaching cycle, the level and the specialization of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to carry out 128 mobility for the staff of the whole education authority of Strasbourg according to 3 strategic levels:\r\n- level of institutional steering;\r\n- level of management of schools;\r\n- school level of EANA - newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country.\r\n \r\nThe activities will consist in work-shadowing lessons, shared teaching and exchanging of best practices, meetings with local, institutional or non-profit organization partners. They will cover the practical aspects of hosting migrants, teaching, methods and material, also the transmission of European values and access to culture and to different forms of artistic expression that are the roots of social cohesion and democracy as well as the education to citizenship.\r\n \r\nThe result of the mobility project will fuel an analysis and a reflection on transferable practices in our local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe eTwinning platform will be the tool of choice for the organization and communication of the project. This platform will serve as a means of exchanging, sharing and disseminating the results.\r\n \r\nThe expected impacts are at three levels:\r\n - academic steering and institutional management of welcoming migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country, \r\n- the management of schools in terms of welcoming strategy;\r\n- support of newly arrived pupils and students who have newly arrived in the class and their inclusion in the regular curricula.\r\n\r\nThe transferable practices that we have observed during the mobility will make it possible to improve the education of newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and their inclusion in the regular curricula to allow a fluent schooling and follow up of the newcomers in regular classes. To put it in a nutshell, all pupils and students with special needs will benefit from the results. \r\nGiven the current political and climatic trends, it is highly likely that the migration phenomenon towards Europe will keep increasing in the forthcoming years.

The stakeholders believe that this process can result in providing more possibilities for young people in Europe to get involved in sports and physical activities in a way that can also provide learning opportunities in relation to life competencies, social skills and well-being. With this aim in mind the concrete objectives of the activity will be targeted to sharing experiences and practices in ETS, identifying areas that need improvement or further development, experimenting and developing new methods of ETS, recording and disseminating the new methods (e.g. exercises, educational activities, etc) developed.

As such this partnership building seminar will be a milestone event in the process of developing and disseminating education through sport methodology in youth work and in sport for all. As a result of an initial long term training course for trainers for ETS and Physical Activities in 2012 a European informal network of experts and practitioners (supported by a Facebook community with 400 members) were founded and a specific pedagogic approach was designed and described. Members of this network of youth organisations and sport associations have been implementing several projects since 2012 that all contributed to improving the quality and diversity of youth work and youth projects in Europe. Throughout these activities members of the network developed the specific methodology of ETS and also published a Handbook Move and Learn.  A coalition of different partners from different sectors (formal education, youth work, sport) have decided to bring together a good mixture of partners for a Partnership Building Seminar in order to work together on a closer and more focused cooperation in order to bring the methodology to many young people and youth workers, PE teachers, sport coaches. The conditions of a stronger and more focused collaboration involving all three sectors and researchers will also be discussed, besides several youth projects that can also support the dissemination of the innovative approach. The Seminar will bring together 30 representatives of partner organisations for 5 days to see the potentials of cooperation and design youth projects and strategic partnership for the near future in order to reach many young people with the approach of Education through Sport in the coming few years.
