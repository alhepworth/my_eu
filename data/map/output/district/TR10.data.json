With one exception, each team is composed of four young people and their group leader. The exception comes from INPRO's side which will have one more participant who will have role of trainer and facilitator. The participants are youths between the ages of 18 - 30 years old and group leaders are without age limit. \r\n\r\nWithin each team, there will also be one participant with fewer opportunities. The participants are active members in their communities, they are volunteers and/or friends of partner organizations who have showed interest in understanding the current state of food production and that can shaped into a more sustainable system. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are as follows: \r\n\r\n- To raise awareness about participants\u2019 national policies towards food production and sustainability. And to show that there is a growing awareness among citizens about the disadvantages of mass-production of food, and that there is an increase of alternative food systems. Also, these new systems are sprouting from \r\n communication and organisation among citizens through grassroots initiatives. Participants will be invited to share good practices from their own communities with one another. \r\n\r\n- To question the mindset of participants towards their consumption of food. This project will help them realize the potential they have as consumers to influence the industries of food production. And to change their roles as passive consumers into active prosumers advocating for qualitative and sustainable products and protesting the unsustainable industrialization of agriculture. \r\n\r\n- To raise awareness about the twelfth Sustainable Development Goal (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns). And to invite participants to reflect on the 1.3 billion tonnes of food that are wasted every year, because of consumers and retailers bad practices, and spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting\r\npractices. \r\n\r\n- To foment a sense of community among participants through gastronomy, by looking at the similarities among their dishes. This will also invite participants to reflect on their own experiences with different culinary traditions, and how the term healthy living can have different meaning for each culture. Food in this case will be used as the main instrument to facilitate intercultural dialogue and promote diversity. \r\n\r\n- To inform participants about permaculture and give them an opportunity of experiencing the theory in practice. \r\n\r\n- To question the mindset of participants towards their consumption of food. \r\n\r\n- To invite participants to reflect on the 1.3 billion tonnes of food that are wasted every year.\r\n\r\nThe youth exchange programme meets the objectives of the project. Participants will take part in activities based on non-formal education methods such as role plays, discussions, brainstorming, team work, interactive games, etc. Participants will also play an active role in the preparation of the programme of the exchange. \r\n\r\nThis project is a chance for all stakeholders to learn something useful which will contribute to: \r\na. Revitalizing informal and non-formal education.\r\nb. Showing the importance of educating using creative ways and methods \r\nc. Showing pros of interactive and creative learning, cultural sensitivity teaching and dealing with youth current mattrers in an interactive inclusive way. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the project will be present in local media and through that, the movement of active citizenship will be present in Hora\u017e\u010fovice and Plze\u0148 Region as well. In international media each partner will also  take his role of multiplicator and share information about the project as well. This will stimulate similar organizations involved in formal and non-formal education to take up this topic more often and transmit to the young people openness and curiosity for accumulating new knowledge and for other cultures, people, and opinions.", "http://www.cultivatecornwall.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA105-047745_2"]]}}}}
