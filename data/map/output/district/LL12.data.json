This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners.

Discussions among teachers on issues concerning emerging new job profiles, new forms of work organization which affect training and educational needs and provision represent the main rationale of the project proposal. New emerging competencies and learning concepts, also taking into account the needs of microenterprises are required by both sectors: the traditional simple and repetitive tasks are evolved to multidisciplinary tasks in order to deliver more complex products and services.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. It takes independence, initiative and flexibility to work abroad. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad will involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment. The partnership brings together partners from different countries (IT,DE,NL,SLO,IE,UK,GR,ES,FR,DK,LT) and is built ad hoc to include the necessary expertise to successfully reach the goals of the project. Skills and competences are multidisciplinary and integrated in a consistent way with the tasks and phases of project development. Many of the partners already collaborated with CPV in other EU-funded projects thus developing a strong mutual trust. C.A.T.ER.P.I.LLA.R project is designated for 104 17-18 years old learners, attending the fourth year at vocational and technical upper secondary institutes. The schools involved, encompass a range of professional curricula: Tourism and Hospitality; Agriculture, Biotechnology, Winemaking.The methodological framework adopted in identifying and describing the main occupational profile \u2013 related units of LOs to be acquired/improved by learners built on: careful analysis of current study programmes and existing methods and practices developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and Consortium's members have been involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. Thus, the proposed model provides a \u201ccommon language\u201d for describing competences and their acquisition and offers a way to relate these competences to specific training programmes. The project will last 18 months and will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES (the work placement will last 30 days (travel excluded) and may include 2 days of induction. In the choice of work placement companies, the project partners will be supported by the E.R.M.E.S. database including more than 370 EU companies); Consortium and foreign partners will ensure an efficient mentoring and supervision arrangements of mobile participants through monitoring documents, monitoring visits by tutors; FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities.The project seeks to have significant impacts not just through the mobilities which the project will naturally promote but also by focusing on the sustainability of the multilateral ties that will ensure. By offering work-based vocational education and training in another country, the primary expected impact of the mobility experience on the participants is a direct and measureable improvement in their professional competencies and work-related skills. Other personal and social impact include: development of language, ICT and teamwork skills; increased intercultural awareness; increased level of independence, confidence and open mindedness.As to the participating organisations, the impact will include: -exposure to work-based learning practices in other EU countries; - development of openness and cooperation with schools from other countries; - strengthening of the EU dimension to the Consortium members\u2019 activities; - improvements in VET methods, systems and processes, development of interdisciplinary approaches.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005083_21"], [2016, "ENHANCED EMPLOYABILITY THROUGH WORK-BASED LEARNING", "COLEG CAMBRIA", 248037.0, 3, 22, "We would like to carry out this project to further support the INTERNATIONALISATION STRATEGY of our institution, that has beensuccessfully offering VET transnational mobility experience since 2006.The vocational areas chosen are Engineering -(Aircraft Manufacturing, Welding) , Hospitaliy and Catering - Professional Cookery,Agriculture, Hairdressing that are priority areas of the College, the 4 sectors being also strategic areas defined by the Welsh Assembly.The BENEFICIARIES are 170 IVT students in total with the following breakdown:- Flow: F, student:s, accompanying staff:a.c.; F1: 15 Welding s. + 2 a.c. ;10 aerospace s + 2 a.c.

According to Eurostat, in fact, in 2013 early school leaving accounted for 12%, the average rate of NEET aged 15-24 reached 13.1% in 2012 while the youth unemployment rate was 22.9% in the EU28 in Feb.2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad scope of \u2018Mobile Learning in VET towards 2020\u2019 (Mo.L.VET 2.0.20) is foster m-learning pedagogy, to help reducing early school leaving, decreasing the number of 15-year-olds under-skilled, contributing to the development of the so-called 21st century skills such as ICT literacy, collaborating, communicating, creativity, problem solving and ultimately to support modernization of education and training systems (responding to Europa 2020 as well as Erasmus+ goals). The underlying rationale of Mo.L.VET 2.0.20 is that mobile-learning pedagogy and tools are a key lever for more effective learning and to reducing barriers to education and training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents attending training at partner organisations are often disaffected towards formal education and activities, live in troubled families, may have already experienced failure in school, score worse performances, risk more to be excluded from the labour market and the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMo.L.VET 2.0.20 concerns FORMAL LEARNING with the aim of complying with official education/training curricula; nonetheless, mobile devices allow ubiquitous access to learning contents, outside the school too, and open up learning to new contexts and experiences. This is a challenge for both the students and the teachers who have to plan and facilitate these processes. The innovative aspect of the project\u2019s approach is letting trainers/teachers and learners become CO-PRODUCERS of contents and tools and not only USERS; Mo.L.VET 2.0.20 aims at rebuilding the concept of formal learning and PEDAGOGY.

It also contributed to the increased sense of belonging to the school community and to the sense of identity of the School.\r\nPursuing the implementation of the Internationalization Strategy, and taking into account the increase in the number of students at school, as well as the excellent results achieved, we intend to maintain the activities developed in the previous application, extending the possibility that more students from the 1st and 2nd years of the professional courses may participate in mobilities, which favour the contact with the realities of other schools/ training centres from European countries.\r\nThus, the GPS-5 project foresees the execution of three types of activity, addressed to all the elements of the school community, and to be carried out according to the planned schedule:\r\nA1 - 25 mobilities (5 flows/ 5 groups/ 5 students) for the 12th grade students (55 days for the development of practical training in companies) in partner institutions from Spain, Malta, Italy and Austria; and 6 mobilities of 150 days in companies for graduate students, in partner institutions from Spain, Italy and Poland;\r\nA2 - 50 mobilities of 16 days for periods of training in schools/ training centres abroad for the 1st year students (30 students) and the 2nd year (20 students) from professional courses in partner organizations from the United Kingdom, Croatia, Austria, Poland and Finland;\r\nA3 - 10 staff training mobilities abroad with partner organizations from Greece, Spain, Cyprus, and Finland.\r\nThe increase in the number of mobilities in A2 aims not only to respond to the students\u2019 requests, but essentially to promote educational success, increase the motivation levels for the school/ professional journey and thus fight against school dropout among young people from disadvantaged socio-economic contexts. With the previous participation of the 1st year students in mobilities, there has been an improvement in the levels of students performance, in terms of attendance, behaviour and reduction of modules left to do. It has also increased the number of applicants seeking the school just because it provides learning opportunities beyond the traditional classroom/ workshop context.\r\nSince most of these students are under 18, we consider it essential to include in each flow a teacher who will accompany them throughout the mobility period. In the case of A1, where there is also a large number of underage students who have never been abroad, the monitoring of a teacher in the first week of mobility is of the utmost importance in order to support the students\u2019 integration in the social, cultural and labour context.\r\nThe changes in the partnerships are related to the change of our courses, and we tried to adapt the flows and the labour contexts to the profile of the courses and to the participants themselves. In the selection of the partners, we took into account the training areas of the groups involved so that the participants could observe and compare the educational and formative realities of the countries involved.\r\nIn the longer period mobilities, the official language of the host country was also taken into account, so that the language barrier would not be an obstacle to the efficient performance of the planned activities/ tasks. The selection criteria for participants will remain identical to those of previous projects, always bearing in mind the equal opportunities concerning gender and special educational needs. They also assure that any student wishing to participate in a mobility can be selected. \r\nThe GPS 5 project still includes both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the different activities, as well as the internal and external dissemination of the good results, so as to enrich and share good practices.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA116-035423_11"], [2015, "\u201cUs\u201d and \u201cThem\u201d: dialog, tolerance, collaboration for good coexistence in a multicultural world!", "COLEG CAMBRIA", 167447.0, 8, 8, "Migration Policy Institute\u2019s report \u201cMulticulturalism: Success, Failure and the Future\u201d (Feb. 2012) draws upon Multiculturalism Policy Index: \u201c[\u2026] multiculturalism in the West emerged as a vehicle for replacing old forms of ethnic and racial hierarchy with new relations of democratic citizenship, and there is some significant, if not yet conclusive, evidence that it is making progress toward the goal\u201d.\r\nPreliminary analysis made by us showed that in Europe exist many ethnicities, each country hosting national and immigrant minorities.

For this activity the school kept the partners for the students \u2018trainings from the Renewable Energy courses, Automobile Mechatronics and Socio and cultural Animation and sought a new partner for the course of Metalworking Production, as it is the 1st time we will have trainings in this area. For each gflow, we included an accompanying teacher, who will stay with the students during the 1st week and help them to integrate in the companies, the culture and group environment. Most of these students are under 18 and travel abroad for the first time.For the A2 activity, we kept the work plan for graduate students, so as to carry out a 150-day mobility in companies. Comparing to the year before, we reduced the number of mobilities from 8 to 6, since we will have a lower number of graduate students this year. For this activity, we kept the same partners, considering the good performance shown. However, and bearing in mind the previous experience, we believe it would be very helpful for them to have a teacher to do the monitoring and integration in this period of mobility. We realized that many students would even like to try this European experience, but they end up quitting as they are afraid of going alone and without the support of a teacher.In 2015 we started to organize the mobility for the 10th grade students to provide them a period of training in schools / training centers abroad, so as to prevent failure and dropout, and to increase their motivation to attend professional courses and their language learning. Both students and parents reacted very positively to the innovative proposal, which registered a high level of interest. So, for this A3 activity, we decided to keep the same number of mobilities (total of 30, divided into 3 flows). In what concerns the selection of partners, we took into account the targeted training areas in reference schools. Since these students are under 18, we included in each flow, a teacher who will accompany them throughout the whole period of mobility.For all the participating students, we will work on the validation of training modules according to the ECVET and provide support on the award of the Europass document.In what concerns the staff - A4 activity,  we foresee to organize 10 mobilities. We increased both the number of flows and partners to cover different training realities and to enhance enriching experiences for the participants, which will surely be useful for their professional performance in CIOR.In summary, the application proposal provides a total of 81 mobilities among 4 types of activity to be held during the year 2016/2017, according to the start and end dates of the project, 61 of these mobilities are for students, 11 mobilities are for accompanying teachers and 10 mobilities are planned for the professional development of Staff.

The project aims at identifying the needs of the fields that use welded structures concerning the expert welder\u2019s skills and knowledge that are necessary to meet the requirements related to the execution of welded joints in compliance with the provisions of the relevant standards in force.he European market of welded structures is a growing market with a turnover amounting to over Euro 2 billion a year, and has approximately 2 million employees. The products that are obtained by welding may be used in various fields of activity starting with personal use products until industrial use products, with the products used in the energy or petro-chemical field until the products used in the medical, military and aerospace field. The intense development of this part of the industry in various areas of Europe led to the need for the relocation of the personnel that specializes in this field. In order to be able to carry out welded joints in various European countries, the expert welder should comply with the requirements of various certification bodies approved by the client. Thus, an expert welder with a certain qualification that is tested in his country of origin needs most of the times to prove his abilities in the country he is relocated in according to the requirements of the labor market.The project aims at developing a work platform that should offer the possibility to develop the knowledge, competences and skills of the target group in the welding process and technology field of the personnel in the specialized industry.More specifically, the project aims to achieve its goald through 4 objectives:     OBJ1. developing a European qualification of the European Expert in Welding Technologies (eu-WELD) with certification at ECVET level     OBJ2. creating a competence profile required by a European Expert in Welding Technologies     OBJ3. developing a training course for the European Expert in Welding Technologies; within the course there will be a special procedure to assess previous knowledge of existing workers in the welding field or knowledge obtained through any kind of prior working experience (formal, informal or non-formal learning) (using ECVET points); the training course will also be offered using innovative e-learning technologies     0BJ4. developing guidelines for the certification of organizations willing to provide the eu-WELD training course; this includes the application of ECVET to qualifications.The partnership includes different stakeholders involved in education and training and brings together 1 company with main activity in welding industry (P2-RO), 1 welding institute (P4-SI), 3 universities (P1, P5, P6 - RO,HU,GB) and 1 private-sector consulting firm engaging in education and training (P3-MT).

On the other hand, pedagogical participants have an opportunity to acquire new information and knowledge about their area of tuition, grow professionally, improve the visibility and recognition of their qualification and optimize the abilities gained in informal education. The project is aimed at supporting the cooperation at high level of quality, with special emphasis on model and method exchange, as well as exchange of common criteria and principles for ensuring high value of vocational tuition and preparation.\r\n\r\nIn total 94 project participants will travel abroad, of which 72 are students at initial technical preparation, 12 are teachers as accompanying persons/mentors and 10 are teachers of the technical subjects. The project implementation is divided into 7 intervals in the period from May 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. The teachers involved in project are employees of the Secondary School Handlov\u00e1, who teach or create content for the technical subjects. Teachers are full of enthusiasm and motivation for involvement into reforms resulting in education improvements. The second target group the project is aimed at are students of technical fields of study and bilingual business academy. Students have already acquired basic knowledge during their ongoing education on technical subjects and vocational training. Students that will be sent to Coleg Cambria, will either undergo an intensive course of English language improvement or will expand their knowledge and practical skills of working with digital equipment on web and graphic design. On the other hand, the students that will be chosen for SOUE Plze\u0148 will take part in a practical training in Automatization workshops, Measuring and Electronics workshops and Digital technology workshops. Finally, the students that will visit the partner school ISS Sokolnice will verify their skills in energetics and heavy-current conduit workshops as well as in the Lifelong Learning Centre.\r\n\r\nProject will support expansion of multicultural dialog and mutual tolerance. It will contribute to the increasing creativity and competition among students from different educational systems and cultures.  SO\u0160 Handlova, as a project proposer, expects a smooth course of individual stages and acquired benefits in all targeted groups of students and teachers. Due to the obtained international educational experience, credit of all participants will be reinforced. Based on the teachers' recommendations, we plan to innovate the Scholar educational program and selected curricula. We will explore the new opportunities and sources for acquiring new equipment for vocational classrooms and their modernization. We will rely on wealth of experience from our partner organizations.

This idea should strengthen the professional education in the field of theoretical teaching and mainly of vocational training. In year 2015, SO\u0160 Handlova signed the Memorandum of cooperation with employers of the region Horn\u00e1 Nitra. This document is the commitment for employers to provide professional training for chosen students.  This cooperation is only in its early stage and the school has problems to provide vocational training for students in their fields of study.  Therefore we use the possibilities of the Erasmus+ programme and the benefits of the Charter for vocational education and training.  Within these programmes we would like to ensure the quality of students` vocational training, professional development of teachers and masters of vocational training.In the period of project \u2013 from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017 \u2013 we want to realize 9 turns, what means 73 persons for mobilities (including 17 teachers or masters of vocational training). The main objectives for both groups are education in international schools, improvement of professional and language competences and individual professional development of participants. The aim of students \u2018internship is to increase their applicability on the European labour market, to acquire new professional skills, to strengthen language competences, to support  informal learning, to acquire experiences and information  about  educational system and way of life of foreign countries during staying in visiting country. The aim of internship for teaching staff is professional development, possibility to acquire new information and knowledge in their fields, to improve the acceptance of qualification and skills acquired by informal learning. It is necessary to prepare teachers for their professions as well as possible. Their teaching methods should correspond with new technologies, technical tools and new ways of teaching. This project supports cooperation with emphasize on methods and models\u2018exchange. It also supports the exchange of principles and common criteria for quality in vocational training and education.  Finally, we want to improve the quality of school, to spread its goodwill and support its competitiveness among schools in our region. Our project is focused on third-year students of Bilingual business academy, Mechatronics, Digital media graphic designer, Technical lyc\u00e9e and Mechanic of computer networks who have enough professional knowledge needed for vocational training. We have supposed 36 mobilities for year 2016 in Strategy of internationalisation. We would like to form several groups of students of these departments with the best learning results. It allows us to get a new partner \u2013 Tallin Polytechnic School. Students will be accompanied by pedagogical staff, because some of them are under 18 and their parents require supervision, too. Accompanying persons will fulfil the role of professional mentors, too. We planned 4 mobilities for teachers, but now we want to extend number of mobilities for them because of their interests in new professional knowledge and in increasing of language competences.  We plan to realize 17 mobilities for teachers in 4 turns. These activities will be focused on watching (comparison of curriculum, school systems, organization of lessons), on experiences gaining, on masterclasses and on using of new technologies during lessons. Professional content of internship is specified in Letters of intent signed by all partners. They are attached to this application form.We want to extend time for internship because of students` reports from previous projects. New internships should be one week longer than previous ones. Students of Bilingual business academy should have four-week internship and students of other departments should have two-or-three-week internship.

We will produce and publish the results in an interactive e-book for teachers and trainers at primarily secondary and tertiary educational level. We have identified three areas where we can gain from working together across the borders:To develop new teaching methods:The traditional way of thinking teaching - one teacher/one subject/one lesson/one classroom is not always appropriate when taking into account the diversity among our young learners. This diversity is not only concerning the different academic levels of the learners, but also factors like cultural background and state of readiness to learn play a central role when organizing the lessons. Another significant reason to the diversity is the fact that the educational institutions, due to political requirements, over the years have been accepting an increasing number of students; on numerous accounts without regarding the different levels mentioned above.  Studies of individualized learning such as individual leaning styles e.g. have shown how efficient this approach is and we will base our cooperation on this knowledge. Furthermore, we will base our cooperation and intellectual outcomes on observations of educational institutions being front riders in this field. We will add new ways of organizing the teaching strategies and lessons taking into account the students' backgrounds and to meet the requirements concerning collegial cooperation, project work, as well as a more optimal or better use of teacher resources. Thus, we look for changes in the teaching role.To ensure a manageable study environment by creating an application-oriented training:Reorganization of teaching strategies and lessons should not involve a more complex every day student life or more complex technical requirements than the institutions are used to. Thus, we want to work with application-oriented training to ensure this. We will scrutinize various ways of working application-oriented and point out the most efficient methods. This will include academic seminars, teacher shadowing, surveys, and cooperation with local businesses for example cooperation with local media and tourism organizations. To ensure retention, inclusion, and completion:Of course, this is indirectly comprised in the above paragraphs, but we want to develop specific strategies for how we can ensure a safe and collaborative learning environment for particularly students with less favourable background including migrants and refugees. We will exchange best practice strategies and develop next best practice for subjects like e.g. coaching, social events and field trips.The desktop research carried out by all educational partnering institutions prior to the first transnational meeting and the presentations of local and national pedagogical and didactical methods to enhance student retention, success and completion will form the base for the observation grid. At this Kick-off meeting, the participants will determine which of the presented issues to grab and of which we have to be aware. These determinations and the theory based knowledge of teaching methods, strategies, and experiences from primarily the involved countries will be elaborated and transformed into measurable paragraphs to be used at observations in Wales and Finland.     Observations of lessons at Coleg Cambria and Axxell and interviews with pedagogical staff and management and theory based knowledge of teaching methods, strategies, and experiences from primarily the involved countries. By including one of the most experienced Danish publishing houses regarding creating interactive e-books we have ensured both didactical and technical expertise for this project.  Furthermore, the University of Lower Silesia is highly experienced in the above-mentioned areas as well as in processing collected data. We therefore believe that the diversity of the competences within this partner group will ensure quality products. We also believe that a cooperation across EU boarders will strengthen the project products, as we will have a diverse pedagogical and didactical view and assess to differently structured teaching and learning methods and strategies.  To frame the project qualitatively, we will develop an observation grid and questionnaires to be used by all partnering educational institutions at observations and interviews at Coleg Cambria and Axxell.

In the school year 2017/18 we have planned the mobility for teachers of electro-technical subjects. We have noticed the labour shortage of this branch on the labour market but the interest in electro technical industry has been gradually increasing. We want to link the project Erasmus with other our project - the Centre of vocational training and education for electro technology, which is currently being prepared. The content and form of teaching have to meet with requirements of quality, technical facilities, new technologies and new teaching methods. But there are also some essential aspects - the management of the school, improvement the quality of school, spreading its goodwill and the competitiveness in the region.  School management`s mobility will be focused on these aims. We expect successful implementation of the Centre of vocational training and education and its use in cooperation with project partners.\r\nWe would like to realize 7 turns with 60 pupils and 6 teachers. The common aims of both groups are learning in the international schools, to improve vocational and language competences. The aims of pupils \u2018internship are to enhance their applicability on the European labour market, to acquire new vocational knowledge, to strengthen the language competences, to promote non-formal learning, to gain experiences from staying in foreign country, to gain information about the way of education, work and life in the country of the project partner. \r\nMobility will be prepared for the third-year students of Bilingual business academy, Mechatronics, Mechanic of computer networks, Digital media graphic designer and Technical Lyceum. These students already have enough professional knowledge necessary for professional practice. Mobility will be realized in the centres for vocational training or in special workrooms of our partners. They will be accompanied by the excursions in manufacturing plants according to the focus of each turn. For students of business academy, our partner at Coleg Cambria will also provide the practice in some enterprises focused on trade and services.\r\nThe students will be accompanied by the pedagogical staff, because some of them are not adults. Accompanying persons will fulfil the role of a professional mentor as well as they will be the part of the work programme. Pedagogical supervision will be carried out continuously for 24 hours a day. But in some situations their presence will not be needed - during the work of pupils when the responsibility will be assumed by the tutors of the recipient organization. Accompanying persons are responsible for the safe transfer from or to professional internship. They will monitor the mobility of students and communicate with the management of the Erasmus project. They also prepare documents for the publicity of professional internships (photos, articles, presentations) and cooperate with the project manager for publicity within the dissemination of the project results. All participants of the project will have contract about the financial support, they will have a daily work program and they will sign the commitment of quality.\r\nThe internship is specified in Letters of intent signed by partners which are enclosed to the application. We will cooperate with  our best partners in the project: Coleg Cambria Wrexham, the United Kingdom, Polytechnikum Tallinn, SSEE Sokolnice, SOUE Plze\u0148, the Czech Republic. The school management is in contact with all partners from previous projects.

The BFS Grafenau, the teachers and instructors of both schools as well as those of the taking up institution, the Coleg Cambria are further involved in Wrexham/Wales. The institution will also provide for lodging, catering and training period mediation. The need arises from the fact that the students must finish several training periods during their education by which one is planned as a foreign training period. Within the scope of this project a 3-week stay should take place for approximate 40 participants who come from the BFS Grafenau as well as from the bath BFS W\u00f6rishofen between May and June, 2015 and in 2016 in the college in Wrexham which serves, among the rest, to cover this foreign training period. \r\n\r\nFurthermore the students will have contact in their later working life in the tourism or Hotelleriebranche with guests from abroad.

PARTNERSHIPThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. The first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this project.Due to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP.LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2015 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner.2. NEEDS Based upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 8 flows spanning 2 years, from 2016 until 2018, for 120 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLOWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. The linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities.3. OBJECTIVESFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2016 until 2087, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the  vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding.Hence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. On the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 8 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2016 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2016 bidding session.4. OUTCOMESThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market.5.

The risk factors our school students are exposed to (rural origin in more than 50 %, the economic crisis in the area, family problems, the belonging to a region facing a high unemployment rate, labor market trends, etc. . ) require the development of skills that facilitate the transition from school to work, especially entrepreneurial and career management ones.\r\n\r\nAs a result of attending the training program, the teachers participating at practical training sessions in prestigious training institutions will improve and introduce innovative teaching methods, will settle the latest tools to achieve optimal training of students in the school; they will develop entrepreneurial skills in training activities for high school and vocational school students by attending a training program in which students will be actively involved and aware of their own training and instruction.\r\n\r\nStudents participating in mobility training program will benefit from a competent mentorship and will develop activities that determine their professional development as well as the improving of their entrepreneurial skills which will make them more competitive in the labor market and will increase their accountability and adaptability .\r\n\r\nMobilities will run for 5 days for 8 teachers and 14 days for each of the three streams of 9 students and an accompanying teacher each; partners agreed on mobility programs and content that will be addressed as well as on measures for monitoring and evaluation.

PARTNERSHIP\r\nThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. \r\nThe first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this new project. \r\nDue to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. \r\nGRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2014 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner. \r\n2. NEEDS \r\nBased upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 10 flows spanning 2 years, from 2015 until 2017, for 150 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO. \r\nWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. \r\nThe linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities. \r\n3. OBJECTIVES \r\nFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2015 until 2017, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding. \r\nHence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. \r\nOn the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 10 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2015 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2015 bidding session. \r\n4. OUTCOMES\r\nThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market. \r\n5. COMPOSITION AND TIMESPANS OF FLOWS \r\nAn overall number of 150 vocational students/apprentices (see qualifications below) are planned to be sent out to COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - LLANDRILLO COLLEGE, grouped in 5 separate flows each. The following student flows, having the qualifications as below, are planned:\r\na.

Internships of students and teachers have become the part of education, they have significant contribution to the knowledge and skills acquisition in the field of information and communication skills, electrical engineering, they improved the linguistic facilities and cultural-social horizon.\r\nIn this project \"Improving the quality of vocational training\", we again want to take advantage of our previous project partners, and to offer our students and teachers modern equipped workplaces and possibilities to get new experience in their fields.\r\nIn the school year 2018/19 we are planning to realize five turns within the activity A1. They are for students of various departments (Mechanic-mechatronic, Mechanic of PC networks, Technical lyce\u00e9, Digital media graphic designer and Business academy \u2013 bilingual study). Our aim is to offer these internships to the best students of each department.

The internship is intended mainly to students of departments number 26-electrical engineering. The students will acquire new knowledge about alternative energy sources, they gain skills in connecting cables of low-tension and high voltage and information about photovoltaic systems. In our school we should build the Centre for vocational education and training till 2019. Till this year we have to use specialized vocational classrooms of our partner school in Sokolnice.  \r\nStudents of technical departments, mainly mechanic-mechatronic, use the internship for acquisition of new competences in the field of automatization, robots programming, modern buildings, camera systems, intelligent wiring, and modern electronic systems. We have only some basic panels for students which are used for residential installations. We will use simulation equipment for camera systems and intelligent building in the partner school in Plze\u0148 (2nd turn activity A1).\r\nMechanics of PC networks and students of Technical lyce\u00e9 will be preferred for internship to school Polytechnikum Tallinn. They will improve their knowledge in vocational subjects focused on IT and PC systems (3rd turn activity A1)\r\nStudents of Business academy- bilingual study will be the biggest group. They will attend ESOL \u2013 the course of English, many specialized lectures from the field of entrepreneurship and tourism. Students will create their own promotional materials. The main aim of this group is to improve the language and to prepare for exams of level \u201eC\u201c CEFR (4th turn activity A1). \r\nSpecialized classrooms and studios of the school Coleg Cambria will be used for students of our department - Digital media graphic designer. Students will acquire new skills and knowledge about various art techniques, they will use creativity and imagination. The internship will be supplemented by taking photos of interior and exterior, processing of photos and collage creation (5th turn activity A1)\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents of the third year will take part in internship because they have enough specialized knowledge which is necessary for the internship. Mobility will be realized in centres for  vocational  training, in the specialized workplaces, and the language classrooms of our partners. They will be supplemented by excursions in interesting companies, students will visit significant regional and historical areas.\r\nThe students will be accompanied by pedagogical staff because some of them aren\u2019t adults and their parents insist this supervision.

The initiators of the project already saw the advantages of implementing this model in UK schools, considering this model ( the only known model for VET schools) as an opportunity to respond to the needs and interests of school, of teachers and of students. The Yale Model is based on a few simple, easy to apply principles, but unknown for Romanian teachers. Everything is about a real need to RE-form the school, to pass from formalization to education, to convert school reactivity in school proactivity and, most important, to bring educational excellence by passing from imposed teaching-learning to the pleasure of teaching-learning. There will be a number of 30 participants, teachers of all kind, from Valeriu Braniste Technical College. There will be a number of 3 flows, each flow with a number of 10 persons. The project doesn't want to limit to the applicant, there is a vision that the participants will become teaching-learning experts for other schools and trainers for other teachers from Lugoj and all over Romania.\r\nThe training programme includes theoretical activities ( classes) and practical activities (learning by seeing, learning by observing, learning by doing, learning from own experience).

Also, there will be a professional, social and personal progress for students. CT V Braniste will become a centre for implementing this educational alternative which will generate the success of any kind.

It is under the rules of the catholic organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V.\u201c which is a recipient of institutions for children and youth services, vocational training and hospitals. For both, the private academy for special education and the Katholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge Augsburg, it is a concern to educate and train well-qualified professionals of social work for the European labor market. On the other hand they want to get well-qualified professionals for their own areas of responsibility and to get their offered jobs occupied.\r\n\r\nBy the increasing mobility within Europe former trainees und students request the private academy for special education to describe and confirm the skills acquired in their training in order to obtain the recognition of their formal training abroad and get proper access to the labor market at their trained level and according to their degree. At the same time the organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V.\u201c and their institutions get more and more applications of foreign professionals. The employability of them is difficult, because their testimonials, degrees  and certifications are scarcely comparable to the local requirements. \r\n\r\nIn  discussions with our Europe partners there are inquiries how interested young people can have access to education and training abroad according to the different levels of education in different European countries and according to their level of certification and testimonials after school. Here, too, the private academy for special education is asked again to identify the conditions of access to training and education,  to register the similarities and differences and to develop the necessary educational modules for conformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to this topics it is the question how to accomplish quick and easy acceptation of the access to training requirements, the recognition of different certifications and degrees and the necessarity of post-qualification educational offerings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this project and the  conversations with the staff of the social work field it is aimed to  get to know the professions and work fields within social and health care and special education. Another outcome of this project is to identify the training courses and their conditions of access, to compare them and to analyse the differences and similarities. According to these results it is a possibility for all project partners to develop qualifiying education moduls ( possibly by another project) in order to get mutual recognition and therefor access to the labor market in European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the project it is also intended to get to know the professions which can be compared to those within the working field for special needs in Germany and their fields of special functions, duties and activities in our partner countries. In conclusion to this we can compare the level of  management for these professions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it should be a result of this project to recognize forms of vocational training for the profession  which ist comparable to the German \u201eHeilp\u00e4dagoge\u201c ( edcuational staff for special needs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of lifelong learning in this project it is also intended to faciliate the permeability between the post-secondary and tertiary education qualifications between the countries. According to the linguistic and cultural varity in an open Europe the project helps to strenghten the intercultural and linguistic competences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three participants of the project are responsible for training issues of the Katholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge der Di\u00f6zese Augsburg e. V. The head of the academy for special education organizes the vocational training according to the contents and methods. The Manager of the Department for Organization and Development has to coordinate training and staff development for all employees within the organization \u201eKatholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge Augsburg\u201c. The head of Department for all schools ( vocational schools and special schools) is responsible for planning and coordination of the staff development for all professionals working in these schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy visits, internships and intensive discussions with the staff of the partner organizations ( vocational training institutions and schools, institutions within social and health care and institutions within the field of special needs) participants and partners of this project get to know different access requiries, training contents und training degrees and certificates, learn more about the competences needed in the fields of practice and are able to compare.\r\n\r\nA long-term benefit is the mutual recognition of education and an expansion of permeability in the European labor market in relation to the working field of special education.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000499_6"]]}}}}
