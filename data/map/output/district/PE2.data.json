Organisations like PACO Ltd, provide marginalised groups with learning opportunities in Community Radio Production to enhance their employability skills, gain recognised qualifications , provide guidance on education and improve their social skills. Many researchers believe that \u201cknowledge is constructed by humans through social interaction. Education, therefore, should be based in learning communities where teachers and students act interdependently to construct meaning and understanding\u201d (Cross, 1998). The best learning communities are places where students are connected through meaningful conversations in cooperative groups with each other and with teachers.\r\nPACO Ltd recognised the integrated and linked learning opportunities, diverse forms of experiential learning (Social Circus Skills), and collaborative research projects (Backpackers Journalism) as powerful and effective strategies for deepening learner preparation for a knowledge-intensive society and increasing the ability to persist and succeed at higher levels of achievement.\r\nThis project aims to provide trainers with the opportunity to act as a resource to exchange innovative ways of community engagement.

Combating hate speech is a serious issue nowadays. We are witnessing it very often, especially online, where people can express their opinions anonimously. Even though the EU and international organizations act towards eliminating it, some countries such as Lithuania, Germany Spain, UK, Turkey and Italy still have many problems with that.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nIn order to tackle this, youth organizations from the mentioned countries have united for this project. The main aim is to raise social awareness of hate speech & show participants how to tackle that. The mobility of youth workers \"Time to Make Love Speech\" (13/11/2017-19/11/2017) will have 30 participants (5 youth workers per country). Priority will be given to those who have knowledge & are motivated about eliminating hate speech.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe main objectives of our project are: (1) to strengthen youth workers' knowledge about hate speech, human rights education & legal tools, (2) to create new solutions for preventing hate speech, (3) to learn about \"Love Speech\", (4) to spread the idea to the wider audience, (5) to show participants how they can effectively protect victim's rights. \r\n\r\nThe project will also give the youth workers tools, skills & knowledge about possible ways of creating their own movement against hate speech & will show how to popularize human rights education among other people, as well as how to eliminate hate speech from usual life.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, a range of NFE methods developed by all the partner organisations will be employed. Involvement, creativity & initiative of all the youth workers will be encouraged throughout the activities, which will include: 1) interactive presentations about No Hate Speech Movements, international policies related to hate speech; 2) info session how to create your own movement; 3) interactive plays/scenes with hate speech against target audiences; 4) preparing materials with love speech; 5) making love speech actions & materials visible in the city of Kaunas; 6) brainstorming of ideas to create solutions against hate speech, 7) \"Free Hugs\" Flashmob; 8) public debate; 9) include ice-breaking & teambuilding through socialising games 10) reflection time, 11) writing articles, creating promotional materials; 12) dissemination of the results by using those promotional materials, organizing workshops on the topic in partner countries; 13) methodology will be prepared by the participants from all partner organizations.\r\n\r\nThe materials from each of the activities will be documented Online & published through specially created project Online platform (social media and web). Participants will also contribute with their articles on key project topics. Media will be involved to spread the information further. All of this will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations & other target groups (media & wider public, e.g. students, teachers) in regional, national and international levels.\r\n\r\nEnvisaged impact for participants:\r\nYouth workers will understand the concept of human rights, fundamental freedoms & what human rights seek to ensure. At the same time simultaneously grasping intricate topics such as the discrimination of women, LGBT people, different religions, different ethnic groups, refugees and foreigners. They will become familiar with theoretical framework about hate speech & more socially aware. They will be able to use their knowledge in their work with youth and transfer it further.\r\n\r\nResult dissemination:\r\nFor the programme to be effective & reach as many people as possible, we all plan to prepare related offline & online materials, as well as create website and social media pages for \u201cTime to Make Love Speech\u201d, where we will publish all activities done during the project as well as prepared materials (videos, pictures, articles, brochures). In addition, during & after the project, the media will be invited to cover the main activities of the training course (e.g. public debate on hate/love speech). Also press releases will be sent out to different media by all participating organizatons to disseminate the results further.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits:\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help the youth workers to enhance their skills and knowledge, but also to increase general public\u2019s awareness of the existing problems of hate speech, racism, and discrimination and to inspire actions towards decreasing it, thus, creating long-term benefits.

Reducing this will be important if Europe is to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets, reduce its excessive reliance on imported energy and the decrease costs to households and industry. The most effective way to decentralise energy production is to increase the amount of generation at source, in this case within the home. A common barrier to the adoption of most energy saving technologies is the high initial investment cost which results in long payback periods considering current energy prices. However, with prices on the rise, existing technologies such as solar thermal heating systems and heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. Although both are reasonably efficient, existing solar thermal heating systems generally only provide up to 60% of a typical household\u2019s annual hot water demand. Air source heat pumps are more effective and can provide up to 100% of total household heating requirements but their performance decreases significantly in winter and they suffer from frost-build up. As these technologies are becoming commodity products, SME\u2019s in these markets are coming under increasing pressure from cheap and often unreliable imports from Asia.  It is therefore paramount that European SME\u2019s keep a technological edge over these competitors.

For some, the option of a vocational career is imposed because of the difficulties they face in general education subjects including foreign languages. Teachers are often faced with the problem of motivation. Through the mobility abroad, this European curriculum is a means of involving these students in a mobilizing project which enables them to acquire skills and autonomy that are necessary for their success.\r\n\r\nOur project\r\nWe are applying for 20 grants for National BTECH in Retail Management for students who will have internal work experience abroad during the academic years of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 (10 students in 2017/2018 and 10 students in 2018/2019) Lyc\u00e9e Poincar\u00e9 has been organizing mobilities abroad for the European section \u2018Secr\u00e9tariat\u2019 for several years. Given the positive feedback of this section, we have set up mobility projects in the Retail Management department from the academic year 2011/2012 to the year 2017/2018. These projects having been accepted, similarly to our application for the European section, we are applying for a new project for the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 academic years.\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nThe mobility will take place in Peterborough, England and will be organized in 4 preparatory days and a 4-week internship. The first days are devoted to a progressive discovery of the environment before joining the host company, in which a tutor will be responsible for the participants.\r\nWe will travel on the Eurostar and students will stay with their host families. The allocation of families and businesses is organized by a local provider who also closely supervises the trainees with the educational team and in accordance to the previously approved specifications. This project involves the various members of staff of our school: the head teacher, the accountant, and the educational teams of the relevant classes.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives notably involve the professional aspect as the project is primarily a linguistic enhancement in connection with the vocational training, but they also go beyond this aim. They bring a cultural aspect through the discovery of a different way of life and an unusual environment. And finally, building up personal confidence in our students is the underlying objective of our project as it allows them to develop self-confidence, autonomy and thus helps them to mature.\r\n\r\nOur requirements\r\nOur students belong to families who mainly come from disadvantaged or underprivileged backgrounds. The financial aspect of the mobility is therefore important, hence the need to obtain funding from Erasmus+ in correspondence with that of the High School and of the Ile-de-France Region.\r\n\r\nPredicted Outcome\r\nThe internal training period done as part of the mobility will be taken into account for the Baccalaur\u00e9at degree. It is therefore assessed by teachers at the place of mobility. Regarding the foreign language assessment in the exam, the evaluation methods which are now being oriented towards oral practice and the skills acquired through the mobility will provide a concrete basis for the preparation of this exam. Because our students are enrolled in the European section, they will take a specific oral exam (which lasts 20 minutes, preceded by a 20-minute preparation time). According to their results, they can obtain a special European grade in the Baccalaur\u00e9at. In addition, each participant will receive a personalized Europass mobility at the end of their training period. In the perspective of professional integration, the skills acquired by students reflect the European dimension in their training. Finally, the European aspect of the project is an undeniable added value for the participants: our students will be able to \"experience Europe\" explicitly.\r\nSince 2015, participants to a mobility program abroad have had the possibility to take an optional oral exam. Part of this exam (8 pts) is assessed by the tutor abroad during the work placement and the other part (12 pts) is assessed by a jury of two teachers in France. The student must comment on a report or a slideshow about his experience in the foreign country. Students who pass this exam receive a Euromobipro certificate. Since 2015, all our students have taken this optional exam and obtained between 4 and 10 additional points for their Baccalaureat.", "http://eurostaff-ltd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046114_1"], [2017, "La mobilit\u00e9 en Angleterre : un outil essentiel \u00e0 l'insertion professionnelle des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de BAC PRO tertiaire (Gestion Administration).", "Eurostaff UK Ltd", 16293.0, 2, 9, "This 10th mobility project concerns the 10 European section students in their final year of a BTEC National diploma in Management and Administrative Duties.

To date we have really been satisfied with the fact that the firms are very often the same (publishing firms, printers, schools, charities...) which is a guarantee of their quality involvement in the training of young foreigners.\r\nOur students have progressively been learning about their future jobs for the last 2 years thanks to theoretical classes and thanks to their different work experiences in France in firms sometimes having a European or international development (Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Vinci, V\u00e9olia, EADS, Catella Property Group France...).\r\n\r\nWe are expecting the following results for the mobility project to come:\r\n* Concerning the students:\r\n- the development of their professional abilities,\r\n- a fluency in English,\r\n- a cultural opening, a European citizenship,\r\n- the development of their maturity and autonomy,\r\n- a personal satisfaction to have achieved such a project,\r\n- a higher motivation to obtain the BTEC National and the European grade,\r\n- the opportunity to continue higher level education after obtaining the BTEC,\r\n- good, and even, excellent results at the exam and at the \"European English grade\", \r\n- more higher-education perspectives,\r\n- the awareness of the importance of the work experience in England and the \u201cEuropass Mobility\u201d on the professional market,\r\n- the awareness of the financial support from the European program Erasmus+ and the interest in the youths\u2019 language training,\r\nOur results from the first mobility project:\r\n- from 2009 to 2014 (6 groups) : 53 candidates = 52 passed their BTEC National (most with a good grade),\r\n- from 2009 to 2014 (6 groups): 53 candidates = 42 European mentions = 79.24%\r\n* In the school:\r\n- an improved status of the vocational section,\r\n- the mobilization of skills for the success of our students,\r\n- the development of interdisciplinarity,\r\n- the experience and abilities acquired by the teams which work is enhanced by the project.\r\n* Out of the school:\r\n- an improved status of the perception of the vocational section and of the school,\r\n- the fact that students are hired more easily,\r\n- our school may be a help for other schools which want to open a European section.", "http://eurostaff-ltd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014025_5"], [2017, "Mobilit\u00e9 en Europe : un atout professionnel et personnel", "Eurostaff UK Ltd", 11465.0, 2, 4, "Henri Poincar\u00e9 Vocational high-school for Trade and Social Care careers, located in Palaiseau, Essonne (91), is a public educational institution attended by students who mainly come from junior high school. For some, the option of a vocational career is imposed because of the difficulties they face in general education subjects including foreign languages. Teachers are often faced with the problem of motivation, Through the mobility abroad, this European curriculum is a means of involving these students in a mobilizing project which enables them to acquire skills and autonomy that are necessary for their success.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur project\r\nWe are applying for 20 grants for National BTECH in Retail Management for students who will have internal work experience abroad during the academic years of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (10 students in 2017/2018 and 10 students in 2018/2019) Lyc\u00e9e Poincar\u00e9 has been organizing mobilities abroad for the European section \u2018Secr\u00e9tariat\u2019 for several years. Given the positive feedback of this section, we have set up mobility projects in the Retail Management department for the years 2011/2012, 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. These projects having been accepted, similarly to our application for the European section, we are applying for a new project for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nThe mobility will take place in Peterborough, England and will be organized in 4 or 5 preparatory days and a 4-week internship. The first days are devoted to a progressive discovery of the environment before joining the host company, in which a tutor will be responsible for the participants.\r\nWe will travel on the Eurostar and students will stay with their host families. The allocation of families and businesses is organized by a local provider who also closely supervises the trainees with the educational team and in accordance to the previously approved specifications. This project involves the various members of staff of our school: the head teacher, the accountant, and the educational teams of the relevant classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives notably involve the professional aspect as the project is primarily a linguistic enhancement in connection with the vocational training, but they also go beyond this aim. They bring a cultural aspect through the discovery of a way of life and a different environment. And finally, building up personal confidence in our students is the underlying objective of our project as it allows them to develop self-confidence, autonomy and thus helps them to mature.\r\n\r\nOur requirements\r\nOur students belong to families who mainly come from disadvantaged or underprivileged backgrounds. The financial aspect of the mobility is therefore important, hence the need to obtain funding from Erasmus+ in correspondence with that of the High School and of the Ile-de-France Region.\r\n\r\nPredicted Outcome\r\nThe internal training period done as part of the mobility will be taken into account for the Baccalaur\u00e9at degree. It is therefore assessed by teachers at the place of mobility. Regarding the foreign language assessment in the exam, the evaluation methods which are now being oriented towards oral practice and the skills acquired through the mobility will provide a concrete basis for the preparation of this exam. Because our students are enrolled in the European section, they will take a specific oral exam (which lasts 20 minutes, preceded by a 20-minute preparation time). According to their results, they can obtain a special European grade in the Baccalaur\u00e9at. In addition, each participant will receive a personalized Europass mobility at the end of their training period. In the perspective of professional integration, the skills acquired by students reflect the European dimension in their training. Finally, the European aspect of the project is an undeniable added value for the participants: our students will be able to \"experience Europe\" explicitly.", "http://eurostaff-ltd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036690_3"]]}}, "8NG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "THE STEPPING STONE", "Stream Lyric", 13197.0, 5, 5, "The Cork Community Art Link, in operation for 23 years,  targets a vast age group that goes from 12+ and elderly, families and youngsters in difficulties becoming a refernce point for Youth groups of the area.
