This will allow consolidating, developing and better exploiting the achievements already reached in the past and to tackle the present challenges in preparing the European workforce in the nuclear fields.\n\nThe main objectives of the proposal are:\n\n1. SURVEY AND COORDINATION OF NETWORKING IN E&T AND VET IN THE NUCLEAR AREAS\n2. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COORDINATED E&T AND VET EFFORTS (Master and Summer Courses for continuous professional development)\n3.

It's an elegant, efficient and engaging solution to the huge environmental problems we face in the 21st century. We cannot apart this away from technology since the information must be used by others. Biodiversity is a very important aspect of our lives and it  can only be managed effectively by engaging all stakeholders in the stewardship process. We will find ways to create collaborations between stakeholders:  botanical gardens, biodiversity associations,  landowners, tourism operators, tourists, scouts, student organizations, scientists etc.We want to identify opportunities for digital technology to support children\u2019s connectedness to the natural environment, thereby encouraging positive environmental attitudes in children, as well as healthy physical play. As schools, we have the duty to find what motivates children to interact with nature and to figure how technology may enhance this interaction. Pervasive and emerging technologies have the potential to motivate children to experience more frequent and meaningful interactions with local natural environments by designing opportunities for interactions between children, parents and technology \u201cin the wild\u201d. Many children have regular access to powerful digital devices containing GPS, access to online information and networks and audio-visual recorders that motivate children to interact and share how they relate to the environment. Elements of this technology can also be applied to counteract some of the barriers to independent outdoor learning. OBJECTIVES1. Promote a responsible environmental awareness based on scientific facts2. Increase understandings of the nature of science and  lead to more positive attitudes toward science and the environment3.  Bring scientists, teachers and students together in partnerships that result in useful research and effective science education4. Create learning lines and tools for connecting new technologies with nature5. Collect large quantities of data across an array of habitats and locations over long spans of timeOur partnership consists in 6 countries involved: Romania, Spain, UK, Czech Republic, Latvia and Italy. Start date will be 01-09-2016 and implementation will last 36 months due to huge amount of results and time taking researche activities.Our main results will be:- Create methodology regarding the integration of ICT into nature studies and sciences- Develop on-line/ virtual/Internet materials- Trainings and events for teachers and students:- conferences  & symposiums- workshops- transfer of database to science associations, universities, stakeholders interested in collecting and analyzing data. During three years we are planning to travel in every country to interract with experts on main aim - plug in nature with new technologies and participatory science tasks.  In each meeting we will bring 3 students for short term exchanges. Every visit will have a theme related to  main  aim.Our results will be provided in the form of digital assets and used on virtual environments. Final versions of our activities and results - such as presentations, photos, eMagazines, text files, posters, questionnaires and surveys will be published on the web and e-platforms in English and other languages. The publishing activities will deliver rich, flexible, opened and enjoyable learning experiences.In terms of mobility and transnational meetings we plan to have 6 staff meetings for management issues and 6 short term exchanges for students.", "http://www.cockermouthschool.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-RO01-KA219-024599_1"]]}}, "9HT": {"nhs": {"data": [["RNN", "Cockermouth Community Hospital", "nhs_RNNCB"]]}}}}
