The Attainment Challenge is a unique initiative as it aims to close the \u2018Attainment Gap\u2019 related to poverty, it is focused on providing extra resources in schools and nurseries within Scotland\u2019s poorest communities in a bid to raise attainment in Literacy, Numeracy and Health and Wellbeing. The Attainment Challenge is underpinned by the documents The National Improvement Framework, The Curriculum for Excellence, and \u2018Getting it right for Every Child\u2019 (GIRFEC).  In 2014 Sue Ellis and Edward Sosu completed research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation entitled \u201cClosing the Attainment gap in Scottish education\u201d, Its key findings proved to be difficult reading, and it prompted the government to explore equity in education. Every child should be afforded the same opportunities to succeed. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe gap between children from low-income and high-income households starts early. By age 5, it is 10\u201313 months. Lower attainment in literacy and numeracy is linked to deprivation throughout primary school. By age 12\u201314 (S2), pupils from better-off areas are more than twice as likely as those from the most deprived areas to do well in numeracy. Attainment at 16 (the end of S4) has risen overall, but a significant and persistent gap remains between groups.\u201d (Sosu and Ellis, 2014)\r\n\r\nThis information prompts brave new thinking and a bold approach.  It is necessary to look outwards, across Europe, to seek inspiration and learn from the most effective models and practices. \r\n\r\nWe have reflected on our own practice and read widely about international approaches to Early Years Education, however, it is necessary to create our own pedagogy, a Scottish Model. The approach we wish to take inspiration from is the Reggio Approach. The diverse cultures and socioeconomic circumstances welcomed by our nursery necessitate a non discriminatory, encouraging, inclusive approach. Every child and family must have a voice. The Reggio Approach is unparalleled with their confidence in the children's competencies and the ability to listen to every child's voice is truly valued. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore aims to address 3 specific areas in order to enhance and innovate:\r\n\r\nLeadership and Management\r\nLearning Provision\r\nSuccesses and Achievements\r\n\r\nBy addressing these 3 areas, the project main objectives are :\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative approaches to our teaching and learning\r\n- Develop an understanding of creative approaches\r\n- Improving our teaching and learning by raising staff expertise and competences within a European context\r\n- Develop an understanding of practice in Europe\r\n- Improve children's outcomes by developing new learning methods and strategies\r\n- Develop links with schools in Europe\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have planned to provide opportunity for 12 staff to attend a structured training course in Italy ''Creative Teaching in Early Years and Preschool Education, Bologna.\"  \r\nThe course offers a unique opportunity, not only will be on location in Emilia Romagna but the training team are very specialised in their expertise regarding neuro-lingustics and child development. We will gain insight into how the child's brain thinks creatively, and the foundations of language development- essential to be inclusive in our multicultural setting with a high number of children with additional needs and difficult backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe staff selected to attend are committed and dedicated to the children and families in our community. They have a great deal of experience and expertise and a high proportion of the staff are currently studying degree and postgraduate courses. We are applying for 12 places on the training course and these will certainly be filled as there is a great level of excitement surrounding the experience. There is an understanding that this transformational project is long term and a commitment of both time and motivation is required by all to see it through. Through linking the European Development Plan to the \"How Good Is our Early Learning and Childcare\" we are ensuring that we are continually monitoring our progress through the project and evaluating our success.\r\n\r\nThis project will greatly benefit the children and families in our school and the wider community, whilst providing our staff with an exciting and memorable training experience that will without doubt develop their professional skills and form the basis of their future practice.\r\nThe current climate in Scotland is exciting, we are a forward thinking nation, with a strong European Identity.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers.

This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 20 Dundee United FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Turkey. The Turkish host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Turkish and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Turkish partner and the associated local Turkish clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. Dundee United FC have recently completed a successful mobility trip to Turkey in January 2014 and this has formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\nYoung people in Dundee and Tayside are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people in the region where many have poor records of academic achievement and are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in Tayside will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this regional shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. Football clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\nDundee United FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.\r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Dundee United FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK  football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.

The Basse-Normandie region holds a strategic position at the heart of France\u2019s first offshore wind turbine programme, making the most of the natural, structural and technological advantages that have put it at the forefront of this promising sector. Moreover a development plan for the experimentation and production of electricity through tidal farms  particularly in the Cotentin area  is being currently undertaken  in order to exploit tide time differences to maximize the use of resources.  \r\n\r\nScotland has ambitious aspirations for renewable energy. The Wind and Marine Renewable sectors are quite advanced with a high level of onshore and offshore wind either built, consented or planned and Marine Renewable are high priority with the establishment of the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). This ambition is reinforced by the  Scottish Government who have a target for 100% of electricity from renewable by 2020. \r\n\r\nNorway is a big oil and gaz producing country. Renewable energy has mostly focused on hydro-electricity but there a few projects in MREs today. One main reason is their wish to maintain nature untouched for future generations. As our \u201coil age\u201d will go away Norway has to focus on renewable energies and the enterprises  on the Western coast will have to find new markets outside the oil supply industry. \r\n\r\n\u201cWinds and Tides\u201d implementation  and progress is a unique opportunity to accompany the development of the industry in Lower Normandy, Scotland and Norway,   through the creation  and testing of a specific training design tailored to the requirement of companies.

Possessing the Charter means that College staff have the ability to make long term plans and devise their mobilities to fit with their academic and term time frames.  \r\n\r\nAcross the College, the general awareness of the European programme is now very high and new sections of the College are now engaged which will inspire new teaching and development approaches in those areas,   The international team have run an ongoing internal communications campaign to publicise and promote the Erasmus Plus Mobilities through all forms of media \u2013 from leaflets, to broadcasts on the portal, to running roadshows, presentations to all academic areas, and the publication of a complete Mobility Handbook.  This campaign was awarded a prize in the Scottish College Development Network Marketing awards - held at a prestigious  Edinburgh venue in March 2017.  \r\n\r\nIn this year's application we add new College departments to the programme - including Construction (to Berlin), Science (Spain), Supported Education (Finland), and Hospitality (Italy). This is a welcome diversification across the college academic areas that are not usually represented in mobilities.   Each year sees an increase in demand and therefore our application reflects this higher activity level. \r\n\r\nAs stated in the previous years report,  DARE - 3 involves reviewing the current year\u2019s programme, involving departments in reviewing their experience and turning their strategy into a series of yearly objectives as per the application.  Also, internal systems of budgeting and financial control are under continuous review as our grasp of the Erasmus Plus mobilities rules becomes more complete and our confidence grows in the Mobility Tool + as a means of recording the required information. \r\n\r\nAll staff and students who are confirmed on a mobility receive a pre-mobilty \u2019programme\u2019 \u2013 following the processes detailed in the D&A Mobility Handbook,  whereby language training needs, and any other special needs are assessed, and country familiarisation briefings take place.

Our aim is to start reciprocal student mobility co-operation with our new Lithuanian partner in the field of property maintenance, because Omnia has educated this field already for years, but there has not been international co-operationin this field in the past years at all in Omnia. We also aim to send some students in the next project period to Portugal, because during this project period only staff members have visited from Omnia there.

Omnian has most of its partner organisations and colleges in Germany. In this application there are ten German institutes. Co-operation with them is well-working and flexible and Omnia's students and experts  consider the country interesting.

This problem (or opportunity) is clearly recognised in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st European Business Forum on Vocational Training (2012) states promoting collaboration between business & VET is pivotal to ensure proper alignment between what businesses need & what institutions teach their future employees. Cooperation around work-based learning of VET students is beneficial to all the 3 actors: the learner, the company & the VET organisation (the learning triangle). Most companies regard technical skills as the basics \u2013the must haves \u2013 but having staff with suitable technical skills alone does not make a company stand out. What makes the difference is the level of transversal skills. Employers stress that these transversal skills enable skilled employees to fully utilise their technical expertise, put it into practice & contribute to company growth, learning & innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium will therefore transfer & implement an innovative student-centred pedagogy, Cooperative Learning (COL) to develop transversal skills. Whilst COL is not new, it is rarely used in VET. Working with COL develops experience & maturity, mainly by exposure to views & feelings of others & the ability to work collectively to a goal whilst considering these. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will identify innovation-friendly employers to work with trained VET staff, to create tasks (real workplace tasks framed as learning outcomes) for transversal skills development.

Cognitive stimulation is a recommended evidence based intervention for people with dementia. People with mild-to-moderate dementia should be offered the opportunity to participate in cognitive stimulation activities including informal stimulation through recreational activities and/or more formally via structured programmes which aim to provide stimulating activities based on psychological theories of cognition.

Outputs will include a project website, research findings, teaching and learning material and a peer teaching course plan.The project proposes to achieve this through reaching 5 objectives:1. To work with a transnational consortium (Europe and Asia, specifically China) to create new learning resources for HE learners which adopt innovative approaches to care for people suffering with dementia.2. To promote cross cultural learning and better understand how Eastern and Western approaches can converge to create workable practical solutions.3. To develop teachers/trainers competences to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to use the resources with their HE learners.4. To draw on existing research from Europe and Asia to explore a common way forward that meets the changing needs of government health and social care policies and the shift from institutional care to home care from the West, and the growing need for institutional care from the East.5.

The level of education of the trainees has declined for about 10 years; furthermore, the majority of today's trainees are young people who come from educationally disadvantaged family structures. About half of the current trainees in the construction industry in Berlin have an immigration background. Current changes suggest that this rate will increase in the coming years. The existing education processes therefore meets no longer the new requirements and demands of the vocational training of the youth in Europe.\r\n\r\nTherefore, effective educational strategies, concepts and innovative learning approaches, which are more target-group-oriented and up-to-date are required for a more efficient integration and inclusion of these groups of learners. This will also promote securing skilled personnel demand on a regional, national and international level as well as the national and European economy.\r\n\r\nInnovative learning processes increase the motivation of the trainees and minimize the terminating rate of trainings, which is around 40% in many sectors and is one of the major problem areas of securing skilled personnel.\r\nThe learning contents conveyed in the former practice through teaching briefings are often not successful in reaching the cognitive understanding of especially educationally disadvantaged trainees.  \r\nTrainers are therefore regularly faced with the challenge of implementing alternative approaches to the teaching of knowledge and competencies in the teaching briefings.\r\nThe project partnership responds precisely to these challenges with this project to integrate more intensively digitalization into vocational education. A digital module-based self-organized learning in the sense of \"e-learning 2.0\", which is developed jointly by teachers and learners, will make learning disadvantaged target groups participate more and more in vocational education and training equally.\r\nThis forms the basis for the increased development of self-directing competence by self-responsible design of the learning phases, the increase of communication and team competence by group work of trainees with trainers together as well as the increase of the media competence by the producing and realization of digital contents.\r\n\r\nSuch teaching and learning arrangements lead to changes in the role of the trainer as a learning companion and facilitator, thus expanding the competencies of the teachers.\r\n\r\nTeachers and learners form the direct target group of the project in their joint work and interaction.\r\nThe indirect target includes trainers in the companies and teachers of the (vocational-)schools (within the framework of the vocational orientation) which will participate in the project results as they can use the project products as well. The developed digital contents give a new insight into real learning situations and provide a more realistic picture of the professions, which gives the vocational orientation of young people an additional authentic information basis.\r\n\r\nA total of 4,000 people will participate in and benefit from the project during the project phase.\r\nTeaching and learning methods as well as training systems in the partner countries are different, but all are facing similar challenges.

BIM is the process and practice of virtual design and construction throughout its life cycle. It is a platform to share knowledge and communicate between project participants. In some of the ELITE project partners\u2019 country BIM has already become compulsory (UK and France), while in Italy, Estonia, Portugal the issue is still under discussion and specific working groups are working on this issue. In this context, where the different national building regulations are more and more innovative and demanding, the professionals in charge of the realization of buildings are not well informed or trained and they lack interdisciplinary skills.  They should be trained in order to promote their 'energy literacy', including integrated design,  management practices and  good operational digital skills which are necessary to face the digital transition which is spreading in the construction sector. The objectives of our ELITE project are:    - to close the gaps between industry needs and professionals and future professionals skills, defining an innovative training course which will foster employability of the trained people, - to support the development of innovative and systemic professional approaches in the field of energy efficiency in the building sector, based on the use of BIM, which will enhance building enterprises competitiveness. The participants will be the ELITE partners, representing 5 EU countries, France, Italy, Scotland (UK), Estonia and Portugal. Their heterogeneity will ensure the multilateral approach to the project. Each partner will involve local stakeholders, representing both the construction trade and the education sector. The beneficiaries of the training offer will be construction professionals and future construction professionals (level 3 and 4 of the EQF).          The innovative, open on-line tools will ensure the sustainability of ELITE activities within and beyond the partnership on a long-term basis. The local national stakeholders and the silent partners identified in the preparatory phase will guarantee the take up of ELITE outputs by a wide audience fostering the impact of the project. The activities planned by the ELITE partners are the following: - design of an innovative the Didactic Suite based on the use of BIM to tackle energy efficiency in the building sector- implementation of an Open Interactive platform.- design of augmented reality projects which will be available on the on-line platform and suitable to all levels and education sectors.- pilot test of the training  materialThe methodology  aimed at addressing the ELITE objectives will follow three main phases: 1. Preparation: Work plan development; definition of procedures for risk, quality and impact evaluation, budget control and  time management.2. Implementation: implementation of the activities as determined in preparation stage, development of intellectual outputs and organisation of multiplier events. 3. Follow-up: impact evaluation procedures, follow-up survey of multiplier events, sustainability actionsThe results expected are the following:  - A new training offer: a didactic suite which will be addressed to learners in a C-VET perspective and will promote work-place learning.- An open interactive platform which will enhance the permeability between formal and non-formal learning, participatory education governance and work methods and will spread the utilisation of open training methods through promoting the use of innovative ICT tools.- Augmented reality projects which will allow learners to work in an intuitive way using a non-formal learning tool and its utilisation be spread for educators and learners at all levels.  The expected impact is the improvement of the competitiveness of SMEs of the construction sector and the improvement of the employability of the professionals and future professionals on a European scale.  Training providers will also benefit from the uptake of the ELITE approach, improving the quality and efficiency of their VET courses, making VET a more attractive learning option and ensuring link to the labour market requirements.

Similarly there is a  need for employers to recognize how trainees are engaged in today's VET centres in teaching and learning in order that  there is a 'joined up' approach. between the two. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposal is to increase the skills of tutors in company to be able to host, train, monitor and assess the apprentices/students and design a process to facilitate the participation of SMEs in the dual VET system (or any other scheme of hosting students in companies).  The project will aim to promote a training culture amongst companies, especially SMEs, through awareness raising activities and utilizing  the experience of companies with a prior experience of hosting VET students and showing the beneficial results for the organization.\r\n\r\nThe DELTA  industry partners will include both large enterprises and niche players in a range of industries all with a need to develop new forms of support and assessment in the skills and competences that are required in today\u2019s workplace.  By involving industry partners  the project will create real applications and methodologies that will work across multiple sectors, and tried and tested in a 'real world' setting.  \r\n\r\nThese include the IOs: \r\n\r\n1) The DELTA Digital Portfolio - where trainees can demonstrate to employers their skills and how they learn in their VET centre\r\n2) The DELTA Toolkit is a set of documents and materials aimed at companies in order to assist them in the process of hosting a VET student, including the assessment of the student and  the impact the hosting has had on the company.\r\n3) The DELTA Collaborative Apprenticeship Schemes for SMEs.  This output is intended for those companies which are too small or too specific to be able to take apprentices (eg because they cannot dedicate personal resources or because they cannot cover all the curriculum to meet the needs of the apprenticeship).\r\n\r\nTwo sets of multiplier events  are planned to maximize the promotion of the IOs and gain more exposure for the project processes to industry and education leaders. \r\n\r\nTransnationality is at the heart of the project in different ways.  It addresses a European problem -  the lack of competences and expertise of tutors in companies when hosting VET learners. Also there will be an exchange of good practices among the participating countries in companies involvement and implementation of apprenticeships schemes (like it is the case of Italy and UK) or dual VET programmes (like the case of Spain) and the comparison of the VET systems in the different countries in order to contribute to a better transparency and knowledge of them among the participating organisations.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036810_coordinator"], [2017, "2015-FI01-KA109-009203", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 206169.0, 18, 32, "Omnia implements the most essential part of its international strategy by coordinating reciprocal student- and expert mobilities. The partner network of Omnia has enlarged by adding Austria and Latvia and new project countries during the last project period. Now our intention is to include even Portugal and Lithuania in this KA1-project. This because we at Omnia, also according to our international strategy, want to offer opportunity for international experiences (mainly in the form of on-the-job learning periods abroad) for possibly many students and from all Omnia vocational fields. In Lithuania we would have two new co-operation fields: logistics and property maintenance and that's why this new partner and country interests us. In Portugal the fields would be hotel, restaurant and travelling and in those fields we have had lack of placements and partners in relation to our applicants from those fields. From the security field Omnia has not either yet had any international activities, because we have now educated this field only for one year at Omnia, but we would find out if any of our existing partners also educates  this field and our objective is to start international co-operation also in this field during this new project period. \r\n\r\nFrom the last projects countries Slovakia will be excluded, because students have not applied there and co-operation was not implemented with the country last year either. Omnia's biggest partners are vocational institutes in Europe, but also a few Chambers of Crafts in Germany are included in this project and they also act as our reciprocal partners, which means that Omnia does not only send students to Germany via them but also receives students from them to practice in Finland in many different fields.\r\n\r\nOmnia has plenty of direct company co-operation in Europe, but because most of co-operation companies abroad act without pic-codes, they are not included in this application. Our intention is to include them later as receiving organizations when implementing the project. \r\n\r\nOmnia's one strategical objective is to offer internationalization opportunities for the whole staff, not only for teachers. That's why Omnia offers possibility to apply expert grants also for administrative personnel, guidance counselors, college nurses, curators, Omnia youth workshop personnel and staff of college canteen personnel. One project objective would also be to use a few of expert grants to reinforce co-operation between Omnia and local Finnish companies, who regularly receive foreign students via Omnia to practice at them. Reinforcing would happen by offering the key persons of those companies an opportunity to make an international mobility period of one week by themselves. \r\n\r\nInternationalization is already built in Omnia Curriculum in the form of one new learning unit called: To be a professional internationally.\r\nStudents can carry out this learning unit by doing an on-the-job training period abroad but also by doing their practicing period at some international company in Finland in case the company language is English.\r\n\r\nMost of the applied grants are single grants, which we coordinate one by one but also try to form pairs or small groups of students to each target country. In this application we apply many group mobilities: for instance a 10 student group in the field of AV-communication to Germany for 12 days, 5 students from social- and health care to Ireland for a month, 5 -student -group in the field of joinery to Estonia for 2 weeks (because our partner has a better CNC-machine than Omnia) and 8 student group from the fields of electricity, plumbing, joinery and house building to the Netherlands for three weeks. We apply grants for accompanying persons to travel with groups, because students in these fields are young and would not dare travel without a safe adult.\r\n\r\nInternational project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of each project, in Omnia's pedagogical development team. There are representatives from Omnia's different divisions in this group. The members of pedagogical development team are working as contact persons between the students and personnel of their own vocational field and management of Omnia and between National project services and International team. With this interaction we try to ensure common interests and lines in different project, development and mobility activities. Good practices will be described in Omnia's pedagogical program and presented in the pedagogical group's meetings. In Omnia's result card numbers of student and expert mobilities will be described and these numbers would be followed and controlled regularly in Omnia's management group and on the level of administration. \r\n\r\nThe number of applied grants is based on numbers of mobilities carried out during the school year 2016 -2017 and on the plans done for next project year.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034404_3"], [2018, "Patways for upskilling students in Europe", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 201179.0, 6, 29, "The project responds to the need that VET schools have to provide their students with the chance to increase and improve the quality of vocational training, by taking internships in European companies, and getting in contact with the single European labour market.\r\n\r\nThe success of the collaboration in the previous consortium integrated by 9 Public VET schools of the Valencian Region and promoted by the IES Ram\u00f3n Esteve, the high rate of insertion of the students to the labor market (90%), the great interest and the satisfaction of the students and the coordinators who participated in the previous project, as well as the close and fluid collaboration of the VET schools involved in the consortium, have fostered the present project that it will satisfy the demands of the VET schools makes possible the collaboration with enterprises at national  and European level. The dissemination actions of the results have made possible the incorporation of 2 VET schools more.\r\n\r\nThe project integrated by 11 VET schools in Valencian Region is adressed to 77 VET students and former students who are doing the 2nd year of the cycles of intermediate level in informatics and communications, agrarian and administration; or graduates in the last year: medium-level technicians from these specialties. The project foresees 8 monthly flows (4 to Italy, 1 to Portugal, 1 to Brussels, 1 to Latvia and 3 to UK) and 2 Erasmus Pro flows of three months (1 to Italy and 1 to UK) Each VET schoolwill select 2 former students and 5 students, one of them Erasmus Pro. There are 5 flows to Italy and 3 to the UK because the profile of the partners as well as the different geographical areas of them will enable the students to carry out their work. training in different fields since companies, even if they are from the same sectors, are very different.\r\n\r\nThe main OBJECTIVE of the project is:\r\nTo allow VET students to develop, through training practices in European companies, the skills and abilities to complete, in a practical way, the skills acquired in VET to be incorporated efficiently into the  European labor market, either on account own or for others. To do this, VET students needs to develop specific tecnical skills on the specialty that they has studied, but transversal, social and intercultural skills will also be necessary to face new challenges and become active citizens with values for the future.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES  will be carried out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation.

The goal is to improve the skills and competences of the participants. To help students to become skilled labourors, to give teachers the opportunities to learn from methods used abroad and to improve the curriculum. \r\n\r\nEach sector in Da Vinci College has made a sector plan based upon the team plans, where international activities have to be a part. This together with discussions on the different sectors has lead to the policy plan of the International office (annex 1). Here we describe a number of goals + activities we will work on the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe big objective is to work towards a curriculum that has an International context. This is a process that takes time. We will start with one course where lessons will be given in English, the teachers involved get the possibility to do a CLIL course or a language course abroad.\r\nTo reach the overall goal we have different smaller goals:\r\n- student mobility, we want to send each year more students to reach te 6% goal the Dutch minister of Education has set. The problem we face now is money, the budget is not enough to reach this, even though we do pay the students only a part of the maximum money we could pay. \r\n- We we will hand in the application for the Charter in 2017 to grow faster.\r\n- Mobility of staff. As we are participating in three KA 2 projects and in 2017 in the application of 5 new ones we have allready quite a lot of international staff activities. We are planning to have a mutual agreement with two colleges in Denmark to exchange teachers and working life representatives. By combining school staff and working life representatives there will be a fruitful exchange of ideas, this will help to improve the quality of the courses in the College. \r\n- participating in KA2 projects, these help teams to get international contacts and to study on different topics. Next year we are going to be the coordinator of at least one project application in the Technical sector\r\n- Giving students the possibilty to participate in Youth projects, these are highly succesfull, short term but with a great impact\r\n- organize one-week study visits in some sectors.\r\n- virtual mobility in language classes\r\n- applying an American student through Fulbright.\r\n\r\nAll students should have the possibility, general the level three and four students are going abroad. This year appr. 150 students went abroad for a work placement or a study visit. We hope to increase these numbers every year.\r\nIn the coming month also level 1 students go abroad, with staff to visit Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe are also open for incoming students, every year there are about 30 students coming in, we try to integrate them in the classes of students that have the same course here in Da Vinci Colllege.\r\nIncoming teachers are offered a program in combination with working life, we always expect them to give at least one masterclass on their own expertise.\r\n\r\nOrganizational structure:\r\nIn Da Vinci college there is a platform of contactpersons from the different sectors, they meet 10 times a year to discuss new policy, practical issues concerning mobility or projects. This platform is important because the participants have to translate the ideas to the teams and students. The participants in this platform support the students in all the steps that are needed to go abroad, information, preparation, practical issues, tutoring, validation and dissemination. Also they inform and help the colleagues.\r\nThere is also a strategic platform, herein participate the director of the sector of Bussiness, the coordinator of the international Office and a member of the Board.\r\n\r\nWe use our website and ELO for information and training purposes. We have developed a number of documents and there is a list to control (annex 7). Students are doing a number of tasks before going. Their tutor in the college is deciding which tasks have to be done. Every participant has to write a final report which can be published on the website. Also they have to give a presentation.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our partners abroad. To make sure things work out well we visit partners, also a number of students when they are abroad and are inviting partners here. Also general meetings like EfVET are used to discuss cooperation.\r\n\r\nDa Vinci College is striving for a network high quality, partners we know and they know us. In this way students and teachers can have a training that helps them to be or become a better worker in our Dutch Industry and social institutions. And to improve the quality of our training courses.\r\n\r\nDoing all this gives our college an International Charisma and is appealing for students to study here.

In addition to these, new partner organizations will become from Scotland and Slovenia. The most important point to implement mobilities is to continue co-operation with known, responsible and trustworthy partner organizations. An important aim is to provide internationalization possibilities evenly to students and experts from possibly many vocational fields from Omnia\u2019s wide international co-operation network. The length of student mobility periods varies from two to twelve weeks and expert mobilities from one to two weeks.  Accompanying person mobilities will be applied for a two-week-group-mobility periods to France. The aim during this college mobility period would be to plan and implement a wooden product under supervision of French and Finnish teachers. In addition to this another group-mobility-period will be applied for a ten-student group for the cooking and baking field students. Two support person mobilites would be applied even to this period. These group-mobility-periods would be done for two different co-operation colleges in France. Omnia has a clear aim to combine internalization strategy to curriculums, develop the studies of internationalization pathway and implement the internationalization strategy. Home college internationalisation will be improved  by developing activities with tutor students for intenational activities.

The two colleges had been active in European projects under the Lifelong Learning Programme and Interreg since 2007.  During that time we gained experience of how to manage European projects from concept through to final reporting and on being awarded the VET Charter we have now embarked on Project DARE (D & A  Reach out to Europe) where the combined college continues in this direction.  The principles behind the international strategy are that the Charter would facilitate the internationalising of the curriculum, where all academic areas would have the opportunity to devise programmes that include a mobility, aligned to their course requirements,  and cross college support services, who previously might not have considered a mobility,  would become  equally involved. Project DARE therefore involves turning the strategy into a series of yearly objectives as per the application, and this has involved work in awareness raising, (dissemination of the Charter benefits, with adverts on the College portal, a presentation to all academic areas, production of leaflets as well as a \u2019roadshow\u2019 open to all where International staff gave talks and led discussions on the Charter across the three campuses) and the publication of a complete Mobility Handbook. The key messages are that:\u2022 The Charter is a five year plan so allows for departments to take a longer term view in planning their curricula. All academic areas are involved  \u2013 those with little or no experience can start to explore, seek partners and plan for 2017/18 and those with previous experience could further develop their links to international institutions.\u2022 Secondly, the message was propagated that all staff could become involved \u2013 not just teaching staff, but support and administration staff in order they could witness good practice in other organisations  \u2013 sometimes being involved for the first time in such an endeavour.\u2022 Thirdly, a range of providers or recipient organisations have been selected for us to work with in a reciprocal manner. These include  Colleges, Universities, VET organisations, Cultural organisations and private training providers. Some are new to us, but all have come with recommendations, or are Charter holders,  or ones with whom we have previously  worked \u2013 and new teaching and development approaches will arise from these exchanges. This first year\u2019s submission therefore embodies the ethos as well as the processes described in the Charter application  - representing a cross section of the College\u2019s functions: Horticulture (CZ), Performing Arts (Norway and France), OD (Sweden), Support Services (Spain and Finland), Hair & Beauty (Finland), Creative & Digital (Italy), Travel & Tourism (Slovenia) and Business and Teacher Training (Finland). Our students will undoubtedly benefit from these placements in our partner\u2019s business and VET centres. This will provide them with new and exciting experiences and staff  members will develop new relationshps with their international counterparts  and the D&A curriculum will be enhanced  thus benefiting our future students. The numbers of students in this '16/17 application is quite close to the  number anticipated in the Charter application, at 103. The number of staff (38) is a total of those on a staff mobility and those accompanying students and is determined by the need to accompany student mobilities for a) the security and safety of the group ie 1 staff member per 10 students as recommended in the Guide and/or b) the requirement to have two members for staff development purposes c) to further develop the relationship between institutions and d) allow mobility to staff other than teaching. All staff and students will receive a pre-mobilty \u2019programme\u2019 \u2013 following the processes detailed in the D&A Handbook,  whereby language training needs, and any other special needs are assessed, and country familiarisation briefings will take place. There will be discussions concerning the schedule and programme, and staff will also relate to their opposite number to identify issues in advance. Staff will receive briefings on assessment and support issues, inc. ECVET, and travel arrangements will be handled by the administration section of the International team as well as an external travel company.

Industry 4.0. is more demanding in both technological and organisational terms and interdisciplinary competences are essential.In this context, the VET system should seek to provide a broader set of skills and job specific capabilities and close the existing IT skills gap. Industry 4.0. calls for a new approach of IT know-how, in combination with organizational and soft skills and therefore, vocational training needs to be structured in a different way and integrated in the industry 4.0. by cooperating with technological centres and companies, completing the triangle innovation-education-business. According to the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB), \u201ccompanies are cooperating more with partners in the higher education sector to train the next generation of skilled workers. But vocational education and training must not leave this field to the higher education establishments alone, particularly as no uniform standards exist as yet. On the contrary, it must develop its own concepts for Vocational Education & Training 4.0.\u201dGiven this background, with LAIT 4.0. the partners want to contribute to the achievement of these objectives:- Provide VET teachers with knowledge about industry 4.0. technologies and with the skills to transfer this knowledge to VET learners and to SMEs.- Develop the technological and organizational skills of VET learners in order to give a better answer to the current demands of industrial companies, especially those involved in advanced manufacturing (CNC, virtual welding, robotics...).- Improve the access of companies, specially SMEs, to the knowledge of research and innovation centres to apply it to their own economic activity.- Increase cooperation between VET centres, research and innovation centres and companies, enhancing the triangle education-innovation-business.- Facilitate transparency among the different VET systems in the EU by the joint design of a course addressed to reduce the skills shortage related to industry 4.0. and the development of a memorandum of understanding among project partners to facilitate the exchange and mobility of VET teachers and learners, as the implementation of industry 4.0. in companies is a European need in order to guarantee the competitiveness of European companies.During the project, 18 VET teachers will be intensively trained in industry 4.0. in a technological centre in the Basque Country which is a European reference in the field. These 18 VET teachers will transfer this knowledge to other 50 teachers during a short course. Around 1200-1500 learners will benefit from the upgrade of skills of their teachers.On the other hand, cooperation with companies is also an essential part of LAIT 4.0. Twenty companies will be involved in the project and will work with the 18 VET teachers to walk towards the implementation of industry 4.0. and become a factory of the future.The methodology used during the implementation of LAIT 4.0. is the continuous cooperation within the triangle innovation-education-business. Firstly, by upgrading the technological and organizational competences in industry 4.0. of VET teachers, through the specific training provided by a technological centre and passed later on by the own VET teachers to other colleagues.Then, by incorporating the companies to the triangle through the realization of technological check-ups and improvement plans in order to implement industry 4.0. We can sum up LAIT 4.0. results and long term benefits as follows:- The upgrade of competences of VET teachers in industry 4.0.- A better alignment between VET provision and the needs of companies by the implementation in VET courses of training related to the development of skills and competences in industry 4.0., which will improve the employability and professional perspectives of VET learners.- A higher implementation of industry 4.0. in companies by the realization of technological check up and improvement plan by VET teachers in cooperation with a technological centre. - The definition of new ways of cooperation between VET centres and companies by the provision of added value services beyond the traditional training, contributing to the modernization of VET centres.- A higher relevance and prestige of VET by playing a key role in driving innovation in companies and being a bridge between technological centres and companies (a role now played almost exclusively by universities).", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA202-025016_4"], [2017, "Provehicle 4", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 118948.0, 7, 13, "The context/background of project our project is the needs of a flexible workforce that can respond to increased competition and rapid technological change by enabling vocational training and education (VET) to respond and adapt to the demands of the labour market.

Amledo & Co is in the project supported by MYN (The Motor Industry Professional Committees of Sweden).\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is European mobility for VET learners and staff in the vehicle sector. The objectives in this project are:\r\n a) Increased skills and competences for VET-learners and improve their learners socially, culturally,  linguistic, flexibility, employability and transition to the labour market by VET learners traineeship in companies in EU. \r\nb) Update, upgraded skills and competences for modernising and internationalising their mission by understanding the skills demand in the European Vehicle sector and VET through staff training abroad at a European VET-provider.\r\nc) Creating a network of VET-providers, social partners and companies to understand European VET and vehicle sector skills demand to reinforce capacity of managing international collaboration and increased international scope.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants: Outgoing 50 VET-learners and 50 VET-staff plus 14 incoming.\r\nProfile: The project is intended for VET-learners and VET-Staff in the Swedish Upper secondary school national programme The Vehicle Programme (fordons- och transportprogrammet) that provides Vocational education training. The mobility project focuses on the three sub-programmes to The Vehicle Programme: 1) The Lorries and mobile machinery programme; 2) The Body work and paint spraying programme; 3) The Passenger cars programme.

We address quality and management issues by implementing the EQAVET model in the project work plan and in the design of the work packages in order to address quality and management issues in a sustainable way. The EQAVET model consists of four stages for the quality assurance cycle for VET-providers: Planning, Implementation, Evaluation and Review. The methodology used for learning will be mobility, through personal experience and observation increase participant\u2019s knowledge. The methodology for project management will be work packaged based and enforced by agreements.\r\n\r\nThe main result and outcomes of the project are increasing competence, flexibility and employability of VET-learners, VET- staff and participating organisations in the vehicle sector. We will create professional/personal development of the participants in the project with regard to their relevance for the vehicle sector labour market needs through mobility. The results for participating organisations will be developed reinforced capacity of managing international collaboration and increased international scope. It is a win-win situation in the effort to strengthens the quality of teaching and training by cooperation and knowledge sharing.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits are the dynamic transformation of VET to better match training and education to European labour market skills demand and by so creating employability, self-empowerment and self-esteem, language competences, intercultural awareness in line with KA1 call 2017.  The impacts have also been proven by experiences and feedback from both The Motor Industry Professional Committees of Sweden and consortium members.

ROCvA, aims to be the bridge between the potential workforce (all our students) and the demands of the labourmarket. It also aims for improving the quality of the education and to become one of the top five educational institutes within MBO/VET by seeking strengthening the professionalism and working towards excellence in all levels and areas. Internationalisation will help provide the tool for all learners in ROCvA to be internationally and interculturally competent, help them acquire the new 21st century skills and be prepared and skilled for the global workfield.\r\nROCvA provides an added value to its vocational educational programmes by enhancing the quality and quantity of its international mobilities for learners and staff. It is necessary to achieve a better uderstanding of the educational systems within Europe and by cooperation with institutions and enterprises within Europe to share best practices that help to develop personal, generic and professional competences of teaching staff and learners; thus improve the quality of education, the learning - teaching process, internships and thus enhance employability for our learners and staff. International activities form an integral part of the Team Plans and thus integral part of the complex educational programme.\r\nErasmus+ KA1 is about mobilities so most of the planned activities are student and staff mobilities. Individual mobilities, internships, study programmes, language courses, job shadowing, study exchanges will have been offered and organised by ROCvA for all its students and teachers on a decentralised level by the Programme Teams in cooperation with the College International Cordinator of the ROCvA MBO Colleges. The International Office, as a central hub, coordinates all international activities monitored and supervised by a Steering Committee, reporting to a Senior Leadership Team (directieplatform), thus providing guarantee for the quality of all international activities.\r\nActivities are planned for learners and staff already working with international programmes but also for the planned new bilingual courses for the creative programmes already mentioned; Art and Design, Dance, Hospitality,  International Jean School and  Make-up Art.

Through Internationalisation@Home, intercultural values, EU citizenship should be promoted through internships, trainings, foreign experiences, exchanges, virtual international classrooms etc. to be aware of and to help understand and accept cultural differences.\r\nMultilingualism should improve within ROCvA and even Management Teams will take up language trainings to enhance their skills and competences and motivate their staff by giving a good example!\r\nThe project will stimulate and add value to the cooperation within the EU vocational qualifications, VET providers and between small and medium size enterprises.  It will support the implementation of best practices for the educational programmes and internships by exchange of experiences;  special emphasis regarding quality assurance.\r\nThe most important impact is to improve the quality of mobilities on a European level, and on national and institutional level as well. Through successful mobilities new sets of skills and competences will be obtained by all the participants, learners and staff, and a new way of thinking  will have an added value to the personal and professional development of all the participants.

Students\u00b4 ability to co-operate in a group improves and their models of action and identity are constructed towards a more positive and sustainable direction. Students learn how to communicate in English and learn to control their financial affairs; in other words, they learn more about the basic skills in life. The self-controlled and goal-oriented use of social media before, during and after the mobilities increases the knowledge of the responsibilities and rules of digital communication and 21st century skills. The aim of the project is not only to increase professional skills but also simultaneously interactive and life-management skills of our students.

The Interns are 18 years old, motivated and goal oriented  young adults. Concerning this application, here's the joining study fields and number of participants: Hotel- and Catering ( 4 / Cyprus ), Metal (2/Hungary), Hairdressing and Beauty (4/Ireland, 4/Estonia, 2/Cyprus), Car mechanic (2/France), Shoe making (2/France), Electricity (2/Hungary).5-10 weeks' internship consist of the orientation period of the recieving organisation, tutoring action during the whole period, work practise, continuing self evaluation by means of blog and final report writing, intermediate- and final evaluation by means of work place tutor and the culture visits by the partner organisation.After Sataedu was accredited by NA ( mobility charter), we have strengthen our internationalization work by employing a new employee next to Head of International Affairs, and her tasks are just among the students' mobilities. She's former international contact person in Kokem\u00e4ki unit, so her skills and competence in students' mobilities are high. Our Internationality process has been changed in the beginning of 2016 such a way that many functions are centralized, e.g. all Sataedu's Learning Agreements are prepared by only one person. This procedure quarantees the same quality to every agreement. In addition in the end of the period, the return training takes place now in every unit in such a way that the coordinator, contact person, mentor and students join together to receive the blogs or final report and to fill in both mobility tool + report and Sataedu's own Wepropol inquiry. During  the feedback conversation and returning the evaluation forms / Europasses, the recognizion and acknowledge of learning outcomes is carried out. Thanks to the reorganization of our internationalization process, it also enables the second call of mobility request during one academic year (one call every semester ). This procedure enables for students, who are graduating earlier, to plan their study path in a way that certain part of the studies can be achieved through the internship abroad.  Sataedu will expand the students' mobilities also for the students with special needs. From this field Sataedu doesn't have any experience yet, and for that reason we'll start with very small group in Cyprus, where the partner is very reliable and high quality. After this internship we'll collect all feedback from our students and teachers concerning this period, so we can build up a functional and high quality preparation course for the next period.Concerning the teachers' mobilities, we are as a local partner in a \"not only fair play\" network, and thanks to this local partnership, we are able to send our teachers of physical education to network partners in Italy and Scotland. Their goals are to get familiar by peer learning with combining the VET and sport and how to enhance the social cohesion and to prevent the drop outs among our students.We are sending 2 teachers to both places for one week. In Satamove 2 mobility project there's still 4 teachers'  2 week mobilities left.Along with the former 7 Memorandum of Understandings, we now have agreed a new MoU with GTI from Ireland.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA116-022622_1"], [2017, "HACIA LA INTERNACIONALIZACI\u00d3N DE LAS ENSE\u00d1ANZAS T\u00c9CNICAS DE SOMORROSTRO", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 31411.0, 4, 13, "The \"ERASOMOTECH\" project aims to open new job opportunities abroad for all students of intermediate vocational training and professional certificates of Somorrostro Technical School.

This has meant a high pressure on Sfi G\u00e4vle when it comes to pedagogical, organisational and logistical competences. In order to meet new challenges the staff is in need of competence enhancement in various ways.

These meetings have led to an interest to use Erasmus + possibilities for competence development.\r\nIncreased internationalisation is a crucial part of the school's development plan which recently has started to evolve.\r\nThe goal of this project is twofold: on one hand it is about developing four staff members through job shadowing, on the other it is to establish a staff pilot group which can inspire colleagues to follow their example. The goal is furthermore to dissiminate what was learned to other teachers so that training can be delivered to others than only the group involved in travelling.\r\nFour (4) teachers will be the pilotgroup which starts this hopefully long development work. They will thoroughly plan the visit, contact the receiving organisation in order to create a well-designed programme, in Scotland they will job shadow colleagues, reflect on what they have experienced and finally spread their experiences to their home institution staff.\r\nIn a longer perspective Sfi G\u00e4vle intends to develop contacts with more international partners in order to boost competence raising of its staff, further exchange programmes and participating in greater European projects.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA104-034248_1"]]}, "nweurope": {"data": [["Dundee and Angus College", "UNEET - Professional integration of NW European young adults into the hotel, restaurant and catering sector", "UNEET proposes an innovative approach to foster the professional integration of NEETs (young adults Not in Education, Employment, and Training), by matching the recruitment needs of the hotel, restaurant and catering (HORECA) sector with the existing labour supply of young adults in 7 NWE regions.\nThe alarming youth unemployment rates in NWE regions (on average 18,8% in the project regions) and the need for better and integral solutions to tackle this issue, have pushed partner organisations to join their forces to conceive an ambitious employment driven project with a strong transnational dimension.\u00a0\nAn in-depth analysis has allowed the Consortium to identify the HORECA sector as the most suitable for the purposes of this project.
