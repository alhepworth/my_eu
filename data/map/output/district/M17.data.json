There is however a current trend for axles to be withdrawn from service before this because of corrosion on the surface long before their design lives. The decision to withdraw from service is taken without the full knowledge of the way in which the failure will result from corrosion, as this requires a crack to initiate and the mechanism for this is unknown. Cracks in axles can also initiate from ballast strikes and electrical faults. The failure rate is about 2 axles per year in the UK. If these withdrawals take place while a train is in-service there is a consequent significant cost associated while the train is out of service for additional maintenance. Inspection of the axles for cracking takes place at intervals set by knowledge of crack growth rates and inspection sensitivities. The most sensitive inspection methods are surface inspection methods designed for crack detection (such as MPI, eddy current and ACFM) and these do not typically attempt to measure the corrosion. However inspection of axles while the train is in service is still required and this is inconvenient and costly for the train operators. WOLAXIM aims to provide three new and better methods of crack detection and corrosion assessment for railway axle inspection. One method is for the exposed body of the axles (intended primarily for freight wagon or passenger trailing axles) and can be carried out automatically as the vehicles pass an inspection station that could be installed in carriage sidings or marshalling yards. A second method is specifically for the hollow axles of high speed trains and aims to improve the speed of the inspection and improve crack detection reliability. This could be deployed while the train is in depot overnight and without dismantling of the wheelset. The third method is to improve the measurement of corrosion and therefore the sentencing of corro", 16029.0, 1261622.0, 3, 9, "WOLAXIM", "http://www.wolaxim.eu", "http://www.lucchinirs.it", null, "fp7_96662_984299741"]]}}, "1GP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1333238400000, 1459382400000, "Ultra high performance MALDI mass spectrometer for basic research use and clinical applications", "Kratos Analytical Limited", "Mass spectrometry is an analytical science covering the multiple fields of chemistry, physics and biology. Each world has its specific needs and ways of producing and analysing samples. The world of clinical proteomics is complex since it involves a close interaction between doctors and hospital practitioners, not mass spectrometrists by nature, and analytical scientists. Several SMEs already enter the field; however none of the proposed solutions have yet reached the ultimate goal of producing the perfect software suite for clinicians and the right instrument for the challenge of ultimate biomarker discovery. However, this challenge is a never ending story since instrument capabilities to look for a needle in a haystack need to be improved continuously. The present Euro MALDI project aims at developing a new powerful proteomic solution for clinical applications. The proteomic platform will be composed of three main software for lipidomics, protein profiling and tandem mass spectrometry with a clinical interface and a high end MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectrometer. This challenge will be fulfilled by collaboration between academia (UnivMed) and an SME (Kratos). Kratos, a specialist in surface analysis and mass spectrometry ,will install a high end mass spectrometer in the premises of the centre for oncology and oncopharmacology (UnivMed/CRO2). CRO2 groups basic and clinical research teams as well as hospital practitioners. The centre has several core facilities such as technological platforms, biobanks, and animal nursing.  Moreover the centre has its own research team in proteomics.

The concept of the ILLUMINATE proposal is to develop automated systems that are able to effectively sort bulbs into different classes and remove foreign objects. This is essential for an economically viable process. The unit will be based on a sensor system combined with self-learning processing unit and will be able to recognize shapes, colours materials, and/or weight. To remedy the current situation where there is little or no separation of mercury containing from non mercury containing materials from bulbs at end of life, the ILLUMINATE project will develop methods and processes for two main areas of the supply chain: collection of the waste streams and sorting of the waste. Once the identification and separation has been achieved the materials from both mercury containing and non mercury containing waste streams can then be handled by the appropriate processing steps in order to cost effectively recycle the waste bulbs. This proposal aims at enhancing the current recycling chain by providing a complete process from collection to pre-processing of waste lamps. In addition to sorting the lamps into proper fractions, the sorting unit will be able to register the number and types of lamps (or other objects) passing through the unit, thereby enabling well-defined statistics on treated lamps and process disturbances due to non-lamp objects received.

THz technologies are also set to revolutionize a range of imaging, sensing, and quantum optics applications.\nRecently, tunneling devices have been shown to be the leading candidate in realizing compact, low cost, high performance THz transmitters and receivers once coupled to suitable antennas. Also, new two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene or 1D nanowires are emerging as suitable platforms for realising highly sensitive detectors of THz radiation.
