Many triggering effects make ESL a complex multisector phenomenon: school failure (disengagement, low achievement, transition between schools and school levels), pull effects from labour market, social and family situation. If it differs from country to country and from region to region, there are some recurrent features: children from vulnerable groups are more likely than others to leave the school system early. Boys are more affected than girls.\r\nThanks to the constant work on drop out preventive and intervention measures carried out by all TO_YOU TOO YOUNG TO FAIL partners, the partnership has pinpointed the need  to FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC AGE FRAMEWORK (10-15 years\u2013 including both Middle school, and moments of transition between school levels) in a broad number of regions, to tackle the issue, and potentially intervene when the problem starts arising. TO_YOU leading idea is that, if the causes of school failure and dropout can have roots in the pre-teen years, middle school - a potentially powerful learning time \u2013 becomes a critical \u201cmake or break\u201d period.\r\nTO_YOU has identified 3 core needs and objectives and designed associated actions.\r\nNeed 1 - to\r\n- provide a cross-sectorial platform of exchange of experiences and practices between partners with excellence initiatives in this area and of different backgrounds and missions,  thus fostering a mutual learning process. \r\n- grant access to a wide menu of consolidated comprehensive and cross sectorial prevention and intervention strategies tailored on the specified age group (best practice collection \u2013 innovative feature). \r\n- promote focused research on the broad issue of relationship/ social capital (peer-to-peer relationship, school leadership and family engagement) and on its potential impact on drop out measures (innovative feature). \r\nNeed 2\r\nThe school cannot and must not address independently the broad range of social, emotional and personal needs that affect the academic performance of children. A process is needed for the school and community to avoid isolation, develop a common vision, and build long lasting commitment and collaboration from policy makers, society, family and other stakeholders.\r\nA first important step in building such cohesive vision is to provide institutions' leaders with the essential content knowledge and materials necessary to develop successful school/community collaborations (reliable, flexible, adaptable and appealing  awareness raising /advocacy tools)\r\nNeed 3\r\nNeed for a continuous professional development and empowerment of teachers and school management, need for school staff to gain a deep understanding of ESL, enhance awareness on their own role in preventing it and to develop the skills to work with other professions and partners, in a \u201cwhole school approach\u201d (design, development, testing and sharing of specific training modules and support multimedia tools)\r\nThe two level focus on management/strategy (advocacy tools for school leadership) and education/ pedagogical tools (teachers/educators) represents an innovative feature.\r\nAnother innovative element of the project is the type of partnership. All 9 partners have a sound regional experience in tackling early drop out. 2 have furthermore participated in ESL related EU projects.\r\n TO_YOU brings together players with different backgrounds, missions (4 schools, 1 municipality, 2 non profit foundations, 1 employers association, 1 higher education body), geographic and social focus (IT, NL, ES, PT, UK).\r\n Moreover most partners have the means to share project outcomes with a significant number of local school communities, and stakeholders (e.g. public administrations, foundations/donors, education practitioners, academia and other stakeholders), well beyond the project boundaries.\r\nAll 4 schools (IT, UK, PT, NL) have experience in dealing with drop-out preventive and intervention schemes and are currently involved in relevant projects wit very different social, geographical and cultural contexts (ranging from excellence situations to highly critical environments).

There is growing evidence that maternal obesity increases the long term risk of CVD, T2D and neurodegenerative morbidity in the offspring. This project will clarify if and to what extent maternal obesity leads to premature and unhealthy ageing, by causing early, i.e. pre-/perinatal metabolic and genetic vulnerability, starting from insulin resistance and glucocorticoid exposure, leading to oxidative-stress, telomere/DNA damage, epigenetic changes, interacting with genetic and environmental variability, resulting in altered gene expression/repair, and ultimately in disease during life and pathological ageing.

The technological objective of the UVLED project is to enable UV coatings to cure using UV LED lamps at the same rate as conventional UV curing, without the need for an inert atmosphere. Our approach is to prepare new, high efficiency near-UV photoinitiator packages, by developing novel silicon- and germanium-based photoinitiators and new chemical methods of overcoming oxygen inhibition. As a result of the UVLED project, we expect to improve our collective competitiveness and generate increased sales of coating and equipment products into the EU industrial wood products market of at least \u20ac106M over a 5 year period. In addition, we estimate that an end-user with just one UV curing unit would save about \u20ac13K in energy costs per year, compared to the use of conventional UV curing lamp systems. We therefore expect to improve the competitiveness of the European coated wood products industry. Our consortium includes 4 SMEs that represent different aspects of the supply chain from photoinitiator manufacturer to the wood applicator. Although this project focuses on UV LED industrial wood coatings, the materials developed have extensive application to inks, vinyl flooring and conformal coatings too.
