As part of the School Improvement Plan, a rolling programme has been implemented to support class teacher delivery of modern languages, with a target completion date of 2019/20. The proposed immersion course will complement the school\u2019s existing strategy of embedding French (L2) in daily classroom practice across the whole school and the initial implementation of the teaching of Spanish (L3) in upper stages, with the support of the visiting specialist teacher. This strategy is also in line with the European Union Strategy for introducing modern languages at a young age.\r\n\r\nAs part of this development, all staff members have completed an audit of their skills in French language and training needs have been identified. The Head Teacher and staff have accessed information on immersion courses and all staff have been given the opportunity to apply for the course. The most appropriate course has been identified which meets the objectives of the school and Aberdeenshire. The proposed mobility is for 3 staff members, including the Languages Ambassador and the Head Teacher, to participate in an LFEE immersion course in Lyon, France, in October 2018. The prior knowledge of French of the 3 participants ranges from beginner\u2019s level French to GCSE and degree level studies. As part of the SCEL teacher leadership programme, one participant is also currently engaging in practitioner research into the role of modern language teaching in supporting the development of listening and talking skills across the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe potential benefits of this proposed mobility extend to all learners within our school. The participant teachers currently teach learners across both First and Second Levels of Curriculum for Excellence; moreover the Head Teacher has the overall responsibility for leading the teaching of French language across the whole school. The LFEE  course programme seems to be a good fit with the needs of the school and the local authority, offering differentiated courses, with an in-depth focus on language learning, pedagogy  and cultural awareness.\r\n\r\nDissemination of this project will take place at a National, Local Authority, Cluster and School level.  On a National level there may be the opportunity for participants to contribute to National Language events e.g. run by SCILT or Education Scotland.\r\nAt an Authority level, meetings with other Language Ambassadors can also be used to share best practice.  Here participant teachers will be invited to share the impact of their experience on learning and teaching in the school.  Platforms such as GLOW and Twitter will be utilised to share their learning with colleagues across Aberdeenshire and across Scotland. At a Cluster level, on their return, participants will lead twilight sessions to share best practice and useful resources with interested participants from cluster schools.  At a School level it is expected that all participant teachers will have greater confidence in their ability to teach French. Enhanced cultural awareness will also be beneficial, in that ideas of contemporary France can be passed on to pupils across the school. The impact on the school teaching staff will be that all practitioners will have an improved approach to the teaching of modern languages in a more ad hoc way, rather than relying on specialist input once per week. It is hoped the participant teachers can offer twilight training sessions to share the information gathered on the immersion course with all school staff. The whole school will benefit from the enhanced level of methodological expertise in the teaching of Modern Languages. We will be able to add a European dimension to our curriculum, thereby strengthening inter-cultural awareness in our school.\r\n\r\nIn future years our school would like to build upon the work of this mobility by selecting staff members to participate in immersion courses in Spain, as part of our long term strategy to develop the use of two modern languages within our school. \r\nIn terms of professional development, the participant teachers intend to apply for GTCS accreditation in the teaching of modern languages as a result of their participation in the course. An integral part of this process is self-reflection and measuring impact. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to enable learners in our school to benefit from greatly increased opportunities in language learning. The school is registered for eTwinning and within the next twelve months the school intends to forge links with a partner school in Europe in order to create an authentic cultural context for our language use. This focus on European and international links will combine well with the current Scottish Government programme of Developing the Young Workforce (DYW).", "http://www.newburghmathers.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Newburgh Mathers School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047023_coordinator"]]}}, "6DZ": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "HIGHLAND STATISTICS LTD*", 544.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the 'Direct research' policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2016_54150"]]}}, "8BN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1325376000000, 1451520000000, "Developmental neurotoxicity assessment of mixtures in children", "Callisto Productions Ltd", "Various recent epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to low doses of environmental biologically active contaminants during human development can alter gene expression and have deleterious effects on cognitive development in childhood. The DENAMIC project is ultimately focused on reducing such effects of environmental contamination on learning and developmental disorders in children.

Key elements are: development of sophisticated tools and methods for early warning and screening of compounds for neurotoxicity, to study mechanisms of disease development and the role of individual susceptibility, to improve assessment of exposures and effects, focus on combined exposures to environmental agents that can interact to enhance adverse effects and reduction of health inequalities of children through Europe. One of the main aims of DENAMIC is to develop tools and methods for neurotoxic effects of mixtures of environmental pollutants at low levels, possibly resulting in (subclinical) effects on learning (cognitive skills) and developmental disorders in children (e.g ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and anxiety disorders). A broad suite of contaminants will be included in the studies, with options to bring in new chemicals in case evidence comes up during the project.
