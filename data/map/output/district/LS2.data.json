There are still only a few dance companies specialising in inclusive dance across Europe and of these most have developed their methodology through working in an integrated way with dancers with a wide range of needs and abilities (physical disabilities, learning disabilities). This project has grown from a need to fill a gap in current inclusive dance practice and the resources available to dance practitioners at community, educational and professional levels as it focuses specifically on the development of technical dance skills in dancers with learning disabilities. Through coming together, these organisations will gain an understanding of current best practice, strive for excellence and create pedagogy that addresses effective approaches to delivery with a focus on safe practice and to raise the profile and skills of learning disabled dancers across Europe. \r\n\r\nThe resource will be translated into English, Spanish and Dutch and will provide a toolkit that will include instructional videos that demonstrate the exercises and activities, alongside lesson plans and other download-able teaching resources. It will also include evaluation and feedback methods that have been developed through the project.\r\nThe project involves 11 members of staff from the three partner organisations and 25 dancers with learning disabilities whom the companies work with regularly. An additional 2 associate partners will be involved to provide expert knowledge and 5 sub-contractors will provide specialised services.\r\nThe project will consist of five residencies (learning, teaching and training activities) held in Leeds (UK), Rotterdam (NL) and Madrid (ES), a transnational meeting to consolidate the content of the OER and a multiplier event, Expressions 2020. The first residency (UK, Sept 2018) will enable the partners to share best practice, deepen their knowledge of safe practice and injury prevention in relation to learning disabled dancers and develop monitoring and evaluation methods to be used throughout the project.  The following three residencies will each focus on a different area of dance pedagogy; alignment and strength (UK, Jan 2019), balance and co-ordination (NL, April 2019), and locomotion and elevation (ES, Sept 2019). During these residencies, exercises, activities and approaches to delivery will be explored and developed.  Between each residency, these will then be tested on each partners\u2019 dancers with learning disabilities over a 10-week period using the monitoring and evaluation tools developed to measure and chart progress.  \r\nDuring the fifth residency all partners will focus on evaluation and reflection and the creation of an initial brief to produce the Dance Re-Skilled OER, which will be finalised at the transnational meeting in April 2020. This will also provide an opportunity to plan a collaborative multiplier event to launch the Dance Re-Skilled OER and involve chaired discussions, demonstrations of the pedagogy and resource and performances by Ability, Stitching Misiconi\u2019s Company and Fritsch Company from PBMLF.\r\nThe methodology partners will use will follow an action research model of self-reflective enquiry to improve the rationality and justice of our own practices and to deepen understanding of our own practices through sharing knowledge, approaches and planning.  An external evaluator will work with the partner organisations throughout the project, supporting the process and dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nThe project will result in: \r\n(1) Increased knowledge of physical symptoms that are prevalent with certain learning disabilities and the development of specific exercises and approaches that will address these\r\n(2) The creation of a pedagogy for teaching dance technique to adults with learning disabilities\r\n(3) The development of new strategies that will enable learners to access class material more easily across Europe\r\n(4) The creation of the Dance Re-Skilled OER sharing the new pedagogy. \r\nThe expected impact includes a higher skilled workforce of dance practitioners leading to increased quality and excellence in dance activity for learning disabled dancers across Europe.

Influenza infections affect all age groups but children and adults over the age of 65 are at most risk of developing severe disease.\nVaccination is the most effective approach to reduce the impact of annual influenza outbreaks and potential pandemics, however, the currently criteria of correlates of protection(CoP) show limitations in predicting protection for seasonal and pandemic vaccines. \nThe Haemagglutinin Inhibition(HAI) antibody titre is the most widely used CoP for seasonal influenza vaccine even if there is a lack of standardisation for conducting HAI and other serological assays and therefore  results obtained from different laboratories are not comparable. This leads to the urgent need of  improving international standardisation of serological assays to reduce inter laboratory variability and to generate supportive immunological assays to be used in studies aimed at developing clinically relevant surrogate markers of protection of influenza vaccines.\nObjectives: The main long-term aim of the FLUCOP project is to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and to develop new assays for the better evaluation of the CoP of influenza vaccines.\nMain specific FLUCOP objectives include:\n-\tachieve standardization of HAI and Virus Neutralization(VN) assays;\n-\tpromote the understanding and application of Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and Neuraminidase (NA) assays as tools for the evaluation of influenza vaccines; \n-\tdevelop selective new assays which might potentially used for future clinical trials for influenza seasonal vaccine evaluation\nFLUCOP Consortium and Project Impact: The FLUCOP consortium brings together 26 groups from 7 European countries, and includes contributors from the academic, governmental, non-for-profit and pharmaceutical sectors. As a whole, the consortium has a balanced array of expertise and each group has been carefully selected to avoid overlaps in research activities and to collectively address the planned objectives. FLUCOP is expected to have a significant impact to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and develop new assays to better evaluate influenza vaccines. This will contribute to the future clinical trial evaluation and possible establishment of correlates of protection Through a public-private collaboration FLUCOP will reach a common agreement on assays and methods to be used by all groups both from the public and private sector for testing influenza vaccines in humans. These efforts are expected to aid evolution of the regulatory guidelines and the practice of the pharmaceutical industry following the application of the methods to efficacy studies.\nProject plan: To reach the proposed objectives, the FLUCOP project is composed of five focused interconnected work packages(WP).\nWP1:Standardization of HAI and VN assays.\nObjective: HAI and VN assays are commonly used to quantify influenza specific antibodies but they show to be highly variable between laboratories. Moreover different protocols are in use in different laboratories, which may contribute to the variability of the assays. This WP aims to improve the standardization and harmonization of these assays and also preparation and qualification of critical reagents.\nMethodology: Adult and paediatric pre and post influenza vaccination serum samples will be available to consortium partners who are recognized as leading experts in serological analysis of influenza vaccine responses.

Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

It is now a serious public health crisis of international concern. The numbers of cases are still increasing 11 months after the first case was described (December 2013): by mid-November 2014 approximately 15000 individuals have been infected and the epidemic is still not under control. The direct effects of this outbreak include disruption of standard medical care, insecurity and social disruption in countries that were already struggling to recover from decades of war. One of the most important key actions to limit and stop the spread of this deadly disease is to identify and isolate the EBOV-infected patients. The diagnosis of Ebola Virus infections has in the past, been performed overwhelmingly in specialist reference laboratories with high-performance molecular, serological and culture methods. In recent years many of these functions have been mobilised into rapid response mobile laboratories. Indeed several of these units supported by European, CDC/USA, Canadian, Chinese and African states have been set up to help the current outbreak by performing laboratory diagnosis, in collaboration with national centres in West Africa. While this type of response has been effective in helping control past EVD outbreaks in rural parts of Africa, it has not been as effective at controlling the current outbreak, which is now spreading in densely populated city and slum areas. Unfortunately, the diagnostic procedures currently used in the mobile laboratories are associated with several problems: i) there are a limited number of diagnostic hubs, ii) performing the diagnostic tests correctly requires specialist training, skill and experience, consequently there a limited numbers of trained staff, iii) the distance between the point of care and diagnostic hubs means that patients cannot be rapidly isolated and thus spread the virus and iv) there are serious biosafety aspects of handling and transporting hazard group 4 infectious samples from hospitals/emergency medical units to the diagnostic hubs. \nThe EbolaMoDRAD project plans to investigate and focus our activities on developing robust, sensitive and rapid diagnostic tools that can be used at the point of care for field investigation. The complexity of the technical issues to be addressed requires a broad and multidisciplinary network of experts. EbolaMoDRAD will build existing leading-edge expertise in Europe and Africa, and bring these together with new networks of scientists who will work towards solving important public health issues concerning EVD that cannot be resolved by individual groups. \nThe overall aim of EbolaMoDRAD is to develop and deliver rapid bedside diagnostic tool(s) that will significantly increase our capacity to handle the current situation of EVD in West Africa and also future outbreaks, within a 24 month period. \nThe project will be a multidisciplinary research consortium drawn from key European and African research organisations, thus consolidating previous tools and knowledge.

Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions.

Hence, to directly promote weight management, there is an immense need to design satiety-enhancing foods that terminate appetite for longer periods after consumption. Although the concept of \u201csatiety cascade\u201d was proposed nearly 20 years ago, the changing dynamics of food properties in the oral mucosa remains the greatest source of uncertainty in food design. In particular, our quantitative multi-scale understanding of lubrication of the human salivary film when exposed to stimuli from food biomolecules, which in turn can have significant appetite suppression consequences, remains poorly understood. The key limitation to accurately measure oral lubrication is the lack of tribo-contact surfaces that effectively emulate the oral surfaces (i.e. the soft, slippery mucous-coated human tongue and the upper palate).\n\nI intend to address these deficiencies by proposing a whole hierarchy of scales (from human scale down to nanometres). To do so, I will use a unique combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to quantitatively establish molecular mechanisms of salivary lubrication and its psychological and physiological consequences.

Seven different chip-based sensor elements will be developed and hierarchically combined via a flow system to characterise toxicity pathways of NM. The HISENTS platform allows the grouping and identifying of NM. Parallel to the screening, the pathway and interaction of NM in biological organisms will be simulated using the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Using the different sensor modules from the molecular to cell to organ level, HISENTS can input quantitative parameters into the PBPK model resulting in an effective pathway analysis for NM and other critical compounds. The developed platform is crucial for realistic nano-safety assessment and will also find extensive application in pharmaceutical screening due to the flexible modifications of the HTP platform. The specific objective is the development of a multimodular HTP platform as new a screening tool for enhancing the efficiency of hazard profiling. Currently, no such flexible, easy-to-use screening platform with flexibly combinable chip-based sensors is available on the market.", 1217008.0, 5461359.0, 8, 12, "HISENTS", null, "http://www.leeds.ac.uk", null, "h2020_200813_999975426"], [1293840000000, 1475193600000, "Extreme biophysics: single molecule characterisation of extremophilic protein folding", "University of Leeds", "Extremophilic (extreme-loving) organisms have evolved unique features to enable them to function in extreme environmental conditions.

Recent landmark trials, showing that intensive glucose control does not improve cardiovascular outcomes and may increase mortality in some circumstances, provide a compelling rationale for intense research aimed at developing novel therapeutic strategies. Type 2 diabetes is underpinned by resistance to the effects of insulin, which I have shown in endothelial cells causes reduced bioavailability of the anti-atherosclerotic molecule nitric oxide and leads to accelerated atherosclerosis.  The cellular effects of insulin are mirrored by insulin-like growth factor factor-1, the bioavailability of which at its receptor is in turn is regulated by a family of high affinity binding proteins (IGFBP). Epidemiological studies demonstrate and inverse association between one of these binding proteins, IGFBP1, and diabetes-related cardiovascular risk.

These interactions take place between surfaces of materials, and so control friction, wear and lubrication behavior. Understanding the nature of these interactions on the macro, micro and nano scales and solving the technological problems associated with interfacial phenomena are the very essence of tribology. The subject of tribology matters because so much of the world\u2019s energy, the majority of which is produced from non-renewable resources, is consumed in overcoming friction and replacing prematurely worn components. Many studies have shown that lessening the amount of energy used in this way is one of best ways we can reduce our impact on environment.Tribology incorporates many disciplines, including mechanical engineering, materials science, mechanics, surface chemistry and physics and a multitude of subjects, such as surface characterization, friction, wear, lubrication, thin films, coatings, materials, lubricants and selection and design of lubrication systems and contact properties. The subject of tribology is at the core of engineering science and is now one of its most dynamic and rapidly advancing areas of research. The field of tribology, functional surfaces/interfaces is very much both interdisciplinary and intersectoral \u2013universities, research centers, medical facilities, big industry, SMEs\u2013and is becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. The primary consequence of this is that scientists and engineers who are working in tribology need to accrue an incredibly diverse range of skills and knowledge.

Unfortunately, the gap between \u201cwhat is taught\u201d and \u201cwhat is needed in real life\u201d is not closing, not in terms of content nor in delivery of teaching and practiced learning. EU \"Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan\" stresses the importance of practical experiential learning models and experience of real-world entrepreneurs in education; suggesting entrepreneurial learning methodologies into the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe Project is about compiling an open access digital video case library in International Business (IB), aiming towards more attractive education and training in higher education and in VET. This digital platform is structured similar to an IB textbook. However, in this web and video based version, students do not need to read through the chapters of a textbook. Instead, all information is delivered in a video format, each chapter being covered with real life cases. In addition, chapters are explained by top executives instead of academics. Top executives talk about a specific problem that they faced in the IB area and how they solved it. Following these video cases, a questions and answers (Q&A) section is added to the video by academics. The Q&A section is similar to teaching notes in printed case studies or textbooks and can be used as part of class discussion, linking the specific example to the theory in each chapter. \r\n\r\nThe Project partners are: KU Leuven, Belgium; University of Leeds, UK; University of Ljubljana, Slovenia; Poznan University of Economics and Business, Poland and El Izi, UK; KU Leuven being the Applicant Organisation. Each of the four universities are known for their academic excellence and research strengths, covering a wide geography among EU countries. El Izi, UK takes part in the Project as an SME, bringing the technical know-how and prior experience of conducting a similar project in Marketing. The partners have jointly decided to take this Project beyond its present scope, testing, adapting and expanding it according to the needs of the EU. Therefore the Project in line with \u201cEurope Strategy 2020\u201d, involves cooperation and collaboration of partners in the field of Higher Education while introducing an innovative method towards more attractive learning. The Project idea itself is an example of Open Educational Resource (OER), with core values of: Open access, education for all, equality in education and integration of innovative teaching methods with digital technologies - all aligned with the objectives of Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nOne of the main intellectual outputs of the Project will be the development of a new video case collection for IB under MNCs Whiper\u2019g name, both for the academic world and the business, narrated by top executives of well-known companies, by employing innovative teaching methods and using digital technology. Anybody who wants (both youth and adults) to learn IB will be able to benefit from this e-learning digital tool which will allow learners to get free access to it whenever and wherever they wish to log in; irrespective of their socio-economic background, leading to equity and inclusion of education for youth and adults who might otherwise face economic, cultural or geographic obstacles. This supports the idea of flexible learning in line with learners' needs and objectives, as a tool for continuing education programme. More specifically, partners will produce 12 video cases and share with the IB community through its website at www.mncswhispering.com. The Project also addresses the international dimension and multilingualism, as these case videos will be produced in English, Dutch, Polish, and Slovenian; but all will have English dubbing as the lingua franca of IB. In addition, the Project will produce intellectual outputs on IB curriculum and best practices in IB teaching, based on survey results, pilot studies conducted in four universities, classroom applications, participant feedbacks with the joint collaboration of partners.\r\n\r\nThe major impact of the Project will be on IB students and lecturers, who will be exposed to entepreneurial learning with the help of  digitalization.
