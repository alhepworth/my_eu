The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.\nThe digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.\nHowever there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network \u2013 everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.\nThis is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.\nThe time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.\nThe services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets.

A focused search for alternative materials with comparable performance is without doubt the most important task to improve this technology. The key challenge is to make CLC less dependent on expensive nickel-based oxygen carrier materials. This project addresses this by investigating two groups of particles: (i) nickel-free materials with and without taking advantage of molecular oxygen uncoupling (CLOU); (ii) the mixed oxides concept, using mainly non-nickel materials with high reactivity towards CO/H2, together with a minor fraction of particles of reduced nickel content acting as reforming catalyst (i.e. transferring CH4 to CO/H2). Oxygen carrier particles will be prepared and investigated using available laboratory reactor equipment. Subsequently, production of large batches will be investigated for the most promising candidates. Existing CLC units at a scale of 10-200 kW will be used to investigate real life performance and operation stability.", 185654.0, 3282219.0, 6, 7, "INNOCUOUS", null, "http://www.matthey.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112442.jpg", "fp7_95759_999947102"], [1377993600000, 1472601600000, "Stable Interfaces for Rechargeable Batteries", "Johnson Matthey Plc", "SIRBATT (Stable Interfaces for Rechargeable Batteries) is a multisite collaborative project consisting of 12 full partners from the European Area (6 Universities, 1 Research Institute and 5 industrial partners). Collaboration with leading battery research groups in the USA and Japan is also considered. The diversity of the research organisations in the partnership has been chosen to provide a wide range of complementary expertise in areas relating to the study of battery electrode interfaces, covering both experimental and theoretical aspects of this important contemporary area. SIRBATT will develop microsensors to monitor internal temperature and pressure of lithium cells in order to maintain optimum operating conditions to allow long-life times that can be scaled for use in grid scale batteries. The cells will comprise of candidate electrode materials in which the complex interfacial region and surface layers have been well characterised and understood via utilisation of a suit of advanced in situ measurement techniques complemented by application of transformative modelling methods. The knowledge from these studies will be used to develop candidate electrode materials with an optimised cycle life and stability, for example by the use of novel stable lithium salts and the inclusion of stable film forming additives into the electrolyte.

Two different strategies will be followed and demonstrated at three different end users facilities to achieve CO2 separation:\n- A combination of Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMM) for pre- and post-combustion, \n- A combination of metallic membranes and sorbents into an advanced Membrane Assisted Sorption Enhanced Reforming (MA-SER) process for pure H2 production with integrated CO2 capture\nIn both cases, a significant decrease of the total cost of CO2 capture will be achieved. MEMBER targets CO2 capture technologies that separate >90% CO2 at a cost below 40\u20ac/ton for post combustion and below 30\u20ac/ton for pre-combustion and H2 production. \nTo achieve this objective, MEMBER has been built on the basis of the best materials and technologies developed in three former FP7 projects, ASCENT, M4CO2 and FluidCELL. In particular, special attention will be paid to the manufacturing processes scale up of key materials and products such as Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), polymers, membranes and sorbents. \nAt the end of the project we will deliver a robust demonstration of the new materials at real conditions (TRL 6) by designing, building, operating and validating three prototype systems tested at industrial relevant conditions:\n- Prototype A targeted for pre-combustion in a gasification power plant using MMM at the facilities of CENER (BIO-CCS). \n- Prototype B targeted for post-combustion in power plants using MMM at the facilities of GALP.\n- Prototype C targeted for pure hydrogen production with integrated CO2 capture using (MA-SER) at the facilities of IFE-HyNor", 184450.0, 8366620.0, 9, 17, "MEMBER", null, "http://www.matthey.com", null, "h2020_212844_999947102"], [1283299200000, 1409443200000, "Innovative Synthesis in Continuous-Flow Processes for Sustainable Chemical Production", "Johnson Matthey Plc", "The SYNFLOW vision is the paradigm shift from batch-wise large volume processes in pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and intermediates production comprising many separate unit operations towards highly integrated but yet flexible catalytic continuous flow processing.

The SYNFLOW mission is to overcome the traditional way of linear process development providing individual solutions for specific products, and to demonstrate the technological, economic and ecological superiority of truly \u201edesigning\u201c processes by application of advanced chemical and engineering knowledge. The SYNFLOW concept is based on the definition of generic challenges with industrial relevance, represented by Case Studies provided by the industrial consortium members. Catalyst development, studies of the underlying chemical target transformations (synthetic methodology), tailored reaction engineering, conceptual process design and process evaluation interact closely in order to substantiate the SYNFLOW vision. Its success will be demonstrated on a relevant production scale as a reference for the entire European Chemical Industry. The SYNFLOW consortium brings together major industrial producers from the Pharmaceuticals, Fine Chemicals and Intermediates sectors, providers of process technology and technical catalyst supply.
