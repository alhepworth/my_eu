We see that the results are exceptional in many ways on the Children involved in this practice. . \r\nThis experience has led to cooperation with different Nature based Kindergartens, also abroad. We have had a lot of cooperation with the Scottish partners, and have decided that this work is much to important not to give wide attendance in all of Europe. So we have contacted 2 new partners that is relevant in this project, and we think we have got a strong case.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT; \r\nWe have focused on 3 main objectives:\r\n   1.   A description on different ways of conducting the nature focus in the childcare sector in 4 European Countries.\r\n   2.   A presentation of best practice in 4 Nature-kindergartens in 4 different European Countries, describing methods and philosophy.\r\n   3.   Making a learning Video of best practice in 4 Nature-kindergartens in 4 European Countries, to use in education and as\r\n         inspiration together with the other material.\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS; \r\nThere are 4 different Nature-kindergartens in 4 different Countries involved:\r\n- From Scotland we have the Mindstretchers Organization, represented with Auchlone Nature-kindergarten. They have a base in a  little old farmhouse in the countryside, and an area outside consisting of a large outdoor-space which they have formed out together with the Children, + a large part of the nearby Woods, also including a small Pond. They are basically working with the system and philosophy of \"Talking and thinking Floor-books\", which is reflected in creating learning paths through the Children's own initiative and ways of thinking. It is also a very good method for documentation.\r\n- From England we have the Boldon Nursery School. They are an urban institution, in the middle of the City. They have a modern Kindergarten on ground level, with possibility to open big sliding doors on the side of the building facing the outdoor area. In that way they can include the indoors to the outdoor area in their activities. They have built a outdoor area on a nature model, trying to reflect different natural environments. They are also leaning heavily on the \"Talking and thinking Floor book\" methods.\r\n- From the Czech Republic we have Zakladni a materska skola Jurta. They are situated outside Decin Town, in a rural environment, surrounded with farmland and big forest areas. There are lots of farming and animals involved in their everyday life. They have their own modern \"school building\", but are mostly outside through the days. They have made their own base up in the woods about 20-30 min. away, and spend most of their days in that area.\r\n- From Norway we have Hval G\u00e5rd Naturbarnehage. They are based in several small cabins without electric heating. They are practically outside all the time. The Cabins are set on the outskirts of a larger Kindergartens area, with open woodlands all around, and close to the Sea. They also have a big Boat, and some smaller ones, to go fishing and traveling with the groups on the sea and surrounding Islands. They also have a mini-bus to use for going on longer trips in the Community surroundings. They are also working with \"Talking and thinking Floor-books\" as a method.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES: \r\n* Planning through meetings every 6 months of the Project groups (2 persons) from each Country, with evaluation of visits and making reports. Also planning further ahead.\r\n* 1 study visit  with the Working-groups (4 persons) from each Country to the other Country's Kindergartens.\r\n* Working with documentation in the field every day - pictures and video mostly.\r\nMETHODOLOGY TO BE USED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT; \r\n* Video meetings with reporting from each of the Countries to the Norwegian administration every Month.\r\n* Making reports on the progress of the project on our Internet site.\r\n* Administrating and publishing on our Facebook site\r\n* Gradually through the 3 years-putting together a Report and a Video documentary from each Country. Also to be evaluated in the\r\n   Project group meetings, and putting it all together at the end.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF RESULTS AND IMPACT ENVISAGED: \r\nWe observe self confident children, with great qualities on cooperating with other children and good ability on finding creative ways of problem solving. Physically strong Children,which can manage in almost every situation, and they can handle a lot of necessary tools. They have also learned a lot about contrasts like cold / warm, exhausted/comfortable, passive learning/deep studies.\r\nTHE POTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS:\r\nGreat lasting learning potential. Socially strong and very healthy Children. Great social Capital. New learning models presented. Inspiration to Personnel and Organizations.

We have 8 members of staff and 40 pupils, with one member of staff being trained to delivery French. Our objective of the project is to enable us as a school to be able to implement the Scottish Government's initiative (1+2) by offering both French and Spanish. We require a member of staff to be trained to deliver Spanish lessons, whereby they feel confident enough to provide adequately pitched lessons that engage and motivate pupils in learning a third language. The course will also enable us to learn about the cultural aspect of Spain as a country, rather than just language acquisition, in order to encourage our pupils to become responsible citizens that are aware of different countries and cultures. I will be the only participant on the immersion course, due to the fact that I am the only other member of staff working full-time. This will enable me to ensure a whole school approach to incorporating Spanish in our school setting. I have a love of languages, having studied French to Higher level at school but do not feel confident enough to provide Spanish, having knowledge of only a few key words/phrases. We aim to provide a variety of activities following attendance on the immersion course. An annual event will be that of a dedicated language week each year, involving a range of different activities aimed at developing our knowledge of the Spanish language and our awareness of cultural aspects of Spain. Seeking to expand on our existing good practice, we will incorporate Spanish into our monthly achievement assembles to recognise progress in the area of modern languages. As we are already twinned with schools in both Canada and France, we welcome the opportunity to broaden this to include a Spanish school. Our previous experience of exchanging letters, monthly newsletters and the sharing of information about our respective countries, such as rainfall, temperature etc, will be of use when establishing a link with a school in Spain. In addition, cookery is an ongoing focus of ours and we will broaden our provision to include traditional Spanish dishes, thereby enhancing our experience of the Spanish culture and encouraging pupils to explore other cuisines. The impact of the immersion course will be that I will be trained and feel confident enough to deliver engaging Spanish lessons in our school. I will have a better understanding of the Spanish language, including the content and skills to be explored and developed. In addition, I will know the progression pathway that will be followed and how to build on previous learning to ensure a good grasp of Spanish. By visiting Spain I will have gained a real flavour of the country and be able to communicate this to my pupils in order to develop their own awareness of another culture, with the support of books and others resources gathered when on the course. This training will also help to develop the knowledge and skills of colleagues in my own school, as well as other schools within our cluster of schools. We do not have anybody trained to deliver Spanish within our cluster so I would be able to provide training on how to approach incorporating Spanish into their curriculum through INSET days and stage group meetings. By learning about different teaching methodologies and how to apply them, I will be able to share these with others, as well as relevant resources to support them whilst delivering Spanish lessons. I will also have the benefit of building links with teachers from other European countries, thereby allowing me to benefit from and share good practice. The longer term benefits of my attendance on this course is that our pupils will experience two modern languages in our setting, helping them to develop their knowledge of both the French and Spanish languages. This will also develop their awareness of other countries and their cultures. I believe that merely learning a language is not enough and that a full appreciation of the language must be gained, together with a real sense of the culture behind it. It is vital for young people become aware of the wider world, especially for pupils in a small, rural school like mine. This allows them to recognise how other cultures are similar or different to our own culture and they are encouraged to look beyond their own country/culture. Thereby they will be supported to develop into respectful citizens, both on a local and global level.", "http://www.aberuthven.pkc.sch.uk", "Aberuthven Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002092_coordinator"]]}}, "1PN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "A Step Beyond 2018", "Duchally House Leisure Limited", 85026.0, 4, 16, "According to the curriculum for our type of school, students must participate in an internship for 12 weeks.
