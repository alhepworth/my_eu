Conventional ultrasonic inspection of high manganese steel is ineffective due to the inherent coarse grain structure and the highly anisotropic and non-homogeneous material properties; low material penetration, high scattering and beam divergence contribute to low signal-to-noise ratio of reflected signals. Conventional dual phased array techniques (with transmitter/receiver pair) have been applied in conjunction with processing features such as spatial averaging and dynamic depth focussing. However, this approach is highly inefficient and therefore inappropriate for practical deployment.\n\nThe SAFTInspector proposal will enable efficient in-service inspection of manganese rail assets by applying Phased Array UT full matrix capture in combination with a novel post processing technique called Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). This technique increases the available angular range of inspection by synthesising a large aperture transducer; therefore spatially averaging noise contributions from grain structure, allowing an increase in Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and increasing the potential signal response from a defect.\n\nThe aim is to design a novel array transducer working in a full matrix capture (FMC) mode. This novel design will enable efficient acquisition of data for SAFT processing. SAFT post processing will generate 2D and 3D reconstructions of the ultrasonic volumetric image to produce a simple pass or fail indication for the user.  This will dramatically reduce the time required at the asset and effectively remove the need for additional interpretation by highly skilled operators.", null, 1155014.0, 3, 8, "SAFTINSPECT", "http://www.saftinspect.eu", "http://www.albaultrasound.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112343.jpg", "fp7_105812_953544242"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "TH!NK: youth & the post-truth era", "A&M Scotland", 18823.0, 6, 6, "The project \u201cMake it happen!\u201d is a 7-day long international youth exchange that will bring together 30 young people from six different countries: Portugal, Spain, Poland, Estonia, Italy and Macedonia It will take place in Lisbon, Portugal between October, 10th and 16th, 2017. The working language of the exchange will be English. \r\n\r\nEach year the editorial board of the Oxford Dictionary chooses the, so called, word of the year. In 2016 this title was given to the neologism \u201cpost-truth,\u201d which is meant as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d The term itself appeared as early as in the 90s, however only now has it moved into the mainstream, being especially used within the context of such recent events as the Brexit, the refugee crisis, the Trump candidacy and presidency or the Russian propaganda concerning the situation in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe reason we want to implement this youth exchange is because we are concerned with the post-truth politics being ever more present within the EU and EU-neighboring countries. We notice that we are now living in times when more and more politicians are appealing to people\u2019s emotions and fears, rather than to their reason. The politics is being based upon constant information noise, in which the boundary between a fact and an opinion, a truth and a falsehood, information and misinformation, becomes blurry. In this environment, in which even long and repeatedly disclaimed falsehoods can carry on \u201cliving\u201d, the politicians do not try to diagnose and solve existing problems based on evidence and facts. Instead, they strive to provoke strong emotions and appeal to a prejudice already existing within the society, oftentimes using slogans devoid of any connection to the reality.\r\n\r\nThis youth exchange has 3 main themes: current affairs (media&politics), critical thinking and youth participation. We think that the only way we can combat the post-truth politics is by working on developing the critical and analytical thinking skills within the society and by promoting the freedom of press. This particular project will be focused on youth and it will be the youngsters themselves, who will create the final product of the project: an NFE module/activity on this Youth Exchange\u00b4s topic. In the follow-up phase the youngsters will implement the activity within their communities, as well as spread it in their countries, encouraging teachers and student associations to implement it as part of their formal civic education or history classes. The activity will also be described in a brochure that will be available on-line on partner organizations\u00b4 websites.\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, non-formal education methodology will be used and the project has the following objectives:\r\n- to help young people to develop their critical and analytical thinking capabilities\r\n- to promote pluralism, freedom of press and freedom of expression\r\n- to combat populism, radicalization/extremism, censorship and propaganda\r\n- to encourage youth to follow current national and EU affairs\r\n- to empower youngsters to create a new NFE module on critical thinking in the post-truth era\r\n- to promote peer learning and inclusion of the NFE methodology in formal education settings\r\n- to promote critical thinking among the European society in general\r\n- to promote the knowledge of Bairro Padre Cruz and Carnide areas\r\n- to create intercultural learning moments among the participants and between them and the community of Carnide\r\n- to enhance participants\u00b4 ICT skills (especially social media and video-making)\r\n\r\nMain activities within the project:\r\n\u2013 workshops (NFE methodology)\r\n\u2013 street interviews & video-edition\r\n\u2013 presentations on current situation in home countries\r\n\u2013 documentary watching & debating\r\n\u2013 study visits (museum & newspaper offices)\r\n\u2013 preparation of an NFE module on critical thinking in the post-truth era\r\n\u2013 implementation of the NFE module with sending organizations\u00b4 support", "http://www.aandm.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-PT02-KA105-004462_5"], [2017, "EuropEVS", "A&M Scotland", 3905.0, 5, 5, "The EuropEVS seminar will gather organizations working with disadvantaged young people from 5 European countries (Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Scotland and Greece) at Jugendakademie Walberberg (JAW), Germany, from the 15th till the 18th of May 2017, including travel days. \r\n\r\nWith many partners from across Europe we have been carrying out various international and intercultural projects for young people, especially for those with fewer opportunities and/or with migrant backgrounds.
