The idea of the project comes from the current concerns of the younger generation, who seem to have so much available, that they often end up thinking that either these opportunities are not for them either unable to pick their focus. The objectives of this project is to support 5 foreign volunteers facing similar situation to create their pathway while at the same time supporting their peers in Croatia and Zagreb to do the same. The volunteers joining this project will be also chosen based on the fact that they are facing fewer opportunities to join educational and mobility project, and thus grow. In a wider perspective, this project is what we see as a base to improve several aspects of life-quality of the local community, such as increasing one's own employability, learning a new language, become more tolerant towards other cultures and gaining new practical skills, which will also be the greatest impact of the project for all the communities and organisations involved. The project will include supporting Syncro in setting up a youth info center with systematic following of young people who seek information, and systematic promotion of educational opportunities. It will also involve several foster homes and similar institutions where the volunteers will be taking a role of a foreign buddy for one year. As a part of finding their own course in life, the volunteers will each prepare an event for local people, that they will later repeat in their respective communities. As a result, we will have five events happening in Zagreb and involving more then 500 people, and events in Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Italy; we will empower many young people from foster homes in Zagreb to take a step towards improving their lives, and we will support many young people from Zagreb and Croatia to find their own way in life while getting educated and while getting a significant international experience at the same time.", "http://www.xchangescotland.org", null, "erasmus_2015-3-HR01-KA105-021539_6"], [2014, "EVS in Styria", "XCHANGE SCOTLAND", 24071.0, 5, 8, "\u201eSchule im Pfeifferhof \u2013 Knallerbse\u201c is a non-profit alternative school initiated by parents for their children.

Youth unemployment rates are historically four to five times more than the adult rates in every country in the world. In 2012, youth made up to 40% of the world unemployed. Close to 75 million youth were unemployed worldwide. The quality and relevance of education is often considered as the first root cause of youth unemployment. Yet, high education does not guarantee a decent job. One global survey found that more than 55% of employers worldwide believe there is a \u201cskill crisis\u201d as businesses witness a growing mismatch between the skills students learn in the education system and those required in the workplace. \r\nWithin the frameworks of this project we want to promote volunteering as an important tool for unemployment solution. Different types of volunteering \u2013 short-termed and long-termed EVS, engagement with local CSOs and charities, internships in NGOs and businesses \u2013 all these types of activities increase person\u2019s chances for employment. Volunteering a person gets new skills and knowledge, learns useful tools, gets experience of teamwork and subordination. In many cases the experience of volunteering changes the person\u2019s attitudes towards their life plans changing the direction of what kind of employment they are looking for. Volunteering creates new working places, develops entrepreneurship, contributes to person\u2019s CV.\r\nThere are different levels of youth involvement into volunteering activities in different countries. While in Western Europe it\u2019s quite common for students to take a year off studies to volunteer abroad or to be involved in number of local charities, in Eastern Europe and Caucasus and Mediterranean countries it\u2019s still something strange and foreign. Raising awareness of volunteering opportunities in these countries may turn beneficial for students, young unemployed graduates, organisations \u2013 NGOs and developed business enterprises, society in general. Using methods of non-formal education we want to promote volunteering activities and for this to establish a network for volunteering opportunities for the young people in different NGOs around Eastern and Western Europe, Balkans, Caucasus and Mediterranean countries. It will help to make people from these countries closer to each other, to exchange experience, project ideas and stories of success. With the help of existing youth programs young people from Western Europe will volunteer in Eastern Europe and vice versa. During our TC we plan to give the participants space to create their future projects related to volunteering, to make the participants use their creativity to develop new approaches of volunteering, to establish informal contacts necessary to this task. \r\nObjectives: 1. to establish good connections between the young people from participating countries; 2. to transfer the good practices in the field of youth work, cultural diversity and social inclusion; 3. to promote volunteering activities and for this to establish a network of organisations involved in volunteering of the young people in different NGOs around Eastern and Western Europe, Balkans, Caucasus and Mediterranean countries.\r\nThe participating countries are: Austria, Israel, Netherlands, UK from countries with better employment situation and more developed volunteering programs and Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM, Georgia, Greece, Jordan,  Romania, Russia, Turkey,  Ukraine with very bad situation with youth unemployment and volunteering opportunities. With these partners we have a good set of Project and Partner (50/50) for the aims of this project and the variety of skills, experience and competences to have great discussions that will allow us to share the tools the participants and their NGOs could use in their future work with youth for the promotion of volunteering and to create new approaches for future projects and international cooperation.

It will improve the overall provision of teaching, learning and training within the peacebuilding industry by bringing together providers from the formal education (FE) and non-formal education (NFE) sectors in a community of practice. These partners will investigate current deficits, weaknesses and missed opportunities in educational provision across the field, addressing these with innovative tools for learners, as well as tools and mechanisms for learning providers to facilitate cross-sectoral working.Peacebuilding is now a multi-billion Euro industry with a global infrastructure, reflecting the acute need to address conflict and insecurity and growing confidence that doing so is possible, particularly with new technologies. The increase in peacebuilding has spurred growth in education and training, as practitioners need applied skills and knowledge. However much of the current provision is offered piecemeal, disconnected from other relevant learning opportunities. Collaboration between learning providers is challenged by differences in pedagogical perspective, underpinning ethos and teaching methodology. There is no clear guidance for learners on the skills and competencies they should acquire and no easy way for them to combine courses strategically. There has also been little systemic reflection on the benefits and limitations of online and distance learning in peacebuilding, although learning providers use them a lot. The main objective of BUILDPEACE is to enable innovative new approaches to developing peacebuilders by: 1) creating a common framework of key competencies across the FE and NFE sectors; 2) helping learners find navigable and flexible pathways for accessing relevant learning opportunities;  3) blending FE and NFE learning approaches for more comprehensive provision, making use of technology. To do this we will bring together European partners with experience in improving the learning outcomes of peacebuilders. Our activities will help us better understand the current state education provision within the peacebuilding field and develop innovative ways to improve learning outcomes using new methodologies and technologies. This will inform the creation of a range of tools for learners and learning providers to use, including free online courses, a handbook, a toolkit and a matrix of the competencies that people need to acquire to work in the field. Tools for policymakers include a mapping report and a policy recommendations report. To test these ideas and tools participants and learners will take part in two BUILDPEACE Workshops. These will pilot and improve the BUILDPEACE approach. Participants will deliver educational content to learners using the methods, modes of delivery and tools that the project experiments with.

One of the projects geared towards secondary school students - \u201cThe Transition Programme\u201d - operates slightly different hours -Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm until 7.30pm.The main aims of the Aisling Project are to prevent early school leaving, benefit the community and advance education by running an after-school intervention project for children at risk. This intervention provides purposeful activity in a caring, secure environment in an attempt to meet the young people\u2019s developmental needs. The service provides a hot meal every day, homework supervision and a range of developmental activities \u2013 drama, art, music, swimming, sports, gardening and arts and crafts etc.  The project will be based on the social and personal development of the young people through activity based programmes.This EVS project aims to develop links with other parts of Europe so that young people from different countries will have an experience of different cultures. The participants will learn more about the Irish culture as they immerse themselves in it, and also about youth work practices within an Irish context. The young people that we work with at Aisling Project will learn about their fellow Europeans \u2013 gaining an insight into Spanish, Italian and French cultures in a way they may not have the opportunity to otherwise.Our intention is to provide the participants with many opportunities to gain valuable experience and skills in working with young people and in living abroad - under the supervision of a coordinator, and with the support of colleagues and a mentor. We hope that this personal and professional development will lead to increased employability following the project.The project will have 5 participants from various programme countries. The participants will all have a demonstrated interest in working with children, a belief in helping young people achieve their true potential and be aged between 21 and 30.

During the past few months, questions such as these have been raised by voluntary and full-time staff as well as in an ongoing dialogue with international partner organisations. \u201cMe & Migration\u201d aims to find answers to those questions. Principles and objectives such as \u201cContribution towards Peace and International Understanding\u201d, \u201cEuropean Citizenship\u201d or \u201cInternational Solidarity\u201d get new meanings and commit us to turning towards this topic. At the same time, it is obvious that as soon as we enter the field of social work, there are limits with respect to capacity, mission and professionalism. It becomes clear that the organisations cannot adopt the tasks of typical migration services. However, they can contribute with enriching and supportive elements. What elements there may be precisely, and how organisations can prepare their volunteers and support them will be the central topics of the project. There are three components that illuminate them from different perspectives and in distinct activities:1.) Trainings for voluntary and full-time youth workers/group leaders working with teenagers and young people who want to get involved or are involved in working with and for refugees. In these trainings, practical tools to support volunteers shall be developed and tested. 2.)

Actually young people are often the missing ones in international partnerships, town twinnings and other economic partnership agreements. With the project Twin\u2019Go, Eurocircle propose to live up youth projects within the existing partnerships of Marseille and (therefore) to benefit effectively of the most positive dimensions/elements of the European Union and the globalization in general. The youngsters could develop their professional abilities, reinforce their international openness, practice one or more foreign languages, confirm their training, expand their networks\u2026\r\nThe foreseen activities of the Twin\u2019Go project are multifaceted, and able to cause the curiosity and motivation of the young people: activities related to the communication of an important city/district, missions related to the European citizenship within Eurocircle, engagement to reinforce the relations between France and Germany and the development of projects for European mobility in Bulgaria.

This is of particular concern to both of our schools due to the extremely large percentage of both schools pupils who speak English/Spanish as an additional language. Both schools have a large number of migrant children who speak different languages at home and often have family roots in different countries. A recent University of Strathclyde report into Children's literacy suggests that teachers are not always acknowledging the cultural capital that children are bringing into the classroom. These formative cultural experiences of children need to be recognised and valued if we are as teachers are to close the attainment gap for all our learners. Our project arose out of conversations around these issues and we have been happy to see it backed up by academic research.\r\nIn short, our project seeks to improve the literacy attainment of all of our children using the international dimension as a self empowering and motivating vehicle. We seek improvement in all of the 4 main components of literacy - reading, writing, talking and listening and have devised a series of activities that we believe addresses all of these main areas. We are also striving for our project to be sustainable. Most of our activities can form part of a child's normal literacy curriculum and the resources we will create can be used over and over again as well as shared with other schools. We hope to improvements in our children's self esteem as they access literacy from a more culturally relevant and hopefully engaging perspective. This improvement in self esteem will improve the overall health and well being of our children. Another important objective of our project is to improve the relationships between our parents, grandparents and the school. Our activities not only encourage the involvement of a child's wider family group but demand it. Parental workshops form a vital part of our project as we seek to tap into the rich cultural capital that exists in both of our schools.\r\nOur schools are similar in terms of our children's language acquisition but come from very different social and economic areas. Pollokshields Primary is in Glasgow, a city that is making a transition from being a traditionally industrial city to one that is more service based. Colegio Hernandez is situated in Villaneuva del Castellon, an agricultural town which is centred around the orange industry. Our children will benefit from experiencing both social realities on our blended mobilities. Life in a multi cultural city, or in a small rural town. Our schools combined roll is 430 children but with the involvement of families and local stakeholders, the number of participants will be much much higher.\r\nOur activities begin with an eTwinning activity called \"How I got Here\". Here children will learn about their unique cultural capital by creating a book that researches their own family history as well as their families reasons for migration. The books will acknowledge and celebrate the wide variety of experiences that exist in our schools. With the help of parents, grandparents,libraries and local storytellers, we will then create a new literacy bank of stories, poems and plays. These resources will come from the communities that our schools belong to. Children will then use these new resources for a term to access the literacy curriculum in Scotland and Spain. This work will then be celebrated and disseminated in an International storytelling festival in Glasgow which forms part of our first blended mobility. Our second year will see children continue to use the resources developed in year 1 whilst creating new ones as children research myths and legends from their family cultures as well as myths and legends from Spain. They will create guidebooks, write play scripts and perform these plays. Senior classes from both schools will use eTwinning to collaborate and create a play based on these myths and legends which will be performed together on our second blended mobility in Spain in 2019.\r\nAll activities will use progressive teaching methods such as AIFL (Assessment is for learning) and Active Learning whilst ensuring that clear about what is expected of them with targeted learning intentions and success criteria. \r\nWe anticipate that our project will help to develop a lifelong reading habit amongst our children. The impact on the literacy attainment of our migrant/refugee children will be something that is vital to the success of the project. We anticipate a higher level of engagement from our parents as the nature of our project shows that we value them and the cultures they bring to Scotland and Spain.

In order to prioritize,  and make sure that the above mentioned needs are taken into account and included in our training programme, our school counts on the help of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes.\r\n This Department, in an attempt to give an answer to the training needs, seeks for the participation in programmes such as Erasmus+ Ka1 since we think that this kind of programme is a guarantee for us to get the objectives related to the previously detected needs. \r\n\r\nAt IES Chaves Nogales, we are constantly doing our best to improve the quality of teaching since we know well that it affects considerably students\u2019 learning and outcome. As teachers too, we  constantly keep in mind the importance of giving an answer to our students\u2019 needs. They  are very important and valuable for us and in this sense, we usually need to go beyond making reports or using statistics.\r\nOur main goal is that students are able to manage by themselves in their social world.

Also, the collaborative implementation of projects and activities by students\u2019 families, teachers , pupils, scientific community, social agents, etc.\r\nRevitalising and dynamizing the library by supplying it with new formats and communication systems so that it may be transformed into a MEDIA LIBRARY.

In this sense the library would encourage multidirectional communication among all the members of the school community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo finish, in the next school year training period, we will keep on pursuing our objectives by sharing the acquired experience and by inviting other colleagues to participate in a seminary dealing with the different areas of interest established in our project.

At the same time, the contact with other schools will provide participants with new perspectives and initiatives for European cooperation, mainly in the framework of Erasmus+ program.\r\n\r\nAll the participants are active members of the international team of IES A Sangri\u00f1a, and for this reason, they have a remarkable and wide background to tackle a project like this: an active and tolerant European consciousness and, above all, the certainty that the teacher training is essential to provide our students with a comprehensive education and future prospects.\r\n\r\nThe activities that will be carried out in their host schools are observation and direct participation in teaching activities, both as complementary and extracurricular teaching. Further meetings are planned with the teacher staff, educational authorities, parents associations and other institutions in the area with a different educational offer. The methodology of this project will be immersion in the life of the host school, so participants could feel another member of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe expected results are acquiring new perspectives, methodologies and teaching approaches, improving communication skills (linguistic and social) and the opening of new avenues of European cooperation. This will have an impact at all levels: individual, because that will improve the skills of teachers and acquire new tools; local, both in the host school -by feedback-, and in the sending school \u2013where students will benefit from the professional improvement of teachers involved-; and, more generally, an impact on the educational community of both countries because of the results of this experience will benefit future participants.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits will derive from the above mentioned impact: foreign language training is the best way to fight against the low level that Spain has always had in this area, and only this way of improving the skills of our teachers can overcome the present situation.", "http://www.hutchesons.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-002584_2"]]}}, "5DU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Raising attainment using SOLE in mathematics for 11-12 year old learners", "St Albert's Primary School", 139730.0, 3, 19, "This project addresses the development of key competences in pupils and teachers in the teaching and learning of mathematics for pupils aged 11-12 years in Glasgow, Warsaw and Valencia in order primarily to raise attainment. This approach of innovative learning of mathematics is a development of the ideas and beliefs of Professor Sugata Mitra of Newcastle University. Sugata Mitra showed by experiment in India that if motivated and suitably led pupils will in effect teach themselves. His 2013 TED talk showed his success and won first prize. During the 2015 British Council eTwinning Conference Sugata Mitra explained his ideas and beliefs by Video Conference and this Project results for that Video Conference. \r\n\r\nSixteen schools will take part in the Project, five in Glasgow, six in Valencia and five in Warsaw. Over the three years of the Project 486 Activities will take place in all 30 classrooms directly effecting over 3000 pupils. Glasgow will lead the Project.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Activities of the Project is to work in groups to answer a \"big question\" derived from the maths curriculum being taught. The teacher does not teach but helps the pupils with their SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment)    \r\nThe key competencies addressed by this Project include: teamwork, responsibility, commitment, motivation, decision making, communication, leadership, digital skills. \r\nThey will have to communicate and present their findings using digital technology to pupils in other countries.\r\nThe Project is entrepreneurial and develops self confidence and belief. \r\nThe acquisition of the above skills will make the participating pupils more employable, increasing their ability to make a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nThe \"big questions\" used in the activities of the Project will address  the mathematics curriculum requirements and specific Learning Outcomes. In this way the teacher will be able to measure the true impact and effectiveness of the Activities on  attainment during the evaluation process.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that the teaching of mathematics is still very traditional in the three cities of this Project.  The common practice is for teachers to stand at the front of the class and teach, then for the pupils to work. The pupils are fed knowledge and understanding and are then asked to use it. This project involves the pupils finding it out by and for themselves by employing critical thinking and using social skills. This innovative method of teaching mathematics can be considered open and in this digital age is dependent for its success on pupils fully using the internet to acquire knowledge and understanding and using social media to communicate and disseminate findings and conclusions.", "http://www.st-alberts-pri.glasgow.sch.uk", "Glasgow City Council Education Services", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036777_12"]]}}}}
