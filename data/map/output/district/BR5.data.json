All the institutes will select 10 students (2 former students and 8 students), except the CIPFP Xeste and the IES LLuis Simarro who will select 12, two of them will be ErasmusPro\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that relations with Istituto Elsa Morante in Italy  fostered reciprocity, it has also submitted a mobility project in which Spanish consortium will receive their students. The reciprocity will enhance the promotion of the European active citizenship.\r\nThe 14 monts project will last from the 1st of June 2018 to the 30th of July 2019. The internship will be carried out from the 10th of March to the  30th of June 2019.  \r\nThe following activities will be structured in 5 phases:\r\nE1- Activities for communicating and spreading information to promote the students\u2019 participation, planning tasks (including participants\u2019 selection), establishing Learning Agreements, reviewing of ECVET documents, logistics and organization (insurance, lights and accommodation), determining contract-related issues, selecting hosting companies, tutors and accompanying teachers, setting up a common dissemination plan.\r\nE2-Preparation of the mobilities. Information Meeting, signing contracts, cultural and professional preparation, OLS language courses.\r\nE3- Implementation of mobilities. Follow-up, evaluation and certification of participants. Competences will be determined in the Learning Agreement and will be evaluated, using the ECVET instruments and will be certifies by Europass. \r\nE4- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the overall project\u2019s results.\r\nE5- Dissemination. The dissemination activities will be carried out during all the project\r\nIn addition to the impact on the participants, the project will also benefit all the partners, by fostering  European cooperation and the relationships between companies and educational centres. \r\nBoth dissemination activities and the mobility experience itself will produce an impact at local, regional and national level. \r\nOther local, regional and national entities will be able to to benefit from the project\u2019s results (even though they are not partners of the project):\r\n- Creation of a quality network that include educational centres and companies\r\n- Decrease in youth unemployment rate\r\n- Improvement of youth qualifications\r\n- Increase in VET enrolment \r\n- Creation of new collaborative networks at regional level\r\n- Widening the possibility of internationalization for other centres, and their chance to be part to other European projects\r\n- Better knowledge of the Erasmus+ programme and EU values (tolerance, equity, equality and inclusion).\r\n- Fostering the sense of European active citizenship and respect of other cultures\r\n- Possibility to create new companies and new business models \r\n- Promotion of social inclusion\r\nThe project is in accordance with the 2020 strategy, with the 20 principles of the European Pillar of social rights, with the goals of Erasmus + to improve the professional development of  VET students, their participation as active citizens in society and their employability inside and outside the European Labour market", "http://www.aaelectricalservices.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048379_25"], [2014, "MOVinVET", "AA Electrical Services", 182572.0, 8, 34, "The MOVINVET project is targeting two main groups: training center's staff (short-time job shadowing in training centers) and young graduates that have obtained an accredited training certificate during the previous year to the departure (3 month internships).  Hosting countries are Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Job shadowing activities for staff will take place in the Netherlands and will address themes such as the integration of migrants and other groups facing social exclusion through professional training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70 mobility actions are expected to be undertaken. Participants' mobility will occur in the summer of 2015 and 2016. Several activity areas will be encompassed by the MOVINVET project: Administration and Finance, ICT, Trade, Industry, Health and Social Services. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVINVET will benefit 6 professional training centers located in Seville that are part of the consortium as well as the Teacher Training Center of Seville, a public entity responsible for continuous training activities for teacher in the province of Seville. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is divided in several stages, namely:\r\n\r\n- selection,\r\n\r\n- preparation;\r\n\r\n- mobility period;\r\n\r\n- evaluation;\r\n\r\n- dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project's main goal is to improve the participant's employability skills through the development of a broad training itinerary that upgrades trainee's professional, language and personal skills. Furthermore, the project addresses the quality improvement of training supply, bridging the gap between participants and the corporate world, the European entity knowledge and the establishment of international working networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium created strengthens sustainability. Tasks regarding the dissemination of results are of essential to attract other local and international partners for the project. Plus, including reference teacher training centers in this project ensures that its outcomes will impact on other training centers. This presents the need for strong communication activities and the transfer of acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVINVET project emphasizes on the quality of procedures and results. The project includes the use of several tools previously developed through research projects and that emphasize key competences such as interculturality or the use of languages through efficient resources.
