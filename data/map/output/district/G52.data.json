Part of the internalization strategy objectives are also carried out in Erasmus + KA2- development projects, in which Omnia is developing for instance new pedagogigal practises and high-quality education for immigrant students.\r\nDuring the present project period Omnia's partner network has expanded with a few target areas: Lithuania, Croatia, Portugal, Malta and Mallorca. Our aim is to start reciprocal student mobility co-operation with our new Lithuanian partner in the field of property maintenance, because Omnia has educated this field already for years, but there has not been international co-operationin this field in the past years at all in Omnia. We also aim to send some students in the next project period to Portugal, because during this project period only staff members have visited from Omnia there. We send mostly students from the fields of business and administration, audiovisual communication and technical fields to Malta and Mallorca.\r\n\r\nIn the becoming project period Omnia's co-operation partners' network would be expanded with ten new partners, which are located partially both in new target countries and partially in excisting partner countries. Omnia is for instance starting co-operation in metal field with a new German partner college, security field co-operation with a new Danish college and  going on IT-field co-operation with a new Irish language school after this spring's piloting mobilities there. We also sent first students to Malta and Mallorca via our new partner institutions this year and are looking forward to hear students' experiences in these new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are exclunding Hungary from our present partner countries in this project, because in two years no student or staff member has applied there. Omnia's biggest partners will continue co-operating with Omnia: they are European multi-field co-operation colleges, with whom we make reciprocal co-operation. Omnian has most of its partner organisations and colleges in Germany. In this application there are ten German institutes. Co-operation with them is well-working and flexible and Omnia's students and experts  consider the country interesting. That is the reason for a big number of applied grants to Germany in this application. We apply also grants for two ten-student-groups to Germany and this fact adds also the number of applied mobilities to Germany.\r\n\r\nOmnia is also co-operating to some scale directly with smaller European companies. Some vocational fields (social and health care) have most of their partners without PIC. We will add these partners during the project period in the Mobility Tool-platform. \r\n\r\nIn this application Omnia applies also 8 grants for long;  5-6 months mobilites for audiovisual communication, tourism, hotel and restaurant field and business and administration fields students. Omnia took part in piloting long mobilities in a project called European Pathway, a Gateway to work and got very good experiences of them.

Completing upper secondary education is recommended as the minimum entrance qualification when making the crucial transition from education to the labour market. ESL is a multi-faceted and complex problem caused by a cumulative process of disengagement. Schools and especially VET Institutions play an important role in addressing ESL but they cannot and should not work in isolation. Comprehensive approaches that focus on the root causes of ESL are required to reduce. To reinforce the motivation of learners and prevent ESL, the EU strongly foster the commitment to offer learners the opportunity and to have new flexible approaches based on Personal Learning Plans (PLPs) elaborated  by VET staff (teachers, coaches, trainers, tutors) in collaboration with Enterprises Staff.

The aim of the EU Member States is on the one hand to create a stable basis for a socially and culturally inclusive society to support the integration process of new members in society and on the other hand to promote a sustainable, smart, innovative and growing modern society. One of the ways to achieve this is \"Education for Sustainable Development\" (ESD), UNESCO, which allows every human the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values necessary to shape a sustainable future. It means including key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning. ESD promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way.One of the target groups which are omitted from ESD measures are migrants.  In most measures, especially in language and integration courses directed at migrants, there is little evidence of sustainable development (SD) measures.  The lack there of is a serious issue since migrants are more likely to face social, economic and cultural exclusion, as well as discrimination and lack resources (European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research 2008, Martiniello and Rath 2014).The fact that some courses, projects, teaching materials contain ESD, demonstrates the importance of sustainability issues for integration work. However, the materials and projects are just fragmentary, which emphasises the significant impact the IN-Life project could have.IN-Life aims to promote concepts and methods for sustainable development by developing an innovative teaching approach for ESD within adult education sector. The aim is to empower migrants to actively contribute towards a sustainable society by raising the awareness of SD as well as improve capacities and knowledge within adult education for ESD for migrants. IN-Life strives to tackle the following three challenges of the EU: 1. Social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants including third-nationals 2. Fighting unemployment 3. Foster SD by teaching and empowering people to become active for SD  The project IN-Life includes the following groups in the project activities: - adult education providers, teachers, especially language teachers, trainers, all of them working with migrant learners;- stakeholders responsible for integration and sustainable development;- migrants taking part in the language courses or other courses who will take part in the educational activities.  They will contribute and take an active role in the following activities: - analysis report on integration and language courses for migrants in the context of sustainable development and sustainable lifestyle concept, detailed needs and expectations of the different groups (migrant learners, language teachers); - development of a toolbox with good practices on education for sustainable development in form of catalogue of exercises, games, learning materials designed for levels from A1 to B2;- development of guidelines for potential users (adult education centres, migrant organisations) on how to implement the concept of sustainable development for migrant learners; - national multiplier events in Germany, UK, Italy and FranceIN-Life aims to:- promote smart growth by implementing effective and innovative teaching methods and tools in education for SD for the target group of migrant learners and enabling them to contribute to sustainability in Europe. - contribute to the capacity, efficiency and quality of adult education institutions throughout Europe by enabling them to reach, teach and empower migrants on SD by using developed innovative teaching materials designed for the specific target group. - bring together European partners with different expertise in the field of adult education, sustainable development and migration/integration/social inclusion. Working with migrants on education for sustainable development will advance research on sustainability. - strengthen language skills of migrant learners in receiving country to use new, content related tools (exercises, gamers, vocabulary linked to SD).- reinforce interaction between practice and policy for SD and integration. - improve the competences of migrant learners, migrant communities, as well as the partner organizations involved in the project. - promote access of socially vulnerable and excluded group of migrants, for adult education and ESD (discrimination, language barriers, lack of information, lack of social integration, marginalisation, energy poverty).", "http://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA204-003293_2"], [2017, "ICT based evaluation methodology to assess the social impact of work-linked training", "Glasgow Clyde College", 209395.0, 5, 6, "Training is a key element to ensure the sustainable growth and competitiveness. From the last decades of the past century till today, public bodies and authorities have spent several resources on the promotion of work-linked training programmes. From the beginning of these activities, evaluation was an inherent nature of training process. It was mandatory and required to know the quality of the training process as well as the results of the intervention.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, European Commission published the report \u201cRethinking Education: Investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\u201d (COM(2012) 669 final), in which two main questions arisen: the need to stablish partnership between training and education institutions and companies,  and  the need to measure and assess (multi-approach) the training and education in all levels, and specially in those related to work-based training. This document reinforces the main ideas contained in Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 (2010), topic considered one of the pillars of the ET2020 strategy in 2009.\r\n\r\nThere are different scopes to define and design training evaluation process. If we focus the process on \u201cdimension of evaluation\u201d we can evaluate according to: Process, outcome or impact. If we focus on evaluation\u2019 goals, we can obtain a realistic feedback from final users about \u201cusefulness\u201d. We can also define a process from \u201cevaluation approach\u201d or considering \u201cthe purpose of training\u201d. So, we can use different models and methodologies to assess the evaluation activities, including its impact in the organisations.\r\nHowever, all this approaches and methods have been developed to be used in a wide context, and it\u2019s necessary to adapt them to specific scenarios. Considering this scenario, it\u2019s necessary to provide a flexible, customizable and friendly methodology that help work-linked training providers to assess training activities considering not only the results and impact of the training in the persons, but the impact in the organisation itself and in its environment.  Besides, companies needs a supporting tool that help them evaluate their training needs, labour market trends and the impact in the economies of the resources spent on these. In brief, the new approach have to conciliate the interest of employees, employers and employment services, creating a new framework to support not only training promotion but the evolution of labour market and the competitiveness of companies and economic tissue.\r\nThus, this new approach should cover four main criteria to evaluate:\r\n\r\nQuality: evaluate and assess the quality of training, that is, witch characteristics of the training satisfy the needs of trainees (regarding contents, duration, trainers and facilities).\r\nEfficacy/Performance: Identify the results obtained during the training sessions and how these results fit to the needs of the labour market and companies.\r\nEfficiency: Assess the final results focusing on the economic and other resources engaged in the process.\r\nImpact: Assess the impact/effects of the training on both the employability of the trainees and the competitiveness of the companies.\r\n\r\nSo, ATWORK project aims to develop/build/create a methodology to evaluate the social impact of the work-linked training programmes on persons, on companies and on socio-economic environment.\r\n\r\nIn order to support the main project goal, project has some specific objectives as follows:\r\nSO1.

The implementation of these initiatives, as it was pointed out at the conference \"Towards a European Area of Skills and Qualifications\", has been slow and mobility is still hampered between and within countries, both in the area of education and in the area of employment. \r\n\r\nFor this reason the EUKCEM II project aims at adding further content on the EUKCEM platform addressing those doubts and further facilitating the management of mobility project, with ECVET as integral part. Video animated tutorials, checklists and training contents delivered in webinars from a practicioner point of view about topics such as \"From idea to application\", selection of beneficiaries, definition of learning outcomes... until how to document and prepare the final report will practically support project coordinators.

It has become evident that community education processes  must be initiated, coordinated, guided and accompanied. This is the only way to ensure sustainability and avoid pop-up effects. To this end, a professionalized advanced training is required, which is conceptualized and developed by the project Community Education Facilitation. \r\n\r\nBy Community Educationwe mean an approach which joins lifelong training with social goals. This takes place in the context of communities which represent a group of people in the broadest sense who are defined by common characteristics. Lifelong training as a principle of CE processes is understood in this context from the angle of learning with and from each other, encompassing all age groups and social levels. Our experience has taught us that community-based learning processes do not just happen by themselves. They must be initiated during a process and must be kept going. Collective learning requires support from a CEF in the course of the CE process. \r\n\r\nThe model is based on two pillars \u2013 on the one hand, the advanced training program \u201cCommunity Education Facilitator (CEF),\u201d and on the other hand, the advanced training for becoming a \u201cCommunity Activist (CA).\u201d  \r\nCommunity Education Facilitators can be described as individuals who are trained professionally to integrate community development processes into community education processes and vice versa. It is about enabling community and neighborhood workers as well as regional developers to initiate regional learning processes and combine them with other activities (social concerns, labor market policies, economic policies), or simply learning processes controlled by the community. They are not providers of education themselves, but simply act as experts who initiate, accompany and moderate such processes. Furthermore, CEF are employees of adult education facilities who works towards anchoring local educational offers and tying them to regional processes, or who want to initiate community education processes in the sense of promoting participation. \r\nCommunity Activists are volunteer experts who try to get community-based learning processes going. These can consist in forms of embedded learning, i.e. where other activities are the focus but where learning forms an integral part of the whole, or in initiating proper learning activities and embedding them locally \u2013 as, for instance, in the form of new places of learning, learning partnerships, learning caf\u00e9s, etc. \r\nThose who are eventually meant to profit from this are citizens, as they amplify their knowledge, build up competencies and further develop their skills. \r\n\r\nThe project is directed at adult education facilities and freelance trainers, regional development organizations /neighborhood activists and community development organizations, at decision-makers who want to make community education processes an integral part of their strategies, as well as at committed citizens and volunteer organizations.\r\n\r\nThe CEF advanced training program will include 6 modules and take 12 days, the one to become a CA will take 5 days. The CEF will train the CA in their local environment and continue to mentor them. \r\nThe training courses will begin in the fall of 2017.\r\nThe involved partners from UK, IT, DE, BU and AT work in cooperation at developing and realizing this educational offer and thereby want to contribute to embedding community education in urban and rural regions.", "http://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA204-005011_1"], [2015, "Technological Empowerment for VET trainers.

Moreover, the Common Framework for Digital Competences for Trainers 2012, published by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport reinforced this argument stating that trainers need to improve their digital competences to normalize the use of technological resources in class. The MOBILE-TECH project wants to contribute to make this a reality.\r\n\r\nThe use of mobile devices for learning is not something new and although there are some experiences of its successful implementation, we have detected some barriers for its implementation in VET:\r\n\r\n- Most of VET trainers are not aware about the potential of mobile devices as a tool for learning.\r\n- Mobile devices, and specifically smartphones, have a bad reputation \"majority of people on Earth believe mobile phones, beyond not being conducive to learning are in fact antithetical to it\" (UNESCO Mobile Learning Week Report, 12-16 December 2011, p.11).\r\n- Most of VET trainers do not have the necessary competences/knowledge to use mobile devices for learning (ICT skills, knowledge of the different apps which can be used for learning, how to create/modify their own apps, how and with which purpose to use mobile devices).\r\nThe aim of MOBILE-TECH project is to encourage VET trainers\u00b4 training about mobile learning in an Open Collaborative Learning Platform. \r\n\r\nBesides MOBILE-TECH persuades other objectives:\r\n-To develop an Open Educational Resource (OER) where generate practical and collaborative m-learning\r\n-To involve VET Centers directors\r\n-To rise student\u00b4s interest on m-learning\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, we will carry out several activities which can be gathered in three stages:\r\n\r\n1) Trainers\u00b4 guide for mobile resources to be used in the classroom. The guide will include National and European good practices about m-learning and different mobile resources which can be used in a VET class and which resources can be used to create own apps.\r\nThis guide will be presented in different public events which will take place in the partners\u00b4 countries.\r\n\r\n2) Development of Trainers\u00b4 course: How to develop new training resources and teach mobile learning (m-learning), to provide the VET trainer with training materials to develop the necessary competences and knowledge to implement mobile learning in a VET class. The course will deal with different topics. Specifically, the course will be focus on how to develop own contents and how and for what to use different mobile applications.\r\n\r\nThe course will be tasted in the consortium countries: Spain, Finland, Greece, United Kingdom and Germany. Teachers/trainers and trainees will take part in the pilot testing sessions.\r\nBesides, the course will be also presented to direct and indirect target groups in public events.\r\n\r\n3) Open Collaborative Learning Platform for trainers\u00b4 learning resources. All the project materials will be hosted in this platform. Not only the guide and the course but also different pedagogical materials related to m-learning in the classrooms.\r\nThe Learning Platform will be tested by teachers/trainers of the VET centers and it will present in the last conference of the project in Spain (project\u00b4s promoter country).\r\n\r\nTo ensure the smooth development of the MOBILE-TECH project different key transversal actions will be implemented: \r\n\r\nA1- e-mail distribution list \r\nA2- Moodle platform for an effective management of the project.\r\nA3- A group in Google hangouts will also be created  \r\nA4- Quality Management Plan \r\nA5- Dissemination Plan \r\nA6- IPRA \r\nFour financial reports (A7), (A8), (A9) and (A10) and four evaluation reports (A11), (A12), (A13) and (A14).\r\nA15- Web 2.0. campaign. \r\nA16- Publications in press.\r\nA17-Elaboration of a video presentation of the project \r\nTwo dissemination reports (A18) and (A19)\r\n\r\nThe consortium will meet in four International Meetings as follows: M1-Kiel (DE), M2-Glasgow (GB), M3-Helsingfors (FI), M4-Durango (ES)\r\n\r\nWith MOBILE-TECH project we want to contribute to the adaptation and empowerment of the VET trainers to the demands and needs of their students by providing them with the necessary competences to address mobile learning.", "http://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA202-015903_1"], [2014, "Green Apron - Training module for catering schools/vocational centres students in plant-based diet", "Glasgow Clyde College", 153632.0, 6, 7, "Green Apron reacts to the urgent demand for a Europe-wide food VET specialised in the area of plant-based cuisine. The meat-reduced cuisine is currently experiencing an unprecedented rising tendency. The Eurispes report 2013 shows that in Italy for instance plant-based eaters are 8% ( 6,9 vegetarians 1,1 vegan). In Spain plant-based eaters set the demographics in two millions (4% of the population) and observed that in the latest years the trend accelerated. In UK and Scotland a large increase in the population is moving onto to non-meat dishes and in particular a plant-based cuisine/diet. Some independent market studies suggest that vegetarians constitute 7% to 11% of the UK adult population. In France In October 2011, the European Vegetarian Union reported that the French government's D\u00e9cret 2011-1227 and associated Arr\u00eat\u00e9 (September 30, 2011) effectively outlaws the serving of vegan meals at any public or private school in France. Similar decrees are proposed for kindergartens, hospitals, prisons and retirement homes. In Romania 85% of people  are Christian Orthodox and many of them keep the Orthodox Lent, which means having a vegan diet for certain lengths of time (which can add up to be more than half the year). Moreover many people are changing their eating habits because of healthy reasons.\r\n\r\nThat is the reasons for a growing demand of skills to prepare balanced meals containing little or no animal products. The traditional vocational chef education and training (VET) in Europe does not yet consider the know-how and the skills for a sustainable and balanced cuisine with low or no content of animal products. The lack of knowledge in this field leads to insufficient skills of chefs and caterers to meet the new needs of their customers. In addition to customer demands, sustainability standards have become a major component within caterers' corporate social responsibility policy.  To face these needs and request Green apron aims at developing the production and dissemination of a curriculum and training material of a 100-hour-module. Translated into 5 languages English, French, Italian Spanish and Romanian and enriched by modern multimedia content (3D-animated movies, e-learning modules, recipes videos,) the project results are exploited in the national educational systems.

This situation has contributed to a decrease in the motivation of young people, namely in the conclusion of their educational journey, and consequently in the rates of early school leaving.\r\nThe Mobility Project - \"GPS II - Get Professional Skills II\" - consists in carrying out 45 mobilities related to training in the workplace, aimed at young people who are attending/ have completed their vocational training, and at teachers from Vocational Scool Cior. This project is defined in 2 parts - one for young people and one for teachers, with 3 lines of action/ activities, that are complimentary and coordinated:\r\n- A 1st line of action which covers vocational students who are attending the 3rd and final year of their vocational level IV course, and is part of their training plan in a real work environment; it is addressed to 25 students. 5 students from each finalist class will be selected to perform a 8 week work placement in a company of the Partner country.\r\n- A second line of action which is addressed to  recent graduates students from each of the vocational provided in Cior, so as to  strengthen their employability skills and facilitate their transition to the labour market. This action involves 10 newly graduated students from Cior ;\r\n- Finally a line of action which aims to involve 10 teachers from Cior, so as to improve their training practice and promote the quality of vocational training provided. In this line of work, we expect that the teachers involved in the mobility and the remaining school staff  will have the opportunity to acquire in loco knowledge related to methodologies and vocational training systems of other countries in Europe, so that the observation of good practices and the debate on the issues of students' motivation and strategies to fight early school leaving, will  bring concrete contributions to improve the quality of the training process.\r\nThe GPS project 's main objectives are to :\r\na) provide participants the acquisition of  knowledge and skills over a training placement period  in an organization from another Member State ;\r\nb ) facilitate personal development and integration into the labour market;\r\nc ) encourage the learning of foreign languages;\r\nd ) promote the cooperation between training organizations and companies at a European level ;\r\ne) promote the European dimension of education and internalization of the European citizenship concept;\r\nf ) provide participants the direct contact with industrial realities different from those they face daily;\r\ng ) raise levels of completion and lower rates of school dropout ;\r\nh ) improve school human resources;\r\nf ) encourage the sharing of best practices among professionals in the partner countries, for enhancing strategies and motivation of students to complete their training pathway;\r\ng ) strengthen the competitiveness of the European labor market.\r\nBeyond these mobility planned activities, the project also includes preparation activities and the monitoring  and support to participants, as well as the activities for the project evaluation and dissemination of results, namely the organization of the Europe Day and the organization of the final seminar to present the results .\r\nWith the implementation of the project, we expect  that the involved participants will develop personal and professional skills in their areas of expertise; acquire a deeper understanding of the professional context and of the tasks to develop; become more aware of their European citizenship status; and become able to transfer and adapt the knowledge to the national contexts and reality; this  in the search for continuous improvement of training systems to meet the individual needs and the labour market needs too.

This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: modular design suited to existing trenching machines; mechanical movement subsystem with <5% error in desired motion tracking & <1cm in actual tracking error; control subsystem capable of negotiating \\/-0.5m 90\u00b0 step in terrain & turn on-the-spot; complete simulated locomotion cycle in under 5mins, with <5% desired motion tracking error.\n\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of damage to subsea energy cables, thereby maximising offshore energy reliability, maintain renewable energy affordability, & minimise the marine environmental impact of cables. In turn, we will deliver a profit of \u20ac10.95m & 100 new high skill jobs to the SME partners after 5 years.", null, 1227744.0, 5, 9, "HEXATERRA", null, "http://www.aph.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157242.jpg", "fp7_109873_952171013"]]}}}}
