Today's users, however, need a new generation of smart recommendations that are able to keep pace with their moment-to-moment needs in their fast-moving, dynamically developing, mobile worlds. Achieving such social smartfeeds requires facing the grand challenge of providing recommendations that are simultaneously real-time, large-scale, socially informed, interactive and context aware.<br/>CrowdRec addresses this challenge by pioneering a breed of algorithms that combine crowdsourcing and recommendation algorithms to achieve a new generation of social smartfeeds for access and exchange of digital media in social networks. The key insight of CrowdRec is that, in order to achieve the dense, high-quality, timely information required for a truly useful social smartfeed, it is necessary to go beyond passive information collection and also beyond users' immediate social circles. Instead, the necessary information can be actively acquired by using crowdsourcing to solicit input and feedback from the wider community. CrowdRec algorithms create a symbiosis between users and content: they establish reciprocal relationships that both satisfy users' digital media needs and connect media with users able and willing to contribute the information necessary to improve access and exchange for the overall community.<br/>The project pursues three scientific and technical objectives: 'Stream Recommendation': exploiting the ability of recommender system's to process usage patterns to create social smartfeeds useful in large-scale social networks; 'Crowd Engagement': designing algorithms that engage users to generate information needed for smartfeeds; 'Deployment and Validation': creating a both a reference implementation to support research and a real-world social networks for large-scale user trials.<br/>CrowdRec achieves its ambitious goals by bringing academic, industry and SME partners with longstanding expertise in social and context-aware recommendation together with two large social networks with the high volume of media data flowing in live user communities (one > 14 million members and one > 20 thousand members) necessary for 'in vivo' development and evaluation of CrowdRec technology.", 37964.0, 3378197.0, 7, 10, "CrowdRec", null, null, null, "fp7_110635_951393752"], [1283299200000, 1383177600000, "User-centric Wireless Local-Loop", "FON Wireless Ltd", "The flexibility inherent to wireless technologies is giving rise to new types of access networks and allowing the Internet to expand in a user-centric way.

This fact becomes even more significant due to the dense deployment of Wi-FI Access Points that is common today in urban environments.Due to such density, a relevant aspect that can be worked upon is leveraging such 'wireless local-loop' by developing networking mechanisms that allow adequate resource management and a future Internet architecture to scale in an autonomic way. Such wireless local-loop could then reach rates closer to the ones provided by current access technologies.<br/>A way to overcome the limitation of today's broadband access technologies is to expand the backbone infrastructure reach by means of low-cost wireless technologies that embody a multi-operator model, i.e., a local-loop based upon what a specific community of individuals (end-users) is willing to share, backed up by specific cooperation incentives and 'good behaviour' rules.<br/>The purpose of this project is therefore to explore the potential of having a wireless local-loop based upon a user-centric (community) model extending the reach of a high debit, multi-access broadband backbone from different perspectives (technical and business models, as well as the expected telecommunications market and legislation impact).

Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds.

Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics.

The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.roccofortehotels.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_14"], [2016, "LEO quali-TC ECVET ENLARGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY", "Rocco Forte & Family (The Lowry Hotel) Limited", 472814.0, 7, 39, "Due to the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of emergency - as the unemployment rate for the aged 15-24 reached more than 44% - and it is, therefore, widely believed that it is necessary to foster experiences of integration into the production system since the years of education and training.Recent economic developments have shown, moreover, the need, in a global context, of a highly skilled workforce. As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.roccofortehotels.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_14"], [2014, "Azioni di mobilit\u00e0 per lo sviluppo delle competenze e la promozione della competitivit\u00e0 e creativit\u00e0 dell\u2019industria culturale e del turismo", "Rocco Forte & Family (The Lowry Hotel) Limited", 307797.0, 6, 39, "One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes.

Every student is not just an \" MBO catering participant \" but an \"MBO catering participant  and committed citizen in the present and future society\".\r\nTo achieve the objectives , the duration of the mobility is  customized to their personal abilities and the level of study. The deliberate choice of partners will certainly make a positive contribution to the quality of the project.\r\nWe have a large number of partners with whom we work. Depending on the level and abilities of each participant, we find the most appropriate country and type of accredited training company for each. Therefore the number of partners exceeds the number of participants that we send each year .\r\nMoreover, participants can enroll at any time during the year in any training programme at Europrof, therefore, a broad -based partner contact is of great importance.\r\n- The content of the project is aimed basically at 13 students MBO BOL (Level 1 / m Level 4 ) at the initial vocational training in the context of Hotel and Catering , Hospitality, Pastry and Culinary arts. Participants will do a part of their training program, training (BPV) in a European accredited hosting partner. The intention is that participants go for an internship duration of between 7 and 15 weeks . They will gain their practical experience in accordance with the practical skills required in these accredited training companies.\r\nTwo applications which will have a big impact:\r\n1 -The fact that Europrof gives participants the opportunity to do an international internship , during their first year of study  , in a   \"real-life \" situation, ensures  the development of their enthusiasm and interest and passion for their future work and employment ( if at 16 or 17 years of age they have this opportunity and experience, one can surmise the tremendous help and encouragement it will mean for them!!)  Our experience is that their passion and enthusiasm increases as if they were already 19 and 20 years of age.!!!.... The future will change for them . Their ambition will grow and their performance will be enhanced. \r\n2 - The fact that we give the students immediately  in first year, the opportunity to follow internships in 4 star* and 5 star * companies. We teach them right from the start to set the bar very high and then ... naturally passion and motivation will grow rapidly! The nice thing is that if they are looking for their  internship of the 2nd year, they are not satisfied with \u201clower\u201d places .... This is the beginning of a passionate future! they learn from the beginning  at the highest level ! This improves entry and employability in the labour market .\r\nInternationalization applied in this way you can presume it represents a real modernization of VET ! !\r\nImproving language skills also plays an important role (e.g. English, Spanish and German ). It creates interest and appreciation for the culture and customs of the host country. This helps them to adapt during their stay.\r\nSTAFF :\r\nA total of 5 participants (practical trainers , teachers , etc. ) .\r\na) internships  in approved / accredited training companies in the EU countries .\r\nb) in collaboration with a number of Hotel and Catering Companies in the EU countries designing and developing educational modules that will be given in the new Europrof Qualification programme .\r\n=============\r\nWith this \u201c2 in 1\u201d- project implementation , we are confident that we will achieve our five broad objectives , namely :\r\n- Achieving modernization of vocational education by  internationalization\r\n- Accelerating the development of personal, general, and branch-specific competencies\r\n- Improving the quality of learning and teaching\r\n- Improving employment and sustainable employability\r\n- Increasing the value and attractiveness of vocational education through closer cooperation with  the industry\r\nTogether with a number of partners, with Erasmus + projects, we are trying to promote reciprocity.

This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through this project, the VET school(Escuela Profesional de Hosteleria de Jerez) aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (hospitality, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for Level 1 students/ and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the Level 2 and 3 . The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the sector of Hospitality industries and tourism, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for economic and social growth cannot be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between educational and training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities.\r\n\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\". The development of ECVET began in 2002 after the Copenhagen Process emphasizing the need for a credit transfer system for VET. CrossCompetence is a project based on the concrete responses to the questions of developing ECVET in the European member States and corresponding to the 2009 EU Recommendations on the establishment of the European Credit system for VET. The project works in particular to realise an European area for Lifelong Learning in the field of cultural industries and the promotion and management of tourism.\r\n\r\nThe whole activities are implemented by regarding a strong European perspective which are reflected in all project activities and results. The project aims to increase the knowledge of ECVET and its technical specifications and ensuring that the added value of ECVET is understood and perceived all over Europe.", "http://www.roccofortehotels.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA102-002802_4"]]}}}}
