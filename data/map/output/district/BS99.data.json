It affects around 500 apprentices each year and the Regional Assembly voted again for 2015, an amount of \u20ac 350,000 from its budget, to encourage the mobility of the public. To boost this policy, the region received significant support from the LEONARDO program since 2009. Over the period 2015/2017, it is to extend this action to which the application of apprentices and the interest of the CFA are growing. This proposal is part of a strategy to strengthen mobility implemented in the framework of partnerships stabilized, but also development of new initiatives to provide opportunities for new CFA, especially smaller, which benefit from experience gained by the consortium. It will also develop moiblit\u00e9s to vocation \"Certification\" in order to enhance the recognition of acquired skills. \r\n\r\nThe Region proposes in this context a strong support for CFA : \r\n1 / the proposed technical assistance to the CFA for the development, monitoring and evaluation of their projects: Many CFA remain little - if at all for some - experienced in European mobility projects. It is therefore to support the structures / teaching staff in the engineering of the project on the educational aspects (linguistic and cultural preparations initially, Europass, etc.), logistical and budget to finalize qualitatively valid nominations and financially eligible. Indeed, mobility projects account for them not only a financial effort, but also a significant administrative burden, while their human resources to develop these actions remain limited. The Region has earmarked 1.5 agents for the methodological support. \r\n\r\n2 / producing financial engineering to leverage the Region's response capability for the benefit of CFA: these include funding to abound in the region through the intervention of the appropriations of the European Union , including mobility projects to the public via apprentice Erasmus + scholarships.

In total, nearly 9,000 apprentices registered training in these institutions, the construction industries, agriculture, aviation, hotels or industry and services in general. The strategy of this project is to establish direct partnerships between CFA midi-Pyrenees and European training centers to facilitate the investment company. Thus, each CFA develop specific interaction with one or more training centers to the needs expressed and the relevant sector. To the extent that all training centers displayed on this project lead professional training on how alternating school / company, they will be directly mobilized on internships Research and placement of apprentices via the corporate network their territory.
