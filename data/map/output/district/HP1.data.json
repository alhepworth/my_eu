Storytelling will help refugees by empowering them, facilitating communication and inspiring their personal growth. Telling their own story in a secure environment will reassure them the values as a person, widden the chances of meeting new people and being offered work opportunities.

Once the first draft products (training modules and validation system) have been developed, they will be tested during a well structured piloting phase.  The piloting phase will be preceded by a five-day European training course (C1) for trainers and multipliers, to get to know the LISTEN concept and to learn how to apply it in real training contexts with refugees.

The idea is that participants are able to use all the information acquired during the exchange and begin to think about their future career and all the possibilities that they have to create their own future.The objectives of the project are:- Provide young people with the opportunity to develop or improve their basic and transversl skills, such as entrepreneurship, digital skills, teamwork, creativity and multilingualism providing the theoretical and practical means to facilitate the resourcefulness of the youngsters with creative processes and business in order to facilitate their employment, also in relation to other areas of Europe.- Promote social inclusion; will participate in the exchange young people with fewer opportunities, youngsters who have financial problems or are in a state of inactivity or unemployment. Many times the people who are in these situations are those who are less willing to participate in certain activities with other ypung people, probably due to a conditioned reflex of their economic situation;- Encourage their active citizenship and participation in society, encouraging young people to take active and enterprising attitudes not only in their communities but also in Europe.

In the first topic volunteers will gain skills in translation softwares commonly used in the organization, they will use their language skills to translate the language-related websites (European projects of E@I), learn to test and disseminate web portals.

Young people may get such a chance only once in their life. We want to give a chance to young foreigners to be involved and receive as much knowledge and experience as possible.
