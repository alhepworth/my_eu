This project aims to bring music to the fore front of our curriculum by offering a different approach to lessons allowing them to be more interesting and stimulating for the pupils. This project will be fully inclusive by integrating all pupils regardless of ability, age or special need. \r\nThe objectives of this exciting opportunity are learning the language of sound, learning their musical heritage and sharing it with partners and celebrating the place of musical education in the partners\u2019 curriculum. The pupils will explore nature\u2019s sounds, examine music of differing periods and be motivated to create their own music. \r\n\u201cA New Sound for the EU\u201d is an interdisciplinary project using music to share traditions, not in a stereotypical way, but rather to celebrate the unique identity of the six partner countries involved: Croatia,England,France,Malta,Sweden and Turkey. The exchanges that are already occurring between partners is the key point to a successful partnership. We have no doubt that the experienced partners will help the new partners get the most from a multilateral project. Each partner will be responsible for sharing the project beyond their school to the wider public whether it be through local media or the web site. \r\nThe pupils will take part in a range of activities with the first having the pupils learn about the partner schools involved in the project. Presentations and posters will be shared with each other. The pupils will become involved in musical aspects such as sharing traditional Christmas songs, exploring instruments and sounds, making instruments, researching periods of music and composers, perform dances and learn lyrics of modern songs to be performed during the final show.  The pupils will be taught about the importance of legally downloading material from the internet. Video conferencing will play a large part in sharing and practising the material for the final show.\r\nThis project will have a number of results that include but not limited to newspaper articles, videos of the Christmas songs and folk dances, mini instruments made from simple materials, sound and memory games, time lines, performances of music, power point presentations of composers, cds of music and a final show based on all the pieces of music shared during the project! \r\n\u201cA New Sound for the EU\u201d will impact upon musical skills allowing the pupils to gain a better knowledge of types of music, instruments and the ability to read sheet music. It will improve cross disciplinary skills by expanding their knowledge of geography, developing concentration skills and increasing their vocabulary skills. Lastly it will have an impact on participating schools through the establishment of a strong and long lasting partnership with the European schools.\r\nOverall this project will help pupils develop into a well rounded young EU citizen by improving their skills of team building, solving problems and most importantly celebrating similarities and accepting differences.", "http://www.rayleighprimary.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002310_2"], [2016, "Meet The Ancestors - Where Did I Come From?", "Rayleigh Primary School", 103651.0, 6, 6, "Meet The Ancestors: Where did I come from?A European project from six countries examining prejudice and racism through  an interactive learning platform.This project asks children from the ages of 5 to 11 to look into their family history and discover who their relatives are. It then builds on this to ask questions about the difference between nationality and citizenship. It asks children to reflect on their family  history and think what next? Where would they like to go in the world given a chance and why they would like to go there? All their discoveries and opinions are captured in video, spoken word and text and placed on an interactive map of the world. This initial child led discovery then acts as the start of a deep investigation into genetic ancestry, the movement of peoples through time and the idiocy of prejudice and racism.This next step starts with the return of genetic testing information on those children who volunteer. Plotted on the map it will reveal the ancestral movement of people in the partner schools. This will lead to the question, why did our ancestors move? Teachers can then open the world of natural disasters, wars and trade as the reasons their ancestors moved, no different to the crisis of our modern times.Many would argue that prejudice and  racism are the root cause of many of the problems that inherit the world today. The refugee crisis spreading across Europe is bringing tension and fear to all. This project is aimed at showing that far from being a modern plague, the movement of people across our world has been with throughout human history.

The total heat exchanger fouling costs were shown to exceed US$4.4 billion annually for industrialised countries.\nShell-and-tube heat exchangers, prevalent in refineries and petrochemical plants, experience most of the fouling on external tube surfaces. Traditional water jet systems (manual and automated) are unable to penetrate the 6mm space between the tube rows, thereby leaving approximately 40%-60% of fouling uncleaned.\nTube Tech, a market leader with more than 25 years of experience in fouling removal, have developed ShellJeTT, an innovative cleaning technology carefully engineered to go through these corridors, enabling 98% fouling removal. This keeps heat exchangers free from fouling; enabling considerable financial savings for the refinery operators. Specifically, results achieved from two case studies where ShellJeTT was applied (TRL-6), evidenced Return on Investment (ROI) of 5:1 to 20:1.\nDuring ShellJeTT\\, we target to enhance our current system\u2019s automation capabilities, allowing our operators to deploy ShellJeTT in a robotic mode. This will move them further away from the blasted area and reduce the deployment time. Project\u2019s activities are structured to raise the technology readiness of ShellJeTT\\ to TRL-9, through an extended period of market replication and demonstration activities.\nShellJeTT\\ is poised to have a tremendous impact in both economic and environmental terms; it will enable the oil refining industry to reduce operational costs by $2.46bn per year while reducing CO2 emissions by 313200 tonnes per year.\nOver a 5-year period after ShellJeTT\\\u2019s market launch we aim to increase our revenue by \u20ac6.75 million up to \u20ac33.75 million per year.

Eight percent of industrial plant operating costs may be attributed to heat exchanger fouling.  Despite enormous costs associated with fouling, the industry relies on off-line cleaning because there are no on-line systems capable of operating under high temperature, low velocity conditions with chemically reactive fluids.  The cost of taking plant off-line inevitably means that the heat exchanger operates at significantly less than peak efficiency.  Our proposed solution is to develop an innovative projectile based on-line cleaning and injection system that will work under the required operating conditions to mitigate foulant build-up throughout the heat exchanger.  Achieving our objectives will require research to formulate accurate correlations of foulant deposition rate as a function of geometry and operating conditions, the development of a composite projectile material to achieve the required mechanical properties and chemical stability as well as a projectile trajectory control system to deliver a uniform distribution of projectiles over the heat exchanger tube-face.  Furthermore; ensuring that projectiles are propelled through the heat exchanger tubes in a low velocity regime will require us to devise a means to temporarily increase flow velocity through selected heat exchanger tubes.  Research will concentrate on characterizing foulant deposition mechanism, structure and rate, projectile tribology as well as gaining a detailed understanding of heat exchanger fluid flow and its control.
