Three-quarters of the pupils are of White British heritage. Low numbers of pupils are eligible for Pupil Premium or Pupil Premium Plus funding. \r\n\r\nThe proportion of children with special educational needs, including those with a statement/EHCP of special educational needs, is above average.\r\n\r\nEcclesall Junior School has been teaching French (Upper Key Stage 2) since we took part in the Sheffield Pathfinder Project in 2003.\r\n\r\nInitially, French was taught by a specialist language teacher, however, in order to increase the pupil\u2019s exposure to the French language we decided that class teachers would take over the role of teaching French.\r\n\r\nThis decision highlighted several issues with language learning in our school.\r\n\r\nA high proportion of staff don\u2019t have the confidence and language competence to deliver French adequately. As a result, they are nervous to teach French and it is not taught consistently across all year groups. To encourage staff to be more involved in language learning, we would like them to have the opportunity to improve their language skills and develop new teaching methods, sharing resources and ideas.\r\n\r\nEccleshall Infant and Junior School will merge in September 2018.  We will then consolidate how we teach French across the new larger school. \r\n\r\nIt will take some time to integrate the two schools. Making use of the changes caused by this merger we will send staff from both schools on a structured training so that all year groups are fully equipped with the training, knowledge and resources they require to fully integrate language learning into the curriculum of the newly combined school.\r\n\r\nThis project is very much linked to our School Development Plan and is supported by our SLT and Governors. It will greatly influence the development of our school in relation to the learning of languages.\r\n\r\nWe have staff of varying abilities in the school, a situation which will be exacerbated when our schools merge in September this year. In this context, this project presents a fantastic opportunity to take steps towards levelling the French skill set across the school and we expect that, by bringing teachers from both schools together it will also contribute to the process of developing the two schools into a single teaching organisation.\r\n\r\nOur  project will result in us having greater capacity within our school to teach languages in more Key stages. Teachers and support staff will expand their skills base and become more flexible in what they can offer. \r\n\r\nImprovements in learning and teaching methodology, new ideas shared with the link school, a variety of engaging resources and direct communication with native speakers will make our teaching more enjoyable, and pupils far more engaged and motivated to learn languages. \r\n\r\nBy improving the provision of French in KS2 and introducing it in KS1, attainment will be much greater and pupils will be far better equipped with language skills on entering secondary school.", "http://www.ecclesalljunior.co.uk/", "Ecclesall C of E Junior School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047258_coordinator"]]}}, "8BU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "PATHS: for Solidarity Economy and Youth Entrepreneurship in Europe", "Youth Discovery Ventures Ltd", 79950.0, 5, 5, "PATHS: Youth for Solidarity Economy and Entrepreneurship in Europe (PATHS) is a strategic partnership between European organizations active in the field of education, training and youth designed to promote cooperation and innovation in the field of young social entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nThis project arises from the analysis of the context in which organizations develop their activities and their previous experience in this field. The outcomes of this analysis are: \r\n\r\n1. Given the difficulties that young people find their access to the labour market, youth entrepreneurship is an alternative to unemployment. \r\n\r\n2. To become an entrepreneur is not necessary a specific qualification or a particular academic level, but many young companies die in the first two years. That means that could be necessary to improve the qualifications of young entrepreneurs to reduce the high mortality of young companies. \r\n\r\n3. Entrepreneurship projects based approaches solidarity economy have a mortality rate significantly lower than the entrepreneurial projects of competitive basis. \r\n\r\n4. Organizations in the field of non-formal education and academic institutions (formal education) have interest in promoting entrepreneurship among young people. But there are not enough methodological and training tools. \r\n\r\n5. Given the current social context of Europe and the future prospects, young entrepreneurship will not be a fad. Instead could be the only chance for a new generation. \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are: \r\n\r\n1. To promote cooperation and networking among participating organizations, developing a line of work maintained over time (integral promotion of youth entrepreneurship) based on the ongoing collaboration between European organizations (strategic alliance). \r\n\r\n2. To increase the capacity of organizations working on the promotion of youth entrepreneurship through resources, materials and tools that will improve the quality of its activities and the results thereof. \r\n\r\n3. To promote the development of specific skills by workers of the organizations involved (trainers, trainers, youth workers) and to promote their professional training as facilitators of youth entrepreneurship projects in the field of solidarity economy. \r\n\r\n4. To contribute to the promotion of entrepreneurship among young people as an alternative to unemployment and, simultaneously, as a way to emancipation and to contribute to society. \r\n\r\n5. To contribute to strengthening youth entrepreneurship projects and its transformation into solidarity economy enterprises with consequent multiplier effect in terms of employment and contribution to the common welfare. \r\n\r\n6.

It can accommodate up to 60 people indoors and up to a few hundred during the warmer months when camping is possible.  Ananda Gaorii also has a commercial organic bakery which delivers bread and cakes to Copenhagen and the local area. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are 1) To provide long term residents and participants (including the EVS volunteers) with non-formal learning experiences that will strengthen their community living skills, deepen their personal growth, give them tools to improve their physical and mental health, broaden their vision and give them an opportunity to learn the values and competencies related to living sustainably and managing an active project; 2) To offer short term learning experiences to those who attend the classes, retreats, workshops and trainings offered at Ananda Gaorii or who simply visit Ananda Gaorii to see what we are doing. 3) To benefit the local community by organizing activities which help support and integrate refugees and build a more resilient community;  4) To strengthen our engagement  and cooperation with other organizations sharing similar goals. 5) To encourage volunteering. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the project include: planning and organizing the daily life of the community; learning and practicing yoga and meditation including an option to learn how to teach basic yoga classes; building, maintenance, renovation and interior design; growing food; developing systems for recycling and efficient use of resources; creating small projects for generating income or improving the daily life of the community; hosting and promoting workshops, retreats and classes; looking after the project's website and social media; guiding and coordinating short term volunteers; engaging refugees in cultural and learning activities; participating in farmer's markets and other local activities; exploring the local region; music and learning evenings; swimming at the beach.

In May 2013 Eurostat published the new statistics for the youth unemployment, alarming when it still comes to over 23%.

We believe that by supporting a personal growth and development of young people and by creating spaces for active participation and engagement in social life realities, youth can fulfill their personal and professional potential. This will lead to new social and business ideas and actions/ initiatives, thus reduced youth unemployment.

Need for our project is very clear -first of all, our societies are still quite xenophobic and are afraid of unknown. They are afraid of different cultures and do believe that people from other cultures want to dominate or destroy them. This fear is caused by stereotypes and prejudices and is empowered by media, who shows often only the negatives, and misses the positives. Because this new stereotypes are created every day and people in our society are getting more afraid. There is also a second issue, that people (including also people in power positions like decision makers and people in education system \u2013 youth workers, teachers) are not aware about the differences between refugees and for example economic migrants. For many, all foreigners/immigrants are the same, but in reality each person has his/her own story to tell.

It marks a significant step for YDV in its commitment to providing an increasingly diverse range of international opportunities for young people in the UK and globally. The project is based possible through the organisation's growth in capacity, a creation of a dedicated base in Sheffield, and a commitment to work within the local disadvantaged area and provide activities and events that address the varied social needs of the area. This project will enable us to fulfill those goals.The project's objectives are:1. Develop and increase specific skills, experience and competences in Community Events Management for young people across two activities:European Voluntary Service activity - Four YP, 6 Months, Sheffield.Youth Exchange (x1) 25 young people, a week coinciding with a main community run festival in the city. 2. To increase the number and quality of inclusive, cultural and environmentally sustainable community events in Sheffield that promote the importance of inter-cultural dialogue, sharing heritage and to share this experience and best practice with our European partners.3. To increase YDV's capacity to deliver international informal education opportunities for young people which are high quality, sustainable and inclusive. The EVS activity will meet these objectives by giving the 4 volunteers a structured 6 month placement  in a community events management setting, gradually developing theirs skills through  \u2018on the job\u2019 training under the learning framework of community needs, cultural expression and resource management. Volunteers will live and work together as a team, and receive supervision, mentoring, social and linguistic support.The Youth Exchange will give 25 young people from 5 countries the opportunity to experience a condensed version of the EVS programme under the same framework, with interaction and involvement in the management of the exchange by the four EVS volunteers - thus putting their skills into practice and maximising the involvement of young people. The youth exchange will be during, and include participation in the city's main community event: Tramlines Festival 2016. The anticipated impact of this project will be that the EVS volunteers will increase their confidence in communication (especially in English), team work and leadership, and develop key competences which will allow them to potentially gain employment in this sector. Youth exchange participants will gain a better understanding of the different roles, activities and skills needed to host and manage community events, they will explore what makes an inclusive community event and share different ways of creatively sharing culture and heritage.  They will have increased their international connections and their sense of belonging to a European community and network that can support them to achieve their goals. YDV will increase our capacity to deliver international volunteering in the UK and local area and encourage young British people (especially NEETS) to take part in Youth Mobility Projects. The long term benefits of this project will be that we will connect communities in different European countries and create of a network of partner organisations that share the same principles and act in the spirit of European values. The EVS \u201cteam\u201d  will be connected individuals who are confident, expressive and integrated into the community in Sheffield and whose impact will outlive the duration of the project.

With is project, we are keen to develop and improve on our previous EVS project conducted between April - October 2016 - as a 6 month programme, we felt that a longer programme of 11 months would enable a greater level of intergration and provide an increased timeframe for the volunteers to develop sufficiently in confidence to be able to start working on their own initiative and organise their own activities, as well as having time to reflect and improve. Local context:Sheffield is a polarised city, with many neighbourhoods in the 5% most deprived in the country (www.sheffield.gov.uk).  There are increasing mental and emotional health needs in young people and women in Sheffield, matching national trends and linked strongly with deprivation and health inequality....The city also needs to ensure older people get the services they need, and that young people, black & minority ethnic people and women are more able to access better quality employment (State of Sheffield report, 2016). EVS Volunteers will work within this context and create through their own interests, skills and competences, activities and events that respond to the local needs of the community. Objectives of the project:1. To provide a fantastic learning programme for 4 EVS Volunteers for 11 months, to support them to intergrate into life in the UK and support them to develop skills in community development.2. To develop a programme of EVS-led activities that engage the diverse local communities of Sheffield, including intercultural and intergenerational activities, to bring communities closer together3.

La recente attenzione sugli studi sul funzionamento della mente dell'adolescente e del giovane (Siegel) ci stanno dimostrando che alcuni luoghi comuni Sull'adolescenza sono spiegabili con lo sviluppo cerebrale intenso che caratterizza questa specifica et\u00e0 della vita e, queste spiegazioni, ci propongono approcci di lavoro nuovi in cui l'educazione alle emozioni ricopre un ruolo centrale e risulta essere una competenza centrale per gli operatori giovanili che vogliano far sentire i giovani con cui lavorano VISTI, PROTETTI, CONFORTATI e SICURI DELLA RELAZIONE.Lavorare con le emozioni permette agli operatori giovanili di costruire una relazione di ascolto profondo e positivo anche con i giovani pi\u00f9 difficili da intercettare e feriti, permette di attenuare il disagio adolescenziale e giovanile, aiuta i giovani a essere maggiormente consapevoli e padroni delle proprie dinamiche comportamentali e di raggiungere i propri desiderata in termini di reazioni e azioni e gli fornisce, in termine di life skills, degli strumenti trasversali per un inserimento sociale di successo. Educare alle emozioni pu\u00f2 rappresentare uno strumento valido di prevenzione di comportamenti violenti e estremi. Il progetto si prefigge di promuovere lo sviluppo professionale degli operatori giovanili utilizzando l'educazione emotiva nel lavoro con giovani e gruppi di giovani difficili da intercettare, provenienti da contesti di degrado e con esperienze di violenza interpersonale, agita o subita.

As the embedded world meets the Internet world there will be an increasing number of interacting systems with strong connectivity utilised in both society and in industry. Platforms4CPS targets the transport, manufacturing, energy and health sectors. Europe is a world leader in the area of time-critical and safety-critical systems and to maintain this position there is a need to be able to design, develop and deploy highly distributed and connected digital technologies. There is a move towards increased autonomy and a need to meet demanding safety, security, power efficiency, performance, size and cost constraints. Underlying this is a need to develop a foundational background to create the \u201cscience of systems integration\u201d to manage the complexity of future CPS. Platforms for CPS deployment are also seen as being key for the future, however, these can only become successful if a supporting ecosystem of developers and users is created. Platforms4CPS thus aims to \u201ccreate the vision, strategy, technology building blocks and supporting ecosystem for future CPS applications\u201d with three key objectives to: \n- Create a vision and strategy for future European CPS by analyzing the ecosystem and market perspective and strategically updating and validating existing CPS roadmaps across multiple domains\n- Promote platform building, bringing together industry and academic experts and create a repository of CPS technology building blocks \n- Build an ecosystem by creating a constituency and through cooperating with ECSEL, ITEA, and ARTEMIS projects on the foundations of CPS engineering, and consensus-building on societal and legal issues related to the deployment of CPS\nThe overall objective directly addresses the call objectives in ICT 1-2016b to maintain and develop Europe\u2019s competitive lead in CPS by capitalizing and bringing together expertise for successful exploitation of ICT", 155777.0, 873577.0, 4, 8, "Platforms4CPS", null, null, null, "h2020_205961_958028455"], [1451606400000, 1530316800000, "ICT Policy, Research and Innovation for a Smart Society: towards new avenues in EU-US ICT collaboration", "Thhink Wireless Technologies Limited", "The aim of the 30-months PICASSO project is (1) to reinforce EU-US collaboration in ICT research and innovation focusing on the pre-competitive research in key enabling technologies related to societal challenges - 5G Networks, Big Data, Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems, and (2) to support the EU-US ICT policy dialogue by contributions related to e.g. privacy, security, internet governance,  interoperability, ethics. PICASSO is oriented to industrial needs, provides a forum for ICT communities and involves 24 EU and US prominent specialists in the three technology-oriented ICT Expert Groups and an ICT Policy Expert Group,  working closely together to identify policy gaps in the technology domains and to take measures to stimulate the policy dialogue in these areas.  A synergy between experts in ICT policies and in ICT technologies is a unique feature of PICASSO. An analysis of the industrial drivers, societal needs, and priorities for EU-US ICT collaboration will be done, and policy gaps will be highlighted. An Opportunity Report will point out new avenues for EU-US research, innovation and policy collaboration. An \u201cICT Industry Toolkit\u201d app will support companies and academia in exploiting collaboration opportunities. Policy briefs focusing on specific aspects of identified policy gaps will provide visibility for EU policies and propose ways forward. Strategic initiatives will be investigated and discussed, and a White Paper will be prepared. The outreach campaign will include 30\\ events, success stories factsheets, info sessions and webinars.

ICT offer a seemingly boundless source of innovation, promising to deliver precisely the capabilities European manufacturing businesses require to remain competitive and to furthermore enable them to run their business in a sustainable way. However, the potential of ICT in manufacturing is far from being fully exploited.<br/>Towards making ICT an enabler for innovation in manufacturing, employing suitable IT architectures and services is of fundamental importance. In manufacturing, however, these are in many cases not in place because a) decision makers are not aware of the most suitable architectures and services, b) decision makers may be sceptical towards novel paradigms, c) novel paradigms may not be tailored to meet the demanding manufacturing requirements or d) promising paradigms may indeed not have been discovered for manufacturing.<br/>The Road4FAME project has been conceived to respond to this situation by developing a holistic research and innovation roadmap for architectures and services, aligned with the concrete needs and requirements of manufacturing. In the roadmapping process, promising paradigms and concepts shall be evaluated with respect to their applicability and utility as architectures and services in manufacturing. The roadmap will serve to guide the R&D of architectures and services to match precisely the requirements of European manufacturing businesses. Furthermore, the Road4FAME project will yield strategy recommendations and outline business opportunities tailored to decision makers of European manufacturing businesses enabling them to harness the potential of ICT through the right architectures and services.
