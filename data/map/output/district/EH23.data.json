Some Midlothian schools are already well underway in their exciting journey in implementing effective language programmes in schools.  At Stobhill we feel that we have a great need to develop our knowledge and skills in Spanish so that we too can embark on our exciting journey in taking forward the promotion and implementation of Spanish fully in August 2017 in line with our School/ASG Improvement Plan.   The teachers also feel that they would benefit greatly from attending a follow up course offered in France to consolidate their knowledge and understanding.\r\n\r\nHaving attended several language twilight courses, we have identified that the three participants mentioned in this application all have very different experiences/levels of French and Spanish  We are all in agreement that by visiting Spain and France and being fully immersed in the French and Spanish programmes of study and by experiencing the culture first-hand that this would be the most invaluable and memorable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we believe that we will all be able to share our experiences with the rest of our colleagues at Stobhill in order, not only to motivate them, but also to instil a real enthusiasm for learning French across all stages of the school.\r\n\r\nThe immersion programme embraces the key principles of Curriculum for Excellence, therefore, being given this opportunity as lifelong learners ourselves, can only serve to ensure that the French and Spanish learning programmes we will create and deliver will reflect the seven principles of curriculum design.  Moreover, when teachers receive positive, relevant and meaningful CPD experiences then this can ensure \"positive, relevant and meaningful learning programmes\" can be created and delivered by all staff.  Bruner advocates that the most effective way to learn is through active discovery and as we all support Bruner's theory we believe that this course is ideal.\r\n\r\nThis course encompasses learning French and Spanish with natives speakers, developing a greater cultural awareness and discovering new ways of teaching languages through a variety of media.  This courses offer invaluable training in the teaching of foreign languages to young learners through observing and participating in modelled activities.  A real incentive of attending these courses is the facility to network with other professionals from across Scotland, France and Spain, and share resources and good practice.  The applicants were delighted to have access to the LFEE platform after the initial immersion course in Salignac, France which is an invaluable resource with many tested resources and activities. By having this bank of resources, these can be adapted to suit the interests and needs of all learners at all levels, this enables teachers to plan exciting lessons to engage all our children in language learning.  The applicants are excited with the opportunity to have access to a similar platform with Spanish resources to use with their learners.\r\n\r\nThis experience will inspire the participants to share their first-hand experiences with their learning community - pupils, colleagues, parents.  This project will enable the participants to build up a network which will be invaluable to share good practice, lessons, as well as guidance with any issues that may arise.\r\n\r\nWe have recognised that we all at different levels with French  and Spanish and we have different experience with foreign languages and by taking part in this project we hope to be inspired to fully embrace the 1+2 approach in line with Government policy.", "http://stobhill.mgfl.net", "Stobhill Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035956_coordinator"], [2016, "Language Learning", "Stobhill Primary School", 5273.0, 1, 1, "This application is for four Primary teachers (including 1+2 Lead Learner) to participate in an immersion course to increase language capacity and improve conversational language in line with the Scottish Government's 1+2 languages approach.
