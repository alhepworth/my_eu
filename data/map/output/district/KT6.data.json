However, companies find that these graduates, left the school system, have serious weaknesses in relation to practical skills-operative and the soft skills, particularly language especially when graduates are working in companies operating in foreign markets. Therefore in the first months of joining the company, the activities of neo-matter is quite unproductive.The project, therefore, is to ensure that, through a placement abroad in companies of the sector, the new graduates should perfect their training, achieve competencies and technical skills and cross-claims by companies that offer them work, and ultimately, to access more easily and expertise in the world of work, which in turn, benefiting from human resources and youth already qualified, will see improved their performances.Target group are graduates from the Technical Institutes Consortium partners, selected after participating in tenders issued by the Municipality in collaboration with the sending schools. It's a two-years project and,   for each school, will be selected graduates in the year 2016 and 2017; the selection criteria will favor the motivation, knowledge of foreign languages and the vote of diploma requirements deemed critical to successfully undertake and effectiveness of an experience as electrifying as intense as the majority, never lived experiences of living away from the family context, until now; experience that, therefore,  requires tenacity, perseverance and adaptability.The selected beneficiaries, after a run-up cultural and pedagogical regarding the country of destination, and after signing the Learning Agreement, undertake their internship experience, lasting four months, in selected European companies, taking part at the same time and for all the training period,  in a language training online on the electronic platform designed and made available by the Erasmus+ program. During the internship they will be supervised and assisted constantly by a tutor, both in Italy and abroad, who will assess the progress during the course and the learning outcomes at the end of the internship. This will enable beneficiaries to obtain, once back in their country of origin, the Europass Mobility Document, the Europass CV, the European Language Passport, the Certificate of participation in language training online, indicating the level achieved, certificates expendable for entry into employment.The Municipality of Baronissi is the beneficiary of financing, general coordinator of the project, and point of reference for the Erasmus+ National  Agency;  partner schools are sending bodies, responsible for selecting, referring to the definition of Learning Outcomes; Iris Institute and the Bank  will set in the diffusion and dissemination of project results; The Bank will also act as sponsorship as reward 4 trainees, returning from the mobility experience abroad, with training vouchers redeemable for a specialization course in the field.Benefits are expected from the project on the direct beneficiaries, the new graduates who will consolidate the technical and professional knowledge and language skills, gain practical skills and operational, develop interpersonal and organizational skills, and last , but not least , develop an open mind on European citizenship.

We will ensure that our students acquire social, civic and intercultural competences, by promoting democratic values and fundamental rights, social inclusion and non-discrimination, as well as active citizenship.
