By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat.

Evaluation comments have been fully addressed; WP structure completely revised and the consortium strengthened, particularly by addition of Airbus as Technical Lead.  Aircraft data networks have increased dramatically in complexity throughout the history of powered flight. Modern networks must support many nodes with a wide range of span lengths, bandwidths and protocols. Existing systems, chiefly based on copper conductors, have evolved to support these ever-increasing demands. These networks have consequently become larger, heavier and more expensive, and this trend is set to continue. A coordinated step change to fibre optics would reduce network size, weight and cost and improve the modularity, flexibility and scalability. Moreover, fibre brings many other advantages including EMC immunity and improved security. By defining networks according to a DAL-based hierarchy, the flexibility of photonics can be harnessed within the constraints of safety certification restrictions.  Terrestrial telecoms provides a rich source of technology. However, R&D is required to adapt terrestrial photonics for aircraft networks. Cabin systems have been identified as the most immediate application area: here the need for high flexibility (driven by customisation), high bandwidth (driven by information-to-the-seat) and large node count mean that the technology and business cases for photonics are compelling.

A further aim is to achieve 50% cost reduction for finished parts, compared to traditional processing.\n\nThe project will design, demonstrate and deliver a modular streamlined work-flow at factory level, offering maximum processing flexibility during AM, a major reduction in non-added-value delays, as well as a 50% reduction in shop-floor space compared with conventional factories.\n\nAMAZE will dramatically increase the commercial use of adaptronics, in-situ sensing, process feedback, novel post-processing and clean-rooms in AM, so that (i) overall quality levels are improved, (ii) dimensional accuracy is increased by 25% (iii) build rates are increased by a factor of 10, and (iv) industrial scrap rates are slashed to <5%.\n\nScientifically, the critical links between alloy composition, powder/wire production, additive processing, microstructural evolution, defect formation and the final properties of metallic AM parts will be examined and understood. This knowledge will be used to validate multi-level process models that can predict AM processes, part quality and performance.\n\nIn order to turn additive manufacturing into a mainstream industrial process, a sharp focus will also be drawn on pre-normative work, standardisation and certification, in collaboration with ISO, ASTM and ECSS.\n\nThe team comprises 31 partners: 21 from industry, 8 from academia and 2 from intergovernmental agencies.

A prototype Rankine cycle cabin air-conditioning system, utilising a cryogenic working fluid is designed.\n\u2022 All cryo-tank technologies will be driven by system requirements of advanced passenger vehicles (e.g. LAPCAT A2 and the SpaceLiner) and results will at the study end be assessed on impact.'", 236508.0, 3435210.0, 7, 11, "CHATT", null, "http://www.gasdynamics.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/158205.jpg", "fp7_100271_999702856"], [1304208000000, 1446249600000, "Aero-Thermodynamic Loads on Lightweight Advanced Structures II", "Gas Dynamics Ltd", "ATLLAS II is a logical follow-up of a recently finalized FP6 project which has as objectives the identification and assessment of advanced light-weight and high-temperature resistant materials for high-speed vehicles up to Mach 6.\n\nThe material requirements are first defined through an in-depth feasibility study of a Mach 5-6 vehicle. The consortium has now this capability at hand as they can rely on a first set of validated tools, material databases and valuable experience acquired during ATLLAS-I. Starting with a preliminary aero-thermal-structural high-speed vehicle design process, further multi-disciplinary optimization and testing will follow to result into a detailed layout of an independently European defined and assessed high-speed vehicle. Special attention will be given to alleviate sonic boom and emissions at high altitudes.\n\nThroughout the design process, the aero-thermal loads will define the requirements for the proposed materials and cooling techniques needed for both the airframe and propulsion components. The former will focus on sharp leading edges, intakes and skin materials each coping with different external aero-thermal loads. The latter will be exposed to internal combustion driven loads. Both metallic (Titanium Matrix Composites and Ni-based Hollow Sphere Stackings) and non-metallic materials (Ceramic Matrix Composites and Ultra High Temperature Composites) will be evaluated.\nCombined aero-thermal-structural experiments will test various materials as specimens and realistic shapes at extreme conditions representative for high flight Mach numbers. Both static and cyclic tests at low and high temperatures are planned including the evaluation of their durability in terms of long duration exposure to the harsh flight conditions.
