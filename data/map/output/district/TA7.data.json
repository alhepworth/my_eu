The latest UK statistics indicate that the highest workplace fatalities occur within this sector. Previous project partner research also reported related health & safety concerns within this sector & developed a framework for common European VET competence standards. These standards can be adapted & developed further for use within the WAH occupations. At the same time this project aims to facilitate best practice & high quality instruction amongst VET providers & skills trainers of WAH courses across Europe & beyond, exchanging knowledge, innovations & expertise in the process.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe ultimate project goal is to \u2018raise safety standards\u2019 & \u2018reduce accidents & fatalities\u2019 of workers at height within agriculture & the environment. The 7 key project objectives to successfully achieve this goal are as follows:\r\n1. Organise & run trainer technical standard setting events \r\n2. Organise & run trainer technical evaluation and verification events \r\n3. Produce trainer Codes of Practice, training guides etc for WAH \r\n4. Produce a project web page/social media links & blogs \r\n5. Develop a high quality VET provider & trainer e-knowledge library  \r\n6. Develop a Data Warehouse incorporating web-based analysis tools i.e. statistical analysis of fatalities/accidents etc\r\n7. Develop 3 new European occupational standards & related competence certification in the safe use of chainsaws & other equipment for WAH within agriculture & the environment\r\n\r\nProject Participants:\r\nThe project consists of a very experienced & capable partnership of 12 organisations tasked to ensure its success. Their make-up consists of VET & project management specialists, private & public bodies, non-profit organisations, e-learning, WAH & adult education specialists & government institutions in the education & agriculture sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Activities:\r\nOver the project lifecycle the partnership will undertake numerous tasks in pursuit of the ultimate VET-Safety goal. These include for example:\r\n\u2022 VET-Industry consultations\r\n\u2022 Meeting presentations\r\n\u2022 WAH training techniques analysis\r\n\u2022 WAH competency developments\r\n\u2022 WAH incident evaluations\r\n\u2022 Project dissemination on many levels across numerous sectors\r\n\u2022 International certification events\r\n\u2022 Training publications & guidance materials etc\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Methodology:\r\nThe project will be undertaken in 4 stages within its lifecycle as follows.\r\n\r\nStage 1: (Pre-cycle)\r\nUndertake pre-project planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop an effective management plan, project organisational structure & dissemination plan\r\nSchedule the objectives into an action plan of individual tasks & work packages\r\nResource & run trainer standard setting events in partner countries & develop VET training standards\r\nMonitor & evaluate feedback & disseminate information gathered till end of project\r\nPromote project information through the web, social media links etc till end of project\r\n\r\nStage 2: (Mid-cycle)\r\nResource & run trainer evaluation and verification events in partner countries & develop VET assessment standards\r\nPilot test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nUndertake post-project sustainability planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nProduce a project interim report & evaluate findings\r\n\r\nStage 3: (End-cycle)\r\nLive test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nCompletion of VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nDevelop a project \u2018Exit Strategy\u2019\r\nProject End & final report & evaluation of the findings\r\n\r\nStage 4: (Post-cycle)\r\nAnalysis of project feedback\r\nContinued development, dissemination & enhancement of project products & goals\r\n\r\nProject Impact:\r\nThe project will reach its objectives via enhancement of current training products available but more importantly through completely NEW partnership innovations focused on VET WAH safety. These are:\r\n1. Web based VET knowledge library: e-LIBRARY \r\n2. International VET Data Warehouse & associated incident analysis & reporting tools \r\n3. Safe use of ladders & MEWPS & emergency rescue techniques VET qualification \r\n4. Aerial use & safety of a chainsaw VET qualification \r\n5. Safe use of winches in manual & mechanised lifting & pulling operations VET qualification \r\nThe web based e-tools will enhance training experience, course delivery methods & benefiting both the trainer & trainee. These tools associated with 3 new European qualifications accredited & delivered to high quality standards will have an immediate impact in helping to reduce accidents & fatalities. Longer-term development of these across Europe will lead to further reductions in accidents & fatalities & increased worker safety on a wider scale supported by the unique predictive analysis capability of the VET Data Warehouse", "http://www.blaketraining.co.uk", "A1 Arborists LTD/Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001870_4"]]}}, "9BD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1349049600000, 1412035200000, "Competitive stationary low concentrating solar module of novel design", "Architectural Solar Limited", "The achievement of the goals of the European energy and climate change policy necessitates the development and deployment of a diverse portfolio of low carbon energy technologies. In 2010, photovoltaic (PV) technology was the leading renewable energy technology in terms of capacity growth in Europe. But for reaching the main sectorial target: \u201cup to 15% of the EU electricity will be generated by solar energy in 2020\u201d it is a pre-requisite to achieve the substantial reduction of costs and the improvement of device efficiencies.\nRecent developments in PV worldwide business are showing that other global economies are fiercely fighting to take over EU leadership in the production of the PV products as well as technology. EU could maintain a competitive position due to introduction of new cost-effective photovoltaic technologies underpinned by strong RTD efforts allowing European companies to develop innovative knowledge intensive solutions through whole supply chain to capture market share.\nThe biggest influences on the cost effectiveness of the conversion of cells to modules are the optimisation of cell efficiency and material consumption and the optimisation of the combined module manufacturing and installation cost.\nThe proposed project aims to bring the innovative photovoltaic technology enabling achievement of 0,67 \u20ac/W cost target in next two years. To achieve this goal proposers will develop innovative concepts for key components of PV system, prototype and test the stationary low concentrating photovoltaic module of novel design. The proposed solutions enable higher conversion efficiency and 5-fold reduction of active material \u2013 both leading to significant cost/performance, resulting more than 20% reduction of the Watt-peak. By creating a non-competitive supply chain within the consortium the SME partners will be able to use the new technology developed to secure their competitive advantage in PV markets and over 10 year\u2019s period make a cumulative profit of about 27 M\u20ac.", 118540.0, 1343521.0, 5, 8, "SOLGAIN", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/146970.jpg", "fp7_105027_971100466"]]}}}}
