Today, it is not enough to educate children independently. Diversity should be provided in educational settings for children to interact with their environment throughout the educational process as from early ages. (Sobel, D., 1997) Through out-of-school instruction as a complementary model of in-class instruction, children have the opportunity to learn through their hearing in a comfortable environment. In addition, it can be said that outdoor games have a positive impact on Gardner's multiple intelligence theory  and can be said to be based on studies in the literature that have created positive developments especially in the areas of natural intelligence, inner intelligence, social intelligence and bodily intelligence (Sahin, C. , 2007). We can show that children enjoy outdoor activities more than the classroom activities , have a higher motivation and more permanent learning because they learn by doing-living(Civelek, 2016).\r\n      \r\nThe objectives of our project are;\r\n* To learn and teach outdoor games belonging to different cultures from each other,\r\n*To learn \"how we can take learning outdoor\" from each other,enrich its implementation,examples of activities and prepare lesson plans, \r\n* To enrich the outdoor pedagogical infrastructure of our teachers by exchanging information with our partners and by observing the schools,\r\n* To make learning more permanent, creative and fun,\r\n* To enrich and diversify our educational environments,\r\n*To increase the sports/physical activities and make them more active,\r\n* To increase the love of nature and environmental awareness of our students,\r\n*To raise awareness of students about healthy living and healthy nutrition,\r\n* By exchanging our experiences and good practises,we can learn from each other transnationally. All of the partners are interested in outdoor pedagogy and share their knowledge.\r\n\r\n         We are 7 primary schools from partner countries, Turkey (coordinator), Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Poland and United Kingdom. 42 students and 55 teachers will actively participate in the transnational mobilities. We will do 4 Transnational Meetings and 3 Learning/Teaching/Training events. With the help of our project, we will learn different and cultural outdoor games and enrich our educational life of the students crossculturally. We will have an exchange of ideas about taking learning outdoors, the sample activities and lesson plans for teaching maths, science, social sciences, language, arts, physical education, etc. outside the classroom. We will also create a school atmosphere with the students playing and learning at the same time. We will increase the awareness of healthy students, healthy children, healthy life styles and healthy nutritituon. We aim at creating a holistic approach of teachers and students through outdoor pedagogy. Students will both learn and play at school. They will acquire the knowledge about environmental consciousness and healthy living (nutrition and physical activity). The students will spend more time outside the classroom and again they will learn through experience.\r\n\r\n       We will prepare a \"Handbook for Outdoor Games and Taking Learning Outdoors\" and publish it in English and every partner's language. Also, we will distribute its e-book format in our project's blog page and in our eTwinning project. The teachers will learn new outdoor games and activities to take learning outdoors from there. We will show some photos and videos in the blog page and social media through facebook, twitter,etc. Every partner will organize a seminar in their countries to the school principals about the project, its targets, results and the outputs will be run. Then, the school principals will present them to the primary school teachers. They will motivate their teachers to use these methods at schools. \r\n\r\n       As a conclusion, Our students will both learn and have fun at school with outdoor games, and love spending their time at schools more. As we will enrich and diversify our educational environments, our students will also learn peripherally and experience different subjects in different and enriched outdoor places/gardens as classrooms. Students will be more active, do much more sport/physical activities and be healthier. We aim at our students have beneficial habits throughout their entire upbringing and in their lifetime.", "http://www.merchantsacademy.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-TR01-KA219-045812_5"], [2016, "Better Spanish at the Merchants' Academy's Primary Phase", "Merchants' Academy", 13638.0, 1, 1, "The Primary Phase of the Merchants' Academy taught Spanish to the students because it was the language they were to learn when they entered the Academy's Secondary Phase. The teachers at the Primary Phase were aware that their knowledge of the Spanish language was inadequate and lacked the confidence to teach it effectively. Consequently, a language specialist was hired to teach Spanish to students in KS2 but this amounted to no more than half an hour a week and frequently less. The staffs' concerns grew and there were several meetings during 2015 to try and formulate an action plan to improve the teaching and learning of Spanish. The staff decided that at least one teacher from all Phases of the Primary Phase, with students' age ranging from 3 - 11, would undertake  professional development to ensure that the teaching and learning of Spanish was effective and continuous throughout the school and curriculum to guarantee students progress.After much debate and research it was decided that an Erasmus+ funded project would best meet the needs of the Merchants' Academy's students and teachers' professional development.Staff's enthusiasm to study in Spain was universal and a selection process was undertaken to choose the staff that best met the needs of the school. A teacher from Early Years was chosen, 2 teachers from KS1 and 1 from KS2. All these teachers are relatively new to the profession with no one having more than 5 years experience. Two more experienced teachers, who teach in all the Phases, were chosen to ensure continuity across the school even in the event of unforeseen long term absence of one or more  of the other participants.The language schools are in Malaga and the courses are Primary specific. There are strong cultural elements to the courses and they teach Spanish through tried and tested successful methodologies which the participants will adopt in their own practice and disseminate to colleagues in the Academy.An action plan has been put in place to assure the efficacy of the teaching and learning and there will be continuous reflection and reviews of practice to ensure that the students make good progress.Assessment and evaluation of the project is continuous and an integral feature, essential if standards in teaching and learning are to improve.The impact of the project will be disseminated beyond the Academy and its stakeholders and it is hoped that teachers will continue to develop their professional practice to ensure the children 'will achieve more than they ever thought possible' - the school motto.", "http://www.merchantsacademy.org", "Merchants' Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023844_coordinator"]]}}}}
