This 4 year project will establish a European network of creators to encourage and support creativity, innovation and art production, support and develop emerging talent and assist the creation, distribution and monetisation of art.Our focus will be on creativity in an urban context, with an emphasis on music, digital art and street art. We will explore this through a series of co-created, co-curated and co-produced events, residencies, laboratories and conferences bringing together experienced cultural players and creative organisations from cities across Europe: Bristol, Bergen, St. Etienne, Aix en Provence, Liepaja, Cornella, Zagreb, Berlin and Kuopio, and further afield in Quebec. Through a collaborative process of skill sharing, learning from the experiences of others, citizen engagement and artist, audience & community development, we will join forces to:* create a new platform for the sharing of emerging, innovative and collaborative art across Europe* create a cohort of artists able to develop and engage a wide range of new and diverse audiences across the world* create new ways for art to engage with and stimulate communities. This will have the power to affect positive social changes throughout EuropeThis network will act as an incubator for cultural innovation and new practices in creativity by stimulating risk taking through the development of challenging artworks in challenging circumstances. Collectively we will:* strengthen connections between citizens, communities and creativity* create a vision for the future of art which engages communities not only as consumers but as creators* empower and enable citizens to shape and build stronger communities through participatory artistic, creative processes* build and develop new audiences across the world* create an ecosystem for a sustainable creative economy", "http://www.superact.org.uk", "SUPERACT!

In days gone by, people had the knowledge and capacity to be able to grow their own food, but this is no longer the case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing in allotments and cooking at home are both declining skills amongst those populations.

Gardening  (growing vegetables, flowers)\r\n\r\n2. Cooking (to feed oneself, to please)\r\n\r\n3. Creation&beauty (transforming-using for creative arts)\r\n\r\n4.

COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 223275.0, 7, 7, "Central to the project is the question of how to reach those remote from education \u2013 i.e., people who for whatever reason have had little or no formal adult education - to improve their participation in further education and to design and provide low-threshold learning opportunities. Studies show that only about 10% of the low-qualified participate in further education \u2013 among graduates of universities, the participation quote is four times as high. Education experts agree that being remote from education is not due solely to the individuals themselves. Often the institutions, too, are distant from the target audience. This is why experts suggest outreach educational counselling as well as further alternative approaches to increase participation in further education.\r\n\r\nOur project ON THE MOVE has its foundations in European Policies and in recent research done within the PIAAC programme.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Lifelong learning and the development of skills are important factors in this strategy. The European Agenda for Adult Learning (EAAL) is directly linked to this and therefore puts emphasis on the necessity for increased participation in adult learning. Whilst participation rates vary considerably amongst EU countries, the rates for low-skilled adults are generally low.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are identifying, testing, developing (further) and disseminating successful approaches improving the integration and support of the educationally remote. With this project, staff in counselling and educational institutions in Europe will learn about alternative approaches (predominantly of the outreach kind) bringing educationally remote and low-qualified people to further education and will implement these in their countries. This project will increase the chances of the educationally remote to find (better) work, as this is directly correlated with the level of qualification. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\n\r\n- Research from all project partners on suitable best practice examples in Europe for reaching educationally remote people. This also includes previously conducted European projects, whose results we will disseminate further. \r\n\r\n- Assessment matrix which we will use to evaluate the identified counselling projects and develop new approaches. \r\n\r\n- Website including an Open Educational Resource with at least 30 projects of outreach counselling from different european countries. The site will be available in all partner languages. \r\n\r\n- A professional publication (ebook and print) which will contain 30 descriptions of the identified best practice examples. Like the website, this will offer didactic instructions which will enable the implementation of outreach educational counselling and other alternative approaches to reaching the educationally remote at other institutions, too.  \r\n\r\n- 6 Video interviews in which we will interview skilled personell from best practice projects and accompany them at their work: how do they reach people, how do they counsel them, what are the topics etc.?\r\n\r\n- In our main product, the best practice publication, we will also include recommendations for the use of \"easy language\" better reaching the target groups needs.\r\n\r\n- For internal use we will produce and regularly update a dissemination and a quality plan, draft a project management handbook and a project agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation phase, each partner will form an assessment group consisting of 5 people active in the area of further education/adult education, which will evaluate the project examples that were researched in the first (research) phase using the assessment matrix and make recommendations for (further) development. The members of this group can be counsellors, trainers, managers, or political decision-makers. The groups will be put together in such a way so as to ensure the necessary specialist expertise to evaluate the projects as well as guaranteeing a widespread dissemination from the start. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the project, each partner will organise a public event and invite educational institutions, representatives of charities, those active in adult and further education, representatives of umbrella organisations (e.g. the Volkshochschulverband (Adult Education Association) in Germany), political decision-makers, representatives of the press, and everyone who is interested in the subject. Each event should reach at least 30 people resulting in 200+ participants. During this event, the best practice approaches that were identified and developed will be presented and the publication will be distributed.  In addition we will deliver the project publication to at least 150 university libraries and lecturers across Europe.", "http://www.superact.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA204-001579_4"], [2015, "ALADDIN and the intergenerational lamp", "SUPERACT!
