This project will tackle two significant environmental challenges facing Europe, whilst also offering added value to the construction industry.\nThe first issue addressed is that of mixed plastic waste. In Europe, in 2014, 18 million tonnes of post-consumer waste plastics were landfilled or incinerated, as they could not be easily separated and recycled. Alternative uses for such waste must be found.\nThe second issue is the growth in the use of plywood, typically manufactured from slow-growing, tropical hardwoods. This material is a key, high volume commodity in construction industry formworks and an area the size of Madrid is deforested each year to meet Europe\u2019s demand.\nECOSHEET-PRO transforms mixed plastic that would otherwise be wasted into a competitive, reusable, plywood replacement. Previous attempts to create such boards have failed to deliver the required strength or cost effectiveness required by industry. We have overcome these barriers through an innovative manufacturing process, which will be scaled up and refined during this project.\nECOSHEET-PRO has the potential to re-define the \u20ac1.8 billion European plywood industry and help Europe meet its demanding plastic recycling targets, contributing to the circular economy. Our success stems from bringing together the complementary expertise of two eco-innovative SMEs from Italy and the UK, both with a strong ambition to grow and internationalise.\nAcross a network of 13 facilities in 2023, ECOSHEET-PRO will create 77 jobs, generate annual revenues of over \u20ac76.5 million, annual profits of \u20ac26.8 million, and transform >221,000 tonnes of waste into valuable products.", 419250.0, 2797944.0, 2, 2, "ECOSHEET-PRO", null, null, null, "h2020_210848_934599269"], [1430438400000, 1446249600000, "An Environmentally-Friendly Alternative to Plywood made from Co-mingled Waste Plastic", "Environmental Technology Evolution Ltd", "At present, 50% of all EU plastic waste still ends up in landfill.

Unfortunately, the majority of plastic waste within the EU are in the co-mingled contaminated category which are notoriously difficult to separate or recycle. Furthermore, also polluting EU landfills is end of life plywood. More than 300k tonnes of plywood waste is generated yearly most of which end up in landfill. Plywood contains toxic resins, adhesives which leach into the soil and are damaging to the environment.  \n\nThe aim of this innovation project is to bring to technology maturity and market readiness an environmentally friendly, cost effective, alternative to plywood made from low grade mixed-plastic waste, specifically for the construction industry. By so doing, we will cut down on the global demand for plywood (3 million m3 in 2013 in Europe alone - globalwood.org), and thereby stem the tide of global deforestation.

There are a large number of such young people in the North East of England who are unemployed, but there is also a shortage of such young people with relevant work experience in most areas of the local economy; EUROVET1618 aims to provide carefully chosen bespoke work placements in Europe, which will enable the participants to acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in their occupational sector, in order to give them a better chance of securing employment locally at an appropriate level. This will also contribute to the regeneration of the local economy by helping to provide the trained workforce that is needed in most of the region's industry sectors, and in particular business and marketing, media and graphic design, and hospitality and tourism.A recent report (19/03/2014) by the Local Government Association (LGA) concluded that the problem of underachievement among 16-24 year olds is particularly acute in industrial cities in northern England, such as Newcastle. One of the areas with the biggest pool of 'hidden talent' among 16-24 year olds is Tyne and Wear (43%) In 2015, in their report \u201cThe Geography of Youth Unemployment\", The Work Foundation at the University of Lancaster found that youth unemployment in most major UK cities was considerably higher than comparable cities in Germany, and that in the Newcastle conurbation it is currently running at 21-25%The region's economic development needs skills in all sectors and in particular business and marketing, media and graphic design, and hospitality and tourism, which are all fundamental to future growth; with the need to drive up demand for skills, most of the new work opportunities in these sectors will be at the qualified vocational levels.Furthermore all employers continue to demand greater soft skills such as those which can be developed in a trans-national work placement.EUROVET1618 will introduce participants to the experience of living and working in other EU countries, and to the principle of looking further afield for new ideas and inspiration. It is intended that by experiencing mobility placements they will gain new practical experiences, learn how to carry out occupational tasks in different ways, begin to see new employment possibilities and develop adaptability to change in their chosen occupational areas, and in this way contribute to improving the competitiveness of our key regional industries. By working for 3 months within a different culture they will develop the 'soft skills' which are now key for employment, and it is also hoped that they will increase their awareness of wider European citizenship, culture, traditions, and languages, and hence become better EU citizens through this experience.The aims of the project are therefore:1) To enhance the employability of young people who have recently completed vocational training at NVQ Level 3 through to NVQ Level 6 (undergraduate level), and who are resident in the north east of England, by providing them with relevant work experience in other countries2) To enable these participants to broaden and develop their linguistic and cultural knowledge, skills and competences through direct experience of working in other countries3) To contribute to the regional economy by producing potential high quality recruits who have a European and international perspective, and who can add European value to companies who employ them4) To add value to participants' existing qualifications by providing them with opportunities to practise and develop their existing skills in a European contextExpected outcomes are:1) Participants who are more knowledgeable, skilled, personally and professionally confident, and employable than before their placements2) Participants who can add value to companies in key economic sectors in the north east of England by providing a European and international perspectiveThe mobilities will take place over a period of two years; there will be 32 mobilities in total, divided into 8 groups of 4 mobilities each, to four experienced host partner organisations in four different countries.4 groups of 4 participants will each undertake a work placement at the same time in the same country, providing opportunities for mutual support and reflection and sharing of experiences.In addition, each of the 8 groups will receive monitoring visits during their placement from an Accentuate 'accompanying person'.

According to requirements the group of participants will be supplemented by students from other fields of apprenticeships. Additionally, a fair number of students who are in their second year of the Vocational High School with the profile Foreign Language Correspondent take part in the project. In the course of this project the 40 participants will complete a four- to six-week placement in England, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands or Malta which will take place in two flows in autumn of 2014 and 2015. The participants will be prepared in linguistic and intercultural matters through the KBS Nordhorn and placed into the companies abroad by the partners. Some of them will be visited during their placement through the teachers of the KBS Nordhorn. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this transnational cooperation with the partner institutions is the quality improvement of the apprenticeship through the learning of intercultural key qualifications for the apprentices and Foreign Language Correspondents. The growing international orientation and as a consequence thereof the necessity of lifelong learning is especially significant for all jobs in the business area. For this purpose a competent use of English as the international lingua franca is essential. Accordingly, the participants will gain considerable insight into foreign companies.  For the Foreign Language Correspondents the placement serves an ideal supplement to their English and Spanish classes.

The planned duration of the placements is between 2 and 6 weeks according to the corporate frame conditions, so the project also provides the possibility to have longer placements for participants. An important focus of the project lies on the use of ECVET as method for the qualitative implementation of the mobility actions. At the beginning of the selection process we will define units of learning outcomes together with the companies and according to the professional profile which will be able to be gained during the practical placement. These will be agreed with the host organisations in a memorandum of understanding. A learning agreement will be the basis of agreement between apprentices and companies and if needed their parents. In a personal transcript the acquired units of learning outcomes will be documented at the end of the placement as basis for further recognition. Besides ECVET the participants will also be issued an Europass for the documentation of their practical placement. \r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented in a co-operation of well experienced intermediary organisations with excellent contacts and networks to companies in all four sectors. With this we can offer the possibility to reflect the conditions and requirements of companies and apprentices in a best possible way.
