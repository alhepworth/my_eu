The reasons behind this loss of competitiveness is manifold: (i) lower man power costs in the Emerging countries, (ii) lack of regulatory requirements in the emerging Countries, are the most obvious. The CCRYSTAL main objective is to develop a new technology to crystallize pharmaceutical substances, affording fundamental new approaches to obtain products with high purity levels and constant and reproducible crystalline forms at a competitive price, enabling EU APIs industry to regain his competitiveness against Asian Producers. The innovative proposed technologies are based on a new concept crystallizer and on continuous mode operation. Crystallizer is designed in such a way to assure a perfect actuation of elaborated operation strategies, intended to control the main phenomena involved in crystal formation: (i) Primary nucleation; (ii) Secondary nucleation; (iii) Crystal growth.

Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps.

Finally, we will compile a Policy Brief (Output O3), stating the advantages of Green Learning Environments for children in general and our target group more specific. The Policy Brief will also include a brief summary of the project and will introduce the materials and outputs developed.The project will involve 125 children with special needs from 6 schools, and 175 staff members from these schools. We will communicate widely and give a lot of attention towards disseminating the results and tools provided by the project through social media, newsletters, articles in local and specialised press, conferences, mailing lists, ... (expected audience: at least 2000). The project will be closed by a Concluding Seminar, which will be held concurrently in the three countries involved (expected attendance: 55 national participants and 15 international participants each) (Multiplier Events E1, E2 & E3). To stimulate interaction between the 3 concurring seminars, we will set up video-conferencing; online streaming (and recording) the conferences makes it possible to expand the audience to people attending online during, or after the conferences. The Policy Brief will be sent out to relevant local, regional, national and European administrations, authorities, expert networks, umbrella organisations, politicians and policy-makers (over 125 addressees expected). In total we will reach over 2600 people.Apart from the results during the project, we aim at leaving a legacy trough the Green Learning Environments Toolbox, which will be widely promoted and will be freely available online, also after the end of the project, and trough the Policy Brief. We are assured that the project will lead to an increased awareness on the advantages of green areas for formal and non-formal learning. We are assured the Toolbox will stimulate schools and organisations to go outdoors for learning, leading to increased learning outcomes, and eventually to a better inclusion of the target group in society.", "http://green-lane.eschools.co.uk/website", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE02-KA201-017373_9"]]}}, "4RF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1383177600000, "DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNIQUES FOR TRAIN AXLES", "Phoenix Inspection Systems Limited", "The structural integrity of wheel sets used in rolling stock is of great importance to the rail industry and its customers. A number of rail accidents have been directly related to the failure of train axles, leading to increased demands for their inspection and maintenance. Visual inspection and Magnetic Particle Inspection are the current standard practices used for manual non-destructive testing of axles. However, these processes require removal of the wheelset from the wagon/locomotive bogie and full disassembly in order to facilitate access.  Inspection is also carried out by some wagon providers using ultrasonic testing (UT) but its application is also limited to disassembled wheelsets.\n\nAn axle on a wheelset can be connected to a number of ancillary components including breaks and bearings. The disassembly (and reassembly) of axles from the wheelsets/wagon bogey is therefore very time consuming and expensive. There is evidence that even partial disassembly and reassembly could introduce future axle reliability problems. To minimise disruption to their train services but ensure continued safety, train operators require frequent and regular inspection methods that allow quick inspection at the depot with the minimum of wheelset and bogie disassembly.\n\nThe AxleInspect project aims to develop new inspection techniques based on phased array ultrasonic and electromagnetic techniques suitable for the inspection of both solid and hollow axles. For solid axles, inspection techniques are to be developed that inspect from the end face of the axles using new and novel phased array ultrasonic inspection technology. For hollow axles, probes based on UT and electromagnetic inspection techniques are to be developed, enabling detection of surface breaking cracks that cannot be found by ultrasonic inspection. These new techniques will allow inspection of axles whilst they are still attached to their supporting bogey, allowing minimal wheelset disassembly from the train.", 240403.0, 1127834.0, 4, 8, "AxleInspect", null, "http://www.phoenixisl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/145778.jpg", "fp7_100825_998136888"], [1246406400000, 1317340800000, "Autonomous Robot for an Automatic Inspection of Nozzle Welds in Nuclear Environment", "Phoenix Inspection Systems Limited", "Regular in-service inspection is important to verify the integrity of welded nozzle sections in nuclear and other safety critical facilities. Nozzle sections made from austenitic steel can be susceptible to rapid crack growth due to thermal fatigue and stress corrosion. Early detection of cracks is therefore essential to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility in question.  In order to reduce the time and cost of such inspections there is an urgent need to develop a system capable of performing a full inspection of nozzles without the need to change probes. The aim of NozzleInspect project is to design an autonomous robot system that able to: reduce the inspection times, Improve defect delectability and sizing, Reduce human intervention which will reduce workforce radiation uptake and Reduce requirement for robotic manipulation and consequently reduce size and cost of robotic deployment system.  The goal of NozzleInspect project is to improve the reliability of the inspection of the welded nozzle sections in nuclear and other safety critical facilities. The robot will carry out a new and novel flexible phased array probe to allow a full inspection of nozzle weld areas and an advanced navigation system that follow the weld in nozzle. The presence of defects in these parts could lead to catastrophic component failure.", 232503.0, 1258389.0, 6, 8, "NOZZLEINSPECT", "http://www.nozzleinspect.eu", "http://www.phoenixisl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58297.jpg", "fp7_93485_998136888"]]}}}}
