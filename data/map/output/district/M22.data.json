St Wilfrid's is part of The St James and Emmanuel Academy trust together with two other schools, Didsbury CE Primary School and West Didsbury CE Primary School.  We also have a Pre- School Nursery which offers 15 hours per week placements and wraparound care plus two Reception classes.\r\n\r\nOur dedicated and dynamic team at St Wilfrid's work extremely hard to ensure that all our children are able to learn in an inclusive, safe and secure environment. We aim to provide a high quality education, which enables each child to realise their full potential.  Our aim is always to provide a broad, balanced and relevant curriculum that encourages a positive attitude to the learning process. We expect high standards in teaching, learning and behaviour, which rubs off on children who are nurtured to become confident, resilient and, most of all, happy and secure at school leading to happy and responsible citizens.  Our Learning Challenge Curriculum, incorporates Spanish alongside other foundation subjects. Children are supported in developing deeper thinking, and to begin their enquiries through questions. These methods allow children to get involved with their learning, and to challenge themselves by independently planning their studies, with support from their teachers.\r\n\r\nOur high-quality teaching of the core curriculum is supplemented by sports activities, music lessons, choirs and clubs - we\u2019re committed to encouraging children to discover their passions. And they feed off this sense of participation, be that in School Council, weekly class assemblies or annual productions.\r\n\r\nOur ethos is Belonging, Believing, Becoming: where children feel a sense of Belonging to the school and community of Northenden, Believe in their ability and potential and Become well rounded and self-aware young people who can be a force for good in society. \r\n\r\nWe would like to take part in the Erasmus + project to promote the teaching and learning of Spanish in school and to improve the language competency  and confidence of all our teaching staff, across all year groups.  In shadowing a Spanish school, we would  aim for staff and then pupils to gain a greater understanding of the linguistic and cultural diversity and make comparisons.  We feel that the Erasmus+ experience would enhance our curriculum to enable us to teach a dual language curriculum with clear progression in speaking, writing and listening.  This would also lead to increased enjoyment, engagement and quality of work in our lessons through the sharing of ideas, experiences and resources.  \r\n\r\nWe would like Erasmus to provide an opportunity for eight members of teaching staff to be able to spend one week in ** School in Malaga over two separate visits.  During this time we would like our staff members to shadow the teachers, involve themselves in the Spanish language, be part of the lessons and reflect on the teaching and learning taking place.  Staff will benefit from speaking with staff, pupils and parents alike, and observing the differences in culture and lifestyle.  We would also like staff to visit places of interest within the local area, collect artefacts, information and photographs which will form teaching resources for Spanish lessons.  We will encourage staff to practice their Spanish language, engage with the community and experience Spanish culture and traditions. Our partner school would be invited to come to St Wilfrid's where we will return the  experience.  These opportunities would provide our schools with a real and meaningful means to share teaching practice between the two schools and impact on standards and the professional development of staff.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for our visit we will be communicating with our link school through telephone conversations, Email and Skype, not only to build a relationship with them but also to carefully plan and prepare for our visit so that all relevant people are familiar with the mutual aims and objectives of the visit.  Realistic expectations need to be set and time frames confirmed.   We would like to arrange our first visit during the Autumn term of this year and the second visit for the Spring term of 2019.\r\n\r\nThe staff we would like to send in the first visit would include the Head of School, Deputy Headteacher, and a teacher from each of Key Stage One and Key Stage Two.  For the second visit we propose that one teacher from Key Stage One and three teachers from Key Stage Two are involved in the program.  All our teachers have Qualified Teacher Status and none at this point are newly qualified.  We feel that two members of the senior leadership team should be part of the initial visit to set the agenda and demonstrate the commitment of the school to this professional development  opportunity.  This is a key priority on our School Improvement Plan.", "http://www.st-wilfridscofe.manchester.sch.uk", "St Wilfrid's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047192_coordinator"]]}}, "4SY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1293840000000, 1356912000000, "Lightweight, long endurance body cooling for fire fighters", "Eagle Technical Products Ltd", "There are about 500 000 professional fire fighters in the European Union (EU). When called to fight fires they can be exposed to high levels of heat stress, which results in decreased physical performance and even heat exhaustion. If a fire fighter succumbs to heat exhaustion he requires rescuing and this then exposes other fire fighters and the public to increased risk. In order to reduce the risk of heat stress, the firefighters are limited to the time they can be at the fire which increases the number of fire fighters needed to fight a fire and this reduces efficiency and introduces complication into the communications between the crews fighting the fire. The StayCool project will develop and prototype a novel system for cooling the body that is light weight, has low energy consumption and so can be worn for prolonged periods of time. Wearing the StayCool system will reduce the wearers core temperature and allow fire fighters to stay at the fire for greater periods of time and so improve the efficiency of fighting the fire, extinguishing the fire quicker and so reduce risk of loss of life and damage to property. The StayCool partnership is ideally placed to develop and exploit this technology having expertise in protective clothing design and manufacture, physiological and human factors testing, mathematical and thermodynamic modeling, access to rapid prototyping and manufacture facilities and the ability to design for manufacture to ensure the StayCool system can be fully exploited. The StayCool system is primarily aimed at a launch market for fire fighters but there e are a number of applications where humans need to work in high ambient temperatures.

They are typically intricate, complex shaped parts produced in near net shape by compaction of powders into a geometry followed by sintering of the compacts for consolidation, where particles are bonded upon heating. The powder metallurgy process, by nature, is suited to high volume production and therefore any flaws/defects in the parts can have a significant impact on the production output for example loss of material and efficiency, as well as potential failures in use later. Therefore there is a need for automated inspection by non-destructive means, for determining and separating the good and bad batches during production, preferably as early as possible, without having to seek destructive examination carried out manually, which can have a negative impact on the production flow and output. More critically, any faulty part that is overlooked may cause more problems later on such as unexpected premature failures in application. Depending on the component and the criticality of the application this can have drastic consequences such as accidents.\n\nIn this project, we will develop a digital radiographic system for online inspection of powder metallurgy parts.
