A review of the leadership literature led two academics (Day & Lord, 1988) to conclude that the research shows \u201ea consistent effect for leadership explaining 20-45% of the variance on relevant organizational outcomes \u201c. Consequently, leadership training exists as a multi-billion-euros industry, because it works. \r\n\r\nThrough the \"LEAD from inside out\" project, we give young persons the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to become quality leaders with high moral values. In the modern world,  organizations need a leader and developed leadership according to the vision and needs of all members. A leader motivates and inspires people to engage and builds a team, so that it is more effective at achieving a common vision. When organizations can't achieve their vision, they remain without a fundamental function - they can't contribute to the development of the community and can't have a long term impact on the society. This is particularly important in the case of youth workers who work or volunteer in non-profit organizations, because they need strong motivation and continuous support to carry on efficiently with their work. \r\n\r\nBy implementing this project, the objectives we are trying to achieve are: building the capacity of organizations for youth; fostering our transnational network of organizations active in youth work; strengthening the international project capacities of the participating organizations and youth workers who need to improve their skills and competences; improving and professionalizing youth work and key competences/skills of participating youth workers (managerial skills, communication skills, ICT skills etc.); and educating youth workers in proper leadership skills which will help them to deal in day-to-day work. Target group of the project are youth workers - 150 of them who are directly participating in the training activities, and a large number of those participating in dissemination activities and reading the Manual.\r\n\r\nThe youth workers will firstly participate in the online course that will last for 12 weeks and will be based on the previously developed Manual \"LEAD from inside out\". During this activity, they will learn how to improve their leadership skills, how to become good youth workers and how to live and work in a holistic way. The online course will be sufficient enough to improve the quality of youth workers and give them knowledge and skills for further development and materials to apply what they have learned in their organizations, but for those who wish to go a step further and become the multiplicators of this concept and have shown most success through the online course, the Training of trainers will be organized, which will be much more practical and result in youth workers that will be the carriers of the next phases of this project. In this way, by combining the Manual, quality youth workers as multipliers and an online course which will educate many generations of youth workers, the objectives of this project will surely be achieved and, in the long run, the project will contribute to the professionalization of youth work.\r\n\r\nThe 2 main methodologies used will be 1. non-formal learning guided by a formal curriculum and led by qualified educators with vast experience; 2. informal learning through sharing of experiences and good practices from educators to participants and among participants themselves, in a way that many experienced and expert individuals or organizations share their knowledge and in that way educate others through methods like presentations, exercises, lectures, games, debates, practical assignments, IT tools, writing assignments and any other method that shows to be the most suited for transfer of certain knowledge, tool or skill.\r\n\r\nThose youth workers who will participate in this form of education will be able to learn how to become strong and not \"burned-out\" in their youth work, develop their personality and professionalize their work. Youth workers from all over the EU will receive open access to educational materials which have been proven to work in practice, which will be the first step towards their professionalization. We plan to use the Intellectual outputs on a long run and to spread the concept of \"Leadership DNA\" throughout EU and then even further because we are convinced that this concept can have many beneficial results on the quality of youth workers in both personal and professional aspect.", "http://www.thelotustrust.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-HR01-KA205-035568_2"], [2017, "Sustainability Quest - Re:Boot", "The Lotus Trust", 48714.0, 7, 7, "The \u201cSustainability Quest - Re:boot\u201d is an 2 year long EVS project containing 4 mobility periods with 2 long term and 24 short term volunteers from 6 countries (Macedonia, Portugal, Italy, United Kingdom, Czech Republic and  Greece) who will be engaged in working on specific tasks connected to sustainable development within local community in Zagreb, Croatia.

The conclusions of the meetings will be: \r\n- in Germany - preparatory event (transversal skills development, outreach for youth), \r\n- in Spain - practical development event (European instruments, outdoor activities), \r\n- in Italy - summarization of the gained experience (fundraising, entrepreneurship ideas for youth). \r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\na) We would like to learn and share about activities in forrest, organic gardens, out door activities that would help youth ultimately get more in touch in nature and be at least some time offline in the forrest or nature. Nowdays almost non stop we are on-line connected to virtual reality and we lose touch with ourselfs, friends, family and also with nature. So the project is designed for youth workers to learn how to engage youth in local activities and also later on in new partnership activities (like EVS, youth exchanges, strategic partnerships, transnational youth initiatives,...) that will help the gain new skills and get in better shape, respect nature, be more in tune with natural biorhythm  and live healthily. \r\n\r\nb) Creating a platform for a European network of organisations active in the areas of ecology, youth work, youth volunteering, healthy lifestyles, tackling youth unemployment and gaining new skills for youth social entrepreneurship;\r\n\r\nc) The project is aiming to directly tackle the problem of youth unemployment in modern society suggesting the alternative ways of youth engagement by changing the urban-rural paradigm and empowering youth by nature itself. The statistics on youth unemployment in EU are frightening. The leading country in this area is Spain (54,3%); Over 5 million young people (under 25) were unemployed in the EU-28 area in the second quarter of 2014. This represents an unemployment rate of 21.7% (23.2% in the euro area). This is more than twice as high as the adult unemployment rate (9.0%). Youth social entrepreneurship is one of the sub-themes of this project. It is an increasingly common approach to engaging youth in solving social problems. Our project promotes these efforts through a variety of incentives, engaging youth in producing environmentally-friendly products and services.\r\n\r\nAfter the meetings of youth workers, each organisation will hold dissemination public event in their local communities (already drafted in preparatory stage of the project), where the results of the project will be shown (photo and video diary of the project, presentations by participants on subjects learned at meetings, presentations of physical and character improvement of participants, promotion of Erasmus+ program opportunities etc.). On this events local stakeholders (youth NGOs and other educational and youth-working organizations, local municipality) and media will be invited for purpose of further dissemination of the project\r\nThe long term effect of the project would be seen through the newly formed network of organisations where the youth workers will have more opportunities for professionalisation, skills and experience development and to improve the implementation of their learned experiences in local communities and outreach their target groups more effectively.", "http://www.thelotustrust.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE04-KA105-012274_4"], [2015, "Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion", "The Lotus Trust", 11359.0, 3, 3, "Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion is the youth exchange project, that will bring together youth from UK, Hungary and Slovenia and 4 accompanying group leaders, aimed to bring about  individuals from different cultures to learn about unity in diversity through this project where the theme will be creativity in cooking and in life, culture, healthy eating habbits and healthy lifestyles through non-formal learning and experience sharing. \r\n\r\nLittle Pizza Effect will last 8 days which will involve seminars from motivational speakers every day, interactive activities and workshops (games, debates, quizzes etc.), through which participants can improve on their core skills and help with their personal development as well as doing voluntary work in the community to help improve the local area.\r\n\r\nWhy is the project named so? The phrase \u201cPizza Effect,\u201d was coined in as late as 1970 by an anthropologist named Agehananda Bharati, and is used to describe a phenomenon that sometimes peolple lack of confidence in their own culture, but are eager to blindly accept all things new and foreign. Originally, pizza was looked down upon in Italy as the poor man\u2019s food: it was just simple unleavened bread with a little tomato sauce for taste. Then, accompanying the early emigrants, it made its way to America, where it was garnished with cheese, olives, peppers, various meats, and so on, totally transforming the original into a kind of delicacy. Years later, when it made its triumphant return to the land of its origin, it became a highly respected dish on the menu of even the most eminent restaurants. The new product was eagerly accepted and even given pride of place in Italian cuisine. \r\n\r\nThe venue for the Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion will be in Budapest, Hungary. The youth will learn about how they can come together to combat prejudices, exchange knowledge and learn from each other based on common interests. The theme of the youth exchange is how a simple thing as food intake,when being prepared consciosly, can be used to unite one another and learn how we can be happy and healthy by addressing our true needs. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to bring together youth from different cultures to educate them about the unity in diversity that exists today through common interests. This will be done through helping participants realize the common goals that we all have for example what we are looking for in life in happiness. Young people can be particularly inspired and reach their potentials if they have a focus for what they want and we want to help them achieve their potential.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n1. To create an awareness and appreciation of different cultures. The Little Pizza Effect - Food Fusion is designed in such a way to help participants learn about the different cultures and the similarities that exist amongst different type of people.\r\n2. Intercultural learning for participants about sustainable ways of living, especially in the long term. This is one of the reasons we chose the venue in Hungary, since the ethos of the centre is focussed on sustainable living. \r\n3. To help youth realise their potential and open their minds to the great impact they can have on world and help them become active citizens and prepare them for European Citizenship.\r\n4. To promote a healthy lifestyle through healthy eating as well daily practice of sports, yoga and meditation. Our daily schedule has also been designed with this in mind - where activities of such a nature are scheduled daily. \r\n\r\nThe long term effect will be about how the youth can give back to the community. After the exchange activities, all partner organisations will hold a public event in their respective countries where the results of project will be shown (photo and video diary of the project, presentations by leaders and participants on subjects learned at exchange, presentations of physical and character improvement of participants etc.).
