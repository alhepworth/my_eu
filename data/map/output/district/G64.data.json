At Bishopbriggs Academy we believe that investing in language learning is a key method of providing our young people with the necessary skills for the best possible future. The EU promotes the introduction of language learning at an early age and this is reflected in the Scottish Government's 1+2 policy, which we anticipate will create an increased number of language learners coming to secondary school. \r\n\r\nWe aim to equip staff with the skills to offer a wider range of languages for pupils to study, meaning that pupils can both continue to build on the language skills learned in primary school or choose to learn a new language. This will allow them the element of personalisation and choice in their learning and will allow them to use their transferable skills, developing a more in-depth understanding of their native language and modern foreign languages. Participation in this project will allow us to develop the school's international element and demonstrate that the ability to speak more than one language is something to which pupils should aspire. The structured language learning course we have identified will provide us with new ideas, access to authentic, up-to-date classroom resources and opportunities to share successful teaching methods with colleagues, both in the primary and secondary sector.\r\n\r\nWe have already begun to introduce Spanish to the curriculum as an L3 option. Laura has completed one and a half years of the CCEd Spanish course at Strathclyde University and this has allowed her to contribute to the introduction of Spanish for Life and Work Purposes as well as the S3 elective course. Laura's participation in the LFEE 3-week immersion course is crucial to her becoming GTCS registered in Spanish and being able to teach Spanish at all levels, including SQA certificate courses, meeting pupil demand for the subject. It will also help improve her fluency, cultural awareness and she will gain knowledge and understanding of new and innovative teaching methods. She will also be able to access authentic teaching resources and materials and forge partnerships with European colleagues. Laura will also be able to liaise with primary colleagues who wish to introduce Spanish as their L3.", "http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", "Bishopbriggs Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035490_coordinator"]]}}, "4DE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Modern Languages 1+2 Training Approach", "Torrance Primary School", 1814.0, 1, 1, "As a recently qualified primary school teacher preparing for the 1+2 approach to languages embedding within the curriculum there are a vast number of reasons I have applied for the French Immersion Course.  I would like to develop my confidence and understanding of the French language as this is at the forefront of our school and local authority Modern Language Improvement Plan (2014-2017).  The project will help our school and cluster group gain invaluable knowledge, resources and teaching methods further enhancing the use of ICT for local and global communication.  The training will provide me with the teaching methodology to suit a range of learners across all stages of the school, thus creating a supportive environment for learning a foreign language.Throughout the course I will be engaging with others and the local environment fully immersing myself into the French culture and language.  I plan to use every opportunity to practice speaking French and whilst working with others in a similar position as myself build international connections.  On return I would liaise with the local authority Language Development Officer to prepare a series of CPD events with the staff in my school and local cluster.  I would also organise a series of reciprocal teaching visits giving teaching staff the opportunities for sharing resources and good practice.  Another of my plans would be to enhance our French planners and assessment toolkits to ensure we have a progressive programme of skilled based learning make teaching the French language fun and interactive for pupils and easily accessible for teachers.  As a result of this I hope learners will feel more confident in applying language skills in different contexts across the curriculum.  I will carry out evaluations of these activities to modify them for future use seeking the feedback of colleagues, pupils and parents.  I hope my participation in the course and follow up planned activities will have a positive impact both in the short term and long term with: teachers becoming more confident in teaching foreign languages; greater cultural awareness and an awareness of the importance of languages being taught within schools; improved teaching methodologies within my school and cluster group; the French language thoroughly embedded within our school and daily life; organised projects linking with French schools using ICT and eTwinning; and a wide variety of shared resources across the cluster group.  I am a motivated individual and always looking for ways to challenge myself and develop my teaching methodology.  I aim to provide a globally nurturing learning environment and am eager to contribute to achieving the visions, values and aims within my school and within the local authority. Our vision is underpinned by the agreed values of equality, mutual respect, effective honest communication and reciprocal support between establishments.
