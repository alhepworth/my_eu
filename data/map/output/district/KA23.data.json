Both project partners are organisations which are active in the field of preserving local handicrafts and providing education to adults with the aim to conserve traditional know-how and improve the quality of handicraft products. The project is participated in by four Handicraft Centre employees. Two of them manage the wickerwork and pottery schools and would like to get to know the teaching methods and tools of the Scottish partner. After completing the trip, they will use suitable methods in new study materials and didactic techniques. The remaining two participants manage accompanying educational activities and require new knowledge and experience to implement new approaches (inclusion of industrial design and development within the local community). The mobility activity will take place in Scotland. The host partner will provide all four participants with suitable mentors/co-workers, which they will accompany during the four-day mobility project.\r\nThe project will employ project management methodology. The applicant and the host employ coordinators (contact persons), who are in charge of carrying out project activities and coordination between the partners. The applicant\u2019s representative (person responsible) is responsible for the complete project execution.\r\nThe expected outcomes are: new teaching methods and tools in the wickerwork and pottery programmes, updated study materials for the two programmes, new knowledge and experience for the participants and their mentors, completed mobility for four participants, four Europass Mobility documents and new international ties.\r\nThe effects of the project will be visible on various levels. The participants will improve the quality of their work, attain new knowledge and experience, both partners will take steps towards internationalisation, the satisfaction of the target group (handicraft programme users) will be increased. The long-term effects on the target group will be: increased professional competencies, improved quality of their products and higher sales. On the local level, the additional knowledge will lead to creating more innovative and higher quality products, boosting sales and greater popularity of handicrafts. On a regional level, the project will contribute to maintaining a characteristic of the region (Ribnica handicrafts) and increase the influence of the Handicraft Centre on neighbouring regions. On the national level, the modernised handicraft programmes of the Ribnica Handicraft Centre will expand the variety of educational programmes for adults in an area that is not covered by anybody else in Slovenia.", "http://www.crafttownscotland.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SI01-KA104-012419_1"]]}}}}
