In many countries, career guidance at school is becoming crucial for preparing students to initiatives of work-based learning and for fostering students' transitions from school to careers and to further learning paths.The quality of career guidance provision at school is based on the qualification of staff, on the tools and resources available for students and teachers, but also on the capacity of schools to establish and empower cooperative relationships with the \"real word\" through the collaboration with other local career guidance services.The project MYFUTURE will improve some of the main factors for ensuring the best quality of career guidance services: the methodological framework, the key skills of practitioners, the information resources and new guidance tools based on ICT.This project will have an impact on the strategic relationships and cooperation among schools and local career guidance systems: in particular, those provided by Public Local Authorities and by Career Services of Higher Education Institutions (HEI).The international consortium is promoted by the University of Camerino in Italy and it includes partners that are engaged in this field, with great experiences and innovative proposals in using and developing new technologies for career education and guidance. The consortium involves 5 territories with different career guidance systems (Italy, England, Holland, Romania and Malta), in order to test the model and the tools in rural, urban, suburban and insular contexts. Starting from a participatory research action, international working groups will develop a coherent set of web tools and devices, with the needed methodological knowledge and with the related open training resources for teachers and practitioners. At least 240 teachers and career guidance practitioners will be involved in the international working groups and in training paths.The main activities of the project includes:- local and international focus groups;- international survey on career guidance at school (emerging needs, models, case studies, tools and web resources)- local and international working groups for the development of the MYFUTURE web platform and e-guidance resources (career database, information, videos, web meeting and web interview, CV on-line, e-portfolio, e-learning paths on CMS for students)- local and international training paths for teachers and creation of the e-learning platform- national pilot actions for testing the models and the web tools- multipliers events- evaluation and exploitation of the project results.This set of project products will foster:- the right of an individualised career guidance for all students;- a qualified support for the preparation of school transitions and work-based learning experiences;- the cooperation among schools and local career guidance services (provided by Universities, Public Employment offices, others local services);- a better allocation (in one shared web platform \"MYFUTURE\") of career guidance resources and services for students;- higher quality standards of career guidance provision at school;- a new training offer and e-learning resources for teachers and practitioners.The main products of the project includes:1 - MY FUTURE - Improving career education and guidance at school. Guidelines for teachers2 - MYFUTURE - Web portal for career guidance3 - Q-GUIDANCE - Proposal for a Quality framework for career guidance resources.4 - MYFUTURE - Web map device5 - MYFUTURE - App6 - MYFUTURE - E-learning platform for teachers and practitioners.The project will also identify the key skills of teachers and practitioners for improving the quality of career guidance. The international working grops will also develop models for training the teachers and practitioners in different contexts, through blended cooperative learning pathways.The great risk, also for the most engaged and dynamic schools and education insitutions, is the lack of effective and operative models and tools to answer the emerging needs of a huge population of students, facing the challange with the career development.In this meaning and as long terms impact, the MYFUTURE project aims at addressing complex structural needs in the field of career guidance and education, fostering cooperation and mutual learning at European level, to share different approaches, to define and test innovative career guidance resources for students.", "http://www.hertsdirect.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA201-024241_7"], [2015, "Boulevard of Dreams", "HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", 71905.0, 5, 5, "Young adults are permantely in motion regardless whether they are or aren\u2019t actively engaged in their educational or professional career. They are continually confronted with changes that affect their personal situation and learning process. This requires flexibility, a positive attitude, motivation and perseverance. It is necessary that young adults but especially those with fewer opportunities or NEETs learn to anticipate to the changes in the labor market and society. They have to be motivated to gain: new insights and complementary skills acquired. If this motivation is lacking there is a high risk to establish a social destructive identity and exclusion. As mentioned in section C.1.3 MYT is actively involved in creating a better future for this targetgroup. After a meeting  in Brussel november 2014,  we concluded that in  different European countries, the challenges with NEETs are similair. We met these partners  and we feel that they all bring relevant expertise in the field and that we all face the same challenges. Unemployment, the risks of dropping out school etc. To reduce those risks we decided to co-operate to exchange methods of knowledge and competences with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- to gain a greater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education, training and the labour market respectively; \r\n- to gain a broader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training for NEETs across countries; \r\n- to gain a greater understanding and responsiveness to  cultural and social economical aspects that are triggers for NEETs to be discouraged, unmotivated and uninspired;\r\n- to improve foreign language and intercultural competences;\r\n- to better the quality of our work and activities in favour of  NEETs;\r\n-to share best practices, useful methods and to gain innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a method that in cooperation will combat the negative consequences of youngsters in the social and economical depraved areas such as  leaving school with no diploma. Many young people that grow up in these areas inherits an outsider identity/position with a lower potential for inclusion in society/labour market and a high risk to establish a social destructive identity. The project  further aims to exchange methods of knowledge and competences \u2013 and for that reason we consider this Erasmus + project to be a perfect complement. We need to improve the knowledge of methods on how to work with NEETs. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed for youthworkers, projectmanagers and trainers, whom represent youth organisations, local authorities, or work in local governments or other public institutions that have experience in project developement, methods and activities for NEETs. The participants for the training and studyvisits must have relevant experiences with the target group, want to learn and co-create, speak english and must be older then 18 and will be selected by the partner organisations. \r\n\r\n - the participant must be a citizen of one of the Erasmus + programme countries (28 European Union countries + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey);\r\n- the participant must be able to communicate in English;\r\n- the participant must be willing to learn and work with other people at an international level;\r\n- the participant is interested in projects or working with  NEETs or young adults with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe activities which will be held are  seminars, training and study visits. The objective  of the first seminar is to discuss similarties, setting inventory and making a selection of avaiblable methodologies. The second seminar aims to review execution and exhange of knowledge by experts. The closing seminar aims to present results, methodology and conclusions. The objective of the training is a lifelong learning, co-creating, exchanges of methodologies and experiences.
