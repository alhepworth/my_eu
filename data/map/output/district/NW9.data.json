The project that we have prepared under the name of \"Code Your Life\" aims to teach children to understand the logic behind these technologies. In this way, children will be not only consuming technology but also control it and becoming an active part of the digital age. Currently, all technology work with certain algorithms and they solve problems by logical thinking. For this purpose, we really need to teach children algorithmic thinking to breaking down a problem into several steps to reach a result. Because algorithm are like road maps for accomplishing a given, well-defined task. In this way, children can be more proactive in carrying out daily routines and they can program their life or their future easily. \r\n\r\nThe most important aim of this project is essentially to teach children how to program and especially the new generation.  The project will give them the confidence to create their own designs and plans. Everyone has ideas but only those who know program can make ideas a reality.  We hope this project will give encouragement to them to be more innovative. Like learning a language early in life, they should learn to program early in life, in this way they can gain a deeper understanding of the logic behind programming.\r\n\r\nThe importance of programming has become a great subject of increasing international awareness. A majority of countries approve mandatory computer programming education in schools because of the technology and programming as a common language. The project will promote children to share their feelings, experiences, and skills with each other in creating their own future together. As a result, learning programming will give some talents to the children such as systematic thinking, problem solving, understanding the relationship between events and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to raise awareness and increase the knowledge of algorithmic thinking which is thought to be one of the key abilities that children should achieve in information and communication technology education at school and in their daily life. We plan to teach a number of activities on algorithm which children can do in their daily life and activities on coding which children can practice using algorithmic thinking. For instance, children will write algorithms about emergencies such as what they should do in case of an earthquake or they will write algorithms about their daily life habits such as how they cross a road in traffic to relate algorithmic thinking to everyday activities or they fix a puzzle that has been solved incorrectly to identify errors and disordered blocks in a program. After learning algorithmic thinking, they will start to write codes to create some materials/animations such as designing greetings cards for special days, animating some stories, building some lesson games.  \r\n\r\nThe project \"Code your Life\" is a partnership encompassing 4 countries. France, Turkey, United Kingdom and Spain. The ages of the children involved in this project are between 10 and 13 years old. Most of the partners have experiences on ICT projects. The things which bring us together is our eagerness and interest for the subject of the project. We believe that we can foster our children's curiosity, creativity and logical thinking for a better future for them by providing tools for problem solving. By taking an active role during the whole process, they will have the opportunity for learning by doing and acting an enjoyable environment. We aim to: \r\n\r\n- Increase the ability of children how to follow a method to solve a problem,\r\n- Increase the ability of children how to analyse errors when they attempt to solve a problem,\r\n- Increase the ability of  children how to use technology understanding the logic behind it,\r\n- Encourage children that they can create their own designs and plans,\r\n- Explain children that they can control technology which is surrounding them and becoming an active part of the digital age,\r\n- Improve knowledge of the same subjects related to the other European partner countries,\r\n- Show teachers how to change educational environment more attractive and enjoyable,\r\n- Show teachers how to use different types of coding platforms sharing experience with other participants,\r\n- Collect and create educational materials to use in classes.\r\n- Increase motivation and enthusiasm of lifelong learning mind set\r\nThe above will be addressed with the help of websites, videos, films, magazines, talks/seminars by training centres, and visit to related university departments, science fair and local authorities.
