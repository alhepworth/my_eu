MID lead finally to highly integrated multimaterial and multifunctional 3D compact systems. With a 20% of growth per year since 2008, MID is the tomorrow\u2019s converging technology for electronics and plastics.\nTo achieve advanced high precision and high quality 3D micro systems, the EU industry is facing the following MIDs bottlenecks:\n-\tto be able to manufacture high precision 3D micro-parts integration plastics and electronics, including 3D plastic system carrier, 3D-conductive tracks and 3D electronics component assembly\n-\tto be able to reduce the manufacturing cost by 50% in order for EU industry to be competitive with low-wage countries,\n-\tto provide the industry with reliable, robust and in-line controlled manufacturing processes for plastics and electronics converging technologies.\n3D-HiPMAS will overcome these challenges by providing the EU industry with a pilot factory based on 4 key technological building blocks enabling the manufacturing of low costs and high precision 3D multi-materials parts:\nA.\t3D high precision plastics micro-parts\nB.\t3D high definition conductive tracks\nC.\t3D precision electronics components assembly\nD.\t3D reliable and robust online monitoring and quality inspection system\nE.\tThese 4 technologies will be integrated in order to launch the future EU pilot factory\nThe consortium is composed of all key actors from the value chain, from the material manufacturer to the end-user", 329726.0, 4287677.0, 4, 12, "3D-HIPMAS", "http://www.3d-hipmas.eu/", "http://www.photonic-science.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155695.jpg", "fp7_104687_998519941"], [1225497600000, 1356912000000, "Demonstration of LIDAR Based Wake Vortex Detection System Incorporating an Atmospheric Hazard Map", "Photonic Science Limited", "Wake vortex and wind shear are major causes of accidents and injury to passenger and crew of all aircraft types. There has been little protection and the main way of mitigating accidents has been to have mandatory separation times that affect the operating performance of airports.  The objective of GREEN-WAKE is to develop and validate innovative technologies that will detect the Hazards and thus improve the operating efficiency of an airport and improve passenger safety.  GREEN-WAKE will represent a significant step beyond current state-of-the\u2013art as it intends to improve upon: (1) The understanding of wake vortex and wind sheer detection. (2) Current detection methods. Commercially available technologies do not provide a solution and this project seeks to develop a new sensor that is able to provide real-time detection. It will develop new and novel technologies particularly in scanning and detectors that will enable real improvements to be made. Further it will develop a new concept in the 3D visualisation of atmospheric hazards, which is an important first step to developing closed loop-systems.  GREEN-WAKE will improve the knowledge and functionality of previous projects.  GREEN-Wake meets and will contribute to four objectives of the AAT.2007 call. Many of the concepts and the innovations will have applications in other on-board sensors for monitoring atmospheric hazards, engine emissions, engine heath and air quality.  The 3D simulator will take another new step, creating tools that can model instrument performance.    The structure of GREEN-WAKE will enable the latest technologies to be individually evaluated and made available to industrial users. Given the high level of innovation that goes beyond just the sensor, this is an important aspect to the exploitation plan.  Dissemination will be through a web-site and briefings with key industrial and user groups.", 224013.0, 2611817.0, 8, 14, "GREEN-WAKE", "http://www.greenwake.org/news.html", "http://www.photonic-science.co.uk", null, "fp7_89388_998519941"]]}}}}
