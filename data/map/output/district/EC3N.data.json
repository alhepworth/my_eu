Current policies (eg de-institutionalisation, community care, person centred services, individualised care packages at home) with recent political and economic developments (mass immigration, asylum seekers, financial crisis and recession) have produced huge demands on social housing and staff work. It faces a perfect storm of greater expectation from users, higher demand and more complex needs as institutional care slowly erodes.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cTowards Person Centred Housing Services in Europe\u201d (TopHouse) tackles the following need: how can we give staff in social housing the training,  tools and local networks needed to improve individual needs assessment and housing allocation, whilst improving person centred support? TopHouse project clearly addresses these issues by identifying what these staff need to know to do their job using a PCP manner based on UNCRPD principles. It  will produce a series of learning outcomes covering housing assessment, housing allocation, the assessment and provision of non-housing support needs. TopHouse also aims to develop local housing support networks, improving collaborative working between the related agencies in social services, health, education etc, depending on individual needs. TopHouse provides updated, dedicated training and tools to do this job better and the means to promote improved inter-agency working to deliver concomitant related non-housing support on a person centred basis.\r\nSpecifically TH will produce\r\n1. A set of learning outcomes, covering the underpinning knowledge required by staff to do this role\r\n2. A curriculum and a modular training programme for staff, with a train the trainer course to get things going\r\n3. Dedicated tools around the assessment of housing and non-housing support needs, \r\n4. A guide to successful local housing support networks\r\n\r\nResults of the TopHouse during the project include:\r\n1. evidence from piloting that certain assessment and allocation processes produce better results, improve user understanding and satisfaction; \r\n2. evidence from staff  involved in assessment and allocation that they now feel better equipped to do their job using the project\u00b4s tools & training; \r\n3. demonstrable capacity within the partnership to train people in the use of TopHouse products and to train more trainers to deliver this.\r\n\r\nOur main objective is to validate and then establish the TH training programmes and get them recognised and accredited in whatever way is locally appropriate, and at the same time promote the other TH products too.\r\n\r\nTopHouse brings together key participants of the housing and support system, gathering all the necessary competences and expertise. With 7 partners from 6 countries, the partnership represents the cultural and social diversity, and captures the various EU approaches towards social housing. Through the TopHouse innovative tools, guide, course, learning outcomes, curriculum and local networks, staff in this key \u2019borderland\u2019 role will be given for the first time high quality learning opportunities focused on their special role and providing a blueprint for a unique Europe wide shared procedure.", "http://www.homeless.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA202-035029_4"]]}}, "1BP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1509494400000, 1604102400000, "Empathic, Expressive, Advanced Virtual Coach to Improve Independent Healthy-Life-Years of the Elderly", "Intelligent Voice Limited", "The EMPATHIC Research & Innovation project will research, innovate, explore and validate new paradigms and platforms, laying the foundation for future generations of Personalised Virtual Coaches to assist elderly people living independently at and around their home. \nInnovative multimodal face analytics, adaptive spoken dialogue systems and natural language interfaces are part of what the project will research and innovate, in order to help dependent aging persons and their carers. \nThe project will use remote non-intrusive technologies to extract physiological markers of emotional states in real-time for online adaptive responses of the coach, and advance holistic modelling of behavioural, computational, physical and social aspects of a personalised expressive virtual coach.
