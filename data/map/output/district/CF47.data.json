At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced.

Sometimes educators experience difficulties in finding the best methodologies and techniques working with autistic children and integrating them in mainstream classrooms. This project is aimed for teachers and other school staff to acquire new knowledge and skills in order to be able to work with autistic and mainstream children in a way that is advantageous for both of these groups. It will not only help teachers and other school based specialists to improve learning environment but also include autistic children in mainstream collective more effectively. \r\n\r\nAIM: The aim of this project is to ensure teachers and school staff (assistants, speech therapists, social educator, special  educator and others that are in any way involved in working with autistic children) with information, techniques, methods and practical skills in order to be able to include autistic children in mainstream classes the best way possible for them to be able to gain from school environment not only curriculum but also cooperation skills, problem solving skills and to increase their communicative abilities. \r\nThis project would not only be a great support for school staff but also a contribution in autistic children education. \r\nAs different countries use wide variety of methods and techniques in work with autistic children in mainstream classes it would be crucial to look at this matter in a broader way than just one country - Latvia. The aim is to include at least five countries and exchange teachers and staff experiences in between these countries. At the end of the project a conference is being planned in Latvia, many teachers in mainstream schools who face challenges of including autistic children in mainstream classes would be provided with new resources to improve their teaching quality and overall knowledge of autism from an international experience based perspective. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: It is being planned to include at least five partners in this project from different countries - Iceland, United Kingdom, Estonia, Slovakia and Latvia. Selection process of partners is based on their experience in the field of including autistic children in mainstream classes. Only preschools and primary schools which had previous experience and which are including autistic children in mainstream classes at the moment of applying to the project will be selected. Previous cooperation partners will also be addressed to ask them if they would like to take part in this project. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES: All partners will be asked to share their knowledge and practical skills in working with autistic children in mainstream classes through organizing short term joint staff training activities/master classes in their countries as well as participating in short term joint staff training events and master classes organized by partner organizations. Regularly project meetings will be held to plan coming up training activities, develop work sheets, questionnaires and other relevant documents for the project. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT: The main outcome of this project is expected to be increased knowledge of school staff, especially teachers who work with autistic children. The knowledge would include different working techniques, methods and skills in order to improve autistic children inclusion process in mainstream schools. Results will be available for society on social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, where newest information from seminars, master classes and every day project work will be published.

In fact, personal development requires the ability to set personal goals and the know-how to attain them: this is what entrepreneurial learning is about. It supports the general learning processes and basic skills achievement with positive effects on self-confidence, achievement orientation, perseverance, analytical ability, proactivity and creativity, and fosters cooperation, personal commitment and appreciation of individual skills and talents.It appears to be neglected, as many European countries do not provide specific training and guidance for primary teachers who are not familiar with E. education, and therefore do not set up entrepreneurial activities in their schools. WHAT\u201cKids Conquering Castles\u201d (KCC) will contribute to enhance, among teachers and school communities in the partnership, the understanding of E. as a key competence to be promoted from early education. It will provide initial and on-going training for teachers, and offer pupils and staff the opportunity to experience and share specific strategies and tools during the three project years through setting up and managing a school cooperative enterprise.International cooperation will be a key resource, bringing in cultural comparison, expertise and actual examples, and enhancing communication skills and European spirit among the participants.KCC will foster awareness about E. competence among families and community, while the castles theme will offer actual opportunities to connect school and territory pursuing strategic synergy. In the surroundings of each partner school there is a castle. The \u201cKids Conquering Castles\u201d Cooperative\u2019s aim is to organize specific activities and events for a child-oriented approach to the castles. The cooperative ethical spirit will help respond to the inclusivity needs of disadvantaged students and families. This spirit will be further highlighted by devolving the KCC Cooperative profits to a NGO, at the end of the third year. HOWAlong the project life, each year will focus on a specific theme: 1\u00b0-\u201cThe Cooperative in the Castle\u201d presenting the local castles and setting up the KCC Cooperative. All the formal steps for the Cooperative registration and management will be made within the partnership (decisions on status, name, logo and mascot, steering board and profit destination).2\u00b0- \u201cMarket in the Castles\u201d: designing, producing and selling castle souvenirs - using territorial resources and historical workshop knowledge \u2013 developing market research and advertising abilities.3\u00b0- \u201cEthical investments and Castle promotion\u201d: bringing the acquired know-how into the local, and sharing results: markets in partner communities to enhance project awareness and experience, as well as additional cooperative profits to be donated to NGO.At the end of each year, a group of students from every country, as ambassadors of their schools, will meet (in Spain, Italy, Germany) to work together in the KCC Cooperative, celebrating the year\u2019s theme and promoting the local castle in an European context. The results from the meeting \u2013 in terms of assessment and of acquired knowledge and skills - will be brought back and shared in the partnership\u2019s schools. Regular communication will allow and support cooperation and play a strategic role in the project implementation.
