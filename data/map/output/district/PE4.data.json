The links initially developed on E-Twinning were further developed by a strategic, face-to-face project planning meeting of representatives of the five participating schools in Slovakia in January 2017.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to develop each of the Global Citizen fluencies of Media, Information, Solution, Creativity and Collaboration, which have strong linked to the STEM and wider curricula in each school.  The project is innovative as it aims to develop the fluencies through the promotion and preservation of long-standing traditions, values and cultures using 21st Century technologies and innovations in a way that makes it more engaging and accessible to a young audience.  Furthermore, the project will promote fusion between traditional and modern technology,  focusing on working with local organisations and businesses to develop the 'fluencies', whilst embedding the reality that we live in a culturally rich, but modern, innovative world and that to compete as global citizens, we need to embrace both aspects.\r\n\r\nAt TVA there is a very strong mix of nationalities (particularly Eastern and Central European), religions and cultures, and this highlights that within Europe we all live under a global umbrella due to our proximity and interdependency.  As such, it is crucial to develop collaborative links with countries where mobility is high to increase integration and understanding of the different cultures and systems, as well as to share knowledge and pedagogical practices.  At TVA, for example, there is a growing number of Roma students and a further aim of this project is to promote educational equality across Europe through showcasing achievements of minorities such as Roma when they are given access to mainstream, quality education.\r\n\r\nIt is an integral part of the ethos in each participating school to develop learners to be successful in a global world, it is also crucial that students develop their competences in STEM subjects to ensure that each country can fill shortfalls in critical industries.  \r\n\r\nThe project will be innovative as each country will develop an original workshop, which will focus on developing the skills of one Global Citizenship Fluency with the aim of producing a final product from each workshop which will then be collated and put together to make a family entertainment set.  For example:\r\n - The UK will link with a local university and business to use programming, prototyping and 3D printing to create an original handicraft linked to cultural festivals (bringing tradition back to life in a way which appeals to young people - i.e. through technology which they will use to programme).\r\n- Slovakia will link with the local TV station to use multiple forms of media to create and distribute comic stories based on local folklore.\r\n- Poland will link with local educational and media organisations and use 3D printing to create a board-game based on prominent Polish personalities in history.\r\n- Hungary will link with local art galleries and digital print companies to use digital image manipulation to produce large scale art paintings during the workshop.  \r\n- The Czech Republik will use sound manipulation and programming as well as links with the local church and religious organisations to produce an interactive game based on religion.\r\n\r\nEach product will be very different, but each will have a traditional focus developed through the use of modern / innovative technology and will be the culmination of the development of an individual 'fluency', all of the products will develop around the central theme of 'diversity reaching for unity'.", "http://www.thevoyager.co.uk", "TDA Education Trust T/A The Voyager Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036766_coordinator"], [2016, "From Symbols to Symphonies", "Comberton Academy Trust T/A The Voyager Academy", 77072.0, 3, 3, "From Symbols to Symphonies (S2S) is a multi-lateral project based on the theme of \"Sharing Heritage\" as part of the European Cultural Heritage Year 2018.  As the programme focus for the European Year is \"Society in Transition'', the project reflects the ongoing and diverse social change in Europe by studying the theme of immigration on a European, national and local level.During the project students will research the history and reasons for immigration in each of the participating countries as well as focusing on a particular strand of immigration which specifically applies to each participating school:- The Syrian refugee crisis in Germany - the town of Viersen has received a number of refugees and the school is helping to support their integration into German society.  - North African immigrants in Spain - Badajoz is an inland, agricultural part of Spain with a number of North African guest-workers.  - European Immigrants in the UK - TVA is a school in Peterborough with very high levels of immigrants (well over 50%), mainly from Eastern Europe and Portugal.The aims of the project are:- To develop a balanced understanding of immigration and mobility patterns within Europe today.- To develop an understanding of the reasons for increased mobility.- To use music , poetry and dance to interpret the challenges and successes of individual migrants.- To write and perform a short musical depicting the stories of 3 migrants.The project aims to work directly with 84 students (28 from each participating school), but the activities of the project will incorporate contact and activities with a much wider group.  During the project, participants will:- Carry out on-line research on the issues surrounding immigration and increased mobility in each of the participating countries.  - Create and populate an on-line project blog-site with research findings, presentations and resources created during the project which will also be shared through e-twinning.- Meet with charity organisations to learn about the experiences and reasons for increased mobility and the support and activities that are offered.- Carry out interviews with migrants about their own experiences and journeys.- Write a series of poems depicting the accounts of the migrants that they interviewed.- Identify pieces of music and choreograph accompanying dance pieces which exemplify the experiences and emotions expressed by migrants in the interviews and poems.- Write and produce a musical drama performance which encompasses the findings of the project incorporating the poems, music and dance into a final production depicting the stories of immigrants in each of the participating countries - promoting the idea of music and dance as a common language to break down barriers.The project aims to raise awareness of the European Cultural Heritage Year 2018 by focusing on individual stories set within the wider context of 'Society in Transition'.  It aims to give participants a broader understanding of the topic of immigration and to support understanding and community cohesion within the participating schools and their communities.In the long-term it aims to provide resources and information about the topic of human mobility which can be used in future PSHE and language lessons in the participating and other institutions as well as to build long-lasting relationships between the schools and community organisations to promote community cohesion, mutual respect and the sharing of culture and experiences.", "http://www.thevoyager.co.uk", "Comberton Academy Trust T/A The Voyager Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024459_coordinator"], [2017, "Right to Roma - Enabling success for EAL and Roma", "Thomas Deacon Education Trust T/A Queen Katharine Academy", 9987.0, 1, 1, "Over recent years, the percentage of EAL students has risen steeply in TVA and we recognise that changes need to be made in the way we provide for our EAL learners who are now the vast majority of our school cohort (over 70%).   In contrast to other schools in Peterborough who have large percentages of EAL, the vast majority of our students are new or recent arrivals and fall into the new census category A and B  (i.e. students with very little English who require a considerable amount of support to access the curriculum) and additionally, students at TVA come from the poorest areas of the city where there is high mobility leading to a number of students who have gaps in their knowledge due to an inconsistent educational history. \r\n\r\nAs a school, we have identified that a key gap in our knowledge is understanding clearly the prior learning experiences of our EAL students and the educational expectations of parents, as such, we understand that we need to make changes to tailor our provision to best meet the needs of our core cohort.  We have a significant and growing Roma community within our school who are currently making the least progress, therefore, it is crucial for us to better understand what Roma education in Slovakia looks like and how we can accelerate the students' progress once they arrive with us, as well as developing parental trust and support.  This project will help us to understand what prior education for these students looks like and how we can build on that to accelerate progress and gain trust.\r\n\r\nOur current Academy Development Plan shows that catering for EAL students is a key priority for us as an educational institution to ensure that results and outcomes for our students improve.  The trend towards increased numbers of EAL MENA is unlikely to change over the coming academic years, therefore, this year we have introduced ESOL as a curricular subject for groups of EAL students in KS3 and are aiming to use this project to drive further curriculum change in the future.\r\n\r\nTVA has key groups of EAL students which form large percentages of the student body, mainly Eastern European and Portuguese.

TEACHING /TRAINING ASSIGNMENTS ABROAD ( PORTUGAL, TURKEY, SPAIN)LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO THIS ACTIVITY FOR STAFF ( CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT)It\u2019s an experience full of insights and personal development that can be transferred to any career setting.A period spent teaching abroad can demonstrate to any employer that you excel in the following key areas:AdaptabilitySucceeding in a role in a foreign country is impressive and adds diversity to your employment history. Working in an organisation abroad often calls upon all your problem solving resources and requires using your initiative on a daily basis. An ability to deal with the unexpected in a calm and controlled manner is a desirable quality for any employer.CommunicationCommunication skills as essential. There\u2019s hardly a better way to show effective communication than than an ability to stand in front of a classroom and teach people who don\u2019t speak the same language as you! Cultural awarenessHaving an understanding of different cultures is ever more important, both in the organisation and when working in global business. Showing sensitivity to cultural differences, whether you\u2019re dealing with clients, customers or colleagues, will get you far. LeadershipA great teacher is also a great leader. Managing a class of 20 pupils is no easy task. Being able to capture your students\u2019 attention and imagination \u2013 and maintain it \u2013 is an achievement in itself. The role of a teacher is largely to inspire and motivate students to respond to challenges and reach their goals. Foreign language skillsThe most effective way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it. The best incentive to do this is to live and work in a country where English is barely spoken, as you\u2019ll have no choice other than to pick up the local lingo. Even if you\u2019ve struggled with learning languages before, this approach works.", null, "C24 Education and Development Centre Limited", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA104-024094_coordinator"], [2017, "Challenges and Realities: Migration", "C24 Education and Development Centre Limited", 35831.0, 10, 10, "Misinformation and misconceptions about migration and migrants still constitute one of the biggest challenges faced by Governments in countries of origin, transit and destination.

Each team will\r\nparticipate with 4 participants, except Greek team which is going to participate with 5 members for practical reasons. The participants will be students (Senior High School and University students) and professionals of education, without any age restrictions, though every participating team will provide the program with 2 young participants with fewer opportunities. Basic aim of this project will be the sensitization of the young participants against the modern\r\nphenomenon of School Dropout which grows rapidly inside the frame of the European Union, as a result of the continuous economy crisis. The participants will learn about the consequences of the premature school dropout and of the child labor into the childish composition, in which amount is the human character affected and which are the \"marks\" that they leave during the passing years. At the same time, through all these, we will bring into the light, the high values of education, the acquisition of knowledge as a power and independence for human beings and the \"gates\" that they open widely for the mankind. The participants will function as multipliers of these messages inside their local communities, their school and university societies, inside their working areas and Social Medias, carrying the positive messages that they will earn from the program. The activities of the program are specially designed to serve in the highest level the desirable results of this program. They are based on methods of formal and mostly non formal education. Special Workshops, role-playing games, simulation games, questionnaires, team-building activities, presentations and videos will be used with the help of modern technology.
