The teacher, plays the important role of facilitator, creating the environment where directed and guided interactions can occur.\r\nThe teacher creates a learning environment which challenges.\r\nStudents work together on a task as they develop across the curriculum. Also, instructors choose meaningful and challenging tasks for the students to work. In this way, instructors manage socratic dialogue that promote deeper learning, collaborative Learning and project-based learning. \r\nIn the 21st century workplace on schools , success requires more than basic knowledge and skills. In a project, students learn how to take initiative and responsibility, to build their confidence, solve problems, work in teams, communicate ideas, and manage themselves more effectively. This should happen in an educational context where STEAM, ICT and language become tools to communicate and share experiences with other students of the European Union. \r\nThe project will take three  years and there will be six transnational project meetings and four short-term exchanges of groups of pupils. We try to exchange as much students ad we can. At least four on every short-term exchange, being aware that the grant aims to provide 100 mobities.

Health surveys show that in Europe we, children and adults, tend to sit down too much, often at a screen, and move too little. Overweight is also common even among young children.  Health care is a huge expense in aging Europe, so we are dealing with a very important issue also at the European level.\r\n\r\nAt schools we face these health problems, and psychological issues are also common, such as social and emotional problems , attention deficit and low self-esteem. We are also aware that children with special needs or low socioeconomic status are especially apt to health risks and early school leaving.\r\n\r\nStudies prove that maintaining high level of physical activity throughout the childhood has positive effects not only on physical health but also on learning skills and emotional wellbeing. Movement is natural to children, yet school system is based on sitting at a desk. Many teachers are aware of the need for change and look for new, active ways to work with children. However, schools carry heavy traditions, and  changes take skills,  effort and courage.\r\n\r\nIn Smart Moves five primary schools work together towards the common goal. The schools come from different parts of Europe:  Kantokasken koulu from Finland, Basischool de Rank from the Netherlands, Escola La B\u00f2bila from Spain, Szkola Podstawowa nr 11 im. Marii Curie  from Poland and Holy Family Primary and Nursery School from Northern Ireland. In this way we hope to get a rather comprehensive view of education systems in Europe, and enjoy interesting and fruitful cooperation as the schools bring different skills and expertise into the project. Northern Ireland, Poland and Finland are experienced and trained in special education. Finland, Spain and the Netherlands have programmes to promote ecological values and recycling. Northern Ireland and Spain emphasize Physical Education.  Poland has large projects to promote healthy diet.  Spain and Poland have recent project experience, other schools have little or no experience of EU programs. All the project schools have good ICT skills and motivated staff.\r\n\r\nThe object of the project to implement  more active and participatory learning methods and practices, to increase  physical activity at school and to promote holistic health education. Movement is the central theme of the project. During the two years we will focus on different sections: sportive events and campaigns at school, active learning, active breaks and creative use of school premises, movement and relaxation. We work on the themes at our respective schools and together online and at the project meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project also covers other aspects of health education: healthy diet, social and emotional skills and relaxation. Throughout the project the aim is to engage pupils at all stages: planning, implementing and evaluating activities. The oldest age groups in primary school, i. e. 10-12 years, are most involved but there are also activities for younger pupils and the whole school. Parents are also invited to contribute ideas. \r\n\r\nThe topics are worked on in various ways.  We make and share presentations, quizzes and documents. Skype, eTwinning and email are used for keeping contact, and we also  write letters to pen pals. We keep blogs. We write weather reports. We take pictures and make videos of sports and activities. We share recipes of healthy snacks from each country and test them. We teach each other games and sports. We write about friendship. We will study how feelings are expressed  in different cultures.  We use also handicraft and drama.  Learning and sharing ICT skills is a central in the project as they are also absolutely necessary for the future. During the project we also have two workshops on active learning and ICT.\r\n\r\nAn important  concrete result will be an online idea bank of tested and evaluated practices and methods, that support the goals of the project. Its purpose is to display silent know-how and ideas that so easily remain hidden at schools. Learning English language and cultural skills is naturally an essential part of the project. \r\n\r\nWe expect to promote, not only international cooperation but also cohesion within schools and with the local community. The project will also give schools tools for global education and readiness for further cooperation. It also seeks to improve and update teachers' professional skills.

Sequential application of the process enables different components of different functionality to be manipulated in a highly flexible and programmable way making best use of the materials.

Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage.

The joint actions of MISE, MIUR, CNR and the Agency for Digital Italy, as well as regional initiatives such as Digital Agenda and Smart Specialisation Strategy of Tuscany and Molise, confirm this need.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, the project offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector (mechanical, mechatronics, electronics), soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 84 students attending classes IV and of 3 months for 84 newly graduated of the 7 participating VET Schools, coming from Tuscany and Molise. The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n1.

It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005700_8"], [2016, "LEO quali-TC ECVET ENLARGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY", "Foyle International Ltd.", 472814.0, 7, 39, "Due to the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of emergency - as the unemployment rate for the aged 15-24 reached more than 44% - and it is, therefore, widely believed that it is necessary to foster experiences of integration into the production system since the years of education and training.Recent economic developments have shown, moreover, the need, in a global context, of a highly skilled workforce. As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.foyle.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_26"], [2017, "Vetrina Skills Lab in Europe", "Foyle International Ltd.", 469295.0, 7, 39, "The need for Tuscan turistic entrepreneurs is to maintain a high standard of services offered, with a level of quality that will satisfy demanding and well prepared customers (national and international), in order to fight the global economic crisis.\r\nThe needs of recent graduates from VET schools is to specialize, to acquire new skills on turistic sector by consequence of the potential of job opportunities offered by the sector.\r\nThese two worlds are the demand and supply to meet that need to find a mutual benefit and profit.\r\nFor these reasons, the Regional Council of Tuscany, since 2001, has been promoting the programme \"VETRINA TOSCANA\" (Network of enhancement of the typical Tuscan products that involve different economic and institutional actors) and that from three yeras ago included in the Special Programme of Regional Development (PRSE) and considered as an excellent model of communication and promotion of tourism.\r\nThe project \"Vetrina Toscana in Europa\" (VET -EU) aims to be connected to this regional programme, promoted by the Regional Council of Tuscany, in order to offer the opportunity of an internship abroad to the students of Tuscan Tourism and Catering VET schools, participating to some dedicated training courses carried out within the farmework of \"Vetrina Toscana\" Programme.\r\nThe VET-EU project is promoted by an articulated partnership of local actors (Tourism and Catering VET Schools institutional bodies, trade associations) and foreign partners.\r\nIt aims to offer students and recent graduates from VET schools in the turism industry of the provinces of Siena, Florence and Prato, a great opportunity to provide more and more qualified sector services by performing a high quality mobility experience at European level.

The employment opportunities in the health and care sectors are growing and, indeed, the forecasts indicate that there are margins for a further increase in the coming years. The sector, however, remains a sector of growing skills and labor intensive.On the basis of these considerations, the project MOBI-CARE will support significantly the acquisition of professionalism about the technical competencies, pedagogical and social skills of the two identified targets: students and recent graduates in social and health care fields by providing additional knowledge needed to the enforceability of daily work, the professional quality and the number of interventions to guide and support intentionally approaches effective in treating issues related to disadvantaged people, marginalized or at risk and planning the team work also in the interests of transnational mobility.The project aims to offer high quality internships and, through ECVET, ensure recognition and transferability of skills acquired, in order to facilitate and support smooth transition of the learners in the labor market. MOBI-CARE implements Work Based Learning activities, as indicated in the National Law 107 of 07/13/2015, through transnational mobility actions aimed at the training of the learners. Transnational mobility that, on the basis of European policies on lifelong learning, must become an integral part of VET programs to enable learners to achieve high level qualifications, milestones for a successful inclusion in the labor market, for the development and improving of their career and to cope with the demands of companies of highly qualified staff.In line with the objectives of EU policies, through MOBI-CARE, the 6 sending VET-schools and the National Consortium as a whole, led by the Foundation NEUROMED, aim to improve the quality of VET, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering to the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their expertises: competencies in the specific areas of social and healt care, cultural knowledge and language skills.This general goal, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience for students and recent graduates of the 6 sending vocational schools and which consists of an internship in a foreign company, lasting 1 month for the students, and 2 months for the recent grauduates. The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the social and health care, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sector and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country.The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the participants; the promotion of key competences connected with the exercise of real active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants; the introduction of new training methods to complement existing practices and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools; the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practice between the partners involved, with a significant impact on improving the educational and vocational guidance.

school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for

skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of

market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and

greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased

Therefore, in cooperation with the partners we have derived practically applicable, inter-professional and comprehensible units of learning outcome from specific job descriptions. These units are then used as the basis for the learning agreement and the contents of the internship. Clear rules for assessment and a quality-oriented documentation ( europass) have been set up in order to ensure the quality of valid learning outcomes (MoU). Our service is perceived by both the trainees and the training companies (mostly SMEs) with very great esteem and consistently positive feedback.

The strategy counts several Erasmus+ ongoing projects: IeFP+; ITS +; Tecnhnet2020 and ESF projects such as: ITS Europe and Mobility 2020.The project Moving Generation 2020 is part of this development plan, and it gives 130 students enrolled in the fourth year of VET schools in Emilia Romagna, the possibility of doing a 3 weeks internship in line with their study programme in another European country. The students are attending VET schools to obtain a level EQF4 qualification. This target allows maximum capitalization of the experience because students possesses the necessary technical and second language skills to work in a foreign company and reach the learning outcomes expected during the three weeks.OBJECTIVESThe overall objective of the project is to enhance the employability of participants by improving their technical and professional skills in the leading sectors of the regional economy (manufactory and tourism), and soft skills such as: learning to learn, interpersonal skills, cross-cultural, linguistic, and personal autonomy, initiative, problem-solving approach to the workplace, which are the most requests from local companies strongly oriented to foreign markets.ACTIVITIESAfter a phase of information and selection, participants will receive a thorough preparation delivered by schools and Uniser which will cover not only the language aspects but also: practical information, culture, safety at work, adapting to a foreign country and the work environment. Each participant will sign a learning agreement which will specify the objectives, learning outcomes, practical information on the internship\u2019s organization and tasks.During the period abroad, participants will be followed by a tutor in Italy, from a tutor in the country of destination, and a company tutor who will guide them in the learning process. Participants will disseminate their experience though the Uniser\u2019s blog and social medias, this will facilitate the communication peer to peer among young people. Website and social medias will also be used to disseminate the projects\u2019 results and promote the calls for applications to participate in the project.Particular attention will be paid to train teachers in schools how to implement mobility projects and apply ECVET. Two training sessions will be arranged through the project specifically addressed to them. Besides, accompanying persons will be the same teachers, who will have the opportunity to verify the quality of placements in person, and get to know the European partners. This will facilitate the recognition of competences through ECVET and will set the basis for future collaborations in follow-up projects.VALIDATION AND RECOGNITION SKILLSBack to Italy, a follow-up phase will be organized to capitalize the mobility experience thus allowing participants to take full advantage of the internship abroad. Furthermore, the competences acquired by the participants will be recognized thanks to Europass Mobility tools and ECVET. The internship abroad will be recognized as the regular curricular internship foreseen in Italy. Participants will receive the Europass Certificate Supplement together with the qualification in order to give them more opportunities to find a job in the European market.

In the year 2011, the mobility certificate for the target group of trainees (IVT) was awarded to our company due to the high quality of our activities. We are working very successfully as a nationwide pool project in the open -flow management. Continuously, a high number of trainees is interested in our company\u2019s mobility program. Especially internships in English language target countries (UK , Malta) are in high demand. Most of the participants come from the commercial and office sector, but industry, tourism, hotel and catering services are common branches as well. In principle, Azubi-Mobil is open to trainees from all kind of different professions. In the project, we work according to the principles of ECVET. The orientation towards learning outcomes is thus a priority for all our partners. Therefore, in cooperation with the partners we have derived practically applicable, inter-professional and comprehensible units of learning outcome from specific job descriptions. These units are used as the basis for the learning agreement and the contents of the internship. Clear rules for assessment and a quality-oriented documentation ( Europass) have been set up in order to ensure the quality of valid learning outcomes (MoU). Our service is perceived by trainees and training companies (mostly SMEs) with very great esteem and consistently positive feedback. For the majority of the participating sending companies (each having 1-2 trainees) the effort of organizing an individual mobility application would be too high. In addition, many companies confirmed individual competence increase on the part of the trainees. Hence, the opportunity to participate in a mobility program during the company training has now become an attractive marketing tool for the companies. Quality, evaluation & recognition of achieved learning outcomes are not only important features in the specific context of European priorities (ECVET) but they are also the basis for VET mobility in general to become an integral, integrated part of operational training with corresponding \"training\" quality. Thanks to the positive feedback from our participants, many training organization send on a regular basis trainees with our help abroad. In addition to the application management, we have a very good European network of partner institutions that support us in the active organization and supervision in the destination country. This is necessary, since 80 % of our trainees do not have any contact to receiving companies in the desired hosting country.

The project will offer the opportunity to live a three-weeks work-based learning experience abroad to 120 students from upper secondary schools in Umbria. The participating schools believe that mobility should be an integrated part of the VET courses they offer, therefore they will recognise and validate the competences acquired abroad by students making use of the Europass instruments and ECVET. Thanks to UmbriaNet, the participants will gain competences in cutting-edge sectors of the regional economy such as tourism and manufacturing industry, as well as key competences/soft skills like learning-to-learn, relational, intercultural and language skills, autonomy, entrepreneurship, problem solving, understanding of the workplace environment: all skills mostly required by companies nowadays both in local and european labour markets.\r\nThe UmbriaNet consortium is formed by upper secondary schools, and the Region Umbria itself (the highest policy-maker in the territory), Uniser (a cooperative with 18 years of experience in learning mobility) and it is coordinated by Itaca which represents the link between education and local companies.

The CoderDojo Model which has been developed and grown on a totally voluntary basis, provides such an innovative approach which can very valuably inform European policy development.  The CoderDojo movement was started in Cork, Ireland, in 2011. CoderDojo is a totally free of cost voluntary movement to teach young people how to write computer code, it raises awareness of potential to set up business and it works extensively on the principal of self and peer led learning by young people - generally between the ages of 5 and 17 years of age.  Leaders and facilitators of CoderDojo groups are usually private companies, higher educational Institutions, community groups or schools. From a standing start in a period of less than three years, CoderDojo is now active in 42 countries worldwide, with c.12,000 registered participants.  \r\n\r\nThe CoderDojo Training in ICT Programming Skills Project is led by the Cork Institute of Technology (CIT ) which was one of the first facilitators worldwide and partnering with CIT is the CoderDojo Foundation which initiated the movement and has worked since 2011 with only its own resources. Since inception the Foundation has recruited c.400  facilitating organisations with hundreds of champions and mentors around the world. CoderDojo has achieved phenomenal success in teaching young people coding skills which not only enhance their STEM abilities but also make them highly equipped for their future educational prospects and working lives. \r\n\r\nThe other partners in the consortium are all well-established CoderDojo Facilitators who recognise the potential of the learning model to address European educational challenges, especially in teaching and building learner interest and competence in STEM subjects, while also preparing participants for a lifetime career.  The objectives of the project are to (i) to capture the best practice in terms of organisational and learning approaches from CoderDojos  and to transfer these into mainstream educational policies in Europe, (ii) to research and make recommendations on the accreditation of CoderDojo prior learning . (iii) to develop a CoderDojo international toolkit in all main European languages with a view to spreading the movement to all countries and regions across Europe and (iv) to widely disseminate the project's policy and learning recommendations . These objectives will be pursued and delivered through a number of different but interrelated project actions, with each action having its own dedicated lead partner. \r\n\r\nThe project will have a dual focus in terms of its outputs. The first set of outputs will be very practical in the form of an international toolkit which will facilitate the spread of the movement around the European Union. The toolkit will address all aspects of the set up and operation of a CoderDojo Group, covering matters from recruiting facilitators, insurances required, premises, child safety issues, curriculum development guidelines, selection of mentors, assessments and so on. The practical outputs will also cover a very wide dissemination of the project toolkit and messages in terms of the spreading of the movement.\r\n\r\nThe second set of outputs have a very strong policy making focus. These outputs will be targeted at Educationalists and Policy makers from the local to European levels, addressing recommendations on how the European Union can make STEM learning very much more attractive to young people, based on a model which has been shown to work extremely well. The project, to this end will include a range of workshops and events with policy maker and educationalists. The accreditation of prior learning is a major policy development aspect of the project, which will undertake in-depth research and provide detailed recommendations on how  self and peer led learning in non-formal and informal settings can provide participants with European recognised qualifications that can equip them for further education  or for work. \r\n\r\nThe sustainability of the project after its closure is guaranteed as the CoderDojo movement continues to spread at a very rapid pace around the globe, with the continuing support of global business corporations and leaders in business. The benefits of the projects are that, for the first time the phenomenon of CoderDojo can be studied and its best practices and approaches analysed, with in-depth recommendations being developed and disseminated for European Educational and Training Policy.

In particular, in the continuation of the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of real emergency (given that unemployment rates for aged 15-24 exceeded 40%) and it is by all believed that it is extremely necessary to deal with this emergency starting from the dissemination of experiences of integration of young people into the production system already during the years of VET paths. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of VET programmes. This would help learners to achieve high levels of qualification, essential for a successful first entry into the labor market or for the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programmes are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU have recently set the goal of allowing at least 6% of all students in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through VET@WORK MOBILITY, ISIS LEONARDO DA VINCI, the ITT FEDI-FERMI of Pistoia, the ITST MARCONI of Campobasso and the partners of the Consortium, aim at improving the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their curriculum: professionalism in the specific sectors of Mechanical, Mechatronics and energy, cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued by a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 4 weeks for the students of the fourth year (5 of which are disabled and/or with special needs) and of 3 months for the recent graduates of the three involved sending schools. The programme provides for the young participants, placements in enterprises, for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country and comparison of the different professional techniques. The project is also implemented in the European context and priority of the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) and contributes, in particular, to create a European area for lifelong learning in the fields of mechanics, mechatronics and energy.\r\nThe main expected results of the project, which is in continuity with the Erasmus project + KA2 VET Strategic Partnership VET@WORK (2014-1-IT01-KA202-002629), promoted by ISIS Leonardo da Vinci in 2014, are the following: the raising of the personal and professional skills of the participants; the promotion of key competences connected with the exercise of a real active citizenship; the increasing of the employment potential of the participants; the introduction of new training methods to complement existing practices and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools; the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practice between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance. The construction of a permanent network of transnational nature of public organisations, and not only, constitutes, therefore, one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experience and good practices at different levels: technical excellence, best practices in training policies and in the governance of the systems. Human resources, instruments and tools provided by all project partners will ensure also the stability of the project and its exploitation beyond its conclusion, in order to adopt a long methodologies and tools developed by the European training paths.

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility.

This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for 60 students/learners (including 5 disabled or with special needs students) and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the 4 participating VET schools. The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the cultural industry and tourisms, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased

Once that connection is established, we are able to help the youth prepare for a sea of confronting situations and challenges they will encounter during their lives.\r\nYouth workers use a variety of different techniques in order to form connections with youth. Through games, youth workers are able to lay strong foundations of trust and openness with the youth with whom they work. We believe games not only provide a safe social environment for personal development, but also improve competencies  and fundamentals youth need to establish themselves well within a community. We believe that certain types of physical games have an educational value that is yet to be fully explored in our education systems. When it comes to the personal development of youth, games are more than a way of having fun, they are important to our organisations and are an extremely powerful learning tool especially when used in a social context.\r\n\r\nThe games exchange will provide a sharing platform for physical games and how they are used in youth work amongst circus schools and other organisations who promote non-formal learning and art education. \r\nIt will take place from 03/05/2015 - 07/05/2015 and will be hosted by Cirkus In Beweging in Leuven, Belgium.\r\nOriginally stemming from a spontaneous games exchange workshop during the NICE (Network for International Circus Exchange) meeting in Denmark in 2013, the International Circus Games Exchange had instant partners and support through youth circus schools and other organisations across Europe.\r\nIn this project we will bring together a strong knowledge base from different countries, cultures and organisations.\r\nThe project will be focussed on the exchange of this knowledge between partner organisations and the individuals representing them. \r\nWe will investigate the different kinds of games used by our organisations and for what purposes.

This expertise will be shared with and transferred to the other participants through explanation and physical demonstration in an open sharing space setting, this means that everyone will be free to give feedback, to propose variations and also have the opportunity to help customise the games to suit other purposes.\r\n\r\nEach participant will return to their organisation with a larger and stronger knowledge and database of games. They will have a greater knowledge and awareness of different types of games and also variations on games they already know.

The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools).

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.towerhotelderry.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_32"], [2015, "Adristorical Lands: promoting mobility for achieving excellence in Tourism and Culture", "Tower Hotel (Derry)", 341111.0, 6, 35, "One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes. This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling at least 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through Adristorical Lands, Regione Molise, the 4 VET schools involved and the Consortium as a whole aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (cultural heritage management, communication, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for 60 students/learners (including 5 disabled or with special needs students) and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the 4 participating VET schools. The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the cultural industry and tourisms, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the participants and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for economic and social growth cannot be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between educational and training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities.\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\". The development of ECVET began in 2002 after the Copenhagen Process emphasizing the need for a credit transfer system for VET.

The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship.

This, in turn, will improve their performance.\r\n- Understanding and analyzing the relationship between business and educational center. \r\n- Establishing a network where both trainees and teachers can make training visits. \r\n- Knowing the employment and education policies of other European countries.\r\n- Getting first hand knwoledge on new models of competency certification. Model ECVET\r\n- Improving language skills\r\n- Improving ICT skills\r\n- Knowing the true meaning of  an active European Dimension.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed for 30 teachers and management teams who develop their professional activity: integrated centers, nationally recognized VET schools and high schools with VET programs, and the mobility will be made in \r\nthree shifts:  two to July thirty.\r\n\r\nThe main activities to be carried out by the project partners are:\r\n- Mobility preparation: including, participants' selection, participants' previous training, logistical and contractual issues, coordination...\r\n- Participants' evaluation. The skills acquired during the mobility will be certified with Europass Mobility.\r\n- Monitoring . The participants' evolution will be evaluated through the means established I the project.\r\n- Project evaluation.\r\n- Dissemination . Outreach activities are planned throughout all the project. A final diffusion conference where the results will be presented will be held.\r\nAfter the training period, different proposals will be made in order  to present them to the  public administrations, and training activities will be conducted with management teams and teachers who were not able to directly take part in the project.\r\n\r\nBesides the impact on the participants, the project will affect the schools in which they work, encouraging European cooperation and an rapprochement between business and schools.\r\n\r\nDissemination activities and the mobility itself will create an impact at the local, regional and national levels.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

The project consortium is totally committed to the key statement of the Erasmus+ action that the investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations and society by contributing to growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. The participating organisations have gathered years of precious work experiences with people with diabilities and people with special needs. Furthermore, the partners are well connected through their memberships in the international network of Caravan 2000. Through previously carried out projects most of the consortium partners have established trustworthy and reliable working relationships which are essential for the fast starting, effective work on the high-quality innovative outcomes and for reaching the objectives of this project. \r\nThe project STELLA addresses the agenda for new skills and jobs included in the Europe 2020 Strategy as well as the intended Erasmus+ contribution to support implementation of the European policy agenda for individual and organizational growth, jobs, equity and social inclusion and the Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. \r\nBased on previously gathered observations and experiences regarding the strong wish of people with disabilities for an independent living, the partners could produce a needs analysis to identify the demanded competences which would support people with disabilities on their way to independent living and which would improve their professional chances drastically.  These needs and competences include areas such as social (and social media) behavior, self-esteem, development of critical thinking, emotion control, team ability, analytical thinking, technical and communication skills.\r\nSTELLA practicably targets these competences and produces as an innovative output a handbook for staff, trainers, HR resonsibles and educators on \u201cHow to improve basic work skills of people with disabilities\u201d. The needs analysis is based on former projects\u2019 lessons learned from different European countries and is not limited to certain areas of professionalism. Therefore, the innovative output is transferable and applicable to every field of the labor market as well as on an international dimension. The project is also carried out in an innovative way: During the project implementation people with disabilities are staff members of the work packages' teams.\r\nThe main objective of the project is the production of the handbook which basically provides everyone who operates in an inclusive work environment information and methods on how to improve basic work skills for people with disabilities. Additional objectives are to raise awareness of working in an inclusive team, to strengthen the digital era competences of the staff by working in virtual teams, to foster intercultural competences, to foster the EU citizenship, to include people with disabilities in all aspects of the implementation of the project and to improve the opportunities and conditions for people with disabilities for an independent living.

On a transnational level, four meetings in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Lithuania are predefined in a milestone plan during the project span of 24 months. Further activities address project marketing aspects, e.g. open houses and round rounds, to raise the project acceptance among the direct and indirect target groups and other stakeholders. The project consortium believes that STELLA  will have a huge overall impact. Almost 9000 people are currently employed by the project partners and their associated partners. Additionally 1000 trainers and educators can be reached directly through the network of Caravan 2000 in which the partners are embedded. Therefore, the results of the project will have a potential impact on a total of 10000 staff members.

Despite most EU countries having a transition process in place there are few practical programmes that support young adults during their final year of school to prepare for leaving.  Practical programmes and initiatives to support the transition from school vary greatly across the EU and are fragmented and lack consistency. To  make a successful  transition from school it is essential that young people are prepared for adult life including opportunities to apply  learning to  practical  adult situations. This includes making informed choices about post school options and the responsibilities and expectations that are associated with being a young adult in the 21st Century. Typically this work is not undertaken by school teachers as they do not have the skills, remit tor contacts with adult services to do so affectively. Research undertaken by the NI  Assembly  in 2015 highlighted the importance of involving non governmental agencies during transition planning and preparation and this is echoed throughout the EU.   Research  carried out in 2011 by the Academic Network of European Disability Experts  (ANED) highlighted that across the EU the transition to post compulsory education is problematic for young disabled people and there are fewer opportunities  to enter and progress into further education or employment. They attribute these challenges to education systems that fail to provide young people with disabilities with the skills required to progress beyond the school environment and teachers often lack the appropriate methodology tools to prepare them for adult life. \r\nThe project will conduct the following activities:\r\n\r\n1.

Erasmus+ priorities have placed a noted emphasis on the delivery of projects that will develop core employability skills and to enhance innovation and the creation of more entrepreneurial individuals. We include targeted curriculum areas including Hairdressing, Early Years, various Training & Craft Skills, Fashion, IT, Hospitality and Essential Skills.  In this application we are introducing new curriculum areas Beauty and Science and we are re-visiting entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nEMOKS will provide learners the opportunity to undertake a 2 week mobility period in an European country either in a vocational institutes or within a company.  As the project title suggests the learner will gain opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills through training and assessment in their vocational and professional competences and will enhance their employability skills.  \r\n\r\nThe main development for NWRC in this year's application is the inclusion of ErasmusPRO long term mobilities.  We hope to offer high quality and economically relevant training opportunities to improve the skills level of our students.  The curriculum areas we have selected to pilot this new activity are IT, Creative Industries & Hospitality.  Some of the courses we run in the college in these areas require a compulsory work experience - these can be difficult to secure either through a lack of opportunities in the area or a saturation of the number of placements being sought from companies.  \r\n\r\nWe include ECVET principles into our mobilities, addressing vocational education with an integrated approach, building on relationships with our partners as we develop learning outcomes that meet our learners\u2019 needs and sharing of experiences.\r\nLearner mobility activities will provide European training experiences to students, many of whom have special needs or fewer opportunities who may not appreciate how adaptable their learning needs are within the context of the wider EU.  The training experience will show them that neither their special needs nor Europe places boundaries on the opportunities that are open to them, in an effort to encourage them to continue with the learning and enhance their employability skills.  \r\n\r\nThe College development plan seeks to encourage outward mobility.  Learning ouctomes achieved on these projects will benefit the local economy and work towards the strategies set out by our local council for better education and training of its people to compete in global markets.

This project clearly progresses the NWRC's European Development plan further into Phase 3 on its Phase 5 Plan.   \r\n\r\nThe project is aligned with the objectives of the Erasmus+ Programme in terms of \"equiping young people with knowledge, knowhow, skills and/or competencies.\" The key objectives of E2020 are also relevant in terms of \"addressing skills deficits, technological competition and .... using forums to share best practices, mutual learning and disseminating results\".   All partners are keen to pursue internationalisation within their organisations.  For NWRC, this is now a cornerstone of  the new FE Means Business Strategy for Northern Ireland (January 2016).  \r\n\r\nSeveral curriculum areas will be involved in terms of meeting particular needs of their staff and students.  Students at level 2 and 3 in these areas have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many,  the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing or a lack of confidence to travel and work in another country.  The majority of our student demographic would fall under the eligibility criteria for widening participation and those with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project provides training for Sport, Motor vehicle, Welder& fabricators, Carpentry, Masonry, Media, Fashion, Early Years, Hair & Beauty, Health & Social Care, Printing, Catering and a large emphasis is placed on students who have special education needs (SEN) and on Essential Skills Literacy & Numeracy.

With the current Erasmus-application call 2018 we make a step in the direction of establishing the mentioned strategic objectives. In this call we describe the flows for in total 420 students (in 2017 this was 390 students). Included are also 40 staff (in 2017 this was 45 staff).\r\nIn the Erasmunplus guidelines for call 2018 is ErasmusPro described. From the total flow of 420 students, the group of long-term students is 83.\r\nWe want to mention the following developments regarding the mobility of students and staff:\r\n\u2022 The interest in Germany and the German language is increasing: in call 2017 we mentioned 125 mobilities to Germany, in the call 2018 150 students are involved.\r\n\u2022 Rijn IJssel concludes that currently mainly students of level 3 and 4 step forwards to participate in mobility programs. In the perspective of the view of Erasmusplus that all students should be granted the possiblity to participate, a plan has been developed focussing on the group of Social care-students level 2, to develop an Orientation\u2013mobility program. This example of Social Inclusion will be developed together with host North West Regional College (NWRC) in Londonderry. Keypoint will be the workingmethod with tandems of UK and Dutch students while working on Orientation on the professional field of Social care, visit Social care-institutes and follow classes. In the preparation and organisation special attention will be set on an extended preparation program including language and solic guidance during the mobility.\r\n\u2022 The workingmethod of the so-called Language-internship (Taalstage), in which the learning of the language is applied directly to assignments in companies, is successful. It is now applied to programs in the English, Spanish and German language.\r\n\u2022 Rijn IJssel aims to connect staff mobility to support innovation-topics. In call 2018 we involve 2 staff study visits:\r\n\u2022 In the perspective of organising Long-term mobility for the professional field of Health Care, we include in the application a flow Advanced Planning Visit to support the development of Long term mobility 3-12 months for students.\r\n\u2022 In line with the projectplan Ecvet in Rijn IJssel, departments are developing sustainable links towards Memoranda of Understanding. In 2017 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 2 Finnish VET schools. In 2018 more will follow.\r\nAside the Erasmus-mobilities, other international activities are developed and established. In this perspective again exchanges are planned with German schools, supported by the Interreg project of Learning Euregion.

Despite this and the fact that work-based learning in VET has proven to be effective in terms of providing students with skills applicable to the labour market and helping to reduce the risk of youth unemployment, VET and WBL does not have a very good reputation regarding professional growth and career guidance, intellectual challenges and attractive career opportunities.\r\n\r\n2. In the countries of the partner organisation WBL as part of VET is under transformation and VET providers and stakeholders need support on how to innovate the existing work-based learning practices, seen as a success factor for good governance of WBL. \r\n\r\n3. All participating organisations in this project recognise that collaboration and partnerships between school and company/workplace will enhance quality in areas as career guidance, curriculum design and professional growth and wil result in better value for the involved organizations. But all of them feel the need  for more more research of innovative models of networking and partnership between school and labour market.\r\n\r\n4. Already at the end of 2008 the European Council decided that 'career management skills play a decisive role in empowering \r\n\r\npeople to become involved in shaping their learning, training and integration pathways and their careers'. On national as well on regional levels there are promising schemes and projects. However, these projects have in common that the cover only individual aspects and stages on the path of working life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis partnership project adresses these needs through development, transfer and/or implement innovative practices at organisational, local, regional, national or European level with the aim of:\r\n\r\n- Enhancing the professional growth and career guidance of the staff members and those involved in training and education (VET) by increasing the quality of international knowledge exchange and continuous training, including new pedagogies, e-learning and the use of Open Educational Ressources in different European languages.

We want every pupil to feel socially included, to challenge and support them to reach the proposed learning objectives and to prepare them to be a strong professional and active citizen. These professionals and active citizens should also be equipped with digital competencies.The project TABLIO addresses this challenge by using tablets into primary and secondary education and using them for differentiation and inclusion purposes. This project will argue that more schools should use tablets. Differentiation and inclusion should be introduced in each classroom and school that work with tablets. All learners will benefit from it.The Tablio-project unites 7 partners from 6 European countries: Belgium, Slovenia, Turkey, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy. All partners subscribe the local, national and European need for inclusive education with tablets (and broader: digital devices). We want to strengthen in-service teachers and schools of primary and secondary level, but also preservice teachers and teacher trainers. If they are fully equipped with the digital competencies and didactical insights to integrate the tablet effectively in their classrooms, all pupils will benefit from it.The project methodology consists of 3 main phases. Phase 1 focuses on the development of a design toolkit, containing design-principles, design-templates and evaluation criteria for the use of tablets for differentiation and inclusion purposes. We will develop this by doing desk-research and organizing focusgroups on the topic in each participating country. After finishing this toolkit, we will  spread an open call in the countries for practices on the use of tablets for differentiation and inclusion purposes. Practices will be described and analyzed via the design toolkit. In a transnational meeting afterwards we will decide which are the 'good' practices. All results will be collected in an online toolkit on a website. This website also functions as electronic learning environment for the dissemination phase. In phase 2 we will develop innovative pedagogical arrangements on using the tablet for differentiation and inclusion. We will follow the principles of design-based-research and work with Teacher Design Teams. In each participating country two teacher design teams will be conducted in order to develop and validate new designs, adapted to a specific classroom context that needs differentiation and inclusion. This will lead to at least 12 new good practices. This website also functions as electronic learning environment for the dissemination phase.

This will reinforce professional relationships between staff and students and give students an opportunity to enhance their planning and business skills. \r\nSoft skills development is strongly supported by participants working collaboratively across languages, cultures and customs: communication, especially negotiating skills play a major role: these are lifelong transferrable skills.\r\nThe internationalism has a key role in artistic development and vocational competences. In this project the students and the staff work in multinational groups and so they get impressions and musical know how from different genres and musical approach in other countries. International activities raise the general competence aspiration level. International contacts enable new coming performance possibilities for students in Europe. The language skills of the student will improve which is extremely important in music business. \r\nThe project will improve the knowledge of ECVET system in partner organisations.

We believe that mobility projects provide the participants with new knowledge and language skills in addition to social and cultural competence, which make them independent and attractive on the job market.  We have seen that the ability to participate in international projects increases student motivation, which leads to an increasing number of students from vocational subjects who complete their education and get a certificate of completed apprenticeship or continue onto higher education. It is also an important contribution to provide vocational subjects improved reputation.\r\nThis year our application comprise two different mobility projects. One to Derry in Northern Ireland for 30 students from the building and construction department and 30 students from the department of health care and social studies. A total of 16 teachers will attend the project. For Reykjavik on Iceland we apply for mobility funding for 20 students and 8 teachers from the department of arts and crafts. 16 students who study climate, energy and environment and 4 teachers from this line of study will also attend.\r\nThe superior goal for all mobility projects is that students improve their academic, linguistic, cultural and social competence through participation in vocational schools in Northern Ireland and Iceland. Work placement, company visits related to their lines of study, and interaction with Northern Irish and Icelandic youngsters are important elements to fulfill the goal.\r\nThe students from building and construction attend practical classes at Northwest Regional College and English lessons at Foyle International. In some of their practical classes, the students learn bricklaying, painting and wallpapering. These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence at our school. \r\nStudents at health care and social studies will partly attend classes at NWCR and partly have work placement in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and/or weekends, the students will participate in planned field trips, including excursions to different spots of historical and cultural interest. Furthermore, there will be arrangements like visits to the cinema and football matches etc.\r\nStudents of arts and crafts will attend practical classes at the Technical College of Reykjavik, where they will participate in trades like tailoring, gold- and silversmith work and hairdressing. Hairdressing is the only option we offer at Olav Duun upper secondary school, and students will thus get familiar with several interesting career paths within their program at The Technical College. \r\nThe students of Climate, Energy and Environmental work will both participate in practical classes at the Technical College and have work placement and training in local plumbing firms.\r\nA cultural program, where the participants will visit famous attractions in and around Reykjavik will be arranged for the whole group on Iceland. Excursions include visit to a power plant, where students receive a thorough introduction to topics such as power generation and renewable energy. There have been conversations already, and we hope to welcome students and teachers from the Technical College to our school on a return visit. \r\nAt both NWRC and the Technical College some of our teachers get the opportunity to be auditors. For teachers, this mean being able to learn new teaching and learning methods in addition to materials and tools of which we have little knowledge. English teachers who participate will have the opportunity to visit both language classes and practical classes. This will be a valuable contribution to the FYR project, a project which aims to make the students understand the value and relevance of learning English preparing for their future professional life. \r\nRelationships across borders is an important goal for mobility visits. For teachers it is both a pleasant and advantageous experience meeting colleagues abroad. In addition, the knowledge they acquire will be a positive contribution to our school.\r\nPlanning, testing, interview, work with extensive tasks, reports and presentations after the stay abroad will provide evaluation basis for both the project and the student grades in different subjects, and will also form the basis for documentation and transmission of experiences in and outside our school. \r\nProfessional life has become increasingly international, and it is our belief that the project will help the students in their future career and make them reliable and independent professionals. Our school's main values are formation, human compassion and involvement. We believe students through mobility projects will be positively exposed to these values.

Four curriculum areas at three of North West Regional College's campuses  will be involved in terms of meeting particular needs of their staff and students.  Students at level 2 and 3 in these areas have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many,  the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing or a lack of confidence to travel and work in another country.

In 2015 we want to send 40 apprentices to the United Kingdom. The apprentices are part-time students who do an apprenticeship as a management assistant in retail business, in wholesale and foreign trade or office management assistants. In order to increase their business knowledge, intercultural experience and language skills the students attend an Intensive Course (PDP - Professional Development Programmes) that takes 3 weeks. In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics. Their professional competences are developed through team work, communication and and oral presentations. During their stay at  British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding. After the course the students get the European College of Business and Management Attendance Certificate and the German-British Chamber Certificate (AHK London).

This project progresses the College European Development plan from Phase 2 to Phase 3 on the 5 phase longer term plan.\r\n\r\nThe activities are aligned with the priorities and objects of the 'Smart, sustainable and Inclusive growth proposed in Europe 2020', the ET2020 report and the Rethinking Education communication that underlie the new Erasmus+ programme.  In total 5 curriculum areas across the College's 3 campuses have had input in to the activities for this project and have done so based on the needs of the demographic that we serve here in the North West of Northern Ireland, a region on the periphery of the UK, which yet again is on the periphery of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis College serves a region which has suffered greatly in the current economic downturn and the College catchment area has the highest unemployment claimant rates in Northern Ireland out of all the UK Regions. In January 2015 the Derry City Council (DCC) area had the highest unemployment claimant rates in NI at 5.4%, with Strabane 2nd and Limavady 4th highest (6.8%, 5.3%). The skills mix of the workforce is below the NI average. The DCC area has the youngest population in NI - 40% are under the age of 25.  \r\n\r\nSchool retention rates in the region are a challenge and the College provides bridging opportunities both in the College and community environment particularly to those in the 16-18 age category, with a strong emphasis on essential skills development in literacy, numeracy and ICT and development opportunities through apprenticeship programmes.\r\n\r\nStudents at level 2 and 3 within the college have to date been reluctant to take up placement opportunities overseas.  For many the decision has been based on personal backgrounds where an opportunity like that would be seen to be beyond their means and upbringing.  For others it would be based on a lack of confidence in themselves, the skills that they have acquired and their ability to build on them in a different environment. The majority of our student demographic would fall under the eligibility criteria for widening participation and those with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project provides 9 Staff Training, 8 Staff Teaching/Training, 10 VET Traineeships in companies, 6 accompanying staff and 36 Traineeships in vocational organisations within the curriculum areas of Hospitality, Art & Design, Health & Social Care, Entrepreneurship and IT over a two year period. Our partners comprise of 4 vocational organisations and 1 Social Enterprise and are located in the Netherlands, Germany and Finland. The project will provide learning opportunities for all participants to gain wider experience in skills and employability mechanisms used in other countries with a focus on the the non-formal learning and work based learning environment. These activities have three main aims:\r\n1. Increase Employability and Life Skills which will contribute to competitiveness within the European economy.\r\n2. Increase training opportunities for VET learners to link skills from education and training to the needs of employers and the world of work.\r\n3. Update VET professionals' skills and know-how on their working practices and teaching methods.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated outcomes are exchange of learning on skills and employability opportunities that will better inform curriculum development, teaching methodologies and the student experience. For the student participants the opportunity to become role models for their peers within the College and wider community will be exploited to its full potential, to show that barriers only exist for those not willing to challenge the norm. The project will look at a variety of topics relevant to the delivery of training including teaching and learning, quality, funding and resourcing, employer engagement and cultural matters. This will be shared within the College NI network and with our other European partners through the Ulixes Economic Engagement Working Group.

We believe that internationalisation will give the participants academic knowledge, but also social and cultural competence as well as language qualifications. This will make them more independent and attractive in the labour market. We have seen that the opportunity to participate in international projects gives higher motivation among the students, and thus the chances for completing upper secondary school with a diploma or a certificate and possibly go on to higher education, will increase. Internationalisation is in this way closely linked to the school\u2019s aim to make more students from vocational programmes complete their study. Further will this give the vocational programmes higher esteem. The participants will acquire a competence which is in demand in local trade and industry. \r\nWe hereby apply for a mobility stay in Derry, Northern Ireland, for 15 students and 4 teachers/assistants from the programme construction techniques at year 2, and a mobility stay in Sevilla, Spain, for 12 students and 3 teachers/assistants from the programme restaurant and food processing at year 2. Both projects will have a duration of 14 days including days of travel.\r\nThe students from restaurant and food processing will have one week in a Spanish school, IES Heliopolis, where we attend lessons and present our own traditional food. Despite challenges when it comes to language, the students quickly find ways to communicate and become friends. \r\nWe go on different excursions: in Jabugo we visit the world\u2019s best producer of ham, in Sanlucar we learn about exotic fish and shellfish not found many places elsewhere, we visit tapas restaurants where we taste and learn about local food \u2013 the diversity and the history of this food. All this represent unique knowledge and competence we cannot learn elsewhere. \r\nThe second week the students are out in work placement in different firms. The firms are chosen by the school staff since they have the best contacts and know what firms will be suitable for our students. We visit the students every day to ensure they are doing well. In this respect it is good to be several teachers/assistants so we can handle unforeseen challenges effectively. \r\nWe see that this has great impact on our students, and that it is of importance to our recipient. The students start talking about the visit to Spain already the first year at upper secondary school. During the time we have run the project in Spain, none of the participants has dropped out from school, everyone has completed their studies with above average marks. \r\nThe students from construction techniques will have one week of teaching at Foyle International and one week at NWRC. Foyle will give the students courses in English language and Irish culture. Derry has a special history because of \u201cthe Troubles\u201d, and this is something our students will learn about. A mix of lessons in history, social science, language and culture, will give the students knowledge of the city and country and a valuable experience. At NWRC the students will participate in vocational training directly related to construction techniques. The students will take part in ordinary lessons and get practical training in masonry, surface treatment work, and construction. Since the building tradition in Northern Ireland is different from our own, the students are guaranteed to learn a lot. This knowledge is something they can bring back home and compare to our own culture and building traditions. All teaching will naturally be in English. We will plan excursions for the weekend we are visiting in addition to a guided tour of the city, social activities, and a friendly football match with NWRC students. \r\nIn the organisation of Steinkjer upper secondary school, the interest in Erasmus + projects is increasing, which means that several programmes of study will probably join in and apply for funding next time. \r\nThe long-term effect of this project is that we build close relations to other countries in Europe.

The internationalisation work is well established in our school and we have seen that the possibility to participate in international projects increases student motivation, which leads to an increasing number of students from vocational subjects who complete their education and get a certificate of completed apprenticeship or continue onto higher education. It is also an important contribution to provide vocational subjects improved reputation. The projects have gradually become an integrated part of the school\u2019s toolkit to help improve quality in pupils'  education as well as providing a possibility for teachers to expand their knowledge and skills. Professional life has become increasingly international, and it is our belief that students participating in these programs will strenghten their professional skills, language and cultural understanding.\r\nIn this application, we are seeking the continuation of our cooperation with North West Regional College in Derry and the Technical College in Reykjavik.

In the same period we are looking for a stay for 20 students from Design, Arts and Crafts (both from the first and the second year of education) and 12 students from the programme of Climate, Energy and Environment Work, with a total of 8 teachers in Reykjavik.  The students will stay for a period of two weeks whereas the teachers stay for one week.  \r\nThe aim of the mobility projects is to improve the students\u2019 comptence in their field of study, as well as their linguistic, cultural and social competence .There are specific plans for professional, social and cultural activities. Students from Healthcare, Childhood and Youth development will follow the teaching at North West Regional College in Derry on the programme of Healtcare and Early Years, Children and Young. In addition, they receive English lessons at Foyle language school . Throughout the work, they will acquire knowledge of how kindergartens, schools and health institutions work in northern Ireland. \r\nIn Iceland the students from the programme of Design, Arts and Crafts attend practice teaching at the Technical College in Reykjavik.  Here they participate in subjects such as textile and clothing design, gold and silver crafts and hairdressing . The students of Climate, Energy and Environment Work will both participate in practical classes at the Technical College and have work placement  and training in local plumbing firms. During the stay they will study different heating and ventilation systems and discuss energy-saving measures and alternative energy solutions. Both in Iceland and in Northern Ireland welcome meetings are organized, as well as social events , tours and excursions for the students.  At the end of the stay there are also evaluation meetings . \r\nAccompanying teachers will have the opportunity to be auditors at both of the two partner schools.  For the teachers, this means insight into work and teaching methods, materials and tools, as well as getting acquainted with disciplines that we do not offer at our school.  English and Norwegian teachers who participate will be given the opportunity to attend both language- and vocational classes.  This will be an important contribution to the FYR project, which aims to better the integration of general and vocational subjects.\r\nOlav Duun Upper secondary school is looking at integrating the European and international dimension into the students' education as very important.  This means continuing to spread knowledge about the internationalisation of several students and teachers at school, widening the participation of several program areas and also host student groups from other countries. The participation in international projects will stimulate more students to take diplomas, and will also encourage many students to pursue further studies.  This will in the longer term add value to the local institutions and industry.  The school\u2019s values, anchored in our strategic plan, are formation, compassion and commitment.  By being accomodated in Northern Irish families, cooperating with Icelandic and Irish students and teachers, participating in cultural activities, going to school in a foreign country and working in relevant institutions, we believe that students receive a positive exposure of the stated goals and values .

International cooperation is a priority area for the school. The school\u2019s main values are formation, human compassion and involvement. By participating in this mobility project, where cultural activities, going to school in a foreign country, staying with foreign families and work in relevant institutions are ingredients, we think that the students will be positively exposed to these values. The general part of the National Curriculum describes how education should contribute in developing the different sides of each human. The content of the mobility project covers this basic principal, which expresses a wide view on education and formation.This year, 2016, 10 students and 4 teachers from the Building and Construction department and 1 teacher from the department of Early years (Children and Young) are going abroad. The next 2 years, it is applied for 60 students and 16 teachers to get the same possibility. In addition, two teachers from other departments will follow language training and will have the opportunity to look for projects that can suit their respective curriculum areas.There are several goals for going ahead with the project. The main goal is to increase the students\u2019 occupational and social skills. By attending courses in a vocational school and a language school, visiting firms within their own vocational areas, interacting with Northern- Irish youths through cultural and social activities and by staying in a private Northern-Irish home, we will strive to reach the goal.The students from the Building and Construction department attend practical classes at North West Regional College and they get English lessons at Foyle International. In some of their practical classes, the students are introduced to bricklaying, painting and wall- covering. These are highly relevant areas, but in which we have low competence in our school.The students at Healthcare and Early Years will partly attend classes at NWRC and partly have training in institutions that are covering their curriculum areas. Some afternoons and / or weekends, the students go on excursions to different spots of historical or cultural interest. Furthermore there will be arrangements like football matches, cinema etc.The base for the students\u2019 evaluation of the project is the planning, tests, interviews, in-depth tasks, reports and presentations. Some of this work will also give a base for the students\u2019 grades.We think that the project will strengthen our students as future participants in an international job marked. Participating in international projects will contribute to make them more confident in what they might meet in their future working life. Having an international perspective will increase the quality of the education.By attending the mobility project and through the learning processes attached to the preparations and evaluation parts, the students will have an insight in the practice of their vocation in another culture. They will also get an understanding of the culture when they stay with Irish families.When the students stay two weeks in an English-speaking environment, they will get some experience with using the English language that will give them an advantage in their further education. There is a demand for language competence both in the construction field and within the field of Health and social care.There is a demand at the job market for more employees with a craft certificate. Therefor it is important to make the vocational education attractive. When we can offer a stay abroad, it will make the education more interesting and it will give more breadth in the competence, which in turn will increase the reputation of the vocational education. We also think it will affect the students\u2019 sense of coping and ensure that more students carry out their education. At Olav Duun vgs most students at the Building and Construction department complete their education, while at Health and social care, and also at other curriculum areas, the achievement rate is lower. We hope that our good experiences from Building and Construction will give spin-offs so a higher rate of students will complete their education.Teachers participating in the project will also get a broader competence through the exchange with colleagues in Northern Ireland. We will experience new learning methods and get an impression of the level of competence in another culture. In addition, it is of great value to interchange experiences with colleagues in Derry. By building good relations, the work will be more interesting and the insight in other ways to teach, may contribute to a more varied teaching at home.

Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal.

The best way to transfer such skills is through the use of experiences that encourage the learning by doing approach. Among these, a crucial role is played by learning experiences based on the Project-based Learning (PBL)  methodology and by the participation in transnational traineeships. Through PBL, which is a teaching method that organizes learning around projects, students gain knowledge and skills by investigating complex and real issues, carrying out tasks and developing project products. The transnational experiences carried out outside the friendly environment encourage the development of transversal skills such as adaptability and flexibility that are part of the skills required to develop an entrepreneurial attitude. Since several years, the members of the national consortium (ENAC, SCF, ENGIM VENETO) are trying to apply PBL methodologies within their centers, and they have recently decided to promote a joint project, based on this methodology, aiming at creating a network among several IVET centers by establishing a buyer-supplier relationship. In this way the centers engaged in the network will create products / services to be used by other network centers.\r\nThe mobility project EU gives you WINGS would like to interact with this joint project in order to combine the development of PBL methodologies and transnational mobility experiences addressed to VET students and staff. The specific objective of the project EU gives you wings are: a) to strength the competences of VET staff engaged in planning and managing learning processes using the PBL approach and through the exchange of good practices with other VET providers; b) to strength technical/professional and linguistic skills of VET students, as well as  improve their transversal skills through transnational placements carried out in a different economic and social context. This will allow VET students to develop innovation, creativity and responsibility that in the short term will support them in the planning and implementation of projects using the PBL approach and in the long run will increase their employability. \r\nTo achieve these objectives, the project promotes three types of mobility activities: 1)traineeship for IVET students in a company abroad for a period of three / four weeks; 2) traineeship for IVET students in a VET center abroad - with learning periods in companies or other organisations - for a period of two weeks; 3) job shadowing activities for staff members in other VET centers throughout Europe. The first two types of mobility activities will involve 210 students (in IVET pathways, 2^-3^-4^ year or within one year of obtaining their graduation), the third is addressed to 35 VET staff members. The project provides a wide sectorial and geographical coverage and will involve students, providers and partners from different economic sectors.

In addition, the partnership have a significant geographical dimension both at national level (13 Italian regions) and European level (24 partners from 13 countries). The large number of foreign partners and the criteria used to select these institutions will assure VET students that the mobility experience is suited to their professional profiles and will provide VET staff with an extensive knowledge of PBL methodologies developed in the EU.

According to ISTAT data, by the end of 2016 are the young those who face more difficulties in finding a job. In fact in Italy the 39,4% of yhem are unemployed. Even if there are many national programs to increase the number of young workers (such as Garanzia Giovani or the programme of school-work alternance) more and more youngsters from 15 to 24 are unemployed. In Central and Southern Italy the situation is even worse, more than 60% of them are unemployed. This can be due to the personal situation of disadvantage experienced by many youngsters in our area which lead them to stop their training and educational path.\r\nWe have spent more than ten years working in the management services for people with dasibility, families and children and we propose a project which can enable those young people living in a situation of disadvantage to live a training experience abroad, after having been taught what they need as far as the foreign culture and language are concerned with the aim of giving them a chance of inclusion in the working world. Our objective is to contribuite, through a transnational mobility, to the reduction of the unemployment rate helping and supporting the disadvantaged young in their training process improving their knowledge and skills and streghtening the link between training and work placement.

The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit.

In this framework, the Italian manufacturing production system has, therefore, the need to capitalize on its tradition and industrial vocation and excel in enabling technologies, innovate and diffuse, even abroad, the \"smart factory 4.0\". The definition of the skills profiles and skills required, along with the creation of training paths suitable to bring companies to the digital productive change, are configured, therefore, such as crucial priorities for the Italian manufacturing industry. The joint actions of MISE, MIUR, CNR and the Agency for Digital Italy, as well as regional initiatives such as Digital Agenda and Smart Specialisation Strategy of Tuscany and Molise, confirm this need.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, the project offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector (mechanical, mechatronics, electronics), soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 84 students attending classes IV and of 3 months for 84 newly graduated of the 7 participating VET Schools, coming from Tuscany and Molise. The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n1.

In particular, in the continuation of the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of real emergency (given that unemployment rates for aged 15-24 exceeded 40%) and it is by all believed that it is extremely necessary to deal with this emergency starting from the dissemination of experiences of integration of young people into the production system already during the years of VET paths. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of VET programmes. This would help learners to achieve high levels of qualification, essential for a successful first entry into the labor market or for the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programmes are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU have recently set the goal of allowing at least 6% of all students in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through VET@WORK MOBILITY, ISIS LEONARDO DA VINCI, the ITT FEDI-FERMI of Pistoia, the ITST MARCONI of Campobasso and the partners of the Consortium, aim at improving the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their curriculum: professionalism in the specific sectors of Mechanical, Mechatronics and energy, cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued by a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 4 weeks for the students of the fourth year (5 of which are disabled and/or with special needs) and of 3 months for the recent graduates of the three involved sending schools. The programme provides for the young participants, placements in enterprises, for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country and comparison of the different professional techniques. The project is also implemented in the European context and priority of the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) and contributes, in particular, to create a European area for lifelong learning in the fields of mechanics, mechatronics and energy.\r\nThe main expected results of the project, which is in continuity with the Erasmus project + KA2 VET Strategic Partnership VET@WORK (2014-1-IT01-KA202-002629), promoted by ISIS Leonardo da Vinci in 2014, are the following: the raising of the personal and professional skills of the participants; the promotion of key competences connected with the exercise of a real active citizenship; the increasing of the employment potential of the participants; the introduction of new training methods to complement existing practices and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools; the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practice between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance. The construction of a permanent network of transnational nature of public organisations, and not only, constitutes, therefore, one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experience and good practices at different levels: technical excellence, best practices in training policies and in the governance of the systems. Human resources, instruments and tools provided by all project partners will ensure also the stability of the project and its exploitation beyond its conclusion, in order to adopt a long methodologies and tools developed by the European training paths. The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level.

Based on these considerations, the project \"ETEROB Mobility\" aims, in line with the project LLP-LdV TOI \"ETEROB - European Training Programme on Energy Efficient Renovation of Old Buildings\", to lay the foundation, through the creation of specific paths of WORK-BASED LEARNING (WBL) for students in initial vocational training and recent graduates in CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE subjects, for a modernization of the construction sector in the belief that this may be the most immediate and cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption, and to create new jobs and promote economic recovery in the construction industry. Through \"ETEROB Mobility\" the VET School \"Caselli\", the other 9 sending VET Schools and all partners of the Consortium, are therefore intended to provide appropriate competencies in the building eco-friendly sector in order to identify appropriate solutions for energy saving, in compliance with regulations on environmental protection and improve, therefore, the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, to the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills curriculum: professionalism in their specific areas of VET (ENERGY, CONSTRUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND LAND), cultural knowledge and language training.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the

activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20

C\u00e2mara Municipal de Lisboa) and to the individual needs of each of the 3 organisations. As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

The major aim of the project  to refine vocational English in VET and to specify interactions, dialogues and intercommunication in sound, photo, video and digitalized formats to represent ESP. Tutors of the team have the strength to possess the VET orientation and knowledge while students' strength is to be able to utilize the modern multimedia tools as on their daily basis. Youngsters have a primary skill to gain knowledge by ICT but tutors have the secondary skill in the same theme. Tutors and stakeholders acquire and sort out the compulsory, authentic, thematic studies, and they are to select the original and life-like interactions. ESP such as Vocational English applies online platforms as they are spread by everyday use. Having learnt the acquired knowledge youngsters and their tutors as well should learn the time-bounding and time measuring techniques in infochange.  Participants of MEET via VET project take part in workshops, technical visits dealing with the following topics; - teaching techniques in filtering methods, scanning and skimming reading, - recording vocational dialogues, - identifying vocational language terms,- demonstrate creative learning activities, - operate smart techniques and put these applications into practice. Life-long learning is essential in the world of dynamic, ongoing changes to be able to answer the world of digital reality and virtual knowledge-based issues. The stages of traditional education have changed as education is interwoven by IT platforms which are popular with teens.

Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through CrossCompetence, the VET school \"Caselli\" and the other three sending VET schools (IIS \"Roncalli\", the Technical Institute \"Bandini\" and the ISS, \"S. Giovanni Bosco\") aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (cultural heritage management, communication, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for 65 students/learners (including 5 disabled or with special needs students) and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the 4 participating VET schools. The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the sector of cultural industries and tourism, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for economic and social growth cannot be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between educational and training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities.\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\". The development of ECVET began in 2002 after the Copenhagen Process emphasizing the need for a credit transfer system for VET. CrossCompetence is a project based on the concrete responses to the questions of developing ECVET in the European member States and corresponding to the 2009 EU Recommendations on the establishment of the European Credit system for VET. The project works in particular to realise an European area for Lifelong Learning in the field of cultural industries and the promotion and management of tourism.\r\nThe whole activities are implemented by regarding a strong European perspective which are reflected in all project activities and results. The project aims to increase the knowledge of ECVET and its technical specifications and ensuring that the added value of ECVET is understood and perceived all over Europe.", "http://www.derrycity.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000132_23"], [2017, "Learning hospitality in Europe by undergoing a VET traineeship", "Derry City & Strabane District Council", 304309.0, 4, 20, "Over the past 20 years, the technical and vocational education has been subject to numerous reforms and changes that had weakened the training offer. Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased internationalization of training institutions, in line with European standards of education.\r\n\r\n During the project, the Europe Direct Regione Lombardia will disseminate the project among

Apart from offering training support to recent graduates in VET in order to develop several internships in a working environment in Europe (this way they can face the best way to access the labor market), the Consortium also wants to potentiate the sense of belonging to the European citizenship through the mobilities planned and the social inclusion and integration of all their citizens.\r\n\r\nDue to the success and the participants\u2019 level of satisfaction with the first LOGRO-EUROPA, the Consortium has decided to continue and keep improving this project through LOGRO-EUROPA III.  In such a way, participants from Logro\u00f1o can enjoy the best opportunities of developing their professional training, and improve this way their employability.\r\n\r\nIn order to maximize the possibilities for these young adults to find a job after developing their VET is not the Consortium\u2019s only priority; finding a job is only a way to ensure the participants to make the transition as productive members of the society. This element is fundamentally important, since youth is one of the collectives which is suffering most from unemployment (which is maybe the most extended way of social exclusion), fighting also against the inequality gap, strongly installed in Spain from the beginning of the economic crisis.\r\n\r\nFaced with the increase in migration movements during the past years, the aim is also to give support to the integration of youth through giving them opportunities of development quality VETs and the promotion of the values and models of a European citizenship, as another element to achieve via this project. From our point of view this is the best way of showing the EU achievements in the fields of the European rights and freedoms for their citizens, by allowing the new generations to get first-hand knowledge, through a successful program, as is the Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this project will be young adults aged between 18 and 35, already graduated on VET within 12 months before the starting point of the mobilities by any of the formative centers in the Consortium.

In particular, in the continuation of the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of real emergency (given that unemployment rates for aged 15-24 exceeded 40%) and it is by all believed that it is extremely necessary to deal with this emergency starting from the dissemination of experiences of integration of young people into the production system already during the years of VET paths. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of VET programmes. This would help learners to achieve high levels of qualification, essential for a successful first entry into the labor market or for the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programmes are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU have recently set the goal of allowing at least 6% of all students in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through VET@WORK MOBILITY, ISIS LEONARDO DA VINCI, the ITT FEDI-FERMI of Pistoia, the ITST MARCONI of Campobasso and the partners of the Consortium, aim at improving the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the educational paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their curriculum: professionalism in the specific sectors of Mechanical, Mechatronics and energy, cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued by a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 4 weeks for the students of the fourth year (5 of which are disabled and/or with special needs) and of 3 months for the recent graduates of the three involved sending schools. The programme provides for the young participants, placements in enterprises, for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country and comparison of the different professional techniques. The project is also implemented in the European context and priority of the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) and contributes, in particular, to create a European area for lifelong learning in the fields of mechanics, mechatronics and energy.\r\nThe main expected results of the project, which is in continuity with the Erasmus project + KA2 VET Strategic Partnership VET@WORK (2014-1-IT01-KA202-002629), promoted by ISIS Leonardo da Vinci in 2014, are the following: the raising of the personal and professional skills of the participants; the promotion of key competences connected with the exercise of a real active citizenship; the increasing of the employment potential of the participants; the introduction of new training methods to complement existing practices and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools; the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practice between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance. The construction of a permanent network of transnational nature of public organisations, and not only, constitutes, therefore, one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experience and good practices at different levels: technical excellence, best practices in training policies and in the governance of the systems. Human resources, instruments and tools provided by all project partners will ensure also the stability of the project and its exploitation beyond its conclusion, in order to adopt a long methodologies and tools developed by the European training paths.

EXMO 2016 plans mobility programmes for 50 students to be spent in French, British and Maltese companies.The Garfagnana Institute considers the EXMO 2016 project as an opportunity to enhance its quality training and education supply and to take a step further:- To experiment a rotation system which complement study and work at international scale, so to adapt and improve its training programmes and curricula consistently with students\u2019 and companies\u2019 needs.- To have an impact on students\u2019 motivation to achieve learning goals and overall school success, fighting back early school leaving phenomena and other forms of youth vulnerability.- To develop the competences of the Institute\u2019s staff with respect to administration, finance and organisation of European mobility programmes, building on the hands-on practice resulting from EXMO 2016.- To enrich the in-service training opportunities for the Istitute\u2019s staff with particular regard to soft skills (e.g. problem solving, group work).- To raise awareness among the Institute\u2019s staff about the opportunities that \u201cEurope can offer\u201d .- To implement the tools to recognize, validate and certify competences, e.g. by means of the ECVET system and the Europass Mobility and CV tools.- To improve the capability to create meaningful networks with local and international partners. The ability to \u201clisten to\u201d requests expressed by economic and social actors allow to design innovative training programmes that are aligned with the needs of the labour market and of the local contexts.As regards students\u2019 needs and expectations, the EXMO 2016 project meets the following necessities: - To improve their professional and technical backgrounds putting their knowledge to the test in novel and challenging working settings which also require adaptation to different cultures and working approaches and the use of a foreign language.- To acquire or refine relational skills and the so-called soft skills, considered as key competences in the EU. The experience of living and working far from home determines great changes in each participant, in terms of individual flexibility, adaptability, ability to work in team, problem solving skills, stress and time management, management of intercultural relations. It is indeed a crucial and valuable stage for an individual\u2019s development process.- To open the Garfagnana area to broader, EU-wide dynamics, fighting back isolation and enhancing the possibility to get to know in a direct way new ways of living, studying and working.- To further study a EU language to be used as working language in different contexts, so to improve one\u2019s own employability.The project, lasting 24 months, will be carried out in the school years 2016-17 and 2017-18.", "http://www.desmondmotors.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004955_2"], [2018, "\"La mobilit\u00e9, un tremplin pour l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019emploi et une ouverture culturelle pour le d\u00e9veloppement de soi.\"", "Desmond Motors Ltd", 68606.0, 4, 21, "Montpensier, Saint Vincent de Paul and Beau Fr\u00eane vocational high schools have chosen to develop a European identity for their Administration, Sales, Social, Catering and Manufacturer sections.\r\n\r\nOn top of the linguistic approach, the main ambition of the European sections is to give our students European cultural and professional knowledge.

The selected host countries are: Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\r\nThey have been carefully chosen not only considering the foreign languages studied in the schools, but taking into account the different economic history of each one and then the different  way of implementation of CSR. The foreign partners are established reality in the field of training, expert about design, management, implementation of European projects in relation to staff and learners training,  and to vocational training in the company of students and graduates.\r\nAs for staff mobility, emphasis was placed to seek partners already active in the ErasmusPlus  field and particularly reliable. They are able not only to strengthen the language skills but offer job shadowing experiences that allow a) the transfer of best practices in use in partner countries schools; b) the strengthening of cooperation with local and transnational bodies involved in the partnership network.\r\nThe impact on learners will be the development of professional, personal and international skills and competences as tools to facilitate integration into the labor market and the reading enterprises\u2019 needs.

For this reason the project stems from the activities already designed and developed by some Consortium members last year. The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship.

For this reason the project stems from the activities already designed and developed by some Consortium members last year. The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship. An individual plan will be prepared for each participant, on the basis of their professional paths and not forgetting their entry level competences and the defined learning outcomes. Skills and knowledges are relative to the Regione Toscana directory, in particular to the ADA 377 \"Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans\" or to the ADA1492 \"Analysis and monitoring of production and development\". During the meeting the staff will give participants information about the administration and the  management of the project phases.\r\n- Mobility: before the departure each participant will receive the tickets and the handbook; then they will develop a three weeks traineeship in UK, Spain, Ireland, Germany.

One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes. This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. \r\n\r\nIn line with these objectives and European policies, through GREEEN II, I.I.S (Institute of Higher Education) MERLONI MILIANI of Fabriano aims to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (renewable energy and environment), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 3 weeks for 80 students of fourth year of technical and vocational secondary school with fields of study related to the renewable energy and other 8 newly graduated.\r\nThe training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the renewable energy and environment to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country.
