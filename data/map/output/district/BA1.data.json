Amongst this category, the difficulties of persons with intellectual disabilities are even more acute. For them, gaining access to vocational training that can lead to a job is a challenge that the ACCESS Project intends to take up.Made up of 4 different partners from 3 countries (France, England and Portugal), this Project brings together research and training centers and associations directly working with people with intellectual disabilities.It is innovative in the sense that it brings together, in country committees, 4 stakeholders that are not generally used to working together: the young adults with intellectual disabilities, families, trainers and employers. The objective is to have them work in a collaborative and cooperative process, thus improving the empowerment and commitment of all the participants.The 5-day study visits will be organized in the 3 countries with the following objectives:- Permit trainers and employers to discover good practices put in place by training or vocational centers from another country, thus leading to the elaboration of the comparative chart (by INS HEA) and the final guidebook by all partners,- Allow the youths as learners to discover other training practices and learning methods, to meet their peers, to discover another language, culture,\u2026. Especially for this category with very few opportunities to travel abroad;- Participate to the construction of a network of European training and vocational centers.- Enable the project manager and her assistant to draw up the comparative chart and the guidebook.The main tangible result will be the creation of a guidebook for good practices in terms of support and access to education and ongoing vocational training. The guidebook will be based on the comparative chart, the study visits and the different tools created. It will be translated in the 3 languages (French, English and Portuguese) and will also be adapted in Easy-to-Read language so that persons with intellectual disabilities can use it.Another possible intangible result may be a better cooperation and mutual understanding between the categories of persons involved in the project as regards their needs, expectations, difficulties, barriers,\u2026.. (youths, families, trainers and employers) and a better empowerment and commitment of the participants to the country committees and by extension to all their related and linked networks.ACCESS will have multiple impacts at different levels:1/ Direct impact for the members of the country committee and the participants of the study visits:- For the target group: trainers and employers: exchanging good practices and discovering other teaching and training methods. Using a training guidebook adapted to intellectual disabilities. Cooperating with the other parties and empowerment. Building a network;- For the ultimate beneficiaries: young people: Discovering other training methods. Meeting their peers in other European countries and discovering other cultures and languages. Cooperation, social participation and empowerment. Inclusion and access to employment.2/ Indirect impact for other persons outside those involved in the Project. -For the training centers which the young people attend, or in which the trainers work, or which participate to the study visits: They will benefit from the project in many ways: Meeting other professionals. Discovering other training methods and practices. Using the guidebook. -For the labor market: Hopefully, through the employers participating in the country committee, the project will have an impact on their views and will break down prejudices and assumptions surrounding intellectual disabilities.3/ Direct impact for the partners. Cooperation and networking. Improving research and methodology.This multiple impact will promote the construction of an inclusive society in which persons with intellectual disabilities are recognized as being capable of holding a position in society and particularly in the labor market.Access will thus contribute to improving the negative image which the persons with intellectual disabilities suffer from and will increase their chance to actively take part in society and become citizens with full rights.", "http://www.ndti.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA202-024229_1"]]}}, "1LB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1475280000000, 1553990400000, "Development of an innovative algae based tertiary wastewater treatment and value recovery system", "Industrial Phycology Limited", "Industrial Phycology (IPHYC) has developed a wastewater treatment (WWT) process to meet tightening discharge consents for the concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and other materials in wastewater (WW) effluents.

There is a strong focus on creating opportunities for young persons between 16-29 years old to gain accredited skills to become competitive on an increasingly international job market. The EMEU4ALL project addresses all Erasmusplus program objectives (2014-3020) which prioritize the expansion of learning mobility opportunities, the creation of strategic partnerships for VET education and the accreditation of learning mobility achievements through the use of the European ECVET Toolkit instruments. Access for young VET students to teaching and training methods and work experiences in other countries will help to improve their employability in a global economy: work-based learning is critical for employability at all education levels, particularly in the current context of extremely high youth unemployment.  Student numbers have dropped dramatically in the last 10 years and therefore there is a clearly defined need to increase the quality and attractiveness of VET education in many European countries. The EMEU4ALL project therefore focusses on Learning Mobility which comprises both physical mobility and virtual activities, because current opportunities for physical mobility in VET education are low: in The Netherlands e.g. the number of secondary VET students involved in mobility programmes is just between 1-2 % . Internationalization@home (IaH) or Virtual mobility activities where staff and students work together at a distance are stable in HE and Universities, but very underdeveloped in VET; if activities are offered in VET, they are most likely not embedded in the curricula of VET colleges and therefore not validated. IaH, however, may be the only affordable key to mobilize the majority of non-mobile students.  With the predecessors of the EMEU4ALL project, i.e. the Automobility project, the Automovet project and Engineering Mobility across Europe (EMEU) project (2014-2016) the partnership has actively supported and addressed the EU aims described above by creating an open and sustainable network for learning, working opportunities and validation through ECVET thereof for Engineering students in VET education. The attention and nominations the EMEU project has received since its inception has strengthened our belief that the project formula will work in all VET sectors as practice has attracted new partners to the project. Thus, the EMEU4ALL project aims to transfer the EMEU products, procedures and website for Engineering/ICT to Health Care, Social Care, Business Studies (Marketing), Sports, International Trade and Service (Retail and Catering). The existing and tested EMEU products and procedures (see: http://em-eu.eu) will ensure a transfer to the new EMEU4ALL VET sectors with which we aim to: 1. create and test a minimum 40 virtual mobility activities; 2. create and test 40 modules; 3. Create vocational blood groups of  5 partners; 4. promote and execute longer-term work placements for students after finishing the modules. (This means that after the EMEU and EMEU4ALL project, the partners will have developed and tested 80 copy-left modules and virtual assignments. 5. adapt the existing EMEU website for engineering/ICT to the new VET sectors involved. 6. adapt the existing ECVET for ENGINEERING manual to an ECVET4ALL manual. The experience gained with understanding and applying ECVET will help to embed the modules in their own educational programs to become part of the partner\u2019s primary process; 6. Further develop teachers' professional skills in other VET areas regarding intercultural diversity, foreign languages and learning about the other VET programs in Europe. An extra focus for teachers will be on learning about and actively using social media, particularly through virtual learning mobility activities: If students are to be competitive on an international labour market, then it's necessary to gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary in an international context and to assess and validate their achievements. 7. Promote an active relationship between Education and Industry: during and/or after the modules the students will visit local/regional companies to experience educational theory applied in practical situations. Local and or regional industry will also contribute to the project by helping to develop the contents of the modules and by offering work experience opportunities to the transnational students. In a nutshell, through virtually and physically participating in and, more important, after this project, many more VET students will benefit from an international experience which will enhance their chances on an international labour market.

Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation was one of the focus points in its strategy and operations for the period of 2011-2017. In a new strategy internationalisation is not mentioned as a focus point, but it takes in the account of changing needs of workers\u2019 skills and competence due to the e.g. digitalisation, urbanisation, climate change and globalisation. Hyria strategy is not set for the specific timeframe, but it can be modified if necessary due to fast change of the operational environment.\r\n\r\nInternational activities at Hyria are aiming to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The evaluation system of international activities will be improved. \r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved. The implemented periods are compared with the estimated ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- The organisation of international activities at Hyria (better involvement of adult learners).\r\n- Inclusion of international activities into implementation plans of the new curricula.\r\n- Developing an international learning pathway for students.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n- Updating the programme for international activities. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities the mobility periods are implemented according the ECVET procedures, the procedures of international activities are improved, internationalisation at home is expanded, internationalisation is spread into the different departments and students. In addition to that, the transparency of student guidance is improved (blogs as learning diaries) and we have a stronger cooperation with companies. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 61 student mobility periods covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. 5 selected students will receive additional monetary support (exceptional costs) for living and cultural expenses due to the fewer opportunities (economical). \r\n\r\nThe mobility of staff and world of work (22 persons) is connected to teacher/expert exchanges, visiting new partners and work placements for quality reasons. There will be also 4 people invited to teach and guide Hyria\u2019s students of the health care sector.", "http://www.bathcollege.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046772_10"], [2014, "\"Sur la voie\"", "Bath College", 96144.0, 4, 4, "As indicated by the title of the project \u201cOn the Road \u201d, the main objective of the project is to put students on the right track of employability by better preparing them for the challenges of the world of work in the European space. This needs improving the skill levels of linguistics, computer science, rhetoric and communication key skills required in the European labour market. That is why, the experience of an internship abroad is inevitable because nothing can replace the experience of mobility, especially for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds whose parents cannot finance their internship abroad. Therefore, it is essential to create an Internet exchange platform to share productions, information and data on the preparation, practice and monitoring of placements abroad.\r\nThe added value for students lies in the acquisition of technical application and speech methods, rhetoric and management of stress at work that will be useful on the European labour market.\r\nTeachers will also benefit from these achievements through their task of tutoring, coordination and supervision, thus helping to strengthen links and bridges between the world of education and the world of work.\r\nThe choice of school partners has been based on two criteria: knowledge and relevance. Indeed, we already knew German and English schools with whom we have already gone on language and professional exchanges ( one week stay ) . It also seemed to us relevant and logical to include partners from large equivalent European countries (Germany, Britain, and Spain) whose languages are taught as foreign languages in partner countries and spoken by a large number of European speakers. The linguistic and professional gain will be all the more important both for students and teachers. \r\nTo achieve these purposes, planned activities will revolve around two main axes :\r\n- The professional  axis with CVs, standardized cover letters and specific research internship and work placement abroad .\r\n- The axis \"welfare at work\" with the acquisition and practice of speech techniques, rhetoric and stress management.\r\nThe creation of an Internet platform will be the main tool of communication and exchange, allowing students and teachers to share their productions, their experiences, information and database.\r\nContinuous assessment done by students and teachers in each step of the project through evaluation forms, questionnaires and reports will allow to adjust and improve procedures to meet the objectives defined above.\r\n\r\nThe expected results are obtaining adequate training in a partner country and its successful completion through acquired techniques.\r\nThe expected effects for teachers and students from the impact of the project will be measured in several areas:\r\n-improving digital and language skills through the Internet platform\r\n- acquiring speech techniques and stress management, adapted to the requirements of the working world through theatre workshops and yoga\r\n- sharing of information , solutions and know-how specific to each partner on the platform\r\n-promoting consistency between European research tools and internship application by translating and standardizing CVs and cover letters\r\n-ensuring better mutual recognition of skills and experience acquired abroad by issuing a certificate recognized by standardized training partners\r\n- raising awareness of target audiences project by creating their long-term commitment through internal and external dissemination activities\r\n-  developing new practices based on this project and expand long-term partnerships\r\nNo doubt that the cooperation and mutual enrichment between the different partners, synergies and linkages between formal and vocational education, the improvement of language skills and digital competencies will facilitate the integration of young people into the European labour market.", "http://www.bathcollege.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002365_3"], [2017, "Europakaufmann und European Business Baccalaureate Diploma", "Bath College", 91901.0, 10, 15, "As a VET college with a focus on business located in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region with global players such as BASF, SAP and IBM an international orientation is essential for a distinctive profile of our college. It also gives us a competitive edge compared to upper secondary education in colleges providing general education. Continuation in creating this international profile is crucial. Hence we have extended our international educational programme in 2015. The additional qualification (\"European management assistant\" - EMA) for apprentices (industrial mangement assitants) is designed to assure international and intercultural qualification: The apprenteces attend additional courses about international business processes (such as international marketing, basics of international trade and contracts, law of international sale contracts, shipping documents and foreign payment transactions), and acquire certificates: ECDL-Base, certificats of foreign language competence (Englisch (at least B1, intended B2) and French or Spanish (at least A2). They are also obliged to go abroad for a 3-week internship.\r\n\r\nSignificant targets are ...\r\n1) ... for learners: improving their chances on the labour market by providing the additional qualification (\"EMA\") and testing/improving developed  instruments for recognition (especially Europass mobility and ECVET) for work placements in that context.\r\n2) ... for teachers: strengthening existing cooperations and hence putting the international orientation of our college on firm footing, especially by qualifying more colleagues in the execution of work placements abroad, exchange programmes and international projects, discover new impulses for their teaching and share them in teacher conferences for further improvement of our educational programmes. \r\n\r\nAll apprentices enroled for the \"EMA\" programme  are obliged to complete a 4-week work placement abroad. In 2017 there are 31 apprentices aiming to obtain this qualification.  Additionally 10 interested apprentices in other educational programmes will be offered to participate in a commercial 2-week-internship. Teachers who will be chosen for staff mobility are either already teaching in the Europakaufmann (\"EMA\") or EBBD (European Business Baccalaureate Diploma) programmes or seek to teach in these programmes or want to contribute to the internationalization of our college in another way, e.g. by creating new exchange programmes or projects of cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs all apprentices currently enroled for the \"EMA\" programme are apprentices as industrial management assistants their work placements will also fulfill their training regulation. Our partners (CSCS, Principia School of language, partnership international, StageinSpain, Stage Malta) are able to provide work placements accordingly and will ensure on-site monitoring. They will also arrange accomodation and necessary support.  Activities reports will reflect the students' learning progress and will be sent to the German teacher responsible for that project. We will test using etwinning in this context.  The students will reflect on their mobility by using an evaluation sheet based on ECVET criteria, stating the learning outcomes they will have achieved during their stay. These evaluation sheets will be discussed with their mentors and recognized by them. It will be completed by a presentation of the mobility's results to other apprentices in an internship exhibition in Germany. \r\n\r\nThe 2-week commercial internships for apprentices in other educational programmes will be organized by us and Principia in the same way.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the impending BREXIT we additionally apply for internships at Principia/Worcester in 2018 as this is one of our most qualified partners.\r\n\r\nWith regard to our apprentices we expect increased compentence in international business processes, social, personal and intercultural competences as well as improved foreign language competences.

Together with their families, that means that about 2 million people are directly affected by disability, representing almost one third of the world's population. More people have access needs; for example, older and less mobile people or people with pushchairs have access needs. The European population is ageing: by 2050 the number of people over65 will be 3 times what is was in 2003. For all of these people, travelling can be a real challenge.

Making places more accessible is a social responsibility but also acompelling business case to boost the competitiveness of tourism in Europe.The Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROWTH), has responsibility for helping turn the EU into a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy by implementing the industrial and sectorial policies of the flagship Europe 2020 initiative, fostering entrepreneurship and for the COSME programme (Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) which recently called for proposals to facilitate transnational tourism for seniors in low season, recognising the substantial market availableIn July 2014, DG GROWTH held a conference and commissioned three reports detailing the current state of accessibility in tourism: the marketplace, skills and training needs and travel patterns. Two projects (TACTALL and TAFCITY) are mentioned; both aredescribed as innovative and useful; however, the awareness training they offered has not been made available on a wide basis, mainly because they were LLP 'pilots'. Some members of the project teams that created these projects feel that they have the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm to enhance, adapt and deliver sustainable training, with EU certification accepted by many member states.The unemployment rates in partners' countries is high, particularly in the under 30s. Setting up their own business is a viable option for many young people. Many rural areas have no work other than that provided by SMEs or micro businesses; many of these areinvolved in the tourist industry. The marketplace potentially is very large and growing. Recommendations in the 2014 report mentioned have been taken into account in this proposal, together with the consortium's now extensive knowledge and experience.This project will deliver accessibility as a new opportunity for the tourism market, creating a modular course using innovative methods: co-creation (Living Lab) and including disabled people in the curriculum design. Four modules will cover entrepreneurship, including social enterprise; accessibility awareness and comprehension; a standard that could be embedded into any curriculum with EU certification pursued; accessible tourism; marketing accessible tourism (in particular to open up the out-of-season market for older persons). It will also create  co-operation between education, business, social enterprises, NGOs and similar to raise awareness of accessibility. A business case for accessible tourism will be created, to ensure businesses recognise thepotential of the market available. In order to raise the profile of accessibility, via local, regional, national and pan-European networks, businesses associations, NGOs and similar, an online network/forum and quality evalation facility will be designed and delivered . An evaluation/review product, Acc Advisor (similar to the popular Trip Advisor) and an App are deliverables. It is certainly intended to make GROWMAT sustainable, seeking 'corporate' sponsorship, social enterprises or using crowd funding to maintain the profileThe partnership has a mix of skills: 3 VET institutions, 2 of them with experience of projects involving accessibility and elderly people and their needs; a University of Applied Science, with valuable knowledge of entrepreneurship and co-creation (Living Lab) methodology; a UK charity dealing with older people and knowledge of active ageing; a private training company who is also an entrepreneur; another entrepreneur who specialises in 'Design for All'; a European VET network with 1500 members.The project will run events and attend events to enable the partnership to find \u2018champions\u2019 (a person who vigorously supports or defends a person or cause.); the champions are considered very important to the project.The beneficiaries of this project include people of varying abilities, older people, anyone less mobile, students (particularly in hospitality and tourism), teachers and trainers, adults, unemployed persons, employers and staff.The potential long-term benefit of this project is for accessibility comprehension to be accepted as a basic transversal skill.", "http://www.ageukbanes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA202-024934_5"]]}}, "2ED": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Verbesserung der Unterrichtsmethoden f\u00fcr berufsorientierten Unterricht und Optimierung der Bedingungen zur Inklusion im Rahmen der Internationalisierung", "LTS Training and Consulting Limited", 7286.0, 4, 5, "Our intention is it to send one appointed teacher to Norway to the Dronning Mauds Minne Hochschule, a college of higher education.

After a stay abroad the perspective is expanded, the contents of lessons and the methods of education can be critically reflected and adjusted. Being a foreigner in another country enhances the capability for empathy because oneself is in the position of being a minority. \r\nThe mobility project in general should be optimised by including new knowledge and skills, which are acquired during the stay abroad by all teachers involved in lectures, courses and sit-ins.

As a YMCA we are part of the worldwide movement and understand how important it is to create and maintain positive relationships across borders of all kinds.  The objectives of the project are to promote intercultural learning, increase tolerance and understanding, share knowledge of the working practices and requirements in the UK for working with children, provide opportunities for learning in new areas and also to develop existing skills.  In particular we would like to encourage and develop the volunteers creative skills and entrepreneurial spirit by sharing with them the creative aspects of our work and encouraging them to become involved and lead their own activities.  We would like to provide an experience that enables personal growth and increased confidence so that for their futures.The project will involve three volunteers, each from different countries, Russia, Italy and Spain.  The volunteers will all be from different cultures and have different home languages so that coming together and living in the shared flat, working in our varied departments, both the volunteers and the staff, children and families with whom they work will enjoy a positive intercultural learning experience.  The volunteers selected for the project are aged between nineteen and twenty five years old and all have a strong desire to work with children as well as possessing great enthusiasm for the organisation and to take part in EVS. The focus of the project will be in our children's work, we have six nurseries, three after school clubs and one holiday club, however we will also encourage the volunteers to spend some time in the optional departments of Health & Wellbeing, our social enterprise cafe in Bristol, The Kitchen, or in our main hostel reception.In our children's work the volunteers will help with general daily tasks such as setting up activities, reading stories, creative sessions using arts and crafts, music and dance, helping children settle in on arrival, changing shoes and coats, serving and preparing snacks, playing games and other duties.  The volunteers will get to know the children and families and form positive relationships with them and the staff teams.  The volunteers will be encouraged to help run activities and then to research, plan, implement and evaluate their own activities, based upon their own cultures and interests.  These could range from cooking traditional recipes, language activities, learning traditional dances or songs, celebrating cultural festivals, sharing stories from folklore and others.  In the settings the volunteers will also take part in celebrating the varied festivals and events through the year.  The volunteers will also learn more about the early years framework in the UK and current playwork practices.  The mixture of age groups, being three months to five years old in the nurseries and ages four to eleven in the out of school clubs, will provide the volunteers with an interesting opportunity to work with both and see the differences and similarities involved.In the Health & Wellbeing Centre the volunteers will be learning about how centres like ours can support the mind, body and soul which is really important in YMCA work.  In the hostel reception the volunteers will be help with general duties and will be in contact with the huge variety of people on short stays or living in the hostel as temporary accommodation.  In the Social Enterprise cafe in Bristol the volunteers will be helping with the general running of the caf\u00e9 which provides good, healthy food for the local community but also to provide employment and training opportunities for young people who have had a difficult start in life and few chances to build something for themselves.  The volunteers will work alongside trained and experienced staff, most of whom have been involved with the previous EVS projects we have run.  A full induction will be given to each volunteer and both informal training and training courses where available will be provided.  Regular evaluations will be carried out and support supplied.  A local language course will be provided as well as the OLS and the staff teams will help informally.The expected results and impact are to develop confidence, personal growth, intercultural understanding and tolerance for the volunteers and also the target groups, gaining new skills and building upon existing ones.  It will inspire a greater desire for intercultural learning and form good relationships to reinforce the positive attitudes and concepts of the project, lasting long beyond the end of this project.

Older workers who become unemployed are more likely to slip into economic inactivity, especially women and the lower-skilled. Older workers have different skills and competences compared with other generations; without their participation in working life, a shortage of professional, structural and networking capacities will arise. Their transfer of knowledge to younger workers is important; different strengths of different generations creates the strongest combination of competences in the workplace. Better work ability for older people affects their later life; with the increasing numbers of older persons in the EU, it is vital that there is investment in active ageing (active living).  Fostering entrepreneurship and transversal skills, including entrepreneurial teaching and innovative methods of approaching teaching, entrepreneurial experiences for younger people, students; this project addresses these aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this project is to develop working partnerships between education and employment, including self-employment, entrepreneurship; local and regional economic policies include entrepreneurship as a valid alternative to unemployment. Many older people are also turning to self-employment for the first time in their lives; in some cases this is a necessity, in some cases they want to realise their 'dreams'. Mentoring is proven to help new businesses to succeed; many business fail within the first year; personal help and guidance can make a difference. The older generation who have retired but are still active; their valuable skills and wisdom can be used for volunteer mentoring, making that vital difference to the new business and also giving the older person a feeling that they remain a valuable contributor to civil society; hence intergenerational mentoring. Young unemployed are also in danger of social exclusion; they will be helped by this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will create a Mentoring Masterclass; this is a 'Train the Trainer' course; 36 trained mentors will be created. There will be e-learning  created, open access; the curricula will include innovation and creativity skills, creating the entrepreneurial mindset and employability skills. This course will be suitable for the target audience of unemployed, entrepreneurs, mentors, students, apprentices and a wider audience, including employers and business organisations; it can be made available to anyone in the world, providing suitable security is implemented. A 6-month pilot will test the intergenerational mentoring process, created during an innovative co-creation event; 108 entrepreneurs (young and older) will be mentored, delivering a minimum of 1296 mentor/mentee sessions.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 200368.0, 7186916.0, 5, 15, "CryoHub", null, null, null, "h2020_199618_950431512"]]}}, "9AE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1232409600000, 1303171200000, "The Development of Indicators & Assessment Tools for CSO Values-based projects in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)", "Alliance of Religions and Conservation", "'This project involves five very different Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) involved in Education for Sustainable Development in a very wide range of project types coming together to investigate two main aims, with academic assistance: 1) to develop more useful indicators to measure the impact of value/behaviour change elements in their ESD projects \u2013 at the project level.

It will be necessary to particularly focus on the development of less established SD indicators such as ' well-being' which are can be strongly affected by spiritual/faith-based values and activities (Clark and Lelkes, 2005). Indicators for this have been difficult to quantify so far in mainstream discussions, but by focussing at project impact level we believe some can be defined and refined, with CSOs working with academics.
