During surgery and within the intensive care unit, the patient\u2019s upper airway tract is bypassed to assist breathing and enable controlled delivery of medical gases; and thus artificial means must be used for humidification. The state of the art provides two main devices: active (high performance / high cost) and passive (low performance / low cost). Whilst passive is preferred due to ease of use and low costs, it is not suitable for more than 24 hour use (or patients with specific respiratory needs). The HUMID project will overcome this limitation through the development of a low cost, easy to use, self-sufficient passive heat and moisture exchange (HME) device offering the following innovative features:  - Enhanced humidification performance, boosting the exchange of moisture from the HME material to inhaled respiratory gases, thereby enabling longer term patient use (>72 hours); - Custom designed non-woven material structures offering enhanced moisture sorption and heat exchange properties, thereby eliminating the need for external water reservoirs (reduced healthcare service costs and risk of infection);  - Electronic control module and integrated low cost flow actuator, enabling controlled device actuation and functionality in coordination with patient respiration, energy reductions and battery operation;  Targeting replacement of more complex active humidification systems, the HUMID device will offer improved performance and functionality at lower cost; thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits to patients and healthcare end-users.

In this approach, highly sensitive biochemical and biophysical screening technologies are being used to detect the low affinity binding of low molecular weight compounds (the so-called fragments) to protein targets that are involved in pathophysiological processes. By investigating the molecular interactions between fragment hit(s) and the target protein, a detailed understanding of the binding event is obtained. This enables the rational and efficient optimisation of the hit fragment. The optimised compounds represent high quality leads for drug development. The necessary FBLD technologies and approaches have emerged mainly from small and specialised biotech companies. At present, FBLD is being adopted throughout pharmaceutical sciences, including by pharmaceutical companies, SMEs and academic research groups. So far, the necessary training that is needed to obtain an holistic view of the possibilities and opportunities that FBLD provides is missing, most likely because the highly multidisciplinary nature of the FBLD work is difficult to capture within one (academic) institute. Therefore, we have established FragNet as a dedicated FBLD training network. The consortium consists of the most prominent pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies and academic groups that have jointly shaped the FBLD research area. FragNet is committed to train 15 ESRs in all facets of FBLD using the combined technologies, skills and knowledge. This will include both research (e.g., technologies on the interface of chemistry and biology) and transferable skill sets (e.g., writing, media training, entrepreneurship and thorough understanding of scientific knowledge transfer).

In general, adhesive bonding is the optimum technique for joining CFRP light-weight structures, but difficulties in assessing the bond quality by non-destructive testing (NDT) limit its use for aircraft structural assembly. In consequence certification by the regulation authorities is restrictive.\nIn order to implement robust and reliable quality assurance procedures for adhesive bonding, the main objective of ENCOMB (Extended Non-Destructive Testing for Composite Bonds) is the identification, development and adaptation of methods suitable for the assessment of the adhesive bond quality. Since the performance of adhesive bonds depends on the physico-chemical properties of adherend surfaces and adhesives, testing methods for adhesive and adherend surface characterisation will also be developed.\nThe implementation of reliable adhesive bonding processes by advanced quality assurance will lead to an increased use of light-weight composite materials for highly integrated structures minimising rivet based assembly. The expected weight savings for the fuselage airframe are up to 15 %. These weight savings will have further effects on the size and weight of the engines. From the overall weight savings, significant reductions in fuel consumption (direct costs) and hence CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre will result.\nIn ENCOMB, a multidisciplinary consortium of 14 partners from top-level European research organisations, universities and industries brings together leading experts from all relevant fields.
