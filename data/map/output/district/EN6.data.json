The project NAREB's main objective is the optimization of several nanoformulations of antibacterial therapeutics in order to improve the therapy of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) and MRSA infections in European MDR patients.\n\nNAREB will address the problem of drug bioavailability inside the infected macrophages, transport across the bacterial cell wall, and avoidance of escape mechanisms (expressed by the pathogen). The success of the utilization of nanoparticles in the improvement of drug targeting in other diseases opens the way for novel applications in nanotechnology-based treatments aimed at controlling MDR-TB and MRSA.\n\nSpecific objectives to achieve the main goal are:\n(i) Screening of different combinations of antibiotic drugs (small chemical molecules and/or biomacromolecules - glycopeptides) with nanocarriers (lipid, polymeric, biopolymeric);\n(ii) Loading of Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) designed to block the expression of essential bacterial genes in compatible nanoparticle systems and their testing as novel antibacterials;\n(iii) In vitro and in vivo testing of the best therapeutic combinations in relevant experimental models and using innovative bioimaging;\n(iv) Improved formulations of multifunctional particles containing selected antibiotics and TFDs for increasing the bioavailability of active molecules in the site of infection (targeting strategy, adapted route of administration)\n(v) Assessing safety, regulatory and production (GLP/GMP) aspects in relation with the most promising nanoformulations;\n(vi) Clinical Development Plan for the preparatory work for the subsequent clinical testing of the selected nanoformulations.\n\nThe project NAREB brings together 15 partners (including 4 SMEs and 1 industry) from 8 EU Member and Associated States with outstanding complementary expertise, ranging from material engineering to molecular biology, pharmacology and medicine.", 185143.0, 10641537.0, 8, 16, "NAREB", null, "http://www.kuecept.com", null, "fp7_110860_950837942"], [1380585600000, 1506729600000, "DNA-TRAP \u2013 Delivery of Nucleic Acid-Based Therapeutics for the TReatment of Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens", "Kuecept Limited", "Antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from infectious diseases over the last 70 years. However, through overuse and misuse of these agents, many micro-organisms have developed antimicrobial resistance. Oligonucleotide therapeutics have the potential to become the new class of antibacterials capable of treating a broad range of infections. By acting on novel targets, they circumvent current resistance mechanisms and with judicious use, can suppress the rise of future resistance.\n\nDNA-TRAP will build on a platform technology that uses proprietary nucleic acid-based Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) that act on novel genomic targets by capturing key regulatory proteins to block essential bacterial genes and defeat infection. Taking forward newly emerging insights and expertise that exists within each of the partners and through the mutual secondment of researchers, the project aims to develop a new class of nanoparticulate antibacterials capable of meeting the clinical challenge of drug-resistant infections such as Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nDNA-TRAP will establish a lasting, international partnership for transfer of knowledge between Industry and Academia in the field of nanomedicine. Exchange of knowledge and expertise between the partners is key to establishing the fundamental properties of nanostructured drug delivery systems to treat bacterial infections and through this, provide the basis for building a manufacturing platform to advance the experimental therapeutic into clinical trials.\n\n17 researchers in the field of drug development and delivery from 2 commercial (SME) and 2 non-commercial partners across 2 member states, will have the opportunity to share and acquire new complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge, through inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary exchange, allowing for the development of new solutions and the establishment of further joint research projects.", 35380.0, 1901826.0, 2, 6, "DNA-TRAP", null, "http://www.kuecept.com", null, "fp7_110153_950837942"]]}}, "2RY": {"nhs": {"data": [["RY4", "Potters Bar Community Hospital", "nhs_RY402"]]}}, "3JF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1291161600000, 1393545600000, "Alignment of Capability and Capacity for the Objective of Reducing Debris", "Phs Space Limited", "Access to important regions of space is necessary for maximum political, economic and social return from space investments, yet the vulnerability of space assets to debris impacts results in a persistent threat to those investments. At the same time, the capability of space industry to apply debris mitigation measures to reduce the threat is constrained by financial, technological, informational and philosophical considerations in spite of efforts to establish comprehensive debris mitigation guidelines and standards. No system currently exists to identify, quantify or address these constraints, yet while they remain it is likely that the near-Earth debris population will continue to grow and therefore the risk to assets will increase. Thus, the removal of these road-blocks is essential for the long-term, sustainable use of space. The main objective of this Support Action is to support research and development efforts being undertaken internationally and at European level, by providing a coherent and rigorous mechanism for communicating the efficacy of current debris mitigation practices and opportunities for strengthening European capability. This objective will be realised via a three-step approach: (1) surveying the capability of industry to implement debris mitigation measures and identifying existing and future challenges, (2) reviewing the capacity of mitigation measures to reduce debris creation, and (3) combining capability and capacity indicators within an environmental impact rating system to communicate the effectiveness of mitigation practices. The rating system will be directed at the public and private sectors across Europe to support their continuing efforts to implement mitigation measures.

Ensuring robustness into the future, ReDSHIFT will take advantage of disruptive opportunities offered by 3D printing to develop highly innovative, low-cost spacecraft solutions, exploiting synergies with electric propulsion, atmospheric and solar radiation pressure drag, and astro-dynamical highways, to meet de-orbit and disposal needs, but which are also designed for demise. Inherent to these solutions will be structures to enhance spacecraft protection, by fracture along intended breakup planes, and re-entry demise characteristics. These structures will be subjected to functional tests as well as specific hypervelocity impact tests and material demise wind tunnel tests to demonstrate the capabilities of the 3D printed structures. At the same time, novel and complex technical, economic and legal issues of adapting the technologies to different vehicles, and implementing them widely across low Earth orbit will be tackled through the development of a hierarchical, web-based tool aimed at a variety of space actors.
