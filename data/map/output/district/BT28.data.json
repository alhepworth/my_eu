The certainty that the best way to pass on this concern to them is that the students discover for themselves the great range of choices in the rest of the European countries, is the one that inspires us to carry out our new internationalisation strategy promoting our mission, vision and values regarding cooperation and international development. \r\nFrom the Centre, it is more and more evident that, once the vocational training programmes end, there is a lack of awareness about the working systems in other countries among both the students and the teachers which makes it difficult their employability. It has been also discovered that the number of students who start looking for a job actively in a different country is almost insignificant, that there is a low level of foreign language knowledge and a relative lack of motivation in improving these foreign language skills. \r\nAs a consequence of this Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats Analysis (SWOT) and the assessment of the surveys carried out among students and teachers in our centre about the level of satisfaction and quality of our teaching process by means of the Quality Management system ISO-9001, it has been detected that both the students and teachers need to increase their knowledge, expectations and working experience to an international level \r\nHowever, we highlight, as an innovation, that after some years since the implementation of the Bilingual programmes of Microcomputing and Networks, Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations and Maritime Transport and Deep-sea Fishing, the current concerns and the future interests of the students and the teaching staff to gain professional training in productive atmospheres in other countries have been quadrupled. As a result of this evaluation regarding last year and the  publicity campaign of the program carried out by the E+ committee since the beginning of the course, the centre is working hard on applying for more Erasmus mobilities for students, teaching staff and pupils with the certificate in Professionalism, and encourage the rest of the vocational training programmes in the centre. \r\nFor this reason, the Centre needs to meet these needs identified in our analysis by means of your internationalisation project. \r\nThe presence of several collaborating partners throughout out extensive career related to these project guarantees the success in the internship that will take place in the different enterprises in Norway, England, Germany, France and Ireland, and, at the same time, the international character of new dimension will be strongly supported. For this project, we can also take into consideration the support of our new collaborating partner, which is the Ardentia Marine S.L. enterprise (Portugal) that carries out a complete service for the management of Subaquatic operations, the development of maritime rescue operations and the fight against pollution. \r\nIn terms of the activities, fourteen two-month student mobilities (two for each professional family in the centre that will take place during the second course of the Intermediate Vocational Training Programme  and the Certificate of Professionalism, with ages between 16 and 50 years old) will be carried out in entreprises to obtain in-depth knowledge about how they operate and participate in an immersion programme. These mobilities will take place in the Norwegian training ship Statsraad Lehmkuhl, the German training ship Alexander von Humboldt II, the Bergen Maritime Skole regarding Computing, the IMC Diving in Norway for Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations, and the REGibb International which is a leading company in innovating treatments and equipments for personal beauty and hairdressing. In addition, two one-year Erasmus+Pro mobilities will take place thanks to the IMC Diving entreprise which deals with Subaquatic and Hyperbaric operations and is a top company in the field in its country. In fact, IMC Diving has confirmed us its collaboration and interest in this new type of mobilities, describing them as innovating and as a big opportunity for out students. \r\nFinally, five mobilities for the teaching staff will also take place to increase their linguistic skills related to the very technical aspects that are present in our productive sector.

Yet, micro and SMEs, which make up 99% of businesses, still lag behind in digital technologies. If the economy is to flourish, micro and SMEs, must develop data skills or risk being uncompetitive.\r\n\r\nThere is an obstacle: today\u2019s entrepreneurship teachers and trainers also face a data skills deficit. The majority entered the workforce before big data existed and there is currently no reliable source of training to help them boost their own skills. In our survey across 28 Local Enterprise Agencies in the Enterprise NI Network, 52% of business advisors said they were completely unaware of the range of data that is available and 70% rated their own knowledge of smart data as poor. (See full report appended). \r\n\r\nTo remedy this situation, Data SET will improve the quality and relevance of entrepreneurship education by improving the ability of VET and HEI policy makers and practitioners to understand, teach and develop smart data, thus providing business owners, early stage entrepreneurs and students with solid smart data skills training which they will use to help grow their businesses.  \r\n\r\nWe will respond to these needs by pursuing the following objectives: \r\n- develop and publish a Guide to Data Skills Development (IO1) to educate entrepreneurship trainers on the current state of data skills and skills building strategies  \r\n- create a smart data skills training model, comprising OERs (IO2) such as curriculum, trainers guide, lesson plans and suggested content and learning exercises\r\n- train the first generation of Data SET Trainers (learning activity) and widely disseminate the OERs to encourage rapid integration of the training into current entrepreneurship and business support provision\r\n- develop and promote an online Data SET course (IO3) to maximise access to the new training and reinforce classroom delivery.\r\n\r\nData SET will involve at least 60 entrepreneurship educators as participants in the testing of these outputs and we will organize a Train the Trainers Learning Activity in Denmark for 14 educators, who will return to their organizations ready to begin training SMEs and early stage entrepreneurs and students in smart data skills. At least 155 representatives of VET organizations providing entrepreneurship education and relevant stakeholders will participate in five multiplier events in Northern Ireland, Ireland, Spain, Denmark and Netherlands. \r\n\r\nAs tangible results of the project, we expect: \r\n-500 entrepreneurship education teachers and trainers download/receive the OERs and use them to understand smart data skills and have effective pedagogic strategies for teaching and assessing them. \r\n-80 entrepreneurship education organizations, principally in VET but also in HE sectors, commit to introducing smart data skills  into their training programme either through direct classroom or small group delivery or by referring  students to the online course.\r\n-30 stakeholder organizations value smart data skills as a key competence within the framework of VET and driver of economic growth and commit to exploring new ways to support and incentivise  organizations who offer training\r\n\r\nOn completion, the project will have made it possible for current and future generations of entrepreneurs to access effective, practical training on generation, management and analysis of digital data as applied to their business model.

The problem is that our VET institutions are ill-equipped to do so:  most are unspecialized in the specific strategies that are shown to work best with female entrepreneurs; their staff are trained in generic/traditional business models (not STEM) and they are not connected to universities /HE institutions to recruit graduate females emerging from STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nIn this context, WISE has a clear goal: increase the number of female entrepreneurs in STEM by transforming their access to and the quality of the training they receive from entrepreneurship VET institutions.  \r\n\r\nTo do so, we will: \r\na) Establish sustainable, cross-sector collaborative relationships between actors in STEM entrepreneurship development ecosystem via 4 Regional Partnerships leading to 4 WISE Regional Action Plans. \r\nb) Create and publish a WISE Toolkit to facilitate the replication of Regional Partnerships across Europe. \r\nc) Develop, implement and publish a suite of multilingual educational resources entitled Start up in STEM for entrepreneurship VET practitioners to update their knowledge and skills,\r\nd) Design and implement innovative learning placements for 40 young women with STEM start up potential in high growth STEM enterprises (preferably female led.)\r\n\r\nThe project methodology is highly participative at all stages, involving our three main target groups (training providers such as enterprise centres, colleges and incubators; female entrepreneurs and wider stakeholders) in the following ways: \r\n- At least 50 high-level representatives of organizations from VET, entrepreneurship education, and wider economic development will participate in 4 Regional Partnerships\r\n- At least 60 professional entrepreneurship teachers and trainers will be trained using the Start up in Stem open educational resources, benefiting approximately 600 female students \r\n- At least 230 representatives of stakeholder organizations will participate in multiplier events.  \r\n- Approximately 7,500 individuals will engage with the interactive online platform with OER.\r\n\r\nThanks to improved exposure/availability and improved quality of entrepreneurship education opportunities, WISE will generate an increase in the overall number of potential and existing female entrepreneurs engaged in continuing VET and it is more likely that early stage female STEM entrepreneurs grow their ideas into successful STEM enterprises in the short term.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Regional Partnerships and Start up in STEM educational resources, managers, teachers and trainers in VET institutions will overcome existing bias, update their own skills and modify service provision in their institutions to be more inclusive and better support high growth STEM enterprises. \r\n\r\nAt regional level, the project will create a more enabling environment for female entrepreneurs and generate the knowledge sharing and feedback loops which will contribute to ongoing improvement and the development of further initiatives.\r\n\r\nSTEM is a particularly important area of focus across Europe, not only because of the scale of the gender gap, but because of its ability to generate high growth businesses which drive innovation and economic development forward in Europe.   For this reason, we believe WISE will not only generate significant impact at local level through the Regional Partnerships, but will capture the attention of policy makers and actors further up the ladder nationally and across Europe.

It involves 8 partners coming from 6 different countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom). The partners are 3 HEIs, 1 SME, 1 Local Development Agency, 1 Technological Park, 1 Business Advisory/Incubator and 1 expert of VET qualifications. The partnership ensures a very good geographical coverage and puts together complementary competences.\r\n\r\nThe project will be developed in 24 months. At first, after assessing the cloud computing actual uses and business potential, a training needs analysis will state the existing and ideal skills to be acquired, defining the tailor-made learning process.\r\nThe main project outputs are a set of VET qualifications in the area of cloud computing, designed according to the European Lifelong Learning instruments (EQF, ECVET and EQAVET), in order to allow the IN-CLOUD users to acquire certifications that can be spent in the labour market. The qualifications will be at different levels (from EQF4 to EQF7) and will be awarded by the consortium after the successful attendance of training courses, what will be produced during the project.\r\nThe target groups (company employees, public administration employees, researchers, students) will be able to access the training courses at distance by means of the project web-platform and also on the satellite tv.\r\nIn addition to the training courses, the partners will record showcases and video interviews to experts in the sector of cloud computing, to be produced as short video and made available on the project web-site. The aim is to enrich the available didactic material with evidences of real application of the cloud computing technology.\r\nFinally, a virtual bootcamp will be set-up in order to concretely support companies and public administration interested to introduce different kinds of cloud computing in their systems. The virtual bootcamp will be an online application that, identifying the user\u2019s characteristics and needs, will propose a customized guided path, including training activities, learning materials, showcases, hints for potential applications, supporting the customer to identify the specific needed applications/services and the procedures to introduce them in its infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe project will be realized thanks to an accurate planning of the activities, an accurate management and quality assurance and an high commitment of all the partners. The project foresees 4 transnational management meetings and at least 11 virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project will directly impact on the European companies and public administrations, in terms of staff members trained and qualified to use cloud computing technologies and services, of the European Universities, in terms of enhancement of the didactic offer on cloud computing in order to better meet the requests of the labour market, of the students and professionals, in terms of better employability chances. The IN-CLOUD qualifications, designed using the ECVET instrument, will allow the transnational recognition of the acquired competences and will enhance the employability of the qualified users at European level.\r\nThe project long terms benefit will be to speed up and increase the use of cloud computing across all economic sectors, according to the European Cloud Computing Strategy, and to foster a close partnership between Universities and companies on the cloud computing.", "http://www.lisburn-enterprise.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA202-004733_7"], [2017, "Empowering Digital Citizenship through Media Literacy and Critical Thinking", "CANICE CONSULTING LIMITED", 212732.0, 6, 6, "Young people today use the internet to explore, connect, create and learn in ways never imagined. However, digital communications present a paradox:\r\n- too low levels of digital competence accentuate disadvantage and exclusion in the labour market and society.\r\n- too much, uncontrolled, use of digital media can lead to undesirable online behaviours that damage individuals\u2019 interpersonal relations and encourage undemocratic values.\r\nYoung people are particularly vulnerable to both these aspects and are caught in the digital media skills gap \u2013 access to media has grown faster than the ability of our education systems to teach its responsible use.  The consequences of such a vacuum are very concerning in light of the challenges posed to social cohesion by our country\u2019s growing immigrant communities and changing attitudes to multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, EMPOWER is designed with a clear objective: significantly improve young people\u2019s ability to critically assess the online and social media content they consume and create, empowering them to become responsible, confident digital citizens.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we aim to:\r\n- Encourage knowledge sharing and peer learning among education and youth sector stakeholders to develop a Good Practice Catalogue (IO1) of leading and innovative approaches to teaching media literacy and critical thinking as linked to healthy online behavior and active citizenship.\r\n- Create and promote Digital Citizenship Education Toolkit (IO2) comprising open, online resources that Teachers and  Educators can use with young people to explore the topic and strengthen their own skills.\r\n- Develop and widely disseminate a Teachers\u2019 Guide to Digital Pedagogy (IO3) as a user-friendly, interactive online resource to support teaching staff in developing their own digital competences and mainstreaming digital literacy skills in their teaching and youthwork activities.\r\n\r\nThe tangible RESULTS of the project, in the form of intellectual outputs (IOs) and multiplier events, will be supported by 3 horizontal activities which will run throughout the project (Management, Dissemination & Sustainability and Evaluation) which will also produce intangible results as a means to ensuring effective project execution.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these results, the project can be expected to achieve its expected outcomes with target groups and wider stakeholders, including: \r\n- engagement of 50+ wide range of stakeholders engaged in VET, education, youth work, local government and social development policy from an early stage in project through input into O1 and our dissemination \r\n- recruitment of 60 educators and trainers and 60 students/young people who will participate in the development of the EMPOWER course and OERs, they will benefit from completing the course and will provide constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nEMPOWER has been carefully structured to enable young people to critically assess social and digital media and interact more responsibly online. It will do so by increasing the capacity of educators, trainers and youth workers to deliver such education in an engaging and practical manner. \r\n\r\nThe unique structure of the EMPOWER project provides a reliable means of introducing media literacy and digital citizen education for young people across Europe.

By improving the quality and accessibility of formal/non-formal education, VET and youth services at this level, communities will experience an increase in social and knowledge capital, with young people more empowered as leaders of change. Schools, neighbourhoods and communities will experience increase in mental and physical well being as the potential negative aspects of digital and social media usage (confidence erosion, online peer pressure and abuse, increased stress related illness, radicalization etc.) are reduced.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL & EUROPEAN IMPACT\r\nDigital awareness and media literacy is a topic attracting growing interest at national and EU level and so we believe the project will attract a significant degree of attention from policy makers. In reaching them effectively, it can cause: \r\n- a deeper understanding of the best ways to teach media literacy, social engagement and civic participation to different groups of young people and the potential spill over effects in local communities; \r\n- more enlightened and innovative education and youth training/work policies and thus greater sustainability of such services themselves;", "http://www.caniceconsulting.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA202-034537_2"], [2016, "Embedding Entrepreneurship Education", "CANICE CONSULTING LIMITED", 210801.0, 5, 5, "Current EU economic and social policy places a high value on nurturing entrepreneurship among young people.

The majority of the  287,000 EU food companies employing employ 4.25 million people are SMEs or micro-enterprises. While the sector has excellent potential for artisan and specialty producers to establish, the lack of access to food grade workspace is a serious and inhibiting barrier to entry (40% of emerging food producers found the lack of  production space an inhibiting factor to business growth and of concern in terms of business effectiveness).  Artisan food producers struggle to support the capital requirements of setting up a production facility (investing in a food production unit is second only to  the establishment costs of a pharma clean room!).   On the other hand, there is an abundance of underutilized properties in public and private ownership which could be re-imagined as vibrant Food Incubators but the promoters of same lack the skills and practical strategies to develop them. Food incubators have the unique potential to spur productive, inclusive & sustainable economic development. They provide a strong foundation for the creation and expansion of food businesses and jobs by helping communities, VET bodies, development agencies to revitalise underutilised buildings into powerhouses of food sector learning, innovation and production.    At a time of rising social inequality, Food Incubators also offer the prospect of expanding employment  in the growing food sector through educational opportunities for disadvantaged populations.\r\n\r\nFood Incubators Transforming Regions (FITR) seeks to forge an effective & replicable model to provide the learning and strategic structure to develop food kitchens &incubators as enterprise,  training and support drivers at regional level.  The partnership involves 7 partners across 4 counties - UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Slovakia and will run for 24 months.  Its rationale is clear .. while there are many VET responses for food entrepreneurs and SMEs, there is no VET in the theme of training tools for developing regional infrastructure and support structures that will stimulate food economies.    FITR will comprise unique training curriculum and course materials to successfully establish and manage food incubator hubs to cater for the growing numbers of emerging food entrepreneurs who are in urgent need of a place to produce, learn and grow.   It will target community drivers, development agencies and VET bodies.

Firstly, chronic  EU obesity figures (OECD) show that more than half (52%) of the adult population in the EU is overweight or obese.  Secondly, food poverty is on the rise in Europe.  2013 statistics show that 116 million Europeans are now at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 40 million are suffering from severe material deprivation. It is acknowledged that the cheapest food is the unhealthiest food.  These 2 clear challenges represent enterprise opportunities for Food SMEs across the EU to innovate to develop healthier, affordable food and new food distribution channels.

To develop a toolkit to assist & train regional stakeholders to create a Healthy Food Regional Partnership. This toolkit is called the \"Healthy Food Partnership Toolkit\" and will comprise a programme of learning actions and guidance on how to create a healthy food region.\r\n\r\n2.

This course is called \u201cCreative ways to produce, market and distribute healthy food\u201d and will focus on teaching Owners and employees how to implement greater innovation and creativity in their business.\r\n\r\n3. To test an innovative industry based employability training module with a cohort of young unemployed.  This will be industry based learning delivered by Food SME Owners through providing practical placements for learners who will acquire new skills for new employment/self employment. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the project is to provide innovative, easily accessible and career-oriented continuing VET (C-VET) for employees, employers, independent Food entrepreneurs.   However, to provide applied knowledge to the partnership one adult education strand is included providing an opportunity for unemployed young people in competence development.  We focus specifically on how a VET response can be applied in a regional food sector economy.   Why a regional approach? A creative entrepreneurial regional food economy can have profound implications for sustainable economic development. Healthy foods with low food miles represent a very tangible economic opportunity which could reward rural agricultural communities and food firms that can produce healthy, affordable and accessible food products.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project, the 150 learners (100 Employees in Food SMEs and 50 unemployed young people) who participate in the  'Creative Ways to Produce, Market & Distribute Healthy Foods' course and the \u201cApplied industry learning opportunities\u201d will grow confident in their understanding and application of creativity and innovation as relevant to the Food Businesses and will improve the competitiveness of the Business or become self-employed entrepreneurs or gain employment within the food Industry, because their skills and knowledge are more suited. \r\n\r\nA particularly innovative aspect of our proposal is the creation of five Healthy & Creative Food Region Partnerships. This new strategy involves bringing together stakeholders in the food sector, enterprise support, education and economic development - such as VET providers, universities & colleges, food representative bodies, enterprise development agencies and local authorities) - to jointly explore the structural issues behind improving levels creativity and innovation in Food SMEs, inventory existing resources and commit to collaborative actions to address these issues in a DECREE  Action Plan.  We will systematize the process and lessons learned in the form of a DECREE Toolkit, which will be published and actively promoted as a means of replicating the Partnerships in other regions. \r\n\r\nDECREE is delivered by a cross-sectoral partnership led by CIDO, the lead enterprise development body in the Craigavon region, a region known for its food companies & which produces over 40% of all food produced in Northern Ireland (agri-food production is NI\u2019s most important industry).  They will be joined by The Food Hub (Ie) & Satafood (Finland) both Cooperative Agencys specialising in Food VET training and regional economic development programmes.

However, social media is a double-edged sword and our young people are increasingly exposed to online behaviours that erode their confidence, interpersonal relations: online peer pressure and abuse, the search for aesthetic perfection, the over-sharing of personal information, the \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect and risks of radicalization all pose serious risks to the development of positive, confident, active young citizens.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, research shows that the complex social situations presented by social media require young people to have not only basic technical competences but also more highly developed critical thinking skills, as found in a media literacy approach.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the aim of the Healthy Social Media project is clear: improve the ability of young people to critically assess and engage with digital and social media they are consuming and creating to become responsible, confident, digital citizens. \r\nIn order to achieve this, we believe that suppliers of nonformal education to the youth sector have a key role to play.  However, today\u2019s adult youth leaders and trainers are at a disadvantage having grown up in a pre-digital world.  Hence, our project methodology also works to provide them with knowledge, skills and tools to effectively teach social media literacy to the young people they serve. \r\nSpecifically we will: \r\n\u2022 Undertake a thorough Needs Analysis Study to develop an accurate picture of the diverse digital lives of young people, including their motivations, behaviours and understandings. \r\n\u2022 Create a Toolkit of strategies and Open Educational Resources to teach digital citizenship in order to help young people critically assess and understand the implications of the digital footprint they are creating including modules on:  \r\no Defining Digital Citizenship \r\no Privacy & security & safety \r\no Propaganda & radicalization\r\no Self image & identity & social relationships \r\no Digital footprint and reputation \r\no Digital drama/ conflict resolution \r\no Information Literacy and critical thinking\r\n\u2022 Develop a Media Literacy App to provide an accessible and appropriate way for young people to learn or revisit information regarding different themes of the open educational resources. \r\n\r\nHOME will be delivered by six cross sectoral organizations from the community, youth, VET, private and non-profit sector each with a strong track record in youth work, social inclusion and citizenship, and education.

The project positions youth media literacy as a new route to increased citizenship and has the advantage of empowering young people and  acquiring useful transversal skills in the process such as critical thinking, digital awareness and self esteem.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project: \r\n- hundreds of young people (16 \u2013 30 yr olds), the majority from disadvantaged backgrounds, will acquire knowledge and skills to inform their and their peers social media usage,  widening their own confidence, responsibility and skills ultimately useful for employers, and  contributing to the wellbeing of those around them. \r\n- youth workers/educators and community and youth work organizations will adopt new strategies to incorporate new skills teaching, thus enhancing the relevance and quality of their work for problems facing youth in daily lives in today\u2019s society\r\n- those responsible for youth public policy will find new ways of engaging with hard-to-reach young people, often from disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\n- Schools, neighbourhoods and communities will experience increases in social cohesion and potential for future positive change as young people envisage a greater role in society.", "http://www.caniceconsulting.com", "New Lodge and Duncairn Community Health Partnership", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA205-035205_2"], [2015, "Creative Communities Igniting Change", "CANICE CONSULTING LIMITED", 183709.0, 4, 7, "The creative sector has a major role to play in creating entrepreneurial opportunities which tackle discrimination and inequality in the field of entrepreneurship and employment.  A leading driver of dynamic and innovative economies and an area of focus for EU development, it represents 6.8 % of European GDP (approximately \u20ac860 billion) and 6.5% of European employment (approximately 14 million).   Yet for all this potential, there is little opportunity for disadvantage groups to connect with VET in the creative economy as a stepping stone to entrepreneurship. Youth unemployment is a challenge across our partnership - in November 2014 it was 23.2% in Poland, 23% in Sweden, 21.8% in Ireland and a lower 16% in the UK.  It is clear that early school leavers and those of low educational attainment do not have the qualifications or resources to access universities and HEls in this field.  Karen Price OBE explains it clearly-  \u2018There is enormous raw capability in young people \u2026 if we could polish it up. If we could introduce that into our education system \u2026 we would transform the economy.\u201d   But the gap between real world opportunities and teaching is very acute in the creative industries where generic training strategies for creative entrepreneurship do not include community based VET responses.\r\n\r\nCreative Communities Igniting Change has been carefully structured to generate impact for the young unemployed and other socially excluded target groups, the communities that have experienced brain drain and high levels of unemployment and eyesore empty buildings and the VET providers who serve them, by achieving an effective and replicable core model for creative industries training and support within a community environment that provides access to VET for key target groups but also leads to broader economic innovation and revitalisation.\r\n\r\nOver 24 months, CCiC will achieve this in 4 regions in Ireland, UK, Poland and Sweden over 4 key deliverables:-\r\n1)  By establish 4 sustainable, sector specific Regional Alliances  (in Ireland, UK/Northern Ireland, Poland and Sweden) we are forging collaborative relationships between VET providers and HEIs, creative industry bodies, economic actors, local governments and wider stakeholders that will optimise and mobilise the creative sector strategic response at regional level. \r\n2) The resultant 4 Action Plans will improve the quality and relevance of creative industries training and support on offer and provide entrepreneurship pathways.   The creation of a \u201cCreative Communities Igniting Change Toolkit\u201d will facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances of this nature across Europe.  Such is our belief in the innovativeness of this strategic response, that we will commit to ensuring that our Toolkit will be adopted by at least 2 other regions (outside of our partnership) within the lifetime of the project.\r\n3) Create and publish a course curriculum, guiding VET practitioners on the topics and skills most needed by emerging creative entrepreneurs from at risk target groups.   Our blended learning \u201cCreative Business as a Source of Employment\u201d course, will  help potential creative entrepreneurs to set up business in 90 days.

First and foremost, businesses set up by re-starters grow faster than first timers in terms of turnover and jobs created (Stam, Audretsch, Meijaard 2006; Enterprise Europe Network), and approximately one fifth of all successful business people failed first time round.  Secondly, most of the time, business failure is not due to the incompetence of the entrepreneurs.  Thirdly, there is a lot of evidence to show that Europeans as a whole are relatively risk-averse, especially compared to countries such as the USA. In Germany e.g. only 1-2% of new companies per year are founded by second chance entrepreneurs (see KfW-Gr\u00fcndungsmonitor 2013) and the World Bank recently critiqued Poland for its failure to understand the value of second chance entrepreneurs as manifested in its particularly onerous liquidiation procedures (Devictor, 2013).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEU Enterprise and Employment strategy already contains numerous references to second chance policies.

However, the lack of confidence and lack of training in the use of these new platforms is also a cause.  As a result, very few students across Europe are taught by digitally confident and supportive teachers.\r\n\r\nMODERN will increase the ability of VET and HEI educators to pursue innovative teaching strategies supported by the intelligent use of digital learning platforms.   We believe that mainstream digital technology has matured sufficiently so as to allow us to usefully present and rank the tools that exist today (rather than creating new ones), select the most promising in terms of student-centred approaches, and then generate, test and promote: \r\na) an interactive online Toolkit to offer practical guidance for educators wishing to incorporate mobile and digital elearning resources. It will be categorised according to user needs and include an overview of top 20 tools, their pedagogical strengths, validation and assessment options, technical specifications, learner management options and links to best practice and further support.\r\nb) A short \u201cInnovation in Teaching\u201d course. The content is designed to motivate/guide educators to pursue more innovative pedagogic strategies on the basis of mobile and digital resources, 48 of whom will undertake the course during the project lifetime. However, the real value of the course is that each module will be delivered via one of top 5 digital platforms previously identified, hence participants gain confidence in their use and access \u201chow to\u201d guides which allow them to recreate the course in the corresponding platform all by themselves.  \r\n\r\nOur partnership is formed by VET and HEI specialists, from across the profit, non-profit and public sectors.  The project will be led by Canice Consulting, an international consultancy in the field of business VET with a growing specialism in digital elearning and marketing platforms. Two universities will contribute to the research and pilot test phases, Universitat Politecnia de Valencia (represented by their Research Centre on Software Production) and University of Szczecin, while Momentum Marketing and Canice Consulting will share the design, writing and programming of the Toolkit and Innovation in Teaching multi-platform course. Finally, the project will be disseminated and exploited amongst our two target groups \u2013 VET and HEI providers \u2013 by leading pan-European organizations, namely the European Forum of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (EfVET) and the European University Continuing Education Network (EUCEN).\r\n\r\nThe intended direct impact of the project can be summed up in bringing VET and HE educators to the point where they are willing - and able - to \u201cthink mobile first\u201d.  This involves generating greater acceptance of the mobile phone as a learning ally (rather than distraction) and upskilling trainers, teachers and lecturers in their knowledge of available tools and appropriate pedagogical strategies so that they are confident in their ability to select and use appropriate mobile and digital resources in their everyday teaching activities. \r\n\r\nThis will then cause a ripple effect, as adult learners, the majority of whom are young adults, will benefit from a markedly improved learning experience, via improved pedagogical strategies, greater ability to drive their own learning process and increased \u201con-the-go\u201d access to learning especially when outside the classroom.   It will also enable MODERN teachers to boost career progression, and make institutions more competitive in terms of attracting students and producing excellence in results.", "http://www.caniceconsulting.com", "CANICE CONSULTING LIMITED", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013569_coordinator"], [2015, "Creative Entrepreneurs Online", "CANICE CONSULTING LIMITED", 144713.0, 3, 5, "Digital communications are revolutionising our economy and society, enabling disruptive innovation and creating new business models.

The gap between real world opportunities and teaching is most acute in the creative industries where generic online retail strategies do not apply, but new collaborative models abound:  online marketplaces, outsourcing communities, crowdsourcing funding are just some of the many opportunities which facilitate personalised marketing and pricing, while also ensuring secure payment and intellectual property rights. Now, more than ever, the creative and cultural sector can benefit from \u201cgoing digital\u201d\r\n\r\nCreative Entrepreneurship Online (CEO) aims to enable integrated action among VET providers and wider stakeholders to radically improve training for creative sector entrepreneurs, enabling them to harness online business models to grow professionally and increase their commercial success in domestic and international markets.  In order to do so, we will: \r\na) Establish sustainable, cross-sector collaborative relationships between VET providers, HEIs, and wider stakeholders via 3 Regional Alliances to optimise the creative sector knowledge triangle, create 3 Regional Action Plans for improving the quality and relevance of training and support on offer and creative spillovers to other sectors.\r\nb) Create and publish a \u201cCEO Toolkit\u201d to facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances across Europe. \r\nc) Create and publish a course curriculum, guiding VET practitioners on the topics and skills most needed by creative entrepreneurs in today\u2019s digital landscape. \r\nd) Develop an intensive blended learning \u201cBe a CEO\u201d course to help potential creative entrepreneurs to set up online business in 30 days. \r\ne) Trial and publish the course, and engage in dissemination activities to facilitate its inclusion in mainstream VET provision.\r\n\r\nOur unique methodology puts participants and stakeholders at the heart of the project as a means to ensuring immediate results, wide relevance and fulfilment of needs of all parties concerned. Specifically we will test materials thoroughly by training 40+ creative sector entrepreneurs and work directly with the enterprise centres that provide training and support for creative enterprises; and we will build sustainable, synergistic relationships between stakeholders in VET and enterprise education, higher education, creative sector bodies and wider economic stakeholders, through the Regional Alliances. (12+ actors in each region, 36+ in total.)   \r\n\r\nCEO is the first project of its kind to directly address the most recent developments in online business for the creative sector.  This new category of training enables entrepreneurs to identify a much wider range of \u201csellable skills and services\u201d, and to think of ecommerce not as simply selling and shipping a product, but as an evolving marketplace for selling creative services by the hour or by project, for funding new projects, for collaborating at distance with artists, and in doing so, crossing borders seamlessly, as part of a real single market.\r\n\r\nAs a direct result of the project, \r\n- creative entrepreneurs will be equipped to use at least one, if not more online strategies within 30 days, will gain a competitive advantage and are more likely to increase turnover from domestic and international markets. \r\n- VET providers, especially enterprise centres and business development centres, will benefit from an immediate addition to their portfolio of training services and improved staff capacity for training in online business models.\r\n- Universities and colleges will also be able to improve teaching for young, prestart creative entrepreneurs by adopting the curriculum and course. (It will be designed so that training modules can be taught/learnt independently of one another if needed, leading to a flexible needs-based learning).\r\n\r\nOn a wider level, key players in VET / enterprise education, higher education, creative sector and economic development will gain improved understanding of the new parameters of the creative sector, as well as access to specific policy tools and operational strategies that will help enable them to catalyse the evolution of creative enterprises.

Moreover, the consortium will demonstrate scalable and replicable solutions in an integrated environment that enables DSOs to plan and operate the network with a high share of DRES in a stable, secure and economic way, using flexibility inherently offered by specific technologies and by interaction with different stakeholders. To achieve these objectives, a complementary partnership covering the distribution system value chain has been established. The consortium includes three DSOs from different countries and their retailers, innovative ICT companies and equipment manufacturers as well as customers, a start-up in the area of community engagement and excellent R&D institutions. InteGrid\u2019s concepts and approaches are based on the these two elements: 1. the role of the DSO as system optimiser and as market facilitator and 2. the integration of existing demonstration activities in three different regions allowing to move from single solutions to an integrated management at a higher scale while focusing on the scalability and replicability considering current and evolving market (and regulatory) conditions.  The three conceptual pillars \u2013 proactive operational planning with DER, business models for flexible DER, information exchange between different power system actors \u2013 offer an opportunity to maximize the economic, societal and environmental gains from the combined integration of DRES and flexible DER.

As we are language teachers, we will mainly focus on apps, programs and pedagogies related to our discipline. We also want to create an online platform where anybody interested in the subject could share his views and experiences.-Context/background: The different schools involved in this project are already using IT tools in their classrooms. Although we are at different levels of integration of these tools, we have the same goal in mind. We want to keep our students at the center of their learning process and we want to help them integrate IT tools in this process as best as we can. Our different pedagogical teams already use IWBs and iPads and some of our colleagues have already followed a special iPad training. We also have  \"digital coordinators\" and network administrators who work hard to familiarize a maximum of our colleagues with present digital practices. Some of the partner schools are already part of an iPad 1:1 program.-Objectives:We want to learn and share a maximum of information about IT tools in the language classroom.We want to centralize that information and make it available to a maximum of people.We want to study if IT tools can improve student motivation.-Participants:Our project will gather four partners. Each country will designate a delegation of approximately four students (ages 12-16) who will have the opportunity to visit all the partner countries once. Each partner country will also designate a team of teachers in charge of the project's coordination. The standard delegation will consist of four students and two teachers. Under these conditions, the envisioned total number of participants will amount to a maximum of 24 people for each meeting.-Activities:Online meetings & communication, social activities.On-the-spot lessons: students will be gathered in groups depending on the host school's policy. They will experience how digital resources are used in different environments and will have the opportunity to give their opinion on the different lessons they have attended.At the end of the project, a general conclusion will be redacted using the most relevant information provided by the partners and the participating students.-Methodology:With precise task allocation, goal-setting and reverse-scheduling, our project will be well-structured from the start. We want to be efficient and transparent. A permanent monthly evaluation will be set up to leave a trace of our progress but also to help us identify our less efficient tactics so we can correct them in the process. As for interpersonal communication, a written moral agreement will be elaborated between the partners before the projects starts. Doing so, we will start on a solid basis and agree on important points such as transparency and eventual conflict resolution techniques. What is more, after every session abroad, we will evaluate the session together and discuss any conflicts or misunderstandings that have arisen before they take a scale that could be detrimental to the project.-Expected results:Better knowledge and use of IT tools in language learningOpen access online database with tutorials and resources about IT tools in language learningMedium to large-scale communication and publicity about our projectImproved image of our schools and partnersGood memories and international relationshipsPotential inspiration for other projects-Potential long term benefits:Better learning practicesLong-term online resource exchangeImproved student motivation/results/attendanceDissemination activities/trainings", "http://www.wallacehigh.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE01-KA219-016272_3"]]}}}}
