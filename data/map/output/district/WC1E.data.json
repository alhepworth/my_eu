The resulting long-lasting decrease of energy supply damages neurons. I have shown that a major cause of no-reflow lies in pericytes: during ischaemia they constrict and then die in rigor.

My group is world-leading in developing a method called Coherent X-ray Diffraction (CXD).  Our CXD strain images of a Pb nanocrystal were published in Nature in 2006.  CXD is sensitive to strain because the X-ray diffraction pattern surrounding a Bragg peak can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.

However, the number of clinician-scientists is declining due to the failure to retain them in the academic and industrial workforce.

I Creativity holds a strong position in early childhood and primary education, while it appears to be under greater pressure in the more formal educational environment of secondary education. It is therefore necessary to exploit, support and sustain the creative potential that is found in young children. \r\nScience education features highly in European education policy. Major EU reports urge countries to ensure that science education engages students before the age of 14 with science and scientific phenomena, through extended investigative work and \u2018hands-on\u2019 experimentation. The adoption of inquiry-based activities in science education is viewed as the only way forward (Rocard et al., 2007), as it is widely accepted that effective science education based on inquiry can lead to wonderment, and is fuelled by curiosity.\r\nSchool in Europe today would benefit considerably from acknowledging and fostering the link between science education, and creativity. Science education could (and should) be more creative. In the teaching and learning of science, a more creative approach based on curiosity and inquiry would be beneficial, involving, for instance, a move away from the pedagogy of the \u2018correct answers\u2019, which makes pupils believe that it is wrong to be wrong, and become progressively less willing and able to take risk and to unlock their creativity. Further, in a more creativity oriented science education, new modes of interactions within the classroom could be developed to stimulate self-expression \u2013 which, if nurtured, could manifest itself subsequently in later years in terms of an ability to create and innovate. Such a major shift towards more creativity in science education, though, both in terms of fostering creativity in science and teaching science creatively, would require a profound change in educational practices and cultures, demanding the development not only of new curricula, but most importantly of appropriate teacher training and professional development.\r\nThe CEYS project is a timely response to the aforementioned needs, at the European level, aiming at the development of a teacher development course and accompanying materials to be used in European  professional development to promote the use of creative approaches in teaching science in preschool and early primary education, in the frame of inquiry-based educational environments. \r\nThe CEYS project brings together a consortium of five distinguished partners from four countries across Europe. More specifically, the project brings together three internationally recognised universities (AUC, IOE, OU), a science education centre in a leading science research institute (INFLPR), and a distinguished educational research department operating within a school (EA) and thus providing close interaction with teachers, students and classrooms. This consortium has all the characteristics necessary to guarantee the successful and efficient realisation of the project activities.\r\nThe overall aim of the CEYS project is to adapt, test, implement and disseminate a new training framework (including an appropriate curriculum, training activities that include good in-school practices, as well as a variety of supporting material) that will support the training of teachers to use creativity and inquiry-based approaches in the teaching of science.

This will make goals of inquiry-based science learning more likely to be realized and achieve meaningful impact for a critical mass of teachers, and consequently students, across the EU.

Education outcomes need to be improved according to the 2013 monitoring report, and schools need to continuously improve their provision and quality of teaching to meet these goals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur previous work shows that Inspectorates of Education have an important role in driving school improvement, particularly in schools performing below inspection targets. Inspectorates of Education are however less well equipped to contribute to innovative and localized problem solving; their centralized top down approach enhances and legitimizes a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 strategy for success to national standards, encourage risk averse behavior in schools and window-dressing of successful rituals (see O\u2019Day, 2002). Also inspection feedback is often distant (in time) from the behavior the feedback is related to and therefore does not contribute to the trialing and testing of new solutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany countries recognize the need to reshape their inspection systems and redefine the role of Inspectorates of Education to better fit localized decision-making and local structures and networks for improvement. These models are described as polycentric school inspections. Polycentric school inspections evaluate and assess the quality and functioning of networks of schools and/or their stakeholders, with the purpose of validating and supporting school to school improvement and cooperation at the local level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop and test these polycentric models of school inspections and specifically look at the mechanisms and context of their impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants \r\n\r\nA preliminary scoping exercise identified examples of polycentric school inspections in the Netherlands, England and Northern Ireland and examples being developed in Bulgaria.

Within different cultural and national contexts, a loss of authority, of bearings, and of moral values, inducing new relationships between generations and within education, is acknowledged, whereas the school as agent of transmission of the knowledge is questioned (School inequalities, dropping out, problematic school inclusion, lack of integration of migrant children, school/family tensions). There is also the expression of particularisms against the backdrop of a receding secular principle, bringing new communitarian claims into the public realm of education that are liable to threaten children\u2019s integration in the educative system and to draw them away from school. Contemporary uneasiness regarding education resonates strongly within our societies, especially as we cannot but witness the concurrent absence of prospects for our youth. Socio-cultural determinism seems more powerful than ever.  \r\nEducators are often distraught, even professionally suffering, and deplore the lack of training adapted to this context, especially as they intervene with very vulnerable and precarious populations.

The European Commission\u2019s Education and Training 2020 Strategy (ET2020) recognises the need to improve the quality and relevance of teaching and learning in higher education (HE), to modernise and digitise educational systems. We need to design future-looking, digitally rich, flexible courses (module), mobile-ready and attuned to students\u2019 expectations for engaging, professionally related learning experiences (e.g. UK Open University \u201cInnovating Pedagogy 2016\u201d).  Yet we know only a few pioneering academics currently have the design skills, technology knowledge and above all time to remodel their programmes to the creative standards they would like and the future of education demands. \r\n\r\nDeep sector change must by definition engage mainstream teachers, but course redesign processes, while effective, generally demand too much time and support to be scalable.  This contradiction frustrates educational ambition at all policy levels. Recognising the need for a radical rethink, the highly experienced digital education team at University College London (UCL) developed high-energy hands-on learning design workshop locally called ABC with a focus on blended (ICT-rich) learning. The key to this approach is pace, engagement and collaboration. In just 90 minutes using a \u2018rapid prototyping\u2019 format teaching teams work together to create a visual \u2018storyboard\u2019 outlining the type and sequence of learning activities (both online and offline) required to meet the course\u2019s learning outcomes. ICTs, assessment methods, cross-program themes and institutional policies are all integrated into the process. \r\n\r\nExtensive testing at UCL and other institutions has shown high levels of transferability, academic enthusiasm and satisfaction. ABC to VLE has grown from that experience and is an ambitious transnational project to further test, refine and expand this rapid-design format in other institutions taking into account cultural issues, localisation and language, alignment with local institutional strategies and technologies, alignment with quality and other policies, diverse delivery and evaluation approaches and localised support capacity. \r\n\r\nThe eleven partner institutions cover a broad range of contexts, representing ten countries, ten languages and a variety of supported educational technologies, meaning this project will provide outputs relevant to a large proportion of European universities, as well as being of benefit to those further afield.\r\n\r\nThe primary outcome is the development of a learning design and staff development online/downloadable \u2018pack\u2019 including contents, and methods for localisation, training or cascading (i.e. run locally). The pack will be validated in three ways, firstly by co-development by the project team, secondly by longitudinal case studies by the project partners in their own educational contexts, tracking the intervention though development to the student experience in order to refine the process and thirdly by the initiation and engagement of a transnational community of practitioners who will use and feedback on the pack throughout the project.

The result will be to ensure the acquisition of key competences with a focus on entrepreneurship which is seen as a key competence itself in the European strategic framework ET 2020.  A strategic game will be the core of the SUSEN learning arrangement. Students of 7th-8th grade to assume the role of a manager/entrepreneur in the market of energy provision and collaborate in teams. The game-character of SUSEN will typically raise motivation so the learning topic has the maximum impact with the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium selected the energy sector as a focus for the project to combine entrepreneurship education with education for sustainable development. Energy provision, energy mix and energy consumption are central issues for sustainable trajectories in times of climate change. Sustainability comprises not only environmental but also economic and social factors to consider. The game brings together economic questions of entrepreneurial success with questions of corporate citizenship and personal civic engagement.  As a consequence, the learning programme will combine a classroom game with elements of service learning. Participating students have the opportunity to learn outside the confines of school. Students will be confronted with tasks that require contacts with utility companies as well as with nonprofit/community organisations. With this enrichment of traditional game construction the partners intend to sensitise students not only for community but also to create opportunities and preparing young people for when they leave school. It will also engender cooperation between schools and business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SUSEN game-based learning is innovative according to the mentioned combination of learning topics with their particular learning goals: education for sustainable development, entrepreneurship education, and civic education. Far more, it will support collaboration strategies between the game players besides strategies to succeed in a competitive environment. It fosters creativity and design thinking, self-efficacy and self-efficiency. Last but not least it requires transversal competences like a sense of initiative, learning to learn and digital competences. For this reason the consortium adopted a blended learning concept creating an online companion to accompany the game which is appealing to the younger audience offering  \u2018auditory\u2019 and \u2018visual\u2019 learning styles. \r\n\r\nTeachers are the multipliers of the SUSEN game development programme with its ambitious objectives as they will be paramount in its success in supporting the core objective. Firstly, the partners develop a \u2018self-starting\u2018 teacher support pack comprising all the required information, materials, and tools teachers need to implement the game in their lessons. Secondly, they develop a one day teacher training course providing future users with a syllabus and training materials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reach these objectives the consortium analyses at the first phase the learner\u2019s needs according to the different topics and main learning goals.  Simultaneously analysing the relevant curricula to ensure the intended programme is embedded more effectively in schools' regular processes. Regional/national differences are considered in game construction by adaption of rules. The partners develop the game rules, define players' roles, and identify relevant stakeholders (experts) who accompany the game development critically. The classroom game and the online companion will be piloted by schools in different programme partner countries. The evaluation of the whole programme leads to a final version of the game and the online companion. At this stage the teacher support pack will be developed as well as a syllabus and material to train teachers. This will be tested and evaluated in several multiplier events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium of six partners from Germany, UK, Poland, Belgium, and Switzerland were selected for its breadth of relevant knowledge and skills and partners' experiences referring to the topics entrepreneurship, sustainability and civic education as well as their experiences in proceeding EU projects.

Together with the increasing number of multi-faith classrooms, this emphasises the need to equip prospective teachers and teacher educators, and thereby also pupils, with adequate interreligious and intercultural skills and competences that allow them to navigate such complex and diverse contexts and cope with the resulting implications for the individual life-styles. Subjects like Religious Education (RE) or Ethics play an important role in facilitating the discussion of these issues and offering answers and explanations.\r\n\r\nRE in public schools in Europe is designed in many ways. Each country\u2019s respective situation and form of organization differs significantly for mainly historical reasons. Despite the different contexts, an increasingly widespread discussion about the possible future of RE takes place. These discussions, however, are rarely linked together and have not yet reached the level of teacher education and training. Future religion teachers are normally only rather superficially familiar with the situation of RE (and related subjects) in other European countries and thus insufficiently prepared for a joint European perspective.\r\n\r\nIn addition, RE is faced with growing religious and ideological diversity of pupils and stakeholders alike across the entire European area. Current changes to the curricula and school structure, as well as wider debates on religion in the public sphere, have produced noticeable controversy about the place of RE in schools, how it should be delivered and what young people should be taught. \r\nIn the three-year Erasmus+ project \"Religious Education and Diversity - Sharing experiences of and approaches to teacher education in the context of 'Education and Training 2020' (READY)\", teacher training institutions in Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Scotland and Sweden will therefore explore the topic \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 in two respects: the mutual exchange of diverse forms of Religious Education and the variety of approaches to subject teaching and learning, in which the question of religious heterogeneity will be considered and discussed. The results will be examined and proposals for teaching Religion and Diversity in Europe will be published.\r\n\r\nMain target group of the project are teacher trainees for Religious Education. The project begins with a structured online communication between three pairs of trainee teachers from two European countries. This process leads to the development of a joint educational module on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 between the two teacher education institutions. At the same time, profile descriptions of the situation of religion teacher education in the participating countries are exchanged, an interactive READY website is set up, which begins to unfold the diversity of RE across Europe, and a guideline for one week study visits is developed.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of the project, groups of five teacher educators and trainee teachers observe RE lessons in a European partner country for a week and hold discussions with trainee teachers, pupils and stakeholders responsible for RE. These experiences are analysed on the basis of a practical guide to European RE, processed and documented.  In parallel to these exchanges, local model RE lessons on \u2018Religion and Diversity\u2019 are systematically evaluated and their delivery in the classroom also partly videotaped. The pupils are encouraged to establish eTwinning contacts with a RE class in a partner country and in this way deepen their knowledge and experience of religious diversity across Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the entire project is designed to achieve broad dissemination and a long-term impact, which is facilitated by the experience, expertise, contacts and structures of the Comenius Institute M\u00fcnster. This includes, inter alia, a READY Newsletter, an interactive READY website, two national study days in T\u00fcbingen and London, a two-day final conference in Vienna and a documentation of key project results in book form.\r\n\r\nREADY focusses mainly on issues of didactics and pedagogy.

This means there are over 80 million people who are often unable to fully participate in society and the economy due to physical or social barriers. It is essential that people with disabilities participate fully in economic and social life to generate a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.\r\nProviding training to future professionals in matters of disability is a way to establish the bases of an inclusive society that undoubtedly would imply a great advance in inclusion and equality. Hence, an innovative project aimed at raising equality and improving the future conditions of people in a situation of disability, needs to be focused on the training of tomorrow professionals, empowering university students for the future changing ecosystem. Bringing these challenges closer to universities is the best way to ensure considerable improvements in the well being of people with disabilities in the near future. \r\n\r\nMAIN IDEA\r\nIn order to bring the societal challenges faced by people with disabilities closer to universities and in line with European Regulations, it is necessary to complement the programmes of the different university degrees with training courses on the specific needs people in any situation of disability may have in every societal aspect taking into consideration the \u201cdesign for all\" (D4ALL) and Universal Accessibility concepts, in a way of ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities.

For the students and teachers at Hof, developments in information technology and communication has opened new opportunities and could possibly keep the school open in the future, and thus, allow young people and families to receive fundamental education in this remote part of the country. In Hof, flipped learning could transform the way students receive their education as well as how the teaching takes place.

This can involve both \r\na) the use of serious games based on gamification as a design approach which leverages, based on expert knowledge and the literature base, understanding about technology design which effectively engages, motivates and guides participants towards learning outcomes based on gamification principles. In relation to children with special needs, the learning outcome can be wider than that considered for typical groups and may relate to social and life skills development as well as to emotional and social aspects.

Before attending Berufskolleg Hilden these students decided to work in very different professional areas and have reached different qualifications and certificates. The above mentioned project includes two different activities matching the two different sections. At a very early stage all students are informed about the possibility of internships abroad. Their interest is also aroused by separate informative meetings held by former interns reporting about their experiences in foreign countries. They get information about current partners of the Berufskolleg Hilden and about organisational and financial aspects. At the same time the existing contacts are carried on to emerge the current data according to supervisors and contact persons. The individual facts are directly given to the participants in order to start a personal contact and relationship to the tutors at an early stage.

The research is motivated by the importance of early years to human development, both because of the long run consequences of events during that period and because of high malleability across key developmental domains during that period, making it particularly salient for policy interventions. The research is organized into three parts. First, we need to understand the process of formation of human capital, what economists refer to as the production function of human capital. Human capital is understood as a multidimensional object whose components (cognition and intelligence, socio-emotional skills, health) evolve in a complex way interacting with a variety of inputs and environmental factors. Disentangling the role played by different factors and inputs (including initial conditions, environmental shocks, parental inputs, centre based care) is important for our understanding of the process and for policy analysis. Second, we need to understand parental behaviour, as parents choose many of the investments in human capital development. Many questions are open: what are the constraints (resources, information, beliefs and attitudes) that parents face in making investment choices? Do parents make optimal choices? Do parents reinforce or compensate shocks? How are resources allocated across children of different gender and/or ability? Who makes decisions within the family? Third, measurement and the design of measurement tools is central to our research. We need to examine the performance of existing measurement tools and propose, design and validate new ones. The research, led by an economist, is interdisciplinary, using inputs from psychologists, child development specialists, geneticists, anthropologists and is organized around a unified framework, whereupon parents make choices taking into account the production function and a number of constraints", 1553302.0, 1553302.0, 1, 1, "HKADeC", null, "http://www.ifs.org.uk", null, "h2020_205897_998931027"], [1285891200000, 1456704000000, "Microeconomic Analysis of Prices, Food and Nutrition", "Institute for Fiscal Studies", "Diet-related chronic diseases are a major public health concern.  Addressing this concern is a key government policy objectives. Poor diet is one important cause, and a number of policies are aimed at improving diet. The impact of these policies on diet, and thus on health outcomes, will depend crucially on how consumers adapt their food purchasing behaviour in response to the policy, and on how firms in turn respond in terms of the prices they set and the foods they offer.  This proposal sets out an ambitious programme of research that aims to provide a deeper understanding of consumer food purchasing behaviour and firm food pricing behaviour, and their impact on nutrition, taking account of the fact that these markets are typified by oligopolistic competition. This research agenda is made possible by rich new household level data on prices and nutrients.  The research will comprise five inter-related projects. The first two projects will develop a set of models and econometric tools which will produce interesting results in their own right, but will also provide key inputs into the other three projects. Each project seeks to make fundamental advances on the existing literature, and addresses an important policy question. The projects are linked since they will utilise related modelling tools, econometric methods and data. Together these projects will provide a more comprehensive analysis of policy options in the area of food and nutrition than would be possible with independent projects.

First, researchers are increasingly aware of the trade-off between credibility and the strength of the assumptions maintained, eloquently termed as the law of decreasing credibility by Charles F. Manski. This trend has led to recent intensive research in partial identification. Second, applied empirical research is increasingly based on data collected for study by individual researchers, quite often through laboratory or field experiments. Third, high-dimensional data are more readily available than ever before, and have received growing attention in economics. In view of these observations, there is a call for research to improve standard econometric practice by facing identification problems upfront, by providing econometrically sound guidelines for data collection, and by making use of the increasing availability of high-dimensional data without sacrificing the credibility of econometric methods. This research project aims to contribute to advances in microeconometrics by considering the issues of identification, data collection, and high-dimensional data carefully. The proposed research builds on semiparametric and nonparametric approaches to increase the credibility of proposed econometric methods. In particular, the proposed research will: (1) develop identification results of practical value and characterize optimal data collection for applied researchers; (2) make advances in estimation, inference, and testing in a variety of microeconometric models; (3) produce credible evidence in applied microeconometric research; (4) develop computer software that implements newly available microeconometric techniques.", 1111640.0, 1111640.0, 1, 1, "ROMIA", null, "http://www.ifs.org.uk", null, "h2020_198612_998931027"], [1472688000000, 1630368000000, "Empirical evidence on the formation of habits, self-control and non-separabilities in food choices", "Institute for Fiscal Studies", "The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of individual choices over which foods to purchase.

The food market is a good place to study these questions for a number of reasons. First, people make decisions with high frequency and in different economic conditions, which helps provide variation needed for identification of key parameters of interest. Second, we observe the same individuals making choices both for immediate consumption and for future consumption, which will also help us with identification. Third, the food industry is of considerable policy interest. People in developed countries are getting fatter at an alarming rate.

Due to the relatively low EVD incidence rates, this evolved into a cluster randomized design to enrol larger numbers (~400,000), which could be implemented in the event of a flare up in the epidemic. In view of the decline in the epidemic and the confirmation of the possibility of a conditional or accelerated licensure approval pathway by the health authorities, the clinical development plan aims to generate a solid data package consisting of substantial immunogenicity and safety data complemented with animal immunogenicity and efficacy data. These data could support the efficacy assumptions of the candidate vaccines by showing an association between the immune response in humans and that observed in non-human primates in which protection from fatal EVD was shown. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient EVD cases to demonstrate efficacy/effectiveness, the trial design will be adapted to focus on safety and immunogenicity and in adults and children.

In this ERC award I will challenge current paradigms by exploring the implications of new empirical insights from basic science on our understanding of TB epidemiology and its control using mathematical modelling techniques.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the prevailing paradigm of TB natural history is overly simple, and one of the key drivers of inaccuracy in projections made by mathematical models thus far. Current models of disease typically account for two distinct stages of infection and disease, with mostly one-directional progression between them. Instead, data has shown that individuals experience a range of stages of disease intensity. Moreover, over time individuals can move between stages through a dynamic interplay between immune induced repression and disease progression.\n\nIn this ERC award I will first focus on collating the best available data to parameterize a new mathematical model of TB with unprecedented flexibility to capture the required trends. I will settle on the best model structure and understand its behavior. In the second stage, I will use the model to explore critical questions in two areas of TB research that require the detail of the new paradigm: the challenge of addressing latent tuberculosis infection; and incorporating the impact of changes in socio-economic indicators on TB trends.\n\nThe consequences of such a paradigm shift to better reflect new insights from basic science and epidemiology are important. Initial modelling of intermediate disease states and the potential for progression and regression suggests that the projected impact of diagnostic strategies is substantially reduced, both in the immediate and longer-term.", 1306499.0, 1306499.0, 1, 1, "TBornotTB", null, "http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_213390_999912667"], [1433116800000, 1590883200000, "Translational regulation in the persistence and drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes human tuberculosis but can also persist for decades as an asymptomatic latent infection. The mechanisms underlying persistence are poorly understood, and the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis makes the development of effective new treatments an urgent challenge. Understanding the ability of M. tuberculosis to switch between replicating and non-replicating states during infection and disease is central to the search for improved treatments. \nThe number of copies of a protein produced by a cell is generally viewed as being determined by the number of mRNA transcripts, but recent findings suggest that \u2018specialised ribosomes\u2019 can modify proteome profiles by preferential translation of particular mRNA subsets, particularly in response to stress. mRNA molecules contain specific signals that optimise their interaction with ribosomes; known as leader sequences, these include the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence required for canonical translation initiation in bacteria. I recently demonstrated that M. tuberculosis expresses an unexpected number of leaderless mRNA transcripts that lack the SD sequence. In Escherichia coli, only a few leaderless transcripts have been described and they are selectively translated by specialised ribosomes. I propose to test the hypothesis that differential translation of mRNA subsets contributes to M. tuberculosis persistence and drug susceptibility.\nI will investigate the importance of selective translation of leaderless and SD mRNAs in the context of adaptation to stress and drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, using cutting-edge experimental techniques combined with bioinformatic analyses.

Information on this phase, however, is partial and indirect, with fundamental gaps in our knowledge of its role in limiting transmission, in determining the efficacy of infection control strategies, and in governing later infection. \n\nMathematical modelling, when combined with statistical inference, is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and prediction using incomplete information.

The theoretical rationale derives from a hypothesis emerging from evolutionary biology that humans are  cooperative breeders : mothers need help from others to raise children, because human children are too costly for mothers to raise alone. The support of relatives, particularly intergenerational support, is thus vital to women in determining how many children they have.

The objectives of the project are, first, to provide an unconventional interpretative angle to the study of the transmission of Stoic ideas; second, to show their intertwinement with religious models of self-analysis and, most of all, to highlight the combined influence of Stoic and Reformed models of introspection on Bacon's natural philosophy. We argue that Stoic materialism, from its inception, entailed the view that human appetites could not be explained and tamed without connecting them to the very appetites of nature. Our reconstruction of varieties of British medicine of the mind, permeated by Stoic ideas, will throw much needed light on the way in which Bacon looked for a new method that could allow man to master both the appetites of matter and the appetites of society.

This issue is pivotal to understanding the history of sciences and ideas, and the role of the Arab-Muslim world in this transfer to Medieval Europe. Its relevance today also lies in the fact that it addresses questions of cultural and religious identities, since the formative stage of philosophy in al-Andalus proved decisive in shaping the intellectual background of many later authors from the Peninsula, whether Muslims, Jews, or Christians. At the crossroads of major lines of enquiries in scholarship and in line with recent discoveries having important chronological implications, PhilAnd focuses on the 10th century, a period usually disregarded by historians on the assumption that philosophy as such was not cultivated in the Iberian Peninsula before the 11th-12th centuries.

Disordered body representations are central to several serious psychiatric and neurological disorders. Thus, identifying factors which contribute to the formation and maintenance of body representations is crucial for understanding how body representation goes awry in disease, and how it might be corrected by potential novel therapeutic interventions. Several types of sensory signals provide information about the body, making the body the multisensory object, par excellence. Little is known, however, about how information from somatosensation and from vision is integrated to construct the rich body representations we all experience. This project fills this gap in current understanding by determining how the brain builds body representations (BODYBUILDING). A hierarchical model of body representation is proposed, providing a novel theoretical framework for understanding the diversity of body representations and how they interact. The key motivating hypothesis is that body representation is determined by the dialectic between two major cognitive processes. First, from the bottom-up, somatosensation represents the body surface as a mosaic of discrete receptive fields, which become progressively agglomerated into larger and larger units of organisation, a process I call fusion. Second, from the top-down, vision starts out depicting the body as an undifferentiated whole, which is progressively broken into smaller parts, a process I call segmentation. Thus, body representation operates from the bottom-up as a process of fusion of primitive elements into larger complexes, as well as from the top-down as a process of segmentation of an initially undifferentiated whole into more basic parts.

By adopting a richer logical framework than usual, the paradoxes can be transformed from threats to valuable sources of insight. When discovered at the turn of the previous century, the paradoxes caused a foundational crisis in mathematics. Many logicians and philosophers now believe the crisis has been resolved. This project denies that an acceptable resolution has been found and aims to do better. A strong push remains towards paradox. This push arises from the widespread use of (and need for) higher-order logics (HOL), which allow quantification into the positions of predicates or plural noun phrases. Phase I seeks to reveal greater similarities between HOL and set theory than generally appreciated. Phase II explores four arguments that HOL collapses to first-order logic, i.e. that every higher-order entity defines a corresponding first-order entity. These arguments are generally ignored as they threaten to reintroduce the paradoxes. But we show that a properly circumscribed form of collapse is a valuable source of mathematical and semantic insight. Phase III examines controlled forms of collapse using notions of modality and groundedness.

However, the mechanisms that drive this process are not fully understood. A recent experimental assay has measured the insertion of designed peptide sequences into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via the cellular translocon machinery. This has provided the first quantitative estimate of the translocon-to-membrane transfer free energy of polypeptide segments. However, no suitable experimental setup currently exists that allows the direct measurement of the free energy change involved in transferring peptides from water into lipid bilayers. This is because peptides that are hydrophobic enough to insert into membranes generally aggregate in solution. I propose an experimental peptide setup that directly measures the water to bilayer partitioning of a series of designed peptides that do not have this problem. These will be derived by minor re-engineering of pHLIP, a peptide based on helix C of bacteriorhodopsin. This peptide has a set of unique properties that make it ideal for the proposed study. It is soluble at neutral pH and spontaneously inserts into lipid bilayers when the pH is lowered. Remarkably, the peptide partitions as a monomer, without disrupting the bilayer, and has been shown not to aggregate either in solution or inside the bilayer. For theoreticians the proposed direct measurements are highly desirable, since they allow the calibration of current computer simulation models under identical conditions. Recent advances in algorithms and computer hardware have enabled fully converged simulations of the adsorption, folding and insertion of peptides into lipid bilayers.

While doubt is considered a rational virtue, waiting until complete certainty before accepting and acting upon a given hypothesis is unreasonable in many contexts. Given some evidential support for the hypothesis, the threshold beyond which acceptance rather than doubt is the reasonable option seems to depend on the decisional context (particularly the cost of a possible error): jurors in criminal trials should thoroughly consider alternative scenarios before convicting a defendant; doctors or policy-makers, however, may have to take action upon less strongly confirmed hypotheses, depending on the relative costs and benefits of action/inaction. Such a decision-theoretic view of reasonable doubt relies on the assumption that the consequences of an hypothesis are exogenous to the rational evaluation of its evidential support: one first updates one\u2019s degree of belief in view of the evidence, and then assesses whether, given the context, the hypothesis is beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. should be accepted and acted upon). But is it the case that agents\u2019 degrees of confidence in a hypothesis, and their weighing of various pieces of evidence, are impermeable to the decisional context? Is the juror\u2019s actual belief independent from her having to bring a consequential verdict?

Up to date 7 different types of secretion systems involved in assembling such structures are defined. However, recent data on the CupB secretion system described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicate that this is the first time a hybrid secretion system is described, as it contains proteins of both the type Vb Two-Partner-Secretion (TPS) System (adhesin CupB5) and the CU type Chaperon-usher pathway system (CupB3). The proposed research focuses on the CupB pathway components CupB1-6, especially on the hybrid CupB3 and CupB5 proteins, where the so-called P-usher (CupB3), a pore-forming beta-barrel, transports the CupB5 adhesin to cell surface. CupB5 is a TpsA-like adhesin which normally is transported to cell surface through a cognate TpsB-like protein (TPS system). Yet, the CupB system lacks a TpsB-like protein and the P-usher exerts the transporter role. The clue is that the P-usher has a N-terminal POTRA domain, normally found in TpsB-like proteins, which is the site of interaction/recognition of the adhesin CupB5. This is an extraordinary case, where the P-usher is not only able to transport its cognate and fimbriae forming pilin-subunits (CupB1), but also the non-fimbrial CupB5 adhesin. The way the recognition/transport between non-cognate CupB3 and CupB5 proteins is managed will be assessed from a structural point of view using different biochemical (protein purification and characterization) and biophysical techniques, integrating in an ultimate hybrid approach both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electronmicroscopy to determine the dynamics of interaction of the CupB system in a close-to-nature fashion.", 143803.0, 143803.0, 1, 1, "P-USHER", null, "http://www.bbk.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/144504.jpg", "fp7_96384_999833903"], [1288569600000, 1383177600000, "Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on Movable Cultural Assets. \u2013 Innovative Research for Market Transfer", "Birkbeck College - University of London", "The MEMORI proposal will provide the conservation market with innovative measurement technology, improved pollution effects knowledge and evaluation and control methods for the reduction of gaseous pollutant impact on movable cultural assets, - facilitating increased and safe use of protective enclosures for cultural heritage (CH) objects located indoors in new or rebuilt buildings for collections, to satisfy demands for energy saving to mitigate climate change.

However, theoretical considerations as well as experimental evidence suggest that fluid-induced metamorphic recrystallisation may be orders of magnitude more important than thermal diffusion in many if not most field settings. This simple concept may explain the irregular release spectra observed in many stepwise heating experiments. The proposed research will develop a radically new approach to argon geochronology, inspired by a technological breakthrough which occurred in U-Pb geochronology in the mid-1990s. At that time, it was found that the discordance of zircons suffering from common Pb or apparent Pb-loss is greatly reduced by stepwise dissolution in hydrofluoric acid. Acid etching may be equally effective at removing compositionally distinct zones in other minerals as well. In fact, several workers successfully removed excess argon from plagioclase and K-feldspar by partially dissolving them in acid during the 1980s. The proposed research will revisit and extend these earlier experiments. The idea is to subject several aliquots of a well-characterised mineral separate to different degrees of dissolution. Plotting the 40Ar/39Ar ages of these aliquots against their respective degrees of dissolution will yield an age spectrum just like those obtained by stepwise heating experiments. Alternatively, by measuring the Ar content in absolute abundance units and determining the K-content of the acid, an age spectrum can be obtained without the need for neutron irradiation. Thus, the stepwise dissolution technique has the potential to revive conventional K-Ar geochronology and solve the problems of excess argon and non-Arrhenian diffusion behaviour that have plagued the 40Ar/39Ar community for decades.", 99650.0, 468376.0, 1, 2, "KARSD", null, "http://www.bbk.ac.uk", null, "fp7_98484_999833903"], [1275350400000, 1338422400000, "Coordination and Support Action for Global RFID-related Activities and Standardisation - 2", "Birkbeck College - University of London", "The need for authoritative, on-going international cooperation in respect of the European agenda for taking the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) to reality is pivotal in putting it into the global context it demands.
