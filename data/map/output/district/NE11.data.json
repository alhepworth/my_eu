This project is based on the integration of (a) test traces exploitation (generated by test execution in the software integration phase induced by the industrial development process, to validate the requirements of the system) along with (b) platform models and (c) design space exploration techniques. The expected result of the project is to enable functional and performance analysis and platform optimisation at early stage of the design development. The approach of PRESTO is to model the software/hardware allocation, by the use of a modelling framework based on the UML profile for model-driven development of Real Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). The analysis tools, among them timing analysis including Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis, scheduling analysis and possibly more abstract system-level timing analysis techniques will receive as inputs on the one hand information from the MARTE performance modelling of the HW/SW-platform, and on the other hand behavioural information of the software design from tests results of the integration test execution. Of particular novelty in PRESTO is the exploitation of traces for the exclusion of over-pessimistic assumptions during timing analysis: instead of taking all possible inputs and states into account for a worst-case analysis, a set of relevant traces is analyzed separately to reduce the set of possible inputs and states for each trace.\n\nA particular attention will be given to industrial development constraints, which means 1) as little cost as possible in term of extra specification time and need of expertise, 2) a simple use of the tools, 3) a smooth integration in the current design process, 4) a tool framework flexible enough to be adapted to different process methodologies, design languages and integration test frameworks, 5) analysis results\n\n\nDoW (TA) Approved by the ARTEMIS JU on 26/05/2014", 48937.0, 6525207.0, 5, 14, "PRESTO", null, null, null, "fp7_103426_999437367"]]}}, "0QD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1527811200000, 1638230400000, "Electric LOsses Balancing through  integrated  STorage and power Electronics towards increased synergy between Railways and electricity distribution networks", "Turbo Power Systems Ltd", "European distribution networks and light-railway networks present common issues: both have been developed as independent networks, relying on the resilience and robustness of existing power supplies.

Target groups: adult people aged 18 and older who are seeking to be trained as Welding labourers and welding Team Leaders, and enterprises which use welding as part of their business. Two Outputs will be reached by the project: 1. International Welder's (IW) training programme and material; 2. An online Team Leader training programme \"E-WeldLead\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll project partner countries (Lithuanian, Slovenia, Denmark and the UK) have a well-developed manufacturing industry, however, the fast dynamics of the welding technology and science requires constant upgrading of pedagogical material and worldwide standards. Lithuania is the only country among the partners that does not provide welding training at an international standard for the welding labourers. In Lithuania, around 700 companies are actively using welding technology. According to the Lithuanian Job Centre, the Welder is among the top 10 most demanded professions and the demand for the welding labour has been increasing over the past five years: in 2009, the Lithuanian Job Centre advertised 1,7 thousand welder vacancies, in 2010 \u2013 2,5 thousand, in 2011 \u2013 2,9 thousand, in 2012 \u2013 3,1 thousand, and in 2013 - 3,8 thousand. The qualified welders are required in shipbuilding, metal construction and repair, building, and many other sectors. Despite the fact that Lithuania has around 46 education establishments providing training in different types of welding, the companies still suffer from a lack of welding labourers.  This is caused by that the diplomas of the Lithuanian vocational schools are not recognized by International Welding Organisations such as International Institute of Welding (IIW) and European Welding Federation (EWF).  This blocks the employment possibilities for many vocational school graduates and negatively impacts on the Lithuanian welding industry which works in the environment of a tough business rivalry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago, two universities in Lithuania became ATBs. These two particular ATBs were established for the preparation of the senior welding specialists such as IWS (International Welding Specialist) or IWE (International Welding Engineer). However, Lithuania still does not have a vocational training body which would be accredited to provide international training for the welding labourers. Therefore, PO Vilnius Jerusalem Labour Market Training Centre (VJLMTC) aims to become an ATB during this project. The main purpose of becoming an ATB is the preparation of the International Welder's (IW) training curriculum that meets the requirements of IIW and EWF. It would ensure that Lithuanian welding industry is provided with the suitably qualified welding labour, and that the graduates of the VJLMTC have high prospects of employment. VJLMTC teachers will upgrade their qualification to meet IIW requirements during this project. Piloting of IW training is compulsory in the process of becoming an ATB, therefore a 14-monthly piloting in Lithuania will be part of the project.  WTQuality makes a continuation to another project worth over 4 mln EUR and initiated by the Lithuanian Government during which VJLMTC has built at its premises a modern Sectoral Practical Welding Training Centre-Base fitted with high-tech equipment. WTQuality project is part of a well planned vision and a long-term strategy of VJLMTC and the Lithuanian Government on the way to increasing the welding quality in Lithuania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more highly problematic area which WTQuality will address in the lack of Team (Brigade) Leaders in the welding sector. A welding Team Leader welding team is not a seniour welding specialist or engineer. He or she is one of the welding labourers who possesses certain people management skills and a good knowledge of the welding work organisation. During the project, partners  will select the most talented welders and train them as Team Teaders. For that purpose, an online Team Leader training programme \"E-WeldLead\" consisting of 8 modules will be prepared in 4 languages (Lithuanian, Slovenian, English and Danish) and tested by partners during the project in 3 countries (Lithuania, Denmark and the UK).

Traditionally, the students from the Business and Administration come from weaker academic and socio-economic backgrounds and have fewer opportunities.  Both programs face the challenges of increased stress in our society. More and more students suffer from anxiety, stress-related symptoms, allergies, eating disorders and therefore need greater support from us than in the past.In order to meet these new demands, we need to support the students that we know will benefit from IWBL but need a bit of help on the way, by not only getting a visit after a month but also help getting to the destination and settling in.We believe that by sending accompanying staff, we can give students with fewer opportunities, from weaker socio-economic background and those with severe phobias or chronic diseases or diagnoses like for examples eating disorders the chance to go abroad for internships. Many students with backgrounds like these express the will to go abroad, but lack the courage. By accompanying these students their first week, we can strengthen the self-confidence, independence and maturity by helping them find their routines, either when it comes to eating or finding information and thereby opening up doors that otherwise would be closed for them.More and more students nowadays suffer from food, dust or mite allergies.
