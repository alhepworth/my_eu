It is all about youth, especially youth with fewer opportunities.\r\nFor all in the past our mobilities have been a turning point for better. For much better! We are tempted to say, we are saving lives! But we have to support more, much more! For this application the seminar we have had in December in Austria was another  starting point. \r\nThe overall aim of this project is, to give young people with fewer opportunities self-perception and self esteem a push for them to take action for their future, and so, the whole project and all the activities will be related to the effects of our actions and the power of changing small attitudes.\r\nWe start with the urgent needs of the youngsters which include several youth exchanges (sending) and EVS projects (sending) but we also offer youth workers mobilities to strengthen and train for cooperation and for hosting placements in Austria as well.\r\nThe concept is a complete cycle of 5 youth exchanges, 10 short term EVS, 1 long term EVS, 3 seminars and 1 study visit  to activate young people in civic life with the use of R\u00fcckenwind and Erasmus +mobilities.\r\nA continuous training and reflection is a must for youth workers. For this reason we included the reflection, sharing and evaluation circle in this application. To involve some of the youngsters in a seminar will be challenge, but rewarding in many ways - for youth workers and youngsters alike. We are going to separate the International Circle with Point Europa and Educere to make sure that the application will approved . With this new application it is impossible for us to put our projects in a planned multi measure one.  We hope for the future the get the necessary possibilities to write a multi measure application without a limit for activities or participants.\r\nOur focus is on the ones who very rarely participate in mobility projects - young people with severe challenges and restrictions.\r\nOver the years we learned, how much international mobilities can be rewarding and how outstanding changes of lives through Youth in Action and ERASMUS+ can be!\r\nWith the indicated projects we would like to support self-development, cultural awareness,  and wider understanding of Europe and the common challenges. We expect a more positive individual pathway trough this life-changing experience.\r\nWith the topics Inclusion, Dance, Health, Nature, healthy lifestyle and local community we would expect youngsters animated who are most probably not participating in any European program.\r\nThe youngsters will work together, across language barriers, to create something valued and important together. A great chance to build some solidarity and positive group dynamics.\r\nSuitable supervision and training will always be in place, but the volunteers will also be called upon, perhaps for the first time in their lives, to take a responsible role in a piece of work, relying on other people and with others equally reliant on them.\r\nThe aim of the projects are to give young people with fewer opportunities more appetite to take part in further EU program projects. If they are interested after a youth exchange they could take part at EFD short term projects, EFD long term and later on the seminars. It should give the several projects a red line for the youngsters, partners and society as well.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-2-AT02-KA105-001304_3"], [2016, "British - Austrian Cooperation in a challenged Europe", "torpoint and rame youth project", 24890.0, 2, 4, "Europe is changing.

We would like to spread courage and confidence when many are challenged and filled by doubts in values and systems.

This ones have had little opportunities in life to engage positive activities, travel and meet other young people outside their country. These now planned exchanges will enable young people to experience a positive life-and learning opportunity and will allow young people to explore (youth) cultural issues that young people from Britain and Austria are facing in our society today. Lack of perspectives, discrimination, unemployment, rural isolation and lack on role models among others do not need to last  forever if we work on it.We set up a series of exchanges to allow young people to have a positive European Experience - either away or in their home country.We may even may need to call it an INCLUSION PROJECT (Within project responsibles)as it offers opportunities to all young people. No matter if they face challenges in their lives, will have to make sure that they have a chance to participate in these mobilities.We do not know, how Europe and our countries will develop after the 23rd of June, when the referendum of Britain to stay in or leave the EU is over. From our side we are more for the unifying then the separating spirit.We are very frightened, as we cannot predict what the consequences could be for us, for our countries and Europe.We think, that only cooperation and an European Spirit can solve the current crisis. Sour projects will also provide a forum for young people to make links and work together on projects and outings. We will use a variety of topics and tools such as debates, presentations but also dance, music and the arts. Such an experience will provide the opportunity for young people to gain confidence and increase their self esteem. It will be an effective learning experience and for some young people it will provide them with the first experience of meeting other young people living outside their own country. The programs will also provide learning workshops on what is Youth Culture, where young people are needed in our society and what young people can positively contribute to their communities and societies as a whole. The Objectives of this series of projects are to ensure the participants gain a better understanding ofculture. They will have the opportunity to understand differences and similarities of history and culture in Europe. The program will provide opportunities for young people to get to know each other and have fun working together as a team to create a final performance. The project focuses on people who face exclusion due to different factors (health, poverty, education, rural isolation and unemployment).It is important to mention, that in the UK youth service provision was cut dramtatcally, not many offers for international youthwork can be realized.Only the long lasting partnerships allow us, still to realize one or the other exchange, which would be so desperately needed to combat exclusion, xeno - and Europhobia.This projects are also to back the YES-remaining inititiave. Only a common Europe can assure values and standards. The projects will have same objectives and aims, they will have same and similar issues to tackle, but each project will do that in a different way. One by debatting, one by discovering the region and the other by reflecting on culture. The variety of activities and workshops, which are youth let as much as possible, will be provided for the young people to develop their knowledge around Culture, inclusion and diversity, valuing the differences and similarities within them.

Affected infants are born without functional immune systems and die within the first year of life unless effective treatment is given. Treatment options are limited to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and autologous stem cell gene therapy. Over the last 15 years, gene therapy for two forms of SCID (SCID-X1 and ADA SCID) has shown significant safety and efficacy in correcting the immunodeficiency and allowing children to live normal lives. Proof of concept of gene therapy for 3 other SCID forms has also been shown by members of the proposed SCIDNET consortium and is ready for translation into clinical trials. We are therefore in a position whereby, over the next 4 years, we can offer gene therapy as a curative option for over 80% of all forms of SCID in Europe.
