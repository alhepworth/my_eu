Through three previous Comenius projects, over six years, we have forged meaningful relationships and successfully worked together with international partner schools. We are now looking to continue our international focus by providing high quality professional development for our staff to allow them to incorporate new approaches learned abroad into their practice through a KA1 mobility project. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to modify and improve our feedback and assessment policy. We are looking for practices that are efficient, effective and do not add significantly to a teacher's workload. Through job shadowing observations, our staff will analyse how teachers give verbal feedback, and when. They will identify effective marking practices that move children's learning along and evaluate the effectiveness of innovative feedback practices, in collaboration with colleagues overseas. Additionally, through the nature of seeing the practice of colleagues in Europe in their own setting, teachers will develop a greater awareness of European education systems and reflect on similarities and differences to our own system. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing all our staff with high quality professional development, as demonstrated by also including Teaching Assistants in our application. In partnership with the University of East London, we are delivering a part-time masters degree in education based at the school. This KA1 project would complement the staff\u2019s research and study and provide them with a broader perspective when analysing educational approaches.\r\n  \r\nThrough structured training courses, teachers will learn about and analyse what good verbal feedback and formative assessment looks like. They will identify effective ways to plan feedback time into lessons and create an action plan to implement this. Through discussion with peers, they will evaluate how other systems do this effectively and how it can be adapted into a British system. The courses aim to help staff identify additional meaningful assessment opportunities and to learn new and diverse assessment methods and criteria.\r\n\r\nAll staff will enhance their critical enquiry skills that they are developing with our Master's degree study and preparation for their final year dissertation. They will share their experiences with our staff on return, gaining confidence in sharing good practice with professional colleagues (particularly for less experienced members of staff).\r\n\r\n20 members of teaching staff from Duncombe will be given to opportunity to participate in the project, from senior leadership to early career teachers with under five years experience. \r\n\r\nTeachers will observe, plan and evaluate approaches to feedback. Staff that participated in the mobilities will be allocated training time (INSET) time during staff meetings and INSET days to deliver their results to the entire teaching staff. This will include delivering presentations about what they have observed, going through and evaluating approaches to marking and action planning how to integrate positive ideas into our practice. \r\n\r\nThey will then contribute after returning from mobilities to a growing whole school marking and assessment action plan that will be finalised and implemented at the end of the project. This will be overseen by the deputy headteacher (lead for assessment), Jackie Doherty.  The final action plan, taking together all of the practices seen, learnt and evaluated will be delivered through a whole school INSET that explains how we will be changing our approaches. It will be written into our school assessment policy and our school feedback policy and, most importantly, will impact on teaching and learning in our school. \r\n\r\nWe envisage that the impacts will be higher quality feedback and formative assessment, resulting in better quality teaching and learning, as well as a reduced workload for staff. Additionally, teachers will have increased intercultural awareness and a wider skill set. They will also be able to use any competencies acquired to impact on their MA study.", "http://www.duncombeprimary.co.uk", "Duncombe Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047317_coordinator"]]}}, "4LQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Move on up", "Maltese Culture Movement", 21915.0, 2, 2, "The project entitled 'Move on up' is a youth exchange involving a total of 40 youths from 2 different countries: Malta, and UK.     These 45  individuals will consist of  14 young people with special needs and  22  youths with fewer opportunities who will come together at a camping site in Dwejra, Gozo, to implement this project. This project will also involve 2  accompanying persons and another 2 group leaders. Many of the UK young people come from a very deprived borough in inner city London called Tower Hamlets and it is well known for having high levels of deprivation, overcrowding and a lack of affordable housing.  Our project strives to make an everlasting impact in the local community. This new exciting project will enable us to work in a flexible and creative way to reach out to some of the most disadvantaged young people helping us to improve their skills and recognise there full potential.The applicant organisation, ERRC developed the idea for this project with the collaboration of  the partner  organisation which also works in the youth sector. By this proposal, ERRC intends to implement a project that involves young people who come together to participate in a number of activities that are both interesting and educational. This project aims to motivate disabled persons and young people with fewer opportunities to take part in activities in order to promote healthy living, active participation in society and social inclusion.  The project would also provide an insight to cultural social issues, and the influences of one culture towards life perceptions.The main themes of this exchange are to develop more awareness on the need for social inclusion of persons with some form of disability and those with fewer opportunities  and to promote active citizenship and mutual understandings of different cultures. The applicant organisation together with the partner have decided to implement this project at at a camping site because camping in itself is an activity that brings people closer to each other. Camping is also very appealing to young people, and it is considered a very social activity. The participants will also participate in other interesting activities such as scuba diving and zip-lining. The main activities include a mixture of outdoor activities, workshops and discussions, and culinary nights, presentations and tutorials which are all intended to promote the main themes of this project. Our project will also involve a number of informative sessions such as talks, workshops and discussions. Through these talks and discussions the youths will learn how to listen to each other and voice their opinions. These discussions will also serve as an exchange of best practices and experiences.This project will seek to help young people to understand better the concept of solidarity because they will have to work together and assist each other in order to obtain the desired result. During this project the young people will also be involved in a voluntary experience where they will offer assistance to another organisation. The notion of team work is very strong in our project.   The main expected learning outcomes form this exchange will include the following:- A better understanding that the disabled persons and persons with fewer opportunities can interact with the society and not left marginalized;- The development of interpersonal skills ( increase a sense of initiative, self-empowerment and self esteem);- The exposure and experience of outdoor activities, which in the long term, will encourage more physical activity amongst the youths;- A better understanding of each country's culture;- Becoming more familiar with dissemination methods and the promotion of events;- To improve communication skills and be more confident in oneself when expressing an opinion;- To reach compromises and be more tolerant  within a team;- To participate in a team building environment;- To enhance inter-cultural awareness; - To increase an additional motivation for taking part in future ( through formal/ non formal) educational or training opportunitiesThe theme and objectives of the project are to develop the young people\u2019s understanding and knowledge of the importance of having a positive mind set alongside determination and perseverance to keep moving forward to achieving.  We aim to promote culture fusion and learn about different cultures within the group and this not only helps individuals to be more tolerant they learn to respect each other and become more knowledgeable of the world around them.

This imbrication of knowledge-circulation and its implementation, testifies to the learning-in-doing principle that underpins O&F\u2019s activity in response to the equally performative nature of moving image production. Indeed, the methodologies that have been set up by artists and organisations over the last years in Europe are not pattern-based but rather redefined according to each project\u2019s needs. This redefinition has allowed for the consolidation of a genuine and innovative production field that O&F intends to disclose and drive forward. Another structuring principle in O&F is that of collaboration. O&F facilitates the dialogue between different European moving image art traditions and methodologies to have a supporting effect at two levels: the artworks themselves and the field as a whole. As yet another form of collaboration, the cross-fertilisation of resources, methods and publics between art and cinema is of special interest for O&F.Articulated in three activity clusters taking place in London, Brussels and Madrid, the programme combines professional and public events to examine and share production and distribution concerns as well as moving image practice. Along with a Symposium, a Seminar and Screening programmes, O&F develops innovative activities such as the Work Sessions and the Young Artists\u2019 Workshop.
