To achieve this goal, BrightAnimal has the following mission:  To produce a framework for European and non-European small and medium enterprises on effective and acceptable precision livestock farming and to create an international, interdisciplinary network for further development and dissemination.   The main activity and achievement of BrightAnimal will be the elaboration of a book on effective Precision Livestock Farming in Europe and world-wide with special consideration of small and medium enterprises. The book aims at describing current and near-future techniques in PLF, especially taking into account both the practicality for SMEs as well as their acceptability (in the broader sense). The book will also try to set the scene for future developments.   As the second component of the framework, BrightAnimal will produce best precision livestock farming practices (BPLFP) in a series of \u201cproblematic\u201d areas such as aquaculture, beef, sheep and chicken. These best practice guides will be released to the public domain in the form of booklets.   A third deliverable of the project will be a practical showcase activity showing the Good Practices in action in the European Centre of Excellence of Automatic Identification and Data Capture in the UK.   BrightAnimal will organise interdisciplinary conferences for opinion exchange and cross-disciplinary discussions.   It is of great importance to include opinions from outside Europe.

LCA informs designers and developers concerning the implications of their choices on the environmental impacts and is therefore a decision-making tool.
