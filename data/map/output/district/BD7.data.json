Project enables international cooperation possibilities equally and throughly in a very large organization. There are long-term good partnerships behind the project, but the resources for international mobilities have been varied in different study sectors, in adult/further education and in supportive and administrative services. Tampere Vocational College has a total of 20 VET-campuses in the Tampere Region and in the regional campuses there have been very limited possibilites for international mobilities and development work. The merging of Tredu in 2013 was followed by renewal and further emphasis on international activities (also through the new Tampere strategy 2013 goals). International aspects are integrated to all study sectors and the results are realized through competitive and skilled workers in the local economy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to realize student mobilities (total of 74, lasting 4-8 weeks) especially on Tredu campuses and VET areas with limited previous resources for this. Project also enables teacher and staff mobilities (total of 25, lasting 3-4 days). Through these mobilities it is possible to develop work profiles and methods in administration and services and in the VET areas with less international experience. As background support there are good international partnerships with previous development projects (e.g. good mobility practices, quality management, curricula development work and ECVET pilot projects) with practical results and work methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is coordinated by appointed project manager with adequate resources. He/she works in intense cooperation with Tredu's international office, VET-sectors and appointed international teachers. There are clear project management instructions and rules from the city of Tampere regulations and in EU administration to be followed. Tredu also has own project support services available. Intranet works as practical help for project information and dissemination channel as well as Tredu's director meetings, regular international staff and teacher meetings and meetings on different VET sectors. The management of Tredu support the project and its goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be seen in international cooperation that enables students' international individual study paths in different study sectors and develops organization through new aspects of staff members' work. In the background there are the city strategy of Tampere and Tampere upper secondary education's work plan for the years 2014-2017. The results of well-working mobility practices will be seen on the organizational level to promote internationally-minded Tredu and also in the regional campuses with the support for international activities and mobilities.

In their respective professional environments, intercultural exchanges play an increasingly significant role for our graduates and teachers. The professional environments are characterized by people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, with different religions and languages.

Encouraging the students to control and reflect their learning process independently plays a vital part in the project. The improvement of the students\u2018 acting competence enables them both to develop their creativity and their personality. The increasing autonomy prepares the students for life-long learning.

Although this will focus on the STEAM Curriculum (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics), this covers a broad spectrum of the academic and vocational teaching provision at Bradford College and will include a variety of transferable skills, techniques, and strategies that could be adopted across other departments and provisions. The project is partially a response to the recent OFSTED inspection at Bradford College, which identified specific areas for improvement within the quality of teaching, learning, and assessment, however, it is also a broader means of addressing the existing skills gap in the STEAM vocational sectors and the Bradford City and Yorkshire regions. The College expects the success of this project will lead to teaching becoming much more inspiring, thus improving the student progress and inspiring them to push their attainment. Furthermore, the College expects to learn from its international counterparts new strategies that adopted would directly aim to improve the quality of teaching, learning, and assessment, primarily through tools such as lesson observations and how these could be used more efficiently to bring about positive change at the College, as well as through non-traditional teaching and engagement strategies relevant to the STEAM Curriculum.\r\n\r\nBradford College will provide preparation to participants in line with the European Quality Charter for Mobility, Learning Agreement, Quality Commitment, and Agreement between two institutions. A preparation team will be set up to make every effort to ensure all participants are fully prepared for their mobility. The preparation team will include Bradford College International Office team member, Erasmus+ Coordinator from partner institution, placement officer from partner institution, programme areas tutor/member of academic staff for learner participants, and programme manager for staff participants.\r\n\r\nWith increasing staff and students' language competences and awareness of international opportunities, College will keep working on gaining more international opportunities to provide them the chances to go globally. If this application is successful, the College will gain more experience on how to maximise the impact of staff and student mobility. For the next step, College would like to focus on sending more students to take work placement internationally and for staff to deliver training in partner organisations. The chance of observing teaching, learning, and assessment at a partner institution and to learn about best current and upcoming practices in the STEAM Curriculum Area can help the staff to identify the skills gaps between the home students' abilities and the demands of the global market, as well as compare practices relating to ensuring quality of teaching, learning, and assessment locally and internationally. The staff will be able to provide valuable suggestions and opinions to develop the curriculum and skill building at Bradford College, in turn improving the students' average skills and employability levels and enable the College to improve its current provision, making progress towards improving its Ofsted rating and remaining a vital player as a provider of vocational training in the area.", "http://www.bradfordcollege.ac.uk", "BRADFORD COLLEGE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046867_coordinator"], [2016, "BC VET individual mobility", "BRADFORD COLLEGE", 1469.0, 3, 3, "Bradford College has a strong commitment to expand its international activity across the curriculum areas through its internationalisation strategy.

Recently, the transport and accumulation of sediment in natural rivers has become of interest to environmental scientists, as many pollutants are associated with sediments. Deterministic models still commonly used in engineering practice model sediment transport with average quantities. The latest research models use stochastic and now particle tracking approaches to better reflect nature. Random variable analysis is starting to be used but there is little data to test the new models. Grain scale measurements of transport have only recently been achieved as instrumental capabilities have increased. Increasing computing capability now has the potential to treat fluvial sediment systems with true probabilistic based simulations in which the fate of each particle can be individually tracked and modelled. Such a form of sediment modelling is still limited by the existing knowledge of the relevant grain scale physics rather than by computational limitations. The oldest but still most difficult questions to answer about river sediments is whether they do or do not move under the action of the flow and when in motion, where do they rest and for how long. The current proposal will use advanced instrumentation to measure hundreds of moving grains and local flow velocities. This data will be used to develop probabilistic approaches for transport rate prediction, further development of an existing discrete particle model will allow the time history of their grain movement including rest periods and their ultimate fate to be statistically described.

Europe is the world leader in plastics recycling and the second worldwide plastic producer, but competence by emerging industrialised nations, such as China, is growing bigger and represents a major thread for European interests in mid and long term. There is recently a big concern towards the recycling of wasted materials, including plastics. Despite the growth of recycled materials in the polymer sector, there are presently two main factors that prevent a higher use of recycled materials: Uncertainty in fixing final product density and quality of the final product, which is directly affected by viscosity of the blend. Yet despite this tremendous competition, many polymer processes still rely on trial and error for their optimisation, leading to the creation of enormous tonnes of scrap during adjusting periods. Current methods, which enable only indirect measurements such as temperature, screw torque and pressure, prove completely insufficient for characterising such complex behaviour. The industry needs rapid, reliable, non-invasive and cost effective analytical methods for process control in order to ensure desired values of density and viscosity of the polymer. This project thus proposes to develop a compact, non invasive, real-time sensor based on an ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer for in-line measurements during polymer processes. POLYSENSE will be designed for suitable insertion in a standard pressure port, which will enable the in-line measurement of density and viscosity of the polymers while circulating in a molten state inside the machine allowing the prediction of the polymer behaviour and the feedback to the process control.

This project aims to optimize patient safety and patient benefit, by integrating cultural competence into simulation-based education. Simulation education is designed to increase the safety quotient and effectiveness of clinical practice through the rehearsal of skills in an artificial and authentic environment. Diverse patient characteristics may be conveyed through cultural, sensory, language, physical or psychological difference and may increase communication error and threaten patient safety. Arguably, culturally competent health professionals are better prepared to respond to patients with diverse needs relating to, for example, their gender, ethnicity, disability and age. The focus of this project is inclusive clinical practice and this applies not only to patients, but also to diverse health professional students and diverse faculty teachers, for example, those from an ethnic minority background or people experiencing hearing loss. \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to:\r\n1. Create a multi-platform web hub dedicated to simulation-based education and cultural competence\r\n2. Design, pilot, adapt and implement a web-based cultural competence self-assessment tool for simulation-based education with health professionals. \r\n3.

The target population for this project is pre-registration health professionals (for example, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, paramedics, medical students) across all programme year groups.

Ten health professional students from each simulation facility will be invited to be involved in one focus group following piloting of the project toolkit [N:80 students].\r\n\r\nDescription of the activities and methodology\r\n\r\nThis project will address the above objectives through action research methodology as this enables a grass-roots level approach to respond to a 'real world' concern.

This will be performed at the outset because it is integral to the development, implementation and hosting of the other two project outputs; simulation-based education cultural competence self-assessment tool and simulation-based education cultural competence toolkit. The multi-platform web hub will serve as a dynamic and interactive space hosting resources;  international evidence-based current information and links to other resources relating to cultural competency and simulation-based education. It will offer free, open- access, online materials in a range of languages; initially English, Irish, Finnish and Slovenian.  \r\n\r\nThe second output oriented activity will be to design, pilot, adapt and implement the web based cultural competence self-assessment tool. During the second transnational project meeting the project team and other stakeholders will agree the content and process for the development of the self-assessment tool. In 2016, the Association of Simulation in Practice in Health published a standards framework and these will be used to organize and guide the development of the self-assessment tool. Cultural competence frameworks and models will be collated and key performance indicators will be extracted to integrate with the ASPIH standards to form the basis of the self-assessment tool.  \r\n\r\nThe third output oriented activity will be to design, pilot, adapt and implement the web based cultural competence tool kit. The process for this will be similar to the design, pilot, adaptation and implementation of the self-assessment tool. Once the tool-kit is ready the project team, supported by the Digital Media Working Academy will convert it to a web based version. \r\n\r\nResults and impact envisaged \r\nThe results will be a suite of web based tools that will be available to health professionals and educators to use, to facilitate cultural competence. \r\n\r\nThe consequence of culturally competent health professionals should be an increase in patient safety and benefit through improved communication and interactions.
