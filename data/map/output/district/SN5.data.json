The technology is capable of processing varied types of MPW. Plaxx produced by the process can be used as a substitute for Heavy Fuel Oil but with the advantage of being very low sulphur.\n\nHowever, rigid food containers and items such as drinks cartons etc., use laminates of differing polymers. The widespread use of dyes, fillers and other additives, alongside contamination from the contents of the original packaging, presents challenges for our process. Currently, our process is designed to process MPW with low levels of contamination. Capability to process a higher level of contamination through our process opens up markets 2-3 times bigger than at present. Therefore the aim of this project is to further develop the gas filtration system of the technology, and the recruitment of an Associate with the level of expertise to realise this innovation opportunity is therefore essential.

MACIVIVA will pave the path to other large scale thermostable nanopharmaceuticals products for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and other potential applications for direct application by non-invasive routes.\nLiquid products are inherently prone to physical and/or chemical modifications and degradations. Solid vaccine dosage formats (e.g. powder) may prevent molecular motion and shear-induced degradation, and slow down degradation involving water and oxygen radicals, resulting in improved stability and enhanced shelf-life of vaccines. The cold chain storage is still fundamental for preserving the bioactivity of most liquid and freeze-dried vaccines, and a reconstitution step prior to administration is required for freeze dried vaccines that are usually administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. These reconstituted freeze dried vaccines harbor important instability and must be used within hours and kept refrigerated. Because most liquid and reconstituted freeze-dried vaccines are susceptible to degradations, it may affect the immunological properties of the immunogens, with unwanted immune responses or insufficient immune protection. \nFor addressing liquid virosome-based vaccine instability and improving their shelf-life outside the cold chain, MACIVIVA will explore new galenic vaccine formulations through careful screening of excipients, stabilization and drying methods for generating new vaccine solid forms that can be easily self-administered.
