The EU attempts to advance a coordinated approach to end these conflicts and to mitigate the negative effects for survivors. Nevertheless, a clear challenge is that 40% of violent conflicts reignite within 10 years of ending. As outlined in the Commission\u2019s \u201cInstrument for Stability Strategy Paper 2007-2011\u201d, European institutions recognize the need to formulate policies that will help to end this conflict trap. This is urgently necessary in order to enable sustainable social, economic, and human development. Building capacities to address these challenges is the aim of the Training and Mobility Network for the Economic Analysis of Conflict (TAMNEAC). Europe needs a young, knowledge-based generation of researchers and professionals that are trained in rigorous research methods and in policy-based responses to violent conflict. The network will contribute to our understanding of the drivers, the forms and the social consequences of conflict, as well as the risk management strategies that individuals and households can use to cope with conflict.\nTAMNEAC will make a significant contribution in several ways. First, it will develop sustainable professional capacities. With the inclusion of policy and private sector partners, TAMNEAC will develop a cohort of future researchers, policy-makers, and consultants that can deal effectively with conflict. Second, it will overcome current limitations within conflict research by investigating new and innovative topics, such as natural resource exploitation as a driver of conflict, the effects of conflict on maternal health, and the use of microinsurance to manage risk in post-conflict settings.

Thus, there is an imperative need for new technologies that can accurately detect tumour heterogeneity, allow for patient stratification and assist clinicians in providing the right diagnosis and treatment for the right patient. PREDICT\u2019s mission is to address this huge unmet need.\nRadiomics, a newly emerging field that uses high-throughput extraction of large amounts of features from radiographic images, can boost the field of personalised medicine. The analysis of medical images taken as standard-of-care allows Radiomics to capture tumour heterogeneity and to generate \u2018tumour-specific\u2019 signatures in a non-invasive way, without the need of assessing the patient\u2019s genetic profile. Thus, Radiomics, if linked to Big- data and decision support systems (DSS), can be used as diagnostic tool for patient stratification, for prediction of treatment response and for guidance, involving the patient, of clinical decisions in oncology. However, researchers that understand cancer biology, advanced imaging and big data analytics are virtually absent. Even more challenging is to translate the outcomes into actual clinical tools involving the patient.\nPREDICT will train 15 highly promising researchers in the emerging field of Radiomics and Big data.

There is almost nowhere to learn from, no way to see practical experience in dual training \u2013 that\u2019s why we need to find it abroad. Our aim is to give not only excellent vocational training, but to provide also with good general education and modern soft skills of 21st century. This requires improvement in the qualification of the teachers, who have been building the name of the school for years. They need modern methods, skills to use technologies and innovations. We chose to send the language teachers as the leaders, because they will take the information from the source, then will translate it and spread among their colleagues. The teachers in special subjects in Turkey will learn how the dual training system works and will adapt it to our conditions.\r\nFor giving better perspective for the future of our students and the vocational education in general we have 3 goals:\r\n1) To set the beginning of the Dual training in our school in the school year 2019-2020 by implementing what we have learned and seen during the work visit in Turkey. To be helpful for our colleagues from similar vocational schools by sharing with them our experience from the project, as well as our achieved results.\r\n2) To insure for our students excellent vocational training through the system of dual training, so they could be concurrent on the international labor market and be motivated to find realization in the light industry.\r\n3) First the language teachers, then gradually all the others to star creating with confidence educational experiences in their classrooms, using innovative approaches and creative cooperation.

The use of new technologies and the improvement of our students\u2019 knowledge of the English language are two of our greatest academic concerns. In order to achieve our goals we have done a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, and we have determined that we need to gain knowledge and experience on how to implement English in early education, improve the use of ICT in both the learning process and outside the classroom, and the promotion of entrepreneurial ideas among our students.Firstly, our first and second graders will be introduced to English as their second language. Therefore, we need to acquire the competencies and innovative methodological approaches that our teachers need to improve their skills at this stage of education. The Danish educational system is renowned of being one of the best in Europe and English as a second language is introduced very early at schools.  Two teachers from our school will observe their methodology whereas two other participants will learn about the methodology used for the teaching of the English language as a mother tongue in the UK. Both activities will provide us with an example of good practices and how to teach literacy, communication, reading and listening comprehension on a different level.  Furthermore, another teacher will participate in a structured course to gain theoretical knowledge of modern pedagogical approaches and efficient didactic aids, whereas a second one will gain knowledge on how to effectively use creativity in different aspects of teaching.Secondly, modern technologies, which are close to our students as they have been exposed to them since childhood, come as a challenge for most of our teachers.  Therefore, we believe it is imperative to educate our teachers regarding the use of modern technology in the classroom.  The online classrooms that our teachers and students use are a great start but they are still very far from their full potential. Modern communication and the Internet technology provides people with a great deal of information nowadays as well as it enhances the internationalization of the school. One teacher from our school will obtain formation on how to use the ICT in the classroom, whereas another one will get acquainted with the use of computer tools and applications that enable communication with other members of a learning process. It needs to be pointed out that our teachers commute daily among three or four locations so it is imperative that one participant improves the competences in the field of management, organization, mediation and conflict resolution.Finally, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in their future world of work. We intend to promote entrepreneurship and experiential learning.  Our goal is to provide a stimulating learning environment for the development of creative thinking in young people, so that they can develop into bold and successful individuals. The teacher who will mentor these workshops will be trained in a structured course entitled \u201cIntroduction of entrepreneurship in schools\u201d in order to gain global training on entrepreneurship, and will also observe a Danish school where the innovative approaches to problem solving are applied by using LEGOS.We are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to achieve our goals successfully. The Project committee will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the whole process, and   will monitor who, how and when to disseminate the results of the project, both locally and internationally, as the core of our impact and dissemination strategy. Such committee will also carry out the evaluation of the project results after each training activity through monthly reports, by the presentation and discussion of introducing new methods and by the interviews with students and teachers on the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the new methodologies every six months.To conclude, we firmly believe that the sustainability of the new methodologies after the project is finished will finally ensure the successful improvements that we all expect on the fields described above.

The school unit operates an Integration Class for pupils with learning difficulties requiring further support and guidance. The school has developed partnerships with local agencies aimed at the training of teachers and parents. In addition, scientists are invited to inform students on issues such as cyber bullying, cinema, health etc. Furthermore, every year, many cultural and health programs are implemented and presented in events at the school year end. Teachers who intend to participate in training programs are 7 with specialties such as Greek Language, Aesthetic Education, Foreign Languages, Home Economics, Physical education. They have successfully implemented various cultural programs and one participation in a Comenius project. One of the teachers is willing to attend English lessons in UK in order to improve her understanding of written and spoken English, including pronunciation. She will gain confidence in speaking, listening, reading and writing. She will also develop a greater awareness of grammar structure and vocabulary, authentic and appropriate language, formal and informal language, so she can communicate more fluently and effectively in English. The school unit has made preregistration for all the participants and has signed a letter of intent with a second educational institution in Italy for two more training programs. At the first training program in Italy, five teachers are willing to be trained in new teaching methods in Italy that combine the new technologies and are oriented more in Student centered learning methods. The aim is to change and adapt the teaching to the peculiarities, abilities and needs of students in order to attract their interest and participate more actively in the educational process. Furthermore, participants teachers will gain experience and more confidence to develop e-twinning and mobility programs. Initially, participants will prepare for their participation in training via videoconferencing with the partner institution and organize the details of the visit in the host country. Participants will learn more about managing an effective and up to date classroom. Through interactive and engaging activities they will share classroom strategies, learn how to establish classroom rules, provide clear instructions, monitor, develop rapport, incorporate pair and group work, and gain tips for encouraging students to reflect on their own classroom behaviour. Upon completion of training, participant teachers will design Sample teachings which will be attended by the teachers who didn't participate in training.

Our primary objective is to achieve an inclusive school with equal opportunities for all our students. Our students with special educational needs need to be provided with innovative and enterprising methodological updates. After a thorough analysis of our strengths and weaknesses, we have determined that the use of traditional methodologies can generate unmotivated students. Such students end up becoming part of the rates of school failure in Primary Education and High School early drop-out.  Our objective is, therefore, the use of modern and innovative methodologies around creativity and entrepreneurship, and the creation of a website for the effective dissemination of our learnings and results.Firstly, we need to promote entrepreneurship to develop creativity, initiative, perseverance, cooperative work, responsibility and all the qualities required for the inclusion of our students in the world of work in the 21st century. We are convinced that entrepreneurship is the bridge that we need to bring society and school together, and it is for this reason that, apart from acquiring global training on entrepreneurship, we intend to implement the use of LEGOS following the Danish model in our classrooms and do a publicity campaign to promote the work and ideas of local ecological associations. Likewise, after getting training in the use of creativity within the British educational system, we intend to influence the intellectual, emotional and relational development of our students. Finally, we consider it necessary to obtain formation on how to create a website and strategies to successfully disseminate our learnings at local and international levels.To carry out our objectives successfully, we are aware of the importance of the selection of participants with a dynamic, communicative and responsible profile to disseminate methodologies and planned activities inside and outside our team. The school has determined that we need six international mobilities to achieve our goals. In order to guarantee that we develop these objectives, discussion, monitoring, evaluation, and economic committees have been created, which will ensure, each in its area of responsibility, the successful reach of agreements and commitments by all the parties.The committees will ensure our results\u2019 impact before, during and after the project is implemented.  The goal is to anticipate and assess at any time the effect of our activities and their results not only in the participants, but in our institution and the rest of partner organizations, both locally and internationally. The committees are also responsible to monitor and control who, how and when to disseminate the results of our project, both locally and internationally, providing a model of dissemination strategy as well as the tools that will be used for that purpose. As a prime example, we have made a drawing contest with students and families from the school, in which we could gather ideas from drawings with the Erasmus+ logo, the acronym KA1 and our students\u2019 ideal school. We take this as a first example of the use of entrepreneurship and active use of creativity.

The strategic project consortium will be made up of eight partners from England, Finland, the Czech Republic and Germany, and will include one institution of higher education from each participating country, in conjunction with one national partner of differing organisational structures including VET/HE institutions, NGOs and disability organisations. \r\nThe key objective of this two-year Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership project is to support an effective transition process for students with SEND from VET into employment, by collaboratively producing and evaluating three unique communicative and informative tools. There will be a SENEL website dedicated to disseminating the project and making the tools available to the widest possible global audience for long term sustainable impact. \r\nProject activities will include administration and quality assurance, implementing a dissemination and valorisation plan, writing piloting and evaluating the three outcomes described in the following paragraphs, and running three multi national and two multinational dissemination/presentation events.\r\nThe first project outcome will include a portable exhibition of documentary photographs and videos of best practices on partner countries, available with accompanying text in four languages.

The main factor at the background is the fusion of West Pirkanmaa Consortium of Education (LPKKY) into Sastamala Municipal Education and Training Consortium (SASKY) as of 1.1.2014, and the parties\u2019 different approaches to organizing mobility.  Now, along with the fusion, a strong will to share the skills has emerged; to build up strong common practices and to give the students of SASKY more equal opportunities for internationalization than before.  This is part of the creation process of a new internationalization strategy just launched: high quality student mobility will be one of the corner stones of the new strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe implementation of ECVET is important when organizing high-quality mobility.  In the former LPKKY, ECVET has been implemented with the help of intermediary partners; the students give skills demonstrations abroad which the receiving entrepreneurs will assess, and the learning outcomes will be validated according to the entrepreneurs\u2019 assessment.  In the \u201cold\u201d SASKY, within Europea network, a high-quality model, based on co-operation between VET providers, has been developed.  The model sets a good objective for the co-operation between VET providers, but the model is a result of long-term co-operation within a single sector; it can\u2019t be adopted just like that \u2013 therefore the model of LPKKY has been agreed on with the partners as the minimum criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help the implementation of ECVET, the tools of the Perfect Match project will be disseminated to the partners, and their exploitation will be encouraged in the project.  It is also essential to involve the vocational subjects teachers in the planning, setting of goals, monitoring and feedback gathering of placements.  To validate all the learning outcomes gained during the placements, we will round up working groups, consisting of language teachers, cultural subjects teachers, IT subjects teachers, entrepreneurship teachers and Finnish teachers; the task of these working groups will be to elaborate common rules for the validation of the non-professional learning outcomes.  The Education Managers will support their work and confirm the exploitation of the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo launch student mobility, some mobilities are also needed for teachers.  They are needed to share the partner contacts, ensure the implementation of ECVET, the transfer of good practices, co-operation and the planning of new mobilities and new projects.  The input of teachers is also needed to make internationalization an integral part of the everyday life at the whole SASKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis massive machinery is ignited for the sake of students.  So that they can do high-quality placements abroad.  So that SASKY would have practices effective enough, partners good enough and co-operation fluent enough for suitable placements to be found for the students.  In suitable placements, the students\u2019 tasks match their skills and their objectives, and thus the best learning outcomes possible will be gained \u2013 regarding both their hard and soft skills.  Especially the soft skills \u2013 language, cultural, communication and co-operation skills; self-confidence, independence and initiative \u2013 are vital for their employability, and with the help of the work of the validation groups, a bigger part of these learning outcomes will be made visible in their qualification.  The key principle in the realisation of mobilities is to encourage the students\u2019 to take initiative and responsibility in the practical arrangements, yet every student will be given the support s/he needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the skills and experience described earlier, the results of the project include: \r\n\r\n- free-form reports and videos made by the students, describing what they have gained during their placement\r\n\r\n- assessment forms for skills demonstrations\r\n\r\n- a common, updated preparation course in the SASKY moodle\r\n\r\n- international coordinator\u2019s guidelines: a version adapted for SASKY\r\n\r\n- common practices and partners for mobility\r\n\r\n- clear common criteria for the recognition of the non-professional learning outcomes gained during placements\r\n\r\n- reports and workplace descriptions made by teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key impacts of the project are:\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the students\u2019 employability\r\n\r\n- the launching of common student mobility at SASKY, respecting the principles of ECVET\r\n\r\n- the increase of internationalization at SASKY\r\n\r\n- the enhancement of the attractiveness of SASKY as a VET provider  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is consistent with the national and European objectives and strategies for mobility.", "http://www.activatelearning.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FI01-KA102-000136_2"], [2016, "2015-FI01-KA109-009217", "Activate Learning", 67505.0, 9, 11, "In the academic year 2016-2017 Sastamala Municipal Education and Training Consortium (Sasky) wants to send out 74 students and 25 teachers, and invite a Norwegian entrepreneur to Sasky.The content of the students\u2019 placements will be mainly on-the-job learning, though some school exchanges are planned too.  The length of the placements is 4-12 weeks, the target countries including DE, ES, HU, UK, NL and IE. The objective re students is to improve their professional, linguistic, entrepreneurial, communication, co-operation and cultural skills.  We also wish to support their independence and self-confidence by encouraging them to assume as much responsibility as possible concerning the arrangements of their placements,yet we ensure sufficient support and good preparation for each participant.The participants of a short group exchange to Hungary constitute a special group. The participants, 10 catering and hairdresser students, are gathered from the three different schools of Sasky offering these lines. The objective is to give an opportunity  to participate for students who normally would not participate without the support of a group or an accompanying teacher, due to social or economical problems or learning difficulties. The objective of Sasky is also to share internationalisation skills and partnerships, for instance M\u00e4ntt\u00e4 Regional Vocational Education Centre has co-operated with this school for years, and now we wish to spread the co-operation to the two other schools.  We would like to send 3 accompanying teachers with the group, each staying 6 days. Sasky has very limited experience of placements of disadvantaged students, and the partner even less, but we are hoping to start off the co-operation on the right foot.  For the partner it is also important that one of the teachers is already known to them.The purpose of the other teacher mobilities is quality assurance, making the use of ECVET a standard and starting mobility on new fields: even though the co-operation goes way back with most partners, the expansion of Sasky forces us to seek new fields of co-operation with them.At the same time, we wish to improve the internationalisation skills of the teachers by peer learning (of course, observing the world of work in another country also gives the teachers themselves new ideas and motivation for their work). The teacher mobilities are realised in well-planned groups including teachers from different schools, both vocational subjects teachers and international coordinators. The international coordinators ensure that all the relevant matters regarding co-operation and ECVET are dealt with; the vocational subjects teachers are responsible for making the partner understand the content requirements and evaluation of the placement All participants will present the results of their visit both at the internationalisation team of Sasky and at the staff meeting of their own school. This modus operandi has been piloted in All 4 One project with positive results. A new idea is to invite a Norwegian entrepreneur to Ikaalinen College of Crafts and Design with the objective of teaching us something and learning something herself.All these mobilities will support the objectives of Sasky\u2019s internationalisation strategy, the most important ones are:- equal opportunities re internationalisation for students and teachers. The reciprocity brought by the activities is equally important here, therefore the co-operation between schools is highly recommendable. Linguistic preparation also enriches the language selection at Sasky.- the quality of mobility, especially making the use of ECVET a standard and involving the vocational subjects teachers more and more in the organisation of the placements. Shared good practices are equally important; they are constantly perfected at the internationalisation team- the increased involvement of the teachers also realises another objective: Sasky being a genuinely international organisation, internationalisation being the responsibility of the whole staff- increasing the outgoing student mobility numbers to 115 by the end of the year 2016, of which 75 should be at least 4 weeks placements, and the number of incoming students to 50Mobility also supports the development of an international study path at Sasky and the better recognition of all the skills gained during placements.  For Sasky, it is still important to complete the merger: All for One and One for All is the motto of Sasky\u2019s international activities.  That means that we work together for shared objectives and also achieve a much more.  Internationalisation is one of the areas where the advantages of a having a big organisation are clear.In the future Sasky seeks to increase its mobility numbers slightly while taking care of the quality.

These factors may render invalid the classical model in which successive mutations with large advantages arise and  spread through the tumour in selective sweeps. To incorporate these neglected features and to test how tumorigenesis depends on factors such as mutation rate, selection and size constraints, we shall set up a comprehensive model of tumour growth incorporating cell birth, death, division and mutation parameters. We shall examine specific aspects of cancer-as-evolution in mice. By marking mutant clones using fluorescent proteins, we can track them and see how they persist, spread and die. We shall also determine the mutation profiles and genetic diversity of mutant clones and whole tumours in mice and humans using next-generation sequencing. Specific experiments will determine: (i) the fate of new advantageous clones arising in an existing tumour; (ii) whether new disadvantageous clones can persist in tumours; (iii) whether apparently maladaptive traits for tumour growth, such as suppressing the growth of competitors, can be selected; (iv) why do housekeeper gene mutations cause cancer in specific sites; (v) can cancer cells have too much genomic instability; and (vi) whether all cancers develop owing to driver mutations with big effects, or are there \u201cmini-drivers\u201d of tumorigenesis?

Instead a substantial fraction is transcribed, often tissue specifically, into long non coding (lnc)RNA of mostly unknown function.  Many lncRNA are rapidly degraded and may reflect promiscuous, non-functional transcription. However some lncRNA have important cellular functions. I reason that defining promoters and terminators of lncRNA genes will provide valuable information on which lncRNA are likely to be functional. LncRNA gene promoters often correspond to nucleosome depleted regions of protein coding gene promoters and enhancers, which generate bidirectional transcription. Regions of single-strand DNA, exposed by R-loop formation can also initiate transcription and so act as a potential source of lncRNA, as will be investigated here. Since transcription initiation of lncRNA genes appears relatively promiscuous, terminating lncRNA transcription may be of critical importance. This will prevent read-through transcription with consequent negative affects on downstream genes by transcriptional interference or the formation of overlapping transcripts leading to RNA interference effects. Consequently I will focus on transcription termination mechanisms of lncRNA genes. I will determine if known protein coding gene terminators also operate for lncRNA genes or whether many lncRNA use alternative termination mechanisms. In particular I will investigate the role of G-rich pausing elements that promote Pol II termination by forming R-loop structures on lncRNA genes. I will also investigate which classes of lncRNA genes form gene loop conformations when transcribed, as a likely identifier of more highly expressed, functional lncRNA.

The proposed research is in three parts:\nFirst we propose to define the mechanism that controlled the development of the first land plant root system by identifying genes that control liverwort rooting system (rhizoids) development and\ncharacterizing their regulatory interactions.\nSecond we propose to determine if the mechanism that controlled the development of the first land\nplant root system was inherited from algal ancestors.\nThird we propose to characterize the mechanism that controls filamentous root hair growth in\nArabidopsis in response to environmental factors, and determine if it is conserved among land\nplants.\nIn combination, these experiments will define the genetic mechanisms underpinning the development and evolution of one of the fundamental developmental processes in land plants.", 2021905.0, 2021905.0, 1, 1, "EVO500", null, "http://www.ox.ac.uk", null, "fp7_94947_999984350"], [1335830400000, 1506729600000, "Psychology of Relationships, Networks and Community Cohesion", "The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford", "The contemporary urban social environment contains an inherent contradiction at its heart: we live in very large social communities, but our natural community size (as reflected in the size of our personal social networks) is very small (~150, now known as Dunbar\u2019s Number). I argue that a tension between prosociality (facilitating social cohesion in small communities) and selfishness (the individualism that undermines cohesion in very large communities) is responsible for much of the dysfunctionality that lies at the heart of contemporary urban society. This project proposes a novel multi-disciplinary approach to exploring the processes that underpin the social relationships on which community cohesion is based. It will do this through a series of experimental and sociological studies of interpersonal relationships and the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that underpin them, based on integrating theory from evolutionary, cognitive, social and neuro-psychology, combined with insights from evolutionary economics and sociological network analysis. Doing so will allow us to ask whether we can extend the mechanisms involved to enable greater social cohesiveness in modern urbanised societies \u2013 probably the single most difficult issue that we currently face.

PROTEUS will work with a range of university/school collaborations. The project will enable participants to see these approaches at first-hand in order to consider their strengths and weaknesses, whilst learning from each other.\r\n\r\nThe aim of PROTEUS is to enable key stakeholders to better integrate the academic and practical elements of learning to teach, by investigating the effectiveness of initiatives that promote university/school collaboration, such as university schools. These provide opportunities for teacher educators, teacher mentors and student teachers to develop understandings of \u2018new professionalism\u2019, across boundaries of research and teaching practice. PROTEUS will thus develop competences that enable teachers to develop their own practice, and that of their schools, based on systematic research, which is vital if human and economic resources are to be used effectively. Another aim is to enable student teachers to challenge the existing cultures of the schools where they are first employed. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of PROTEUS are:\r\n1. To identify the opportunities and constraints of existing university/school collaborations\r\n2. To evaluate the potential of  \u2018university schools\u2019 as a specific model of university/school collaboration\r\n3. To evaluate the capacity of university/school collaborations to develop 21st century professionalism\r\n\r\nPROTEUS consists of seven universities/university colleges and two university schools, covering all levels of initial teacher education, from primary to higher secondary schools. The partners represent a broad range of European education systems and hence are able to produce detailed evidence about the opportunities and constraints of different forms of university/school collaborations and their integration into national systems. \r\n\r\nThe project will produce knowledge about different forms of university/school collaboration, both locally at the partner teacher education institutions and internationally, through exchange visits and workshops with student teachers, school (mentor) teachers and university staff. It has three phases:\r\n\r\nSTART UP PHASE:\r\n1. Start up meeting to discuss framework for country discussions with three teacher educators from each partner country, developing criteria for baseline measurement (Oct 2015) and resulting in Intellectual Output 1:\r\n2. Baseline measurement. Measurement of teacher competence and professionalism among student teacher in all partner institutions (Jan 2016) Intellectual Output 2:\r\n3. In each partner country, PROTEUS will facilitate discussions between teacher educators, teacher mentors and student teachers about their own understandings of \u2018new professionalism\u2019, and how it is facilitated within national teacher education systems. (to March 2016) \r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTATION PHASE\r\n4. Summer seminar (Weingarten) where 9 participants from each country (3 each of teacher educators, teacher mentors and student teachers) meet to share the findings of their national discussions on \u2018new professionalism\u2019 and university/school collaboration. Outcome: Models for university schools as means for developing teacher professionalism (Summer 2016).\r\n5. Three teacher educators from each country visit NTNU, Norway, for seminar on the emerging \u2018university schools\u2019 developments, and implemention of models (Autumn 2016) against the NTNU reference model. An interim evaluation report on development of models will be the intellectual output from this seminar.\r\n6. Measurement of teacher competence and professionalism (Jan 2017), investigating the effect of elements within the model. \r\nFOLLOW-UP PHASE\r\n7. Representatives of Governments, local authorities and teachers will be invited to a seminar to share observations and findings and to discuss ways forward in Europe. (Spring 2017).  Other dissemination activities will be carried out in this phase.\r\n\r\nBy elaborating the knowledge and experience of partners, PROTEUS will identify and understand the central elements and concepts involved in successful university/school collaborations, which support the development of student teachers\u2019 professional competence. Through dialogue with policy makers in partner countries, we will make empirically grounded policy recommendations for the development of university schools or other specific forms of school-university collaboration. \r\n\r\nPROTEUS will thereby support the development of theoretically informed clinical practice in teacher education.

Those who will succeed will have the opportunity to continue their studies in Universities and Technological Institutions. The outcome is to have students with good amount of knowledge regarding their area of expertise along with theoretic background and of course professional attitude.\r\nThrough our daily education we have detected one problem that is not easy to be solved even for graduates from Technological institutions. The problem for the modern professional technical personnel is to be able to collaborate with scientific personnel for the execution of research project. The difficulty is located because professional technical personnel spend most of their time working in daily small projects. On the other hand scientific personnel are working on big project with characteristics such as scope planning, integration, risk management, contingency plans and of course much more deliverables at the end of the project. Eventually there is part where scientific and technical personnel must join forces for the execution of the project and of course every upcoming project. There lies the problem. There seems to be a great gap in understanding these two groups between them.\r\nThe solution for this problem lies on basic vocational educational. We have the ability to stimulate the minds of the students. This stimulation combines technological approach along with the needs of the scientific personnel. Of course is not enough to train students only in theoretic form but also train them through workshops where there will be able to witness the requirements of such form of work. This educational pattern must be used also in vocational teaching personnel.\r\nThe training of vocational teachers will contribute in further knowledge strengthening that are already acquired where in combination with teaching experience we will be able to create a flexible team of teachers that are in full compliance with modern teaching procedures.\r\nTo cover that need we have created this program with title:\r\nElectromechanical Technology Systems for Particle Accelerators and Detectors.\r\nThe targets of the program are the following:\r\n1. Training of vocational teachers with new technological framework inside school environment.\r\n2. Mobility and training of teachers in scientific environment and practical training with short duration for better perception of the scientific matter with technological approach.\r\n3. Training of vocational teachers on the field of their technological subject through scientific and research framework.\r\nThe participants cover fields such as electrical, mechanical and IT engineering on their workplace and as such we have designed this  mobility program.\r\nIn this team the main target are vocational teachers. Their task is to attend in a small 7 days seminar cycle over one complete technological system that combines all the above sectors (meaning electrical, mechanical and IT) along with scientific

education sector to SMEs in order to address the vocational skills needed to develop and sustain SME growth in Europe. This will involve working closely with SMEs employees and managers and VET providers. Research has shown that SMEs have limited resources for offering training and what they really require is \u201cinformal\u201d training for specific problems they encounter, at a time to suit them. Bespoke training is not usually on offer from traditional training institutions.  Therefore e-learning offers a great opportunity. However, there is reluctance on the part of SMEs, and their employees, to engage in this form of learning, despite the many advantages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this Project is to ensure, by way of the creation of an \u201cSME e-Learning Portal\u201d that SMEs are aware of the e-learning opportunities available to them, and, more importantly, how these can be used to best advantage to ensure acceptance by the Managers and workforce. Throughout Europe SMEs are increasingly important to the economic well being of the EU. It is estimated that they account for 99% of all business with 42% of all turnover. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting the training needs of SME employees is a challenge that requires review; their very survival may depend on an appropriately trained workforce. Established to provide real solutions to the challenge of embedding e-learning in the training practices of SMEs, the SMEELEARN consortium seeks to promote the development of strong economies through the identification and use of innovative training systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project outcomes will include establishing a \u201cSME e-Learning Recognition Review Group\u201d to conduct research leading to the production of a \u201cBest Practice Guide to e-learning for SMEs throughout Europe.\u201d This will include: a study of the conditions under which SME employees will be more likely to accept and use technology-based learning; recommendations as to what strategies SMEs need to adopt to gain the acceptance of their employees and the development of a \u201cbest practice approach\u201d for SMEs when considering including e-learning as part of their training portfolio. The impact of the Project will be the direct promotion of e-learning as a viable training strategy, through the dissemination of the report and it\u2019s findings, the transfer and embedding of innovative training practices in SMEs contributing to the sustainability and growth of SMEs with the EU.", "http://www.rpc.ox.ac.uk", "EU15 Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001610_3"]]}}, "3HJ": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "OXFORD POLICY MANAGEMENT LIMITED", 2435393.0, "Cooperation with Asia (21.02.02)", "fts_2016_12353"], [2016, "OXFORD POLICY MANAGEMENT LIMITED", 1621958.0, "Cooperation with developing countries in Asia, including Central Asia and the Middle East  (21.02.51.03)", "fts_2016_15648"], [2016, "OXFORD POLICY MANAGEMENT LIMITED", 1478294.0, "Cooperation with Central Asia (21.02.03)", "fts_2016_17097"], [2017, "LMC INTERNATIONAL LIMITED*", 18317.0, "Support expenditure for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) \u2014 Non-operational technical assistance (05.01.04.01)", "fts_2017_66742"], [2016, "LMC INTERNATIONAL LIMITED*", 17050.0, "Support expenditure for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) \u2014 Non-operational technical assistance (05.01.04.01)", "fts_2016_68380"], [2017, "LMC INTERNATIONAL LIMITED*", 666.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_53873"]]}}, "3HL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Experience European Business", "Boots UK Limited", 49344.0, 5, 14, "Context and background:\r\nAustria in general and especially Carinthia live from the intensive integration into the European and international economic and cultural areas. Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project. We hope to extend it in the future \u2013 also geographically. In the long term, we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education.

A functioning and sustainable certification scheme requires reliable data and profound research in order to evaluate impacts of biomass production. Currently, the sustainability debate is faced by the lack of data on socio-economic impacts. Furthermore, mainly impacts of biofuels are investigated and impacts of bioproducts are neglected. Thus, a harmonised certification scheme for biofuels and bioproducts is required. In order to harmonise sustainability certification globally, the Global-Bio-Pact proposal includes partners from Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and USA. Emphasis of the Global-Bio-Pact proposal will be placed on a detailed assessment of the socio-economic impacts of raw material production and a variety of biomass conversion chains. The impact of biomass production on global and local food security and the links between environmental and socio-economic impacts will be analysed. The Global-Bio-Pact project will investigate the interrelationship of global sustainability certification systems with international trade of biomass and bioproducts. Furthermore, Global-Bio-Pact will assess public perception of biomass production for industrial uses. This will be completed by the development and test audit of a set of socio-economic sustainability criteria and indicators for inclusion into a future effective certification scheme. Thereby, opportunities and limitations of social issues in biomass/bioproducts certification schemes will be investigated.

It is a massive improvement on current reforesting techniques being a fully automated process and it will simultaneously enable cheaper and faster tree planting (10 seeds planted per UAV per minute). Given that the planting is being carried out by an aerial vehicle, it is possible to plant in terrain that is inaccessible by land-based approaches. It therefore offers a higher return on investment since it can carry out the same activity at a lower cost while also having a greater reach for tree planting.\nThe Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with the automated planting solution being demonstrated out in different ecosystems throughout Europe, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.", 37354.0, 53363.0, 1, 1, "BioCarbon", null, null, null, "h2020_199212_925552467"]]}}, "4NA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "OVER THE BRIDGE", "St. Ebbe's C of E (Aided) Primary School", 32642.0, 2, 2, "Over the Bridge(OTB) will use teacher and pupil visits together with shared lessons via Skype to compare two traditions of after-school education in the UK and Romania. OTB will investigate how these traditions have different impacts on excluded or socially disadvantaged pupils in each school. After-school education is used differently in both countries, and reflects differing attitudes towards education, attainment and inclusion. OTB will enable staff and pupils from both schools to experience differing after-school provision and to make observations and draw conclusions that will influence subsequent teaching practice and school policy. The project will make use of methods of ethnographic observation and analysis that are learned through training in the preparation phase of the project. Both staff and pupils will learn how to use observation as the starting point for developing concepts and theories about the impact of after-school provision on excluded or socially disadvantaged pupils in both countries. The work of observation and analysis will be inspired by forms of ethnography that emphasise a combination of visual, spoken and written work, and combine expressive and analytical writing in creative ways.  Participant pupils in each school will be drawn from those who are at most social disadvantage or at most risk from exclusion. Support for their participation will be provided, including support for pupils' mothers who experience shows are the most important factor in supporting their child's education. The project will result in the creation of a set of resources, including portfolios of work created by the participants, videos of shared after-school sessions, analysis and theories about the impact of after-school provision on inclusion and attainment, and pupil-led and parent-led explorations of the factors that promote or prevent inclusion and attainment .There will be a conference presenting the findings held by the school for invited teaching staff in both cities, and a whole school presentation that will allow participating pupils to present their findings and narrate their experiences to their peers. Project work will also be made avaialable to university education departments and on teachers' websites in both cities.

The interventions will involve 5 cities with different economic & political situations & provide the case-based evidence for replication by others.\nThe scale of energy demand in European cities is huge & as an ever greater percentage of citizens are living in urban areas.   Some of the biggest city authorities consume over 1000GWh of energy every year to run their operations & it is estimated that the energy consumption of the whole city (the wider sphere of influence) could be at least 50 times that of the city authorities alone.   Much of the investment in energy efficiency & renewable energy production has been based on project funding & there is an underexploited opportunity to achieve more systematic and progressive improvements through embedding PPI methodologies within the ongoing processes for the procurement of energy-intensive goods & services.   CEPPI will demonstrate, through an action learning process, how forthcoming public tenders can be influenced to achieve a more sustainable energy outcome & build capacity amongst management & procurement professionals.\nThe project will build on established relationships that have been developed between the five participating cities (Birmingham, Budapest, Castellon, Valencia, Wroclaw) through the Climate KIC.   They will be mentored (by leading PPI and sustainable energy experts) through an action learning process that will build the short term knowledge and PPI capacity to reduce annual energy consumption by at least 33GWh.
