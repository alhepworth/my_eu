The participants will be staying in leeds /Heckmondwike and they will take part in various activities around outdoor activities  some on site and some off site from camping, bush craft, basic outdoor survival skills, sports as archery, high ropes etc and using photography to explore the adventures of outdoors and capturing the experiences.\r\n\r\nThe TC will have active youth workers and young people from 6 countries UK, Romania, Estonia, Slovenian Malta and Czech Republic. The participants will be over 18 yrs in age. majority working with young people from hard to reach communities or young people with fewer opportunities. The young people will be from the same background or willing to work with the above mentioned target group. \r\n\r\nThe methods used in the TC will be hands on experience, transferable photography skills, activities to engage with the outdoors in a relaxed fun way and sport activities that will be good for the well being of  mind and body . The TC will have visits and activities where the participants will try and feel the importance of the skills and the space to discuss issues and reflect. There will be many opportunities to share skills and experiences with each other , to learn from and to evaluate personal development. The TC will provide opportunities to reflect and absorb the learning. The aim of the TC is to bring a group of youth workers together on one platform to discuss issues around certain target groups and how to tackle or make small changes to promote inclusion in the countries they come from. The TC will provide a safe platform to share and learn from each others experiences and country dynamics and resources used with certain stereotypes that society finds hard to accept in todays day and age.   The TC will help to mobilize. It will create opportunities to build partnerships and work towards facilitating more informal methods of learning. The youth workers will also take part in activities to feed the mind and soul and to rejuvenate their bodies with the positive energies to enjoy the outdoors and spark the adventure within themselves. \r\n\r\nThe TC  will address the issue of poverty and marginalization by using photography,  outdoor adventure and sport as tools. They will look at methods to encourage  young people's awareness and commitment to tackle there issues for a more inclusive society. In this context , special emphasis will be placed on equality and discrimination.   All participants  will use their experience in UK and create a collage or story book using their images and linking them to synopsis from their past to present. It will take them on a personal journey and highlight the changes images bring sometimes good and sometimes bad and how certain images jogg our memories . It will be a transition to use their experience of a sport or picture from the outdoor adventure or the feeling of connection towards their surrounding that will realize how difficult situations can be for young people with fewer opportunities . It will reflect how certain images can refresh your soul and give the spark of motivation to make a difference within and in a much bigger context in the world. Adventure triggers the mind and body to share the positive vibes and create peace and harmony. Photography is also a great tool to use to express worries and issues affecting young people in todays fast moving European climate. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the TC is to share good practice, learn new informal methods that could be used in their own countries, share experiences and reflect. The impact will be prolonged when the youth workers will return to their countries and use the skills learnt during their stay in UK and use them when working with their own young people. The long term benefits will help to open opportunities for other young people to become active European citizens, highlight issues and finds ways to resolve them. The skills will be soft skills but something that can motivate the young people to enjoy and take further to develop them selves and bring change in the world. The TC will show ways to sustain small projects and sustainability of skills by transferring them to others. We are hoping to use this TC as stepping stones to create more projects locally and also engage young people in international exchanges. \r\n\r\nThe TC will develop good partnerships among the organisations and aim towards the same goals and priorities.

The activity brings together 10 countries, 25 participants and a Core Team of 3 experienced Trainers.

Using non-formal quality methodology, the focus will be learner-centred and experiential, to share practice, experience and expertise, in order that each participant returns home to implement on a local/regional level. Specific emphasis will be placed on reflection of observations and transfer of knowledge to own practice. There will be visits to different educational institutions in Vienna, to showcase a variety of models where NFE is used, as well as invited inputs from experts in the field.  The themes of Exchange, Explore and Empower will be reflected in each of the intensive working days, culminating in personal learning and development of competences, as well as concrete Action Plans to take forwards with local partners on return.\r\n\r\nProposed outputs include: increased recognition of NFE and its methodology, on a local, regional and international level; local action plans for each partner attending, with consideration of SMART objectives, to be delivered on return back home; definite figures of impact on a local level have been agreed by all partners; future strategic partnerships to embed the linking over a longer time frame and support research into this area which could be published; development of the systems that connect community to education institutions to be transferred to other communities in areas of need, especially related to the cross-sectoral approach for young people at risk of dropping out of the system and/or radicalisation.\r\n\r\nResults, inspirations and outcomes from this project will be disseminated to local/regional/national networks, social media sites and newsletters of the various organisations, reaching more than 15,000 readers in the different countries.\r\n\r\nThe longer-term benefits of this project include non-formal education providing the cohesion in strengthening relationships between the teachers/young people/community representatives which will become more inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nIncreasing recognition for the power of Non-Formal Education and linking the local and regional approach to the international, through Erasmus+, will bring inspiration and momentum to make a positive change in strengthening cross sector working in Education for the benefit of future generations.", "http://www.ukambassadors.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-AT02-KA105-001906_1"]]}}}}
