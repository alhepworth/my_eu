Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. Improved tactical, technical, physical and mental competences for participants as a direct result of mobility.\r\n2. Improved employment rates for mobility participants either as a professional footballer or in alternative career pathways.\r\n3. Accreditation and validation of mobility informal learning and soft skills.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within Europe.\r\n5. A commitment to embed mobility principles within the Modern Apprenticeship Programme.\r\n6. Increased maturity and self-esteem among participants.\r\n7. Dissemination of practices, policies, systems and project outcomes at the employer, local regional and national levels in the UK and in Europe.\r\n8. Incorporation of the project outcomes and best practice within the work and social environments of the project partners.\r\n9. Increase understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobility project will directly strengthen the links between the Scottish Sending partners, European host partners and vocational training providers Scotland through exchange of information at the institutional level and will facilitate the the introduction of innovations in coaching technology to Scottish club academies. Dissemination activities will accelerate the process of mainstreaming the skills and technology transfer from Europe into Scottish vocational education programmes.", "http://www.raithrovers.net", "Adjuvant Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047392_4"]]}}, "1TL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "1 + 2  The World and You", "Kirkcaldy West Primary School", 3044.0, 1, 1, "Context and background:\r\nThe Scottish Government expect schools in Scotland to introduce the 1+2 Modern Languages policy, i.e. all pupils from Primary 1 (pupils aged 5) will begin to learn a modern foreign language  and a second language from Primary 5 (pupils aged 9).\r\nFife Council - our local authority - set up a group of 40 pilot schools to implement the 1 + 2 policy in different clusters across the region - in towns, in areas of deprivation and in rural areas in order to get a balanced representation of all schools in the authority. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project: \r\nOur school has volunteered to be one of these pilot schools .

Two schools and one school complex build up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, where is living the most often a population of immigrants, made the choice of cooking to develop their pupils\u2019 basic competence and to fight against early school failure.\r\n\r\nPriority will be given to the apprenticeship of the language of the education, but mathematics, awaken activities and use of new technologies will not be forgotten. Our students of foreign languages, who are discovering our language, and the vulnerable pupils using at school an other language than their current mother language, will find , through this project an actual motivation and new ways to obtain as soon as possible all the basic skillls.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow to all the schoolboys and girls who do want it, to present one regularly home-made and typical recipe of their native country. With their eventual parents\u2019 help, these recipes will be prepared by the pupils with all what this is implying : practical steps, shopping in a local market where particular components may be found, searching the origins of these ingredients, to weigh, to compare, to adapt the quantities and also to communicate and invite other pupils to share the proposed meal \u2026and to tell the friends how to prepare this meal they also will cook.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen cooking because it is written in each child\u2019s heritage, of each family ; it is a practical way to put children in value, which may be their difficulties ; it allows to put in place an active teaching with the target of a general key skills acquisition.\r\n\r\nEach recipe will be the starting point of lot of children\u2019s researches about the country, the used ingredients, the customs relative to this food,\u2026the written pieces by the pupils.\r\nResults will be at disposal of the partners and all through a digital interactive book site  where the children will have multiple access ( all the recipes with rice, these coming from East  Europe or Central Africa, the recipe of the month, impact on the health, \u2026 ). This site will grow up from month to month with the recipes brought by the pupils of each school.\r\n\r\nMore designed for the teachers , each recipe will lead to a record of good practices giving leads and concrete examples on how to use them the most practically with all the children. These records will be build up collectively , coming from all the ideas of the teachers who will realize the recipe with their pupils, in the initial schools as in the partner one.\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019ll see in each school the creation of a kitchen corner open to all the pupils , but at certain moments also to their parents \u2026and in the same time a place for mathematical manipulations, permanent access to the pc\u2019s and internet , an opening to the food places around the school, a reflexion on the food choices ( elevenses, canteen-hall,\u2026) , an interest for all the actions around the feeding and , finally, logical prolongation of these steps, the creation or the extension of a kitchen-garden .\r\n\r\nThe six projects meetings , one in each country each year , will allow the pupils to make their invited teachers discovering the \u201cfood\u201d places in their neighbourhood, but also to participate to their cooking activities and the possibility to the parents to exchange with the teachers about a well known subject ; this will above all be the start point of new synergies under teachers of the two schools , to launch their pupils to more interchanges.
