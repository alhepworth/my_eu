The first year of the project will therefore consist in exploring the past identities of the six EU countries involved in the project by compiling information about the cultural heritages and backgrounds of each country and by creating family trees and informative posters to be used within the local communities of each country.Another project activity and result of the first year of the project is to create film-interviews and documentaries exploring the national identity linked to the past and to the topic of migration for each country.The second year of the project, with \"The Environment\" as its main topic, is intended as a continuation of the first year of the project and as an exploration of how scientific advances have led to industry and to population growth which have led to environmental problems.The second year of the project moves from a temporal past perspective into a present perspective by exploring positive solutions to e.g. pollution problems created by scientific advances.The main student activities of the second year of the project will therefore mainly consist of raising awareness about the environmental problems in each country involved and divising ways to encourage people to think of alternative ways of protecting the environment. This will be carried out through debates held in local communties, film-interviews made in local communities and informative posters and postcards to be distributed in the local areas of each country.The third and final year of the project will start by focusing on major events since WW2 and subsequently move into explorations on contemporary positive and negative uses of modern technology in each EU country involved by researching how modern individuals use modern technology and how this affects the individual in terms of social skills, communicative skills and human identity.This will be explored and researched through the creation of documentaries, film-interviews and  surveys held in local communities.As a main student activity during the final year of the project, the students will also explore whether a particular national ID connected to the different uses of modern technology in each country can be established.      The students will also be asked to predict future potential scenarios concerning future technical advances and uses of modern technology by creating futuristic short-films on the topic of future uses and impacts of modern technology.The main methodological approach of the project is intended as comparative studies of all student activity results conducted in each country throughout the project.During the three main student and teacher mobilities of each project year, the students will therefore be comparing and contrasting the results of the student activities carried out in their country with the activity results from the other EU countries.All written and visual project results will be uploaded to eTwinning, Facebook and to a project web page which is intended for demonstrating the main content and nature of the project, the main project activity results and for compiling teaching material on the topics used in the project for other schools to use.

The core technology for this high speed, communications module is Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC). This technology allows the transmit- and receive-functionality of the system to be integrated onto single chips. The size of the integrated chips will allow the module size to meet the requirement of an industry standard common form factor. This will make it physically compatible with current system vendors\u2019 products. PIC chips are key to the next generation of telecommunications networks that will demand even higher performance, smaller size and lower cost. EFFECT Photonics are leaders in the field of Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and will combine their PIC technology (based on technology spun out from TuE) with their unique and low cost PIC chip packaging technology (15x cheaper than traditional gold box packaging). This will give EFFECT Photonics a significant cost advantage over competing technologies and products, making it economically viable to manufacture the product in Europe. On completion, this 2 year project will deliver a market ready and cost effective 400 Gb/s optical communication module. The project is a key enabler of 400Gb Ethernet (400 GbE), providing a timely solution to the urgent, unrelenting issue of rapidly increasing bandwidth demand, converting world leading European research and innovation into \u20ac148M of revenue and securing Europe\u2019s position at the forefront of an emerging Photonic Integrated Circuit industry.
