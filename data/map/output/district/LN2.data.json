Through SEITI we gained invaluable expertise in European project planning and management and enhanced the school atmosphere and staff cohesion as well as school quality in terms of safety knowledge and awareness, new and more inclusive teaching methodologies, a reduced failure rate and increased staff and student language interest.\r\nHowever, this is not the finish line, but just a new starting point since we are perfectly aware of our enormously important responsibility to our students, their families and society as a whole. Thus, aware of our strengths, we have carried out an unbiased and in-depth analysis of our weaknesses and outlined a new European ITInerary to address them adequately.\r\nThe LUF objectives are fully consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy: as a macro-target, we aim to continue on our path towards innovation and internationalization. In more detail:\r\n1. Traditionally, we have trained highly specialised technicians but today this is not the best that we can offer our students. We want to learn how to enable them to also develop their personal entrepreneurial skills and an attentive attitude towards personal and environmental health and safety in order to successfully tackle the labour market challenges.\r\n2. Foreign Language competence is still a strong requirement for both staff and students. The lack of communication skills is the main barrier to information exchange and intercultural comprehension. It also limits the access to the global labour market and studying abroad. We expect our staff will use their improved language skills for their personal and professional growth and stimulate students to engage in language studying, more extensive CLIL use and active presence on eTwinning for events, groups and projects.\r\n3. In the past, we mainly focused on the weakest students to reduce educational failure but maybe we neglected the best ones a bit: we need to integrate our teaching methods with path personalization, taking into account different learning styles and times, to engage all the students in their own education at the best they can.\r\n4. The \u2018Good School\u2019 reform has paved the way to new organisational opportunities that we want to use widely in the spirit of the best European management practices.\r\nWe have chosen to include all the staff professional profiles in LUF, as we strongly believe they all play a significant and irreplaceable role within the school community.

We expect the participants to acquire certified competences and work side by side with foreign colleagues to acquire new knowledge, share their expertise and lay the foundation for future collaboration in eTwinning projects.\r\nSince we want to be absolutely sure all the training activities will be fully consistent with the project targets, we have  arranged a total of 29 mobilities with the three partner schools and with MBA school in Las Palmas. We will choose the remaining courses by turning to course providers with proven professionalism and competences.\r\nA Selection Committee, an Organising Committee, and an Evaluation Committee will support and monitor the project and guarantee its consistency with the school innovation path.

Effective cooperation between teachers, students and their parents may be a great support for the students in their attempts to fulfil all the duties and meet all the expectations.\r\nAdditionally, the teachers will be able to enhance and develop their European perspective, which will enable our staff to raise the European awareness in our pupils. The project will also aim at embedding the European and global dimension within the school's curriculum. Moreover, observing the methods and forms of managing an artistic school may directly influence and modify the methods of successful school managing.\r\nIn order to achieve the above mentioned goals, our teachers will visit the hosting school and take part in the course it will provide. The selected group of teachers will take part in a 6-day course organized by the partner school. The course will include: lesson observation, school work observation (both in artistic and regular school), lectures, seminars, practical workshops and running lessons under the supervision of the training teacher. \r\nThe participants of the project are all highly-qualified teaching staff with a long-standing working experience. They are a representative group of teachers following both curricula and working at all stages of education (primary and secondary) and their headmaster. They are all open to new methods and solutions and they all need constant development and training as well as improving their professional workshop. They need external stimuli and some other, new perspective in order to expand their workshop and learn new teaching methods and techniques of motivating students, especially those concerning working with artistically talented students. Their additional goal is to enhance their language competence in English. Moreover, the school headmaster would like to compare and expand his experience in managing an artistic school, by visiting a similar school in England.\r\nAfter the course ends, all participants will share the acquired knowledge and skills with all the teaching staff in and outside their departments as well as with the local environment by sharing their teaching experience. The gained skills will be used to plan, create and carry out new original teaching programmes and teaching innovations. The participation in the project will allow a better organization of the teaching and learning process in our school and working out new methods of motivating students, as well as increase the foreign language competence of the participating teachers.

This, and the fact that sometimes workers have greater possibilities of finding a job abroad, make that European Citizens today are more likely to leave their own country in order to study or work in other EU countries than before. People are often compelled to move in order to follow the changes in the labour market, as some fields of work may be better developed in another country or there may be a lack of workers in a specific sector. Therefore, workers specialized in those areas are more likely to be successful abroad.\r\n\r\nDriven by this necessity a person undergoing education or training should be aware of the situation and the opportunities of the European labour market.

The project partners want to teach lutherie students to use a wider range of woods in guitar making, specifically non-tropical woods, to improve their skills and knowledge, increasing their chances on the labour market, and to provide them with a better appreciation of the environmental impacts of lutherie and the importance of sustainability in wood use. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a business standpoint, the Leonardo Guitar Research Project wants to provide professional guitar luthiers with the proof that guitars made from non-tropical woods can look and sound as good as those made with tropical woods, give them broader range of woods to choose from for making guitars, a well as a sustainable and cost effective supply base of non-tropical woods and a potential competitive edge and point of difference for European luthiers versus lower cost imported guitars from Asia by market's \r\n\r\nexploitation of \u2018Made with European Sourced Sustainable Woods\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leonardo Guitar Research Project will deliver the following results: \r\n\r\n- an enhanced educational curriculum for the students of the participating lutherie schools, developing and incorporating new study material (on non-tropical woods and sustainable forest management and on methodologies for evaluating acoustic guitars), a new teaching methodology (to have more students working together on the same guitar), the practice of entrepreneurial luthiers mentoring for students who will undergo work placements, and increased opportunities for learning mobilities (introducing transnational workshops)    \r\n\r\n- the determination of the most suitable non-tropical wood types for making high-end acoustic guitars, to become a realistic option for schools/students and entrepreneurs/luthiers\r\n\r\n- the creation of a sustainable supply base of non-tropical woods. \r\n\r\n- the development of a European network for sharing experiences and good practices on guitar making with non-tropical woods  \r\n\r\n - the development of a comprehensive communication plan to ensure broadscale results dissemination, including a roadshow with lectures and demonstrations, the appointment of some famous guitar players acting as ambassadors of our project, taking project guitars on tour, and the organisation of the first Leonardo Guitar Festival. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key impact of this project will be to change the mindsets of students, teachers, musicians, luthiers and their wood suppliers: that non-tropical wood can indeed be a good and viable option to make beautiful and excellent-sounding guitars. Creating a sustainable supply base and providing scientifically based information on the qualities of different kinds of woods will make non-tropical wood a true option for schools and luthiers. They will soon realise that using non-tropical wood is not only a good marketing trick, but it is also more profitable.

To maintain and extend the current excellent working relationships with our partners; Alfa College, The Netherlands; Richard von Weisacker, Germany; Krieshandwerkerschaft (Guild of Crafts Coesfeld), Germany in the exchange of participants undertaking relevant vocational training, either as an apprentice or a full-time Level 3 student.\r\n\r\n2. Following a successful staff project in 2016/17 at Alfa College where 2 people from Construction were able to explore the delivery and assessment of Construction and Civils programmes, liaising with employers and working with partners to arrange a student project. The proposed project for 2017-19 will enable 10 Level 3 full-time Construction Civils students each year to undertake a 10 day visit to The Netherlands at Alfa College. The aim is the enhancement of the  primary learning goal and to support personal development and employability. Participants will attend college with their Dutch peers, make site visits and visit cultural locations.\r\n\r\n3. To share and disseminate the project outcomes to a wide audience, locally, nationally and internationally. The Lincoln College Groups Mission  is to be 'employer led, producing a highly skilled and productive work force'. By disseminating the outcomes of the activities to employers and other interested parties such as the Greater Lincolnshire LEP participants will be responsive to their priorities in relation to Health and Social Care provision, to contributing to the creation of extra homes and to transport infrastructure within the area.\r\nNot only will this information be shared locally but internationally with our international partners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and China.\r\nDissemination will be via college social media formats; twitter, face book etc. publications such as the College Group Strategy 2016-19, prospectus etc. Information about all activities will be shared with the local press. These actions will be carried out by the college's Marketing Department. Other forms of dissemination will be explored throughout the duration of the project.\r\n\r\nDissemination and the sharing of results and good practice will also contribute to this process. A working relationship is already established with 2 Mobility Charter Colleges - Leeds City and Craven Colleges to share outcomes etc. It is further anticipated that regular meetings with other Charter holders in conjunction with the National Agency will enable further dissemination.\r\n\r\n4. To explore new opportunities for students, apprentices and staff to work with institutions in another European country. ie Spain. This will involve two staff members to  visit a new partner in the first year of this project. The visit will explore issues in respect of placement location, accommodation, supervision whilst in the country, all other aspects relating to 'safeguarding' etc. It is then anticipated that future funding applications for projects commencing in 2018 for full-time learners and apprentices in a range of vocational areas.\r\n\r\nThe project will run for two repetitive academic years between September 2017 and May 2019 in continued support of consistency and quality of practice. All full-time learners and apprentices will be subject to selection, attend all training sessions, be recommended by their employers/tutors. The outcomes for each of the participants will contribute to the assessment of their primary vocational learning aim, plus their own personal development and progression either into further training or employment.\r\nCare students and apprentices will undertake their placement in the spring of each year and  Childcare students in April. The timing of the two week project for Construction students is yet to be finalise, but it is anticipated that travel will be in the spring of each year. \r\nThe staff visit to Spain will  be carried out in the autumn of 2017. This will enable the two partners to develop a sound working relationship in respect of vocational education and training for full-time learners and apprentices in preparation for a KA1 bid in 2018. Use will be made of standard documents to ensure quality and consistency of practice.\r\n\r\nIn summary the project is to enable all participants to experience and appreciate the culture of another country, how education and training is managed, employment opportunities available; to develop independence and self esteem and to be able to share all outcomes with others.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", "Lincoln College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA116-035785_coordinator"], [2014, "Aktuelle europ\u00e4ische Perspektiven in der beruflichen Bildung als Beitrag zur Schulentwicklung", "Lincoln College", 74280.0, 7, 14, "The application for the project \u2018mobility certificate\u2019 \u2013 awarded \u2018good practice\u2019 \u2013 covers 51 IVT participants in their 2nd year of training (20 sixth form students focusing on business studies and modern languages preparation and additional qualification as bilingual secretary; 31 participants doing a three-year-course in Health and Social Care / Childcare training to be nursery nurses) who will do 4 or 8 week placements in the UK, ES, SE, NL, FR and MT. These placements are a mandatory part of their courses and will be assessed. In addition, 16 VET staff will be visiting international partners for 2-3 days to exchange project related issues.\r\nThe project stems from the European work of the participating departments, which contributes essentially to the school\u2019s quality. Current discussions in vocational training in Health and Social Care as well as Business Administration (BA) give rise to the issues dealt within this project. Due to the two participating departments, the project focusing on current European perspectives in vocational training will be twofold.\r\nIn the BA department the issue of work-life-balance (WLB) is particularly gaining in importance in times of demographic change, internationalization and changing values. Being aware of the positive implications of WLB can decisively contribute to enhancing corporate competitiveness on the European labour market and to increasing a company\u2019s attractiveness for highly skilled staff.\r\nIn their project task during their internship the students are not only asked to deal with the topic from the employers\u2019 perspective, but also from the angle of employees, families and politics.\r\nPrior to their internship they deal with human resources management including different working time models in their BA classes, develop questionnaires/observation sheets to analyze the existing framework in the target country, e.g. key economic data, the availability of childcare etc.\r\nThey work out the specific features in their designated countries through interviews and independently evaluate their observations (PPP, collages, internship report). After the internship their results are compared with those gained in Germany.\r\nThe new focus of the work experience of the social department results from current discussions about changing pedagogical attitudes in elementary education in Germany. This new pedagogical attitude requires a resource-orientated view from the child to promote children`s individual development according to their strengths and competences.\r\nWorking \u201cinclusively\u201d in every field of education and promoting children`s individual needs have become a chore issue of pedagogical work, in theory. However, transferring these concepts of \u201cnobody stays behind\u201d into reality is still problematic.\r\nThis project continues the previous European work of the social department at the RvW college of further education with the aim to resolve the issue of \u201cinclusion\u201d with the support of European partners. In addition, apprentices and teachers of the social department at the RvW college will closely work together on this project. Whereas apprentices will practice the new resource orientated view from children with the help of observation and documentation sheets, teachers will discuss this issue with teachers and tutors from European partner institutions to obtain fresh ideas for the tuition and training of their students in Germany (A1, A2). \r\nIn the BA department activities include the exchange of experiences between two teams of VET staff and the students\u2019 tutors in the host companies with the aim of benefitting from synergy (e.g. cross curricular European projects) in both main subjects of the BA department (English and BA), thus enhancing the specific profile of the department.\r\nThe close link between the students` and teachers` mobility serves to guarantee the project`s quality by the following aspects: the teachers` interchange of possible concepts as regards a child`s individual promoting or the concept of a WLB respectively is structured in the same way as are the students` internships, namely through specific tasks (called \u201cAgenda\u201d) and its results are meant to help improve class teaching and the didactic structure of the departments. Steady teacher teams, each being responsible for one country (consisting of one language and one subject teacher per team), have proven to be worthwhile. Apart from these teams, a supervising \u201cEU team\u201d officially recognized in the school`s curriculum is responsible for the evaluation and distribution of the results in the school`s yearbook, on its homepage and at meetings with tutors or international partners.  This strategy of internationalizing the project`s results carried out by RvW college provides a professionalization of the teachers and in this way a further development of teaching concepts in the different departments of RvW college.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000114_11"], [2016, "(Un-)Employed in Europe", "Lincoln College", 51240.0, 3, 3, "General situationLots of countries in Europe are suffering from a high rate of youth unemployment. This leads \u2013 combined with the freedom of settlement guaranteed by the EU \u2013 to lots of well-educated young people searching a job in another country than their home. After some time lots of these young people come back frustrated to their home country because they cannot find a job or they cannot tackle the different cultural attitudes towards work and getting dismissed.Aim of the projectFor a successful job application in a European country the students need to have knowledge about specific differences e.g. in the application process, the documents required (application, CV), the procedures of a job interview or assessment centres or the structure of the respective labour market.If successfully hired, the new employees will experience specifics of working culture of the new working country as well.Every future employee should be aware of having to tackle another language as well as significant differences in the organisation and results of working processes etc., differences which can be intransparent and therefore potentially problematic for the employee.The curriculum of business studies gives the students basic knowledge about topics like the EU countries and globalisation in general. This Erasmus+ project also takes intercultural aspects into view. Intercultural knowledge is a key competence which is neccessary to acknowledge, think, feel and act with other cultures and so come to a basic understanding about \"the others\".The students learn from peers from other European countries about cultural differences in their respective countries.The aim of the project is to raise the competences of the students for the Europe-wide labor market, which includes:\u2022 applying for a job in a foreign country \u2022 being successful in a job interview in a foreign country\u2022 being aware of differences in labor law between the countries\u2022 being able to tackle with different cultural attitudes towards work\u2022 gaining an entrepreneurial view on human ressources management Project structureThe project is planned for two years according to the guidelines of ERASMUS+ KA2.Done on a two year basis the actual project work is done on four campus meetings. In general it would make sense to have the same student group for two campus meetings, so there would be a change after the second meeting. Each participating country sends a group of six students to the campus meetings.As we handle a business topic it is useful to simulate the competition on the market both of the employees and the companies (as simulated for selling-purchasing processes in the previous project Virtual trade, real savings). Each of the participating countries is simulating two virtual companies which want to hire people. Each participating student applies for a job in the companies of the other countries.There will be four campus meetings abroad which include a virtual job fair, presentations about the participating countries, labor law, country specific attitudes towards work, work on applications of the students, job interviews, assessment centres, ect.

St Monica's Kindergarten in Ludinghausen has hosted childcare students in each of our previous projects as have SKSG Vuurtoren a Kindergarten in Groningen and Franz Ruschkamp GmbH a sales and repair garage in Ludinghausen.\r\n\r\nProject objectives will be reviewed throughout the duration of the project from the initial recruitment process through to dissemination and will involve all stakeholders.\r\nThe results of the project will be shared with Lincoln College staff and staff from other institutions in the Lincoln College Group;  employers/placement providers; SSC's. It is the positive outcomes from these meetings that will perpetuate and shape future projects, support participant progression and underpin greater vocational and social mobility.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", "Lincoln College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012633_coordinator"], [2017, "Plan de mejora de calidad e internacionalizaci\u00f3n del IES Abastos (convocatoria 2017)", "Lincoln College", 33319.0, 4, 5, "IES Abastos is a school delivering Vocational Training courses with a series of  well-defined, determining features and requirements, laid out on later granted KA102 projects:\r\nImplementation of dual system vocational training\r\nReduction of drop-out rates in vocational training for lower performance students\r\nImprovement of the students' employability\r\nEstablishment of an international internship programme\r\nAchievement of  cultural and working awareness of neighbouring European countries in young citizens\r\nThis is an ongoing project and our organization has chosen to deepen and extend the present course of action in view of the relevance and magnitude of the above mentioned aims. Also the degree of accomplishment of our targets at the onset of the project has encouraged us to initiate further actions and lay down a new project in accordance to the aforementioned guidelines while engaging in:\r\nproject-based learning programmes aimed at motivating students and achieving lower drop-out rates\r\nincreasing the scope of countries involved\r\nA pool of hosting companies is now  available for our students' mobilities from previous year thanks to a process of job-search activities prompted  by the Erasmus+ team and carried out by the students concerned. It would be desirable that students of following years should also have access to international training periods which willno doubt enhance the quality of their schooling and employability. The number of companies and partners is expected to grow and extend to the new countries involved in this branch of the project.\r\nPartnership with EU's schools has proved key when designing common solutions for common problems and agreeing on  shared strategies and actions. As concerns this requirement, our  partners are the most suitable for our targets:\r\nSataedu (Finland)\r\nAgrupamento de Escolas Daniel Sampaio (Portugal)\r\nLincoln College (UK)\r\nInverness College UHI (UK)\r\nParticipating teachers are highly motivated and concerned with improving learning quality and the students' employability. All of them are experienced and qualified for the implementation of in-company training and have a fluent command of English in teaching environments.\r\nThe actions planned are the following:\r\n1Research work on  the implementation of the English-taught multilingual programme\r\n2Study of Interventions in drop-out students and absenteeism\r\n3Research work on project-based learning\r\n4Study of vocational training for lower performance students, dual system training and in-company placements towards common strategies\r\n5Search of companies for the students' placements\r\n6Training of students for the creation of companies abroad\r\n7Student's communicative training in foreign languages\r\n8Elaboration of a final memorandum\r\n9Dissemination and measurement of impact\r\nThe project will focus on two broad areas:\r\ndevelopment of activities 1 to 5 aiming to innovate and improve teaching and learning quality, acquire greater impact strategies and establish contact with companies from other countries willing to host our students.\r\nrealization of the mobilities for the internship students aimed at improving their personal development and their employability level in a European context.\r\nA specific methodology has been designed in accordance with the courses of action defined in points 1 to 5 within the project's framework. Each action responds to a clearly defined process: activities oriented towards the gathering of information, candidate selection and management of the mobility process.\r\nTeachers collect the information, engage on a follow-up period in the partner school and establish contact with the companies. Back at home an analysis of the proposed solutions will be undertaken towards agreeing on  a set of conclusions of practical relevance.\r\nStudents go through a period of cultural and linguistic training and get on their mobility under our supervision. Finally, their placement period is assessed by the Erasmus+ committee.\r\nFor the 2017-2019 period we will be applying for the following mobilities.\r\nTeachers: 6\r\nStudents: 6\r\nWe aim to achieve a set of  measurable targets through the implementation of the project:\r\nGreater international projection of our school\r\nImprovement of learning through new technologies and the use of English as a working language\r\nIncrease in our students'  employability as a result of their insertion in an international context, an improvement of their communication capacities and their transfer to adult working life\r\nDecrease in drop-out rates and absenteeism, especially in lower performance vocational students\r\nSuch observations will get accounted for in documents and protocols of immediate application and which are expected to prove their continuity  in future years. That is the reason why we intend to establish collaboration schemes with  Local Government institutions and foster the use of all available environments for the diffusion of the project: the school's website, forums and social networks.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-036993_1"]]}}, "5QY": {"nhs": {"data": [["RWD", "Lincoln County Hospital", "nhs_RWDDA"], ["RP7", "Peter Hodgkinson Centre - Charlesworth Ward & Conolly Ward", "nhs_RP7EV"]]}}}}
