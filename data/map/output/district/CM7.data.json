The USR has promoted the internationalization of Basilicata schools by organizing informational seminars on the European programmes, disseminating best practices, opening a \u201cEuropean Desk\u201d, setting up an ESABAC course, running English language courses for primary school and non-linguage subject teachers. The USR, through this consortium, involves three secondary schools located in Potenza: IIS \u201cNitti\u201d, IIS \u201cDa Vinci\u201d and Liceo Scientifico \u201cGalilei\u201d that have often cooperated with the USR and have distinguished themselves for the quality of their initiatives over the course of years, and two partner schools in Sweden, one in France and another one in Great Britain.\r\nThe three member schools of the consortium share a strong interest in internationalization that is expressed by the headmistresses  and teachers\u2019 tireless commitment to the promotion of innovative practices and a more open outlook on different cultures. Moreover, a large number of teachers who are attending CLIL language courses organized by the USR work in these schools.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to encourage: a) the CLIL methodology training of a large number of teachers who have been involved mainly in English language courses so far, since the teaching of CLIL modules is compulsory in the final year of Secondary school; b) foreign language teachers\u2019 refresher courses in the field of language teaching; c) the linguistic methodological competence improvement of the teachers working in ESABAC French courses; d) the ATA personnel and curricular teachers\u2019 knowledge of English and French. In all, we are involving 90 people working in the  three schools, both teaching and non-teaching staff, in activities that refer to the three typologies of Key Action 1- School Education Staff Mobility, that is courses, teaching assignments and job shadowing. The results of this project, which will develop in the course of 24 months, include the increase in European and intercultural training experiences, the improvement of the formative offer of Secondary schools, the acquisition of new teaching methodological strategies, greater motivation and flexibility of teachers, and the enhancement of the language competences of all those who are responsible for both the reception and the administration and accounts of incoming and outgoing mobility.\r\nThe long term results concern the improvement of  the quality of teaching so that it may become more involving and motivating and more Europe oriented, giving the right opportunities to expand the teaching content through an intercultural approach, transnational cooperation and the collaboration on teaching material. Furthermore, thanks to this project, the USR wants to favour the internationalization of Basilicata schools increasing the development of the school system with the aim of making the consortium an excellence hub the other schools of the region may consult about professional development programmes of the same profile.", "http://www.alechunter.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA101-014337_3"], [2017, "No Place For Hate", "Alec Hunter Academy", 128540.0, 6, 6, "We  named our project as ' No Place For Hate ' , which we think is the remedy for all people. We know that international dialogue, peace, tolerance are necessary virtues to solve many troubles that we encounter. To see differences as a source of richness prevents the extinction of other cultures in such a global world. \r\nAs teachers we observed the students for a long time and found out that the students do not know much about their own cultures and they have no idea about the cultures of other European countries.We met in etwinning and launched an etwinning project.Then we wanted to transform it into an Erasmus+ project to reach wider school groups and the communities.\r\nOne of the main aims of the project is to raise the students' awareness towards other cultures, encourage students to learn different foreign languages, stimulate all the partners to make use of the ICT tools of communication, so as to improve their competence in this area. A more intensive European cooperation will be achieved by getting to know each partner and learning about each other\u2019s culture.\r\nAnother main aim of our project is to make the students with disadvantaged backgrounds feel proud of themselves . They will take part in the national activities ,sports,festivals and workshops actively .\r\nThe project will help the partners to develop multicultural understanding and awareness of the other communities. By sharing experiences together during the project meetings and participating to different activities teachers and students will have the chance to get involved in different ,interesting and enjoyable opportunity to spend time with their European partners.\r\nA high appreciation of the role of students and teaching staff will be increased by the local and regional communities within the European Community.\r\nAll our activities are student oriented and focuses mainly on student involvement.They can be accomplished with their participation from various backrounds and equal number of genders.As partners, we believe that the project activities will be fully integrated into each institution\u2019s curriculum through daily lessons and thematic projects.\r\nOur project includes many activities about art, music,dance,food, lifestyles and sports. By covering different fields we intend to highlight the cultural items and cultural differences. This is necessary both for those  who should learn their own culture and who should compare their culture with others as well. \r\nThere will be six schools from six different European countries in the project. Scoala Gimnaziala Nr.1 Branesti is the coordinator . UK, Turkey, Portugal, Croatia and Poland are the partner countries.\r\nThe results can be summarized as follows : A presentation about each country will be created by partners. Students in each country will make three dimensional models about their historical places and they will exhibit them.They will also create a jingle of the project that will be presented during its development. Also the symbol of the project will be designed by students. The best symbol will be chosen and picturised on magnets.Other results we expect are a project corner, painting contest,essay contest,t-shirt designing contest about cultural diversity, audio-visual daily multi-language dictionary (pupils will study and vocalize other countries' daily expressions and we record the audios during the student exchange event in Romania then combine all of them in an online dictionary) ,European dictionary,cultural game created with Strach coding(Polish students will teach other students during the student exchange in UK,newspapers to be created by students at the end of each year,teaching the national sports,traditional food and folk dance of all the partner countries to the students of other schools. \r\nEach school will establish a Diversity Club. Students meet every week and discuss issues of diversity and design activities to introduce various culture groups within the school.Students will embrace and celebrate their similarities and differences while fighting against bullying via the school's diversity club. The club consists of students who want to spread cultural acceptance through their school and community.  \r\nWe will share the outputs such as presentations, leaflets, audio-visual daily language dictionary and different contests etc on twinspace,on the project website and youtube.

They belong to distinct communities( geographically, socially, economically, culturally) , a real melting-pot. We can estimate that over over 100 students will be directly involved and more than 1000 will be indirectly involved.\r\n\r\nThe activities will be: - Welcome letters;  a web blog about the project (teachers) ; designing of the project logo and slogan; exploring the history of Human Rights; celebration of  UN\u00b4s Day of Human Rights;  exploring the meaning of the human rights through philosphical dialogue; organizing a human rights Club - \"Human Rights are us\" (this can initiate and organise activities and actions concerning human rightsi in the school or local community);T-shirt of the club (that will be used during the Club actions and visits); doing research (interview/questionnaire etc.) on the status of human rights in the school yard, in the local community and in their home country; exploring the phenomenon of stereotyping (engaging the students in a dialogue about how stereotyping can limit people\u2019s freedom; taking action for human rights in cooperation with Amnesty International or any other NGO.\r\n\r\nThe methodology we are going to use is : the school from Portugal will be the coordinator. It will ensure that all the information is properly sent and received by all partners. It will check the particular steps of the project , make necessary changes, etc. \r\nAll the schools will promote the activities planned and an intensive use of ICT will be fundamental for the communication among the participants and dissemination  of the results. There will be 5 transnational meetings with the participation of 2 teachers and 5 students.\r\n\r\nThe results will be tangible and intangible.: Tangible - Social networks( facebook restrict group);a blog;  videos on YouTube channel; Reports; leaflets; exhibitions; school club on Human Rights; NGO school campaign; project corner. Intangible - knowledge and experience acquired; development of language and ICT skills; better awareness of the question arisen; development of initiative, creativity, cooperation; proactivity; entrepreneurship; development of ethical attitudes; development of dialogical skills.\r\n\r\nConcerning the impact of the project and potential longer term benefits, students and teachers  will become more aware of the differents aspects of human rights and they will learn how important it is to involve yourself by respecting and fighting for human rights in everyday life.  By meeting people from other cultures both students and teachers will also get to know different ways of thinking and the status of human rights in different countries.  During the activities they will think about their own attitudes and behaviour, and this might lead to a deeper understanding and change of attitude. The students and teachers will get experience in taking action, and this may empower them to take actively part in the struggle for human rights on a daily basis. For the participating organizations, Amnesty International and other local ones, the fact that we want to work with them and take part in their actions might be an encouragement in the way that they will have more support and publicity.
