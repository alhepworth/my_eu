As the number of visual views increases, current systems will struggle to meet the demanding requirements in terms of delivery of consistent video quality to fixed and mobile users. ROMEO will focus on the delivery of live 3D media to a group of users all at the same time to enable them to collaborate, and jointly enjoy it. This will facilitate application scenarios such as social TV and high quality real-time collaboration.<br/>In order to support these application scenarios, ROMEO will focus on new methods for the compression and delivery of 3D multi-view video and spatial audio, as well as optimising the networking and compression jointly across the Future Internet. The solution proposed by ROMEO is to combine the DVB-T2 and DVB-NGH broadcast access network technologies together with a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware Peer-to-Peer (P2P) distribution system that operates over wired and wireless links. The fixed users will receive the P2P content as well as DVB-T2, whereas mobile users will be served by DVB-NGH, their own cellular network, and hot-spot Wi-Fi connections. The default settings for fixed users will be P2P and use the DVB-T2 when the IP network suffers from congestion. Mobile users will have the hot-spot service as the priority and switch to DVB-NGH or their own cellular service if hot-spots are not available. An audio-visual communication overlay will also be provided to connect the remote users (collaborators) together to jointly enjoy the streamed 3D media. Therefore the live streaming 3D media needs to be received by the collaborating users all at the same time or with only an un-noticeable delay so as to enable them to watch it together while exchanging comments as if they are all in the same location.", 478418.0, 8259609.0, 8, 13, "ROMEO", null, null, null, "fp7_100106_990576029"], [1349049600000, 1451520000000, "Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial & Satellite Systems", "Mulsys Limited", "BATS addresses the integrated delivery of BroadBand (BB) future Internet services for European coverage according to the EC Digital Agenda objective to reliably deliver >30Mbps to 100% of European households by 2020. In order to accommodate the 'unserved' and 'underserved' areas of Europe, an ultra high speed satellite system is researched that provides order of magnitude cost/bit reductions and solutions to existing market barriers of bandwidth and latency limitations. This builds on terabit/s satellite studies conducted by the European Space Agency and extends them into an overall network and service delivery concept.<br/>A novel architecture is proposed which combines satellite and terrestrial service delivery via an Intelligent User Gateway (IUG), dynamically routing each traffic flow according to its service needs through the most appropriate delivery mechanism to optimise the Quality of Experience (QoE). The integration complies with emerging home network environment standards and provides resilience and reliability of service provision to the users by bonding diverse access networks. To cope with such scenario, BATS will also provide a unified network management framework.<br/>The BATS new service paradigm focuses on user QoE and is not constrained by a specific delivery mechanism. The wide range of stakeholders involved leads to a new business model in which the benefits to all are evaluated.<br/>Evaluation of the concept takes place via laboratory emulation with controlled objective and subjective testing and via field trials using prototype IUGs and capacity on in-orbit satellites to assess real user experiences.<br/>BATS provides a unique opportunity for the European ICT and satellite industries to take a lead in this novel integrated system which will have a worldwide market. Contributions to standardisation groups will foster adoption of the concept and assist supporting the European Mandate 496 'To Develop Standardisation Regarding the Space Industry'.", 286028.0, 9528035.0, 7, 17, "BATS", null, null, null, "fp7_106027_990576029"]]}}}}
