The focus will be on enzymes having increased catalytic activity on various types of relevant European lignocellulosic biomass. In addition enzymes with lower affinity for lignin shall also be developed. Such enzymes would increase the effective amount of cellulases/ hemicellulases for cellulose hydrolysis. Furthermore the recycling of these enzymes would be applicable. The approach in this proposal is to discover the desired activities by combining classical and modern screening technologies. The enzymes will be produced in suitable host systems for industrial enzyme production.  The project also focuses on elucidation of enzymatic hydrolysis mechanisms, about which there is a paucity of knowledge. The project will determine the limiting structural factors in these mechanisms by characterisation of the substrate during the course of the hydrolysis and the remaining recalcitrant residue. Synergy between different cellulase and hemicellulases components will also be addresses on the chosen lignocellulosic substrates. Furthermore, the project seeks to demonstrate the proof of concept with the cellulolytic enzymes in a pilot scale using the most relevant European feedstock pretreated wheat straw and related high-volume co-products.", 21525.0, 3445295.0, 7, 12, "DISCO", null, "http://www.wrightsflour.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-05/56957.jpg", "fp7_88398_999558229"]]}}, "5JH": {"esif": {"data": [[1462060800000, 1553990400000, "Inspiring Women", "Enterprise Enfield Agency", "The project provides business mentoring support, managed work space to support women, including those from BAME backgrounds and disabled women, to overcome barriers for either starting a business or sustaining an early stage business, including social enterprises.

A staff training assignment will build the capacity of our host partners to deliver VET programmes and share UK expertise through collaborative action-learning teaching sessions, specialist training seminars and/or masterclasses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop and pitch to investors real co-productions and other transnational ventures, practising skills such as networking, collaboration, budgeting, media research and interviewing, data wrangling, audience engagement and crowd-funding, working alongside and observing international producers and innovators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology innovation is blurring the lines between the roles of producer, technician and other content creators who are now expected to have a good grasp of each other's skills, with additional demands from sustainable development and other corporate responsibility requirements such as carbon audits and community engagement. Teams face '360-degree commissioning', demanding they can think through all dimensions of a project idea. We will expose them to important opportunities for new approaches inside and outside the audiovisual sector where traditional marketing models are changing. For the many content professionals new to the market, improving their networking and collaboration skills has become critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well as Europass, certification will be offered in employability, leadership and Build-your-Own Masters modules in professional media practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology: \r\n\r\nIn the UK, partners in the sending and receiving countries set a brief to which participants respond with a project proposal that addresses technical, business and creative requirements, as well as their own learning needs. Arriving abroad before the main event starts, they share skills and work with local creative professionals to develop and pitch their plans, attending leading-edge workshops (such as on archive use, audience engagement, co-production and pitching) and observing and participating in live pitches and feedback sessions. Throughout the event, they work with event organisers to engage international audiences using social media to disseminate English-language reports and measure their impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults/Impact: \r\n\r\n- On individuals: experience shows us that mixing recent graduates and staff outside a classroom encourages sharing of skills and knowledge. Younger participants often have greater confidence with technology while elder ones bring greater confidence, networking and business skills. \r\n\r\n- On partners: sharing industry excellence and VET skills and developing the European dimension of partners, many of whom are poorly engaged outside their own regions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits:\r\n\r\n- Our partners are committed to exploring and developing ideas and this project is expected to result in cross-referrals to events, strategic funding applications, international co-productions and other transnational joint ventures. \r\n\r\n- As well as up-to-date world-class knowledge and skills, individual participants benefit from greater confidence and the transferrable skills developed through this programme.\r\n\r\n- Our company benefits through developing greater capacity to deliver leading-edge vocational education and training to its client learners.", "http://www.contented.net", "Contented Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000551_coordinator"]]}}}}
