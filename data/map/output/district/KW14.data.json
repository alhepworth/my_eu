In particular, the project will stimulate collaboration in research activities leading towards innovative, cost efficient and environmentally benign offshore RE conversion platforms for wind, wave and other ocean energy resources, for their combined use as well as for the complementary use such as aquaculture and monitoring of the sea environment. The use of the offshore resources for RE generation is a relatively new field of interest. ORECCA will overcome the knowledge fragmentation existing in Europe and stimulate the key experts to provide useful inputs to industries, research organizations and policy makers (stakeholders) on the necessary next steps to foster the development of the ocean energy sector in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. A focus will be given to respect the strategies developed towards an integrated European maritime policy. The project will define the technological state of the art, describe the existing economical and legislative framework and identify barriers, constraints and needs within. ORECCA will enable collaboration of the stakeholders and will define the framework for future exploitation of offshore RE sources by defining 2 approaches: pilot testing of technologies at an initial stage and large scale deployment of offshore RE farms at a mature stage. ORECCA will finally develop a vision including different technical options for deployment of offshore energy conversion platforms for different target areas in the European seas and deliver integrated roadmaps for the stakeholders.

The EU acknowledged this by adding phosphate rock to its list of critical raw materials in 2014. There is a need to boost the use of secondary raw P.\nThe project addresses rural, urban and port areas in NWE. P is needed in rural areas as fertilizer or feed additive (often produced in port areas). P is transferred within food to urban areas where 82% of NWE-citizens live in, and wasted there (via sewage and waste). P4Y specifically targets recovery from municipal WWTP.\n2015 NWE imports 100% of its mineral P-need. 45% of the demand could be supplied by circular economy. The project will exploit the recovery potential of P in municipal sewage water (113,000 t/y P), estimated to cover 26% of the mineral P-demand in NWE. When the project ends, NWE taps 3,5% of this potential; 35% after 5y, 90% after 10y.\nTo achieve this change, P4Y supports 44 enterprises by producing demonstrators in real life conditions of 6 P-recovery technologies for municipal sewage water and 5 new products from P-recycling processes for fertilizer.

The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.

Their goal is to experience further specialization in the area of textile design, textile printing, pattern making, embroidery and the running of companies. With this work experience the students will get a greater understanding of various specializations, an understanding of professional practices and the experience of working abroad.

The work involves making various object from clay and porcelain \u2013 everything from wall and floor tiles to tableware and vases to sculpture and everyday objects like toilet bowls and sinks. The student will take part in a large project that Egill will be working on in Sweden which will be in cooperation with around 2000 immigrants. \r\nOn the school trip 10 students will travel to Holland in their third semester at the Painting/Fine Art Department. One teacher from the department will accompany them. He will prepare the students culturally and professionally for the trip. The experiences and project work accumulated during the trip will be used to further enhance the students\u2018 education when they return as well as being a basis for an exhibition for the whole school. The trip is planned as part of the students\u2018 curriculum and will award each student 5 ECTS credits. Stichting 57 Poort, the partner institution for the trip, provides studios for practising artists in Amsterdam.

The tasks of the vocational training will be to learn how to run a workshop and to take part and get experienced in many of the routines in a studio like: glazing, kiln packing, running workshops for children, grinding after glaze, firing, Facebook communication, making production for Christmas decoration, cleaning, packing big pots for sending and so on. One to two days a week (+ most weekends) the student will have time to work for herself in a other workshop which is used for wheel throwing classes. The student will get tasks and practice how to throw porcelain. The student will be responsible for this studio work: kiln packing, cleaning, glaze making but most of the time is used for throwing porcelain. In springtime the student will take part in and learn how to fire a wood fire kiln in Sk\u00e6lsk\u00f8r. The vocational training starts in August 2016 where the student takes part in the big craft fair Fruepladsmarked in Copenhagen.
