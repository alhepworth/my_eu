Particular focus is on the rapid retreat and collapse of the Arctic sea ice cover and to assess the climatic (ice, ocean, atmosphere and ecosystem), economic and social impacts of these stresses on regional and global scales.\n\nIt is not possible to look at one aspect of this system in isolation; a coupled atmosphere/cryosphere/ocean/ecosystem approach is needed. Our observations will focus on reducing the uncertainty in understanding of Arctic physical processes which are vital in climate and ecosystem change and which may not be adequately represented in present models.  Results of the observational programme will be fed into an ice-ocean-atmosphere model which, after validation, will make projections - with reduced uncertainties - of the rate and nature of future changes in the ice cover, ocean structure and atmospheric temperature and circulation. In parallel with this an ecosystems model will perform the same role for marine living resources. The resulting projections of the two models will be fed into an economic impact model (PAGE-ICE) that is specially reconfigured for cryosphere-driven impacts. This will calculate the impacts of the projected physical changes upon the global economic and social system, including those of the Arctic region itself.\n\nThis will be the first time that a leading global impact model has been coupled with a physical climate model to directly assess the economic impact of observed and projected climate change events.

The DVCI project will develop, test and implement innovative, work-based CVET to support the crucial role of DV Strategic Coordination.The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the \u2018Istanbul Convention\u2019) recognises that an integrated approach is essential to enabling effective interventions to support and protect victims of VAWG, and that training should support multi-agency cooperation.  There is currently no standard training focusing on strengthening competencies and skills to support the role of DV Strategic Coordination across partner counties (UK, Romania, Spain or Greece).   The DVCI project addresses this gap. Our objectives are:1) To share good practice and develop an EU core curriculum and competencies for the DV Strategic Coordination role, involving relevant agencies with responsibility for dealing with DV and VAWG2) To develop nationally-adapted curricula for developing and delivering a coordinated community response to DV in the UK, Greece, Romania and Spain3) To pilot and accredit innovative work-based VET to 160 professionals with responsibility for leading or coordinating DV interventions in four national contexts (45 in the UK, Romania and Greece, 25 in Spain)4) To raise awareness of the need to improve skills of DV coordinators at a local, national and EU level national and assist member states to improve services for victims of DV and VAWG through training Target groups: 1. DV strategic and operational leads, including policy/decision makers, commissioners and managers of DV interventions, including from local authorities, judicial and police, health and education sector and housing associations. 2. DV Practitioners responsible for managing and coordinating DV interventions e.g. social workers, police, health workers, teachers, counselors and staff from NGOs The DVCI partnership brings together local and regional authorities, VET providers, and NGOs, enabling the development of high quality, innovative CVET relevant to national and EU labour market needs, promoting and supporting responses against DV and VAWG.  Each partner will undertake training needs analysis, informed by Stakeholder Reference groups established in each country. We will promote cooperation and exchange of practice, knowledge and ideas via a transnational event programme, and jointly develop a core European Curriculum for DV Coordination and nationally adapted curriculums.

This is particularly true for the United Kingdom where only in 2014 languages were made a statutory requirement in primary schools in England. Whilst language teaching in primary schools is the foundation for a successful language strategy at all levels of education, research has shown a strong decline in motivation for pupils once they enter secondary education. Two of the main factors for this are the lack of assessment of learning progress in the UK and traditional, de-motivating testing methods in other member states. \r\n\r\nMindful of the need for urgent action regarding this issue, educational organisations with a stake in the improvement of language learning provision have decided to enter a strategic partnership under the Erasmus + programme. Their main aim is to combine primary language learning with a method of assessment which motivates young learners to continue learning languages. The participating organisations aim to improve language teaching and the assessment of linguistic competencies in primary schools by producing an assessment tool in the format of a computer game. The game will use a common core of curricula from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as its foundation and \u2013 with its seven language versions - create opportunities for converging standards on a European level. \r\n\r\nThe ten partner organisations were chosen for their expertise in promoting languages, research, teaching primary languages, assessment, translation, e-learning and language games. The Goethe-Institut London, a supporter of language teachers in the UK and all EU member states, is project lead. Together with its British and other European partners, it identified and developed the project idea. Both the Spanish Embassy in the UK and the British language teachers network, ALL, have been extremely helpful and influential in discussing the need to address the imbalance of language learning in the UK and other member states. The Universities of Reading and Leipzig were identified as leading primary language research experts while the University of Perugia was chosen as assessment expert. In order to ensure the necessary practical focus, the Education Ministry of Tenerife supports the development of the tool for Spanish and together with the Education Ministry in Rioja will conduct the piloting in its regions. The University of Siena with its e-learning centre  joined the partnership to provide the basis for the development of the language game for Italian. The University of Westminster will add it translation and localisation expertise for French in the UK. \r\n\r\nAs the project progresses, this tool will to be tested in schools in four countries and the outcomes will be evaluated using standard quality criteria. In order to support the anchorage of the assessment tool in state schools, a specific training of teachers is required which will be done exemplarily at the Education Ministry in Rioja. Teachers can take home course methodology to be implemented in their schools. Project partners taking part in the course will draw on this experience for their own teacher training courses.\r\n\r\nThe design of the game will be based on intensive research to provide insight into assessing progress in language learning. Parts of the programming of an existing computer game developed by the GI's headquarter in Munich in cooperation with the software company OVOS will be used to develop the new tool. The game will then be piloted to calibrate the e-learning content to ensure validity of content and construct. The feedback of pupils, teachers, parents and external educators will be recorded, analysed and implemented. Once the game is used in various classroom situations, the obtained data will show the pupils\u2019 progress. The results will be compared with traditional pen and paper tests.\r\n\r\nThe project benefits all participants. Schools and teachers will become \u201cinnovators\u201d. Students will find language learning more enjoyable. Their learning outcomes will be better and their acquisition of transversal skills will be enhanced. Teachers will be able to develop their professional skills further using innovative methods and digital integration. They will derive great personal and professional satisfaction from improving their students\u2019 learning outcomes. Universities will benefit from research and data analysis from the assessment tool. The GI and the public authorities will be strengthened regarding their work to promote languages. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term, this project should yield strong evidence to convince national authorities to endorse the assessment tool and actively promote it. At European level, the results can be used to promote the launch of pilots for more languages in more countries.
