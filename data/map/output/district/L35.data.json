Possible areas of performance and LO have been identified by the partners mentioned in the relevant sections C. This action will respond to the strategy of improving the quality of training and prepare students adequately for entering into the job market or university; enhance the certification of skills in the informal sector (see training); improve the personal growth of the individual paths.\r\ninternational mobility for a period of nine days for 7 teachers and expert in guidance and mentoring in international training centers in the UK and Malta. This action will respond to the strategy of enabling a new way of \"doing school\" through the continuous training of teachers and technical staff of the school; raise the quality of mobility experiences of the students and their certification of skills.\r\nBoth macro-actions will contribute to achieving the objective of consolidating the local network, regional and international level between the worlds of education and employment.\r\nSince the implementation of the internationalization plan in 2015 the Sarrocchi Institute established the relationships with training centers and international companies, (eg Foyle, Cap Ulysse) and created new contacts with companies able to identify the quality of training paths in accordance with the professional figures in output by the Institute. The Institute has consolidated relationships with local companies, available to participate in the candidate selection process and moments of the final evaluation of the project and its impact.\r\nFinally Sarrocchi identified the alternating training of teachers in tutoring and counseling for 2018-2019, supplementary to the mobility actions.\r\nThe project management actions correspond to established practices as:\r\n- Signing of the MOU for single professionals;\r\n- Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the request for Vet Charter. For staff the selection criteria are as follows: experiences related to international mobility 50%, 20% language skills, 30% motivation and ability to impact at the return.\r\nDefinition of LA in collaboration with international partners\r\n- Mobilities for students and staff as following flows:\r\n25-06/ 2018: 25 students in UK, 10 students in France\r\n01-10/ 2018:  4 staff in UK and 3 staff in Malta\r\n24-06/ 2019:  15 students in UK and 15 students in Malta\r\n02-09/2019:   15 students in Spain\r\nEvaluation of the results, recognition and certification of skills and ECVET points. Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants. Secondary objective is to improve the practices and the educational offer of the school.\r\nIt confirms both the learning objectives for individuals and for the Institute strategies and its international partners. The numbers of participants in mobility have been expanded: 80 students and 7 staff.\r\nIt was predicted 5 leaders (1 for flow) for 10 days to facilitate the insertion of the students in the company and especially to facilitate their first contact with the international environment and intercultural aspects, according with new styles and customs.", "http://www.gdha.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005744_11"]]}}, "5DR": {"nhs": {"data": [["RBN", "Whiston Hospital", "nhs_RBN01"]]}}, "6NY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Boosting the profile of languages", "Rainhill High School Rainhill learning Village Multi Academy Trust", 21602.0, 1, 1, "Rainhill High school is a large secondary mixed school in a deprived area of St Helens. There are 1545 students on roll., and 5% approx. have English as an Additional Language or Special Educational Needs. as a Multi Academy Trust we have partner primary and secondary schools in the St Helen\u2019s borough and students from all kinds of backgrounds attend our school. \r\n\r\nWe offer four languages; Spanish, French, German and Italian.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase the uptake of languages beyond GCSE. It is sometimes difficult to persuade pupils to continue with language learning as they don\u2019t see languages as important, We need to improve our language teaching through new ideas and fresh ways to inspire pupils make languages enjoyable and relevant to their lives. We want them to choose to remain in our school so wish to make our language teaching as appealing and enjoyable as possible to them. Retention of pupils and to sixth form is a whole school priority.\r\n\r\nWe also want to find ways of further including all pupils of all abilities and ensure that lower ability pupils still consider language learning as important and that viable option for them.\r\n\r\nWe plan a two-year project involving international mobilities. We would like to send 10 members of staff to take part in structured immersion courses in Spain France and Germany. This will involve SLT, and teaching and support staff from MFL and from other departments. \r\n\r\nInvolvement of our executive headteacher and members of SLT will give a strong message in school about the whole system change we are making.\r\n\r\nBetter skills and more up-to-date knowledge of current language and culture will mean that our MFL staff are better equipped to teach their first and second foreign languages confidently to higher levels. This will result in improved provision for pupils, more flexibility within the MFL Department, better capacity to respond to change and more choice of which languages for pupils.\r\n\r\nThere will be a more international approach across the whole school, increasing the profile of languages, an increase in the European/international dimension across different subjects, an increase in cross curricular work and more collaboration between departments. Regular whole school staff meetings and time allocated for joint planning will enable us to share ideas and strategies across departments.\r\n\r\nParticipation will refresh our language teachers skills and increase their confidence. They will have more up-to-date knowledge of current language trends and cultural references, making teaching more relevant to our pupils. They will be exposed to new methodologies and innovative teaching approaches including ways of using ICT. They will assimilate new ideas into their teaching and find strategies and resources particularly appealing to students and encouraging them to continue learning languages. The enthusiasm and motivation of our staff will lead to better experiences for pupils, greater uptake of languages (particularly at AS/ A2), more ambitious students and a decrease in early school leaving.\r\n\r\nNon-language teachers will develop language, cultural knowledge and confidence to make the links between their own subject and languages, reinforcing a cross curricular approach. They will have the skills and knowledge to internationalise their teaching. This will mean improved, more diverse teaching skills in classrooms across the school. They will become more interested in language learning and, supported by the MFL staff, will continue to take up further opportunities to improve their language after the mobility has taken place.\r\n\r\nOur project leader has successfully managed another Erasmus+ programme, and is well aware of the need to have a well thought through project plan with SMART targets and regular review.\r\n\r\nThis is a whole school project and the impact will be felt across our whole school and beyond. We have planned our strategy carefully to ensure that the impact will be broad and long lasting. There will be regular reviews of outcomes to ensure that we are achieving the project ends.", "http://www.rainhillhighschool.org.uk/", "Rainhill High School Rainhill learning Village Multi Academy Trust", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046884_coordinator"]]}}}}
