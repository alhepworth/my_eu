These skills shortages are likely to intensify in the future. In parallel with these known skills-shortages, food & drink has grown to become a core part of the tourism experience. Problems faced by the hospitality industry include the lack of suitable skilled staff to recruit, and for SMEs, having the time and opportunity to develop their own skills. Many participants come from rurally based organisations where is is difficult to facilitate long periods of time outside of the workplace, but they can participate and benefit from a focused 7 day intensive study-tour programme.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe project will continue the process of learning and skills development in the areas of food tourism, local products and outdoor activity to create Sense of Place. It aims:\r\n- to exchange expertise and best practice in training development and delivery in relation to food tourism and provision of outdoor activities\r\n- to explore the transferability of expertise and examples of best practice and how they can be used in vocational training in UK tourism\r\n- to give trainers the chance to look beyond their own working environments and develop a European approach to training\r\n- to exchange expertise and best practice in mechanisms used to motivate the tourism industry to participate in training and education\r\n- to improve the recognition of skills within the European tourism industry encouraing tourism industry and higher education sectors to work together to develop current, relevant and fit for purpose qualifications\r\n- to build the foundation for new partnerships and facilitate future exchange/work placement activities\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\nParticipants will be recruited from private and public organisations and companies responsible for the training and development of staff within the tourism industry.  These will be staff from tourism organisations with internal vocational  training programmes, universities, colleges and independent training providers (SMEs).  All 25 participants will have a direct training and development role and will be qualified with an appropriate training qualification or have a proven track record in training. \r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe programme balances visits and opportunities to meet exemplar businesses and organisations. It includes a seminar involving 6 speakers selected for their expertise in one of the topic themes , 3 from Ireland invited by our 2 partners and 3 from within the UK participant group. The seminar will be open to local interested people to attend and to join the UK group to facilitate networking. A key output will be preparation of 3 case studies designed to engage and challenge the participants, become a valuable reference source for them back in their workplace, provide the host organsiation with different perspectives and to be a source of relevant and up to date teaching materials for academic institutions and professional organisations like the Tourism Management Institute. A \"Mystery Shopping\" exercise will provide valuable qualitative research for the host partner, and benefit study-tour participants with the ability to reassess their own place of work through fresh eyes. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nAll pre-visit preparation, travel, health and safety and financial arrangements will be delivered by The Ayrshire Chamber.  Both our Host and Intermediary partners will provide local assistance with advice relating to accommodation, transportation, speakers and eating arrangements.  \r\n\r\nResults / Impact\r\nParticipants gain a study opportunity of how Ireland has developed its Sense of Place by using a strong food, local products and outdoor activity based tourism visitor offer, capitalising on its locality and local produce. Participating organisations will exchange best practice and to share examples. Target Groups benefit from the acquired shared knowledge that leads to enhanced customer experiences and SMEs will have the opportunity for short term targeted learning and to gain confidence to form clusters and increased networks. \r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\nThe participants with work in groups to produce case studies during this study visit, which will be disseminated by all through their businesses, networks, by local and regional public sector organisations and then further disseminated to UK networks/colleagues.  The case studies and presentations from the visit will be published on websites and made available to all who wish to use them.  Academic participants will use their knowledge, as well as the case studies, to integrate into relevant current curricula and to use in future planning and development.  This project will create a positive impact towards meeting the UK Government Tourism Action Plan (2016) regarding jobs and skills development, by assisting SMEs to  compete in a national and international context.", "http://www.ayrshire-chamber.org", "The Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047209_coordinator"], [2016, "Learn, Taste, Experience - Iceland", "The Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry", 26059.0, 2, 2, "Local food and drink have increasing prominence as an economic driver of business.  It gives destinations an extra layer of distinctiveness to attract tourists and assists with international efforts to cut carbon emissions through reducing food miles and using foods when in season. Encouraging more understanding of this important sector therefore has many benefits. The project brought 20 professionals with the responsibility for developing/delivering training from the food & drink, tourism & hospitality and academic sectors to visit South Iceland for a seven day period. We considered this as an ideal duration for this type of activity, and participants had the chance to take part in a variety of visits, attend workshops and presentations without being away from the workplace for too long. As many of the participants were from small rural businesses, 7 days allowed them to study away from the workplace without too much disruption and the possible loss of productivity. There they learned about special initiatives to promote traditional foods, co-operative business marketing and tourism promotions that encourage greater understanding and increased economic benefits for the participating businesses as well as the wider destination. Over the course of the visit, the participants saw how various cluster groups have formed and the impact they are achieving. They heard from organisers of farmers markets, farm shops, developers of food festivals and gastro-tourist itineraries to encourage greater awareness and understanding. And they learned from restaurants and chefs about the importance of sourcing and promoting local food menus. Most importantly they gained an appreciation of the growing desire for authentic local experiences and the important role cuisine can play in that. Everyone was able to take ideas back to their workplace which can be developed, implemented or improved depending on individual circumstances. Our academic participants along with The Ayrshire Chamber worked together to support new delivery models and curriculum as a result of this project and its results. We encouraged participants to research some of their local specialities and to give it prominence, or possibly re-introduce it to menus wherever possible. The project provided inspiration and confidence to all participants to return to their workplace and share their knowledge with staff and peers to provide a sustainable food tourism product for the benefit of the business, the visitor and the wider economy. Iceland has a rich and varied cuisine with a colourful international reputation for some of the more traditional tastes enjoyed locally. The group learned about the techniques employed by fellow hospitality and tourism professionals to get beyond these perceptions whilst ensuring the public relations value of eating \"rotting shark\" is maintained to their distinct advantage. What is it that makes Icelandic lamb, or Icelandic seafood for example, taste so special? How can you encourage people to engage with more traditional ingredients (eg. skyr) for a positive experience? We also covered examples using presentation of foods eg. soup served inside a locally baked bread loaf, using food and drink trails to bring buyers to suppliers and some innovative social media applications used with increasing success. Our project involved 20 participants who all had direct responsibilites for the vocational training and development of staff or be involved in developing short courses and qualifications relevant for the food & drink sector (producers) and the tourism & hospitality sector (buyers). Participants were members of The Ayrshire Chamber e.g.: owners/operators of SMEs, farm shops, food producers, restaurateurs, accommodation providers, training providers, college/university lecturers and visitor attraction operators. We know, from experience, that such a Study Visit bringing together businesses across the various sectors encourages wider understanding of the others roles and opens up wider discussion/sharing of knowledge and provides the academic sector with direct, relevant and current information to build into current and future curriculum. The group produced case studies as a direct result of this study visit which were disseminated by the participants, The Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce, local and regional public sector organisations and then further disseminated to UK networks/colleagues. The case studies and presentations from the visit were published on websites and made available to all who wish to use the products. Academic participants used their knowledge, as well as the case studies, to integrate into relevant current curriculum and to use in planning and development of future curriculum. This will impact the local destination by providing and developing skills to ensure Ayrshire can compete in a european and global stage.", "http://www.ayrshire-chamber.org", "The Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023376_coordinator"]]}}, "2SA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1491004800000, 1585612800000, "AdaptiVe Area nozzle for Ultra high bypass Nacelle Technology", "Rohr Aero Services Limited", "The AvAUNT proposal seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in understanding of the aerodynamic interference challenges associated with the Ultra High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) nacelle with an integrated Adaptable Area Nozzle (AAN) to Technology Readiness Level 4.  The move towards higher bypass ratios can lead to significant reductions in emissions and noise; up to 10% propulsive efficiency enhancement and 2dB noise reductions from UHBR ~15 and above reported.  However, by lowering fan pressure ratios, fan surge problems can emerge with increasingly larger variations in flight performance between sea-level and cruise. To overcome this, the adaptive area nozzle can provide the necessary increases in surge margin at low mass flow conditions at sea-level, but at the expense of additional system weight and complexity.    \nWhile many of the potential benefits of the UHBR configuration have been substantiated for isolated nacelle configurations, there is limited understanding of the installation interference effects that will be induced at these very high/ultra high ratios, or how the incorporation of the AAN may affect the nature of these interference losses.  In the current project, early stage candidate concepts for a nacelle with AAN technology will be studied through complementary experimental and computational simulation to ascertain the interference effects induced and to propose a verified modelling methodology which can be used in advance design studies.  This will be used to inform best practice in the design of installed UHBR nacelles with AAN technology to support a move towards an integrated technology demonstrator within the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking for late 2023.", 104101.0, 1557780.0, 1, 3, "AvAUNT", null, null, null, "h2020_208821_918682054"]]}}}}
