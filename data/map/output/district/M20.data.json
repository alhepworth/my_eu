The seminar\u2019s goal is to make different youth stakeholders meet, including youth, sport and tourism ones as well as training organisations, associations for the protection of nature, unions, university and experts on the governance of mountain territories. In addition to this, these actors would work on how to favour the access and participation of young people in mountain territories and especially of those who are at risk of social exclusion, early school leavers and those who participate less in local activities for whom the lack of inclusion often leads to inactivity and violence in urban areas.The conclusion of the seminar will have a practical impact on the group \u201cJeunes et Montagne\u201d (Youth and Mountain) of the Coordination Montagne, since this group has as goal to follow up on the seminar by structuring the 2017/2020 strategy on the access of young people in mountain activities.
