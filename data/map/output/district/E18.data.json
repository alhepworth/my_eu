Production-cultivation and harvesting objectives are achieved by using magnetic nanotechnologies: superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPAN) are introduced into microalgae protoplasm in order to confer them magnetic properties. Magnetic microalgae (MAGMA) are immobilized onto a soft magnetic conical surface (SOMAC) and covered with a thin layer of continuously circulating water. A greenhouse hosts SOMAC system to exposure MAGMA to sunlight, minimize contamination and temperature-humidity uncertainties. Quantity of water is minimized and harvesting will be fast and inexpensive. These innovations permit optimum cultivation, enhance biomass productivity and dramatically lower costs of biomass production. Biomass is directly utilized by VALUEMAG multi-facilities bio-refinery for the production molecules for pharmaceutical, nutraceuticals, food additives and cosmetics. Using selected microalgae strains, natural products will be extracted by supercritical CO2 extraction, while a new selective magnetic separation method for precise selection of value-added products will be also developed. To reduce the amount of greenhouse gases realized in the environment and further lower costs of biomass, CO2 produced by transformation processes as well as water are recycled and used to enhance microalgae growth rate. All together VALUEMAG achievements will perfectly meet the demand of capturing the potential of aquatic biomass. The project outputs will bring to the market a broad variety of value-added products in sustainable way. Finally, competitiveness of the European industry will be improved since there are not pilot installations or state-of-the-art bio-refineries utilizing magnetic nanotechnology to cultivate microalgae.", 267816.0, 4187979.0, 9, 13, "VALUEMAG", null, null, null, "h2020_209762_923728867"]]}}, "2RB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Tivoli and the diversity, Edered 2017", "International Theatre Exchange", 48094.0, 10, 10, "In the summer of 2017 DATS, Danish Amateur Theatre Association, organizes an Exchange Programme for EDERED, European Drama Encounters, Rencontres Europ\u00e8ennes de Drama.\r\nIn the period from July 19th to July 30th 2017 60 young people between 15 to 18 years of age from 10 different European countries, including 6 young people from Denmark, are invited to Danish Aalborg with their theatre workshop leaders and welfare (educational) leaders.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Exchange is to create a strong theatre technical training course for the participants in an intercultural encounter with other young people for learning, inspiration and development. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a local, national and international network, which will give the young people an intercultural artistic insight. \u2013 A sense of community, bridge building and understanding between young people across cultures, languages, politics and educations. \u2013 A strengthening of the young-to-young encounter locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark we have a strong educational tradition of working with the pupil\u00b4s involvement in our educational system with a view to a democratic understanding. This particular educational practice will be used in all the planned theatre workshops in the Encounter. In this way we will make sure that the young people\u00b4s involvement will be strong in the workshops as well as in the final performance. For some of the workshops leaders from the different countries there will be a learning experience too as they will be introduced to this form of educational practice in their drama education.\r\n\r\nThe chosen theme for this Encounter is \u201cTivoli and the diversity\u201d. In Denmark we have amusement parks which we often call \u201ctivolies\u201d. We will use this theme to show the European participants what a \u201ctivoli\u201d is, but put it in another context with attention to the current flows of refugees moving through Europe, where Europe, in a way, is considered a paradise , a \u201cTivoli\u201d, by the young refugees. \r\nIn the Encounter we have the opportunity to perform in an abandoned tivoli park in Aalborg, and we will use this location as the narrative thread in our performance.\r\n\r\nWith a focus on the common democratic task that we share in Europe we need to be able to understand and consider the communities and diversities we offer other cultures to be a part of.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the European exchange is carefully chosen with reference to the diversity that young people are facing all over Europe, and also with a view to a political relevance in the present situation. It is also appropriate for the European Exchange Programme as well as for the age group. The theme is implemented in all the workshops and in the final performance.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the Encounter is that the participants, through their experiences in the workshops, will obtain an insight and an empathy but above all find themselves stronger in the understanding of the common values we share in Europe. And to express these values in a joint artistic piece of work which is shown to other young people. The theatre gives us the opportunity to express ourselves in a non-verbal language through visual imagery. This makes it possible for the participants as well as the audience to understand the message that appears after the work in the different theatre workshops.\r\n\r\nAfter the Encounter the participants will return to 60 different regions in Europe with a collective experience which they can bring on to their communities in school and in their leisure time.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA105-034151_4"]]}}}}
