Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.", 54396.0, 5416569.0, 7, 14, "RLW Navigator", null, "http://www.jaguar.com", null, "fp7_100030_986480786"], [1328054400000, 1391126400000, "An innovative environmentally friendly thermo-electric power generation system for automotive and marine applications that is powered by exhaust waste thermal energy to reduce fuel consumption", "Jaguar Land Rover Limited", "Car CO2 emissions are to be limited to 120 g/km for all new passenger cars by 2012. If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user. It is predicted that (even if the additional weight of the unit is considered) fuel efficiency will increase by at least 5%, leading to a corresponding 5% reduction in emissions.", 33016.0, 2530500.0, 5, 15, "Power Driver", null, "http://www.jaguar.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/148548.jpg", "fp7_102258_986480786"], [1351728000000, 1477872000000, "Tomorrow's Elastic, Adaptive Mobility", "Jaguar Land Rover Limited", "TEAM aims at developing systems for participants in transportation networks, which help them to behave better \u2013 by explicitly taking into account the needs and constraints of other participants and the network itself.

Staff have low levels of confidence using the latest technologies and innovative teaching methodologies in STEAM. STEAM curricula can sometimes be dated in their approach and do not always make most effective use of latest technologies.

All partners have proven experience of participating in and managing successful international projects  All partners have different levels of expertise in STEAM subjects which will enable them to benefit from working together. The project is comprised of four phases. In the first phase students consider what they want to know about STEAM subjects and how they want to be taught. They move on to examining \u2018big questions\u2019 and using Inquiry Learning Spaces such as Go-Lab. Staff develop their knowledge of innovations in STEAM teaching and learn about barriers to learning especially for girls. They develop new teaching methods such as using the Future Classroom Lab.  In the second phase students and staff begin to innovate using new technologies such as using robotics and coding.  Links are made between technology and the arts with the creation of art galleries with pictures made entirely from coding.  In the third phase students start to think about extending their learning in STEAM by considering careers in STEAM. In the final phase students create new inventions using the latest technologies and staff develop teaching methods that make effective use of multimedia technologies.Throughout the project staff and students will be encouraged to use the latest technologies to enhance learning and to develop the project. On-line courses, videoconferencing, social media, YouTube and augmented reality will be employed in a variety of ways. This will be in addition to face to face learning in lectures, learning activities and meetings with experts. We anticipate that all partner schools in the project will have developed a new and innovative teaching methodology for STEAM subjects. This will included using the latest technologies in class and using teaching methods such as flipped learning and blended learning to foster independent learning skills.  We would like staff to have a much greater understanding of how to engage female students in STEAM subjects and will be using what they have learned as part of their teaching practice.The impact of our project will be that there will be many more female students actively engaging with STEAM subjects. They will be motivated by the new teaching methods and approaches and will feel more confident that STEAM careers are open to them.  Staff will have confidence using the latest technologies to deliver an exciting and relevant STEAM curriculum.  The project will raise standards in STEAM subjects enabling students to make greater progress. This will give them more employment options in the future.Through a structured and wide ranging dissemination plan, we hope that our project has a much wider impact than just on the partner schools involved in the project.

Many participants live in areas of high deprivation and high unemployment. There are many disadvantaged families at all schools and there are many pupils with disabilities at all schools. Two of the schools provide specialist regional support for deaf pupils. All pupils will benefit greatly from this project. They will also benefit from the opportunity of working collaboratively with students from across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project will last for two years. The first year has a focus on jobs. Pupils will reflect on their strengths and interests and how they could use them in future employment. Students in higher education will talk to our pupils about their studies. Our pupils will interview family members about their jobs and experiences of education. They will investigate jobs in their locality and learn about jobs across Europe. This will culminate in a European Jobs Fair led by pupils from all partner schools.  The second year will have a focus on business skills and entrepreneurship.  Pupils will learn key business skills such as economics, marketing and project management. These skills will make them more employable and also enable them to participate in two entrepreneurial challenges. The first of these challenges will be to create a business venture run by pupils at all partner schools. The second will invite pupils to submit business plans. Those accepted will have the opportunity to run a small business for 4 weeks. There will be a range of awards including business making the most profit and company offering most support to the community.\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of a range of activities whereby pupils work collaboratively.
