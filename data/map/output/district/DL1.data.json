Also the partners will enhance the quality and learning offered in education and training by developing new and innovative approaches and supporting the dissemination of best practices. The main aspects of this project that is set up for the duration of 36 months will deal with social and emotional skills, learning abilities and teaching strategies, the awareness of the importance of a healthy life style and nurturing and the inclusion of children with special needs and refugees, asylum seekers and migrants.The project will foster the equity and inclusion in education and training and will enable quality learning for all as well as it will promote the participation of disadvantaged groups by developing social, civic and intercultural competences and media literacy.Innovative education and training will be important as teachers involved will share teaching strategies, work methods and resources for educators and learners they use in their daily school routine and that have been proven. A change of mind and attitude from individualized learning to personalized learning for the best of both the child and the society the child is living in is visioned.This project likes to support teachers to deliver high quality teaching from early childhood education on, to deal with complex classroom realities and to adopt new methods and tools for their daily school routine that are used and well known by their partners in order to improve the quality of services for better learning outcomes and to ensure a good start in education for all. The project especially aims at developing a holistic and age appropriate pedagogical framework in which the benefits will be carried through to other school education levels so sustainable efficiency will be reached.The project aims on supporting teachers in dealing with diversified groups of learners, for example, students with special needs, refugees or asylum seekers and migrants. It will adopt collaborative and innovative practices from each partner school to facilitate the learning process for all students from the beginning of their school life. By addressing underachievement in the basic skills of maths, science and literacy through more effective, innovative, ICT- and evidence-based teaching methods it tries to react on the various diversities in teaching experienced by the participating teachers every day. Therefore the project will focus especially on student centred and problem-based active learning methods using multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches and on fostering critical thinking skills by addressing the cultural and/ or environmental context in teaching sciences. The partners are willing to develop didactical materials to increase the motivation of their students in terms of learning especially in the fields of social and emotional skills, maths, science and literacy and to design necessary changes and improvements at the institutional level within their schools. Students and teachers of all schools will visit each other and get to know the best practice methods, such as Service learning, Rock and Water, Outdoor Maths, Wellbeing and Nurturing and Health education, at their partners\u00b4 school in a natural school surrounding. Afterwards they can take back these methods to their homeschools to introduce their classmates or students and colleagues to these methods to work with them and to evaluate them. There will be additional meetings with teachers from other schools to inform them on these experienced methods so that teachers from other schools also can benefit from this project without being involved directly. In addition the best practice methods and the experiences of all partner schools will be published in a digital handbook of best practice methods that will be linked to the project\u00b4s website so teachers and other people who are interested in this project will be able to get information on this project.It is important to offer as many opportunities to get in contact with people from other countries all over Europe  in a safe surrounding to keep up the European idea, even in young children, to foster tolerance and respect towards each other and to open ways to learn from each other.

There are over 600,000 refrigerated vehicles and containers in Europe and each one wastes thousands of Euros of energy each year due to poor insulation. Likewise, payback on renewable energy systems is compromised by poor thermal storage, reducing their popularity. In short, our members are wasting energy and hence losing money through a lack of optimal insulation. Currently, our options are limited to expensive, high performance materials such as aerogels and vacuum insulation panels, or low-cost but poorly-performing foams. We need a new insulation material that can fill this performance gap, offering high thermal resistance but at a cost close to insulating foams. The HIP project will develop an innovative new class of polymer insulation materials based on high internal phase emulsion templating (HIPE). HIPE materials have been used in other applications but never before for high-performance insulation. HIPE materials allow close control over porosity, pore size distribution and mechanical properties. Because of this, we can precisely engineer the thermal properties of the material within a low-cost manufacturing process. Our objective is to achieve a thermal conductivity of \u22640.015W/m.K at a cost of less than \u20ac500 per cubic metre. Compared to conventional PU foam insulation, the savings will be considerable: Based on our predicted uptake in the refrigerated transport and solar thermal markets alone, the reduced CO2 emission will be over 200,000 tonnes by 2020 and our members will save in excess of \u20ac50 million in energy costs.", 695154.0, 2183624.0, 6, 12, "HIP", null, "http://www.tica-acad.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/145859.jpg", "fp7_96236_991763600"], [1280707200000, 1375315200000, "Portable Real Time Detection of Airborne Asbestos Fibres for Tradespersons", "Thermal Insulation Contractors Association", "Asbestos-related diseases are the leading cause of occupational death in Europe. 500,000 European workers, mostly within the construction, demolition and remediation industries, are expected to die by 2030.

We feel that this level of risk is completely unacceptable for our members and must be addressed. Currently, asbestos is detected by a slow process of air sampling, with samples sent off to a lab and results being returned days later. Not only is this too late to take action, but tests are only performed if asbestos is suspected to be present. There is currently no way to detect asbestos in real-time. The ALERT project will change this. A decade ago, researchers discovered a way to detect asbestos fibres through a light-scattering technique. This work stalled due to technical and cost barriers; barriers we now believe we can overcome. We have assembled a world-leading consortium to extend this early research and develop a low-cost portable detector that can be worn by the worker to continuously monitor their work environment.
