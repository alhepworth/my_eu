Rather than improving both domains separately, POLCA takes a bold step forward by proposing a hybrid programming model that decisively increases programming efficiency in both areas and enables realisation of multi domain use cases.This model thereby allows efficient parallelisation and distribution of the application code across a highly heterogeneous infrastructure, not through automagic methods, but through exploitation of fundamental mathematical axioms behind the execution logic. The model is strongly oriented towards mathematical application cases of both domains, ranging from sensor evaluation, over monitoring-control-loops to complex simulation and modelling.

Gustave Eiffel High School of Bordeaux was chosen in 2014 to initiate this project. \r\nThis request responds to two rationales: first, a territorial reasoning, to galvanize rural areas; the other, to do with job fields, looking to support burgeoning sectors that are viewed as essential to the Aquitaine\u2019s development. For instance, the aeronautics and forestry industries. \r\nTo be successful, covering the whole territory of Nouvelle Aquitaine, we plan to integrate and support every high school and their respective European projects. Integral to the plan is to add two more high schools, one from Poitiers and another from Limoges Academies, to the about 50 high schools that are in the Bordeaux Academy.  Our ambition is to spread the Program throughout the new region \r\nGustave Eiffel High School integrates a \u201cCFA\u201d and in its desire of an internalization of the VET, helps apprentices do internships around Europe. It has been demonstrated that a short term mobility has benefits for the learners and, also, for their employers.  \r\nICT learners go on internships lasting six months, after three months of doing linguistic and cultural training. This ICT is designed to give an opportunity to young, recently graduated VET, HND and CT learners coming from Nouvelle Aquitaine High Schools, to register for training in which they will gain a valuable professional experience in a European company.\r\nThe VET learners from CFA fulfill a three-week internship in a company and have the option of validating a unit called \u201cmobility\u201d. It is essential that these learners have a professional supervisor to help them to get used to a new environment and so they can to fully take advantage of all their unique opportunity. The supervisor will also be evaluating the learning outcomes of this mobility period (e.g., reverse planning).\r\nOur aims for this Project are to promote youth employability and to offer the youth an international exposure. In fact, a lack of experience is one of the main obstacles facing the youth in their pursuit of their first jobs. \r\nOur participants improve their abilities and actively participate in the international transmission of knowledge and in opening businesses. They learn to assume responsibility and develop personal aptitudes which are useful in their future careers, leading to enhance opportunities for employment. \r\nWe want to anchor going abroad to do an internship in the VET courses and to participate in the recognition of this training that is very often disvalued. We have established a partnership with the UK ACCOR group, putting in place the ECVET system to, initially, to work with the hospitality industry. Our wish is to expand it to all business sectors at a later point.\r\nAfter the participants present and defend their internship report, they will receive a \u201cEuropass Mobilit\u00e9\u201d and a European Mobility Certificate or one of the ICT signed by the Chancellor from Bordeaux Academy and the President of the Regional Council. \r\nBecause of our concerns for equity and accessibility of mobility to disadvantaged young and rural students, we have launched an ICT Diffusion Kit (containing a video accessible to everyone to expand our audience and to adapt ourselves to different public) providing all the necessary information about the mobility and the training program. In addition to the website and social networks, we created informational brochures to be utilized (attached here).\r\nWe have taken into consideration the elements critiqued in the previous application in order to improve our practices, proving that we have the capacity to live up to VET Charter expectations. We have created an explanatory guide of the training that details the content, process and the ICT validation. \r\nA job market study was done in response to observations concerning our recruitment process of participants on the basis of the requirement of regional companies.\r\nBecause of the rejection of our application in 2017, we were unable to meet our goal of sending abroad 210 participants. But thanks to funding from the Regional Council and Erasmus+ reallocation grants, we were ultimately able to allow 77 students to participate last year.

In this project we invite volunteers from: Finland, Italy, Spain, France, United Kingdom and Cyprus.\r\nThe target groups of the host organization ARCIL are mainly children, youth and young adults with and without disabilities. The organization has from the beginning a special sensibility for the youth problems and realities. The second organization APAFF works on awareness of animal rights for the local community.  The mission of the hosting organization Cavalo Amigo is to help improve the lives of people with disabilities and special needs that can benefit from horse riding and other equine related activities. And the 4th organization Bloom works in order to support, consult, develop and implement social, cultural and educational projects with a national and international dimension, to empower initiatives and organizations, in the local community, mainly addressed to youth.\r\n\r\nHosting a young European is a good opportunity to work on awareness and inform the target groups, our team and the local community, especially young people, to the importance of inter cultural activities as a way to exchange knowledge, practices and to experience different activities.

At the same time, we know that these volunteers will be also considered like \u201csomething special\u201d for the town, people and institutions. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers are going to help the host organizations with organizing different activities like leisure time activities with children, youth and adults with and without special needs, helping in adoption campaigns for animals, awareness activities for animal rights, etc. The volunteers will give a helping hand in organizing special events, like information session on schools and promotion campaigns in fairs. The methodology we use will be based on non formal learning, inter cultural learning and learning by doing.\r\nWe hope that the volunteers can also be always a new way for information for the young people of Lous\u00e3 and Figueira da Foz: in fact, the young people living in isolated area sometimes don\u2019t know the possibilities offered by Erasmus Plus and it\u2019s one of the reasons of their no- participation.

This project will increase the motivation of young people to continue with their circus hobby and give them new ideas how to develop their activities in a way that they can get more young people interested in joining their group.

A challenge for XXI century schools)\r\nFamilies and Schools towards a new Education:\r\n\r\nOur project will deal with the idea that education shouldn\u00b4t be restricted to educational institutions. It is possible to learn in any place and within society. In order to do so, connection and cooperation between families, schools and community must exist. It is not possible to involve the family in the school dynamic if educational institutions don\u2019t recognize them as the first strategic agent of learning. A school\u00b4s first challenge should be to articulate the necessary mechanisms to understand the reality of its families.  (Education Strategy 2020).\r\n\r\nAs teachers, we should adapt ourselves to a changing world that affects us as educators, our students, and their families without knowing how much and in what ways. Nevertheless schools should offer the necessary resources so that children can adapt to a constantly changing society that requires learning to learn, learning throughout one\u00b4s lifetime, and even learning to unlearn. \r\n\r\nTeachers have to introduce changes in methodology that support  families' proposals and students' learning needs in order to educate children in a holistic way. We expect a global impact of every anticipated result of our project. Therefore, during and after its completion, we expect improvement in the following areas:  Active familial participation in schools and the development of the curriculum, families\u2019 acceptance as being educational agents, multidirectional joint organization between family and school (feedback),forms of communication, information channels, utilization of new technologies for the exchange of information, relationships with our social surroundings, broadcasting our schools\u2019 work and projects through online forms of communication, opened learning communities among European early childhood educational centers. \r\n\r\nThe three infant schools in this project consider ourselves as responsible agents of change. We should favor an educational model where not only creativity and innovation are key objectives, but also where interactive, educational projects will be implemented. Within the collaborative school-family-community triangle, these new projects will point education towards developing the necessary skills that our students need to become involved and engaged citizens in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nThe S.E.L.F. project will give our families (more than 150) the opportunity to participate in educational projects, where one will be within a European dimension. Children (more than 400 from 0 to 6 years old) will have the opportunity of being active agents in their own learning process, teachers (46) will be able to use new resources and construct a new pedagogy with families to teach curricular contents and also to facilitate communication among pupils, teachers and families. \r\n\r\nThe spaces and environments from all the different educational communities that are involved in this project will enrich the learning experience of all participants. Additionally, Institutions in this project are opening their doors and promoting learning environments, which go beyond the walls of the schools, the \"walls\" of their cities, and the \"walls\" of their countries. \r\n\r\nThis project could be used as a model to share with other schools and encourage innovation in other educational communities in the near future because anybody can learn from the knowledge and experience of other schools and take advantage of other good ideas and practices. All of these efforts share the common goal to fully educate the future citizens of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, when a discussing families\u00b4 relationship with the outside world, the fundamental key is to understand how education concerns every sector of society. Our project will focus on this is a new way of understanding the learning process.

The improvement of interpersonal skills of \u201cmobility trainees\u201d and apprentices, who have worked abroad, seems to happen incidentally. The improvement of \u201csoft skills\u201d (analytical thinking, creativity, and sense of responsibility) as well as international competency are important for the apprentices and the employers alike; especially those in commercial business dealing with office management and IT.The topic of language skills is becoming a greater factor. Due to increasing market internationalization, competency of technical English (or other world languages such as Spanish) has become requisite know-how of all applicants. Thus, strong knowledge of other languages increases individual chances on the labor market twofold.For apprentices who work in commercial businesses, the highest achievement is the successful completion of an apprenticeship abroad. For it entails a high quality vocational training, an increased dimensionality to their European identity, and the advancement of foreign language acquisition, as well as an increased knowledge of intercultural awareness.We gain to continually offer our highly motivated apprentices the opportunity to complete a 3- to 4-week apprenticeship/internship in a partner country.

Participants are the trainees who attend this business college. These students serve apprenticeships as office administration assistants, assistants in health care management, sport and fitness management assistants as well as event management assistants. The main objective of this program is to increase the mobility of the young people on the European labour market, to enlargen their language knowledge (especially acquiring authentic Business-English) and to enable them to gain intercultural experience and competences.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this project can be seen as an ideal way of introducing the advantages of the German dual education system to employers in other countries. The evalution of the English companies has always been very positive. Especially the practical knowledge combined with a high degree of theoretical background is highly appreciated by the employers in London.\r\n\r\nEach year about 20 trainees of the above mentioned professions take part in the project. When they start at H20 and at least once every year they are informed about the project at a meeting especially organised for that purpose. Those who are interested in it then must apply for participation. They apply at school but also directly with companies in London. These companies decide whom they will take on, mostly together with the organiser at H20 who is also responsible for booking flights and accommodation as well as informing about everything the participants need to know about their stay in London. \r\n\r\nNearly all participants have at least the German equivalent of a GCSE, most of them even the German university entrance qualification (similar to A-levels). This fact combined with the advantageous situation that many companies have been cooperating with our school for many years helps achieve a high level of quality of the work placements. Most companies know what to expect of the interns and try to find suitable, very often demanding tasks. Even companies that start cooperating with us mostly succeed in doing so due to the personal contact e. g. during the work placement. Companies that cannot offer suitable tasks or enough supervision very often inform us about that in order to avoid disappointment. Then they do not take on an intern that year but are of course contacted next time and in case that the situation has then improved take part in the project again. Ensuring a certain standard of quality is considered more important by us than increasing the amount of participants.\r\n\r\nIt is another advantage of the project that more and more companies in Hamburg consider sending their trainees to a work placement in London because they see that they benefit from the experience, increased competence and new contacts of their trainees. Although there are still companies that have to be convinced of this we are glad that due to the information that is spread e. g. at meetings of those who are responsible for the traineeships or on the H20 homepage people start thinking about letting their trainees particpate.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the events industry networking is an essential part of the business.

Once that connection is established, we are able to help the youth prepare for a sea of confronting situations and challenges they will encounter during their lives.\r\nYouth workers use a variety of different techniques in order to form connections with youth.
