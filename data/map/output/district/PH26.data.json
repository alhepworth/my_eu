For one week, around 30 representatives of 6 different European Protected Areas (National, Nature Parks and Natura2000 sites) will gather to explore and discover the biodiverstiy and beautiful nature of the Gauja river valley.The partners in this project are a panel of EUROPARC Federation's members, coming from different parts of Europe: United Kingdom (Scotland), Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Romania and Latvia. All of them are running a Junior Ranger programme, which main aim is to engage young people in activities and in the promotion of the protected areas they are living in or around. Therefore, participants -aged 14 to 17- of the 5 days camp are all current Junior Rangers in their Protected Area, as well as several older Junior Rangers (6 \"youth+\" aged 18 to 25) and their group leaders - Rangers or Education officer in charge of the Junior Ranger in the partner organisation. Beside discovering and enjoying the outstanding nature in Gauja, this youth exchange is a fantastic opportunity to meet and learn about other Junior Rangers accross borders. As usual, discussions along the hikings, canoe trips or visits of Gauja River Valley will focus on the work of protected areas and rangers, as well as on similarities or differences between countries.By doing and learning from nature conservation, all Junior Rangers attending this camp are developing their understanding for the role of protected areas in Europe and their passion for nature. With this camp, EUROPARC expects to contribute to train (future) citizens of Europe , advocates and guardians of natural areas, where nature conservation and biodiversity are considered as high priorities.", "http://www.cairngorms.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE04-KA105-013799_1"]]}}, "3PN": {"life": {"data": [[2011, "PIP GB - Pearls in Peril - securing the future of the freshwater pearl mussel in Great Britain", "Scottish Natural Heritage", 3748831.0, 1862473.0, "The freshwater pearl mussel (<i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>) is declining dramatically throughout its range and is under grave threat in the UK, as in other areas of its EU distribution.
