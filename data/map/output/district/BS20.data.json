Internet addiction.\u201d -\tyouth exchange on raising awareness on methods, tools and techniques against the internet, computer games and social networks usage of young people within youth work activities locally and in youth exchanges.\r\n21-30th April 2018, Birmingham, United KIngdom\r\nThemes of the youth exchange:\r\nAs youth workers all over Europe we face different challenges regarding our life style. The real \u201chot issues\u201d are computer games, social networks and the internet in general. Among young people, you are cool if you share your stories through Facebook or photos on Instagram. We can see this happening every day among us. Young people are sitting in front of computer, playing computer games, and having community life in the virtual space, then they are not able to communicate with others personally, don\u2019t learn the general social rules at all and they are lost in real life, they don\u2019t move, don\u2019t play any sport. Of course, not all young people are like that, nevertheless even according to the statistics this is a fast growing problem all around the world. As youth workers, youth leaders and young people, we have to deal with these problems, we have to show examples for young people, give information about what will happen to their life if they stop real life socializing. As one of the most important tasks of youth work how as partners we consider is to foster the understanding of young people that they are responsible for themselves and for each other regarding to their health and activity. This is our biggest challenge as youth workers, youth leaders and young people, to support and motivate our target groups to fight against the internet addiction and support them to learn becoming a useful part of their communities.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the youth exchange is to provide space and opportunity for youth workers, youth leaders of local youth organizations on supporting young people to become active citizens of Europe, sharing and exploring non\u2013formal educational methods as youth leaders and peers against the internet addiction, foster their understanding concerning the importance of tools and techniques they can prepare and use among young people in order to motivate them making more sport, live healthier and more active without computers or the internet.\r\n\r\nLearning objectives are:\r\n-\tTo share the realities concerning internet usage among young people in different countries without using the technoligies to present it;\r\n-\tTo explore different ways of active participation of young people as peers in methods, tools and techniques against social networks usage;\r\n-\tTo exchange methods how young people can become healthier and more active citizens through youth work activities and how they can motivate others making more sport, live healthier, be more active, etc;\r\n-\tTo invent tools and techniques how local youth can motivate young people to reduce the usage of the internet.\r\n \r\nThe methodology of youth exchange:\r\nThe youth exchange is based on non - formal education. It consists of non \u2013 formal, informal and formal learning elements. Based on the needs and expectations of participants. It is learner \u2013 centred and it has huge self \u2013 directed learning process. Self \u2013 assessment part will be provided and ensure several creative and participatory methods for participants. The trainers will provide several active methods and tools for participants in order to become active most of the time. Participants will work individually, in pairs, in national and mixed groups. Methods will be used: brainstorming, thought shower, creative writing, questioning, making interviews, montage, critical thinking, active listening, role plays, etc.\r\nDuring the project there will be 4 sessions per day, each 90 min long with coffee breaks between them. In the sessions will be used non-formal methods of learning such as workshops, brainstorming, facilitated discussions, problem solving initiatives, simulations, individual or team work and group tasks, practical activities, exchange of knowledge and experience, and mixture of outdoor activities.\r\n\r\nWho can participate in the youth exchange:\r\n-\tYouth workers and youth leaders representing local youth organizations who are directly working with young people with fewer opportunities, having experience of running or participating in at least one youth project in local or international level;\r\n-\tPeople who eady to take part in the whole youth exchange programme;\r\n-       People with fewer opportunities;\r\n-\tTo be able to communicate in English.\r\n\r\nEligible countries: United Kingdom, Turkey, Lithuania, Albania, Croatia and Estonia (6 +1 participants of the age between 13-30 and a group leader without the age limit from each country)\r\n\r\nPartners will share the outcomes of the project in their media channels and continue activities in their schools or NGO's to reduce the Internet usage among youth. There will be a cooperation with journalists, TV and radio to spread the information locally and regionally.", "http://www.y4f.co.uk", "Youth 4 future Ltd", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046360_coordinator"], [2017, "Intercultural Dialogue through Creative Writing", "Youth 4 future Ltd", 30287.0, 14, 14, "By training course \u2018Intercultural Dialogue through Creative Writing\u2019 we aim to increase competencies of youth workers and educators to explore ways of using creative writing as tool of intercultural dialogue and intercultural learning. The participants will have an opportunity to deeper their knowledge of creative writing, its tools, methods and techniques in relation to intercultural learning and dialogue. Moreover, the participants will directly experience various methods and tools of creative writing and reflect on the ways of applying them in their practices, in the process of fighting hate speech in participating countries, tackling roots of discrimination and establishing dialogue among different groups in the societies. \r\n\r\nObjectives of training course \u2018Intercultural Dialogue through Creative Writing\u2019:\r\no To strengthen knowledge of the participants on using creative writing as tool of innovative learning at their work with various groups of young people including young people with fewer opportunities; \r\no To increase competencies of the participants to use methods, techniques and tools of creative writing at their daily work to fully support personal and professional development of young people;\r\no To explore ways of implementing creative writing as tool of intercultural learning and dialogue;\r\no To raise awareness of the participants on the ways of using creative writing as tools of fighting stereotypes, prejudices, tackling the roots of discrimination and establishing dialogue among different groups in the society;\r\no To support sharing lessons learned across participant\u2019s countries and support exchanging good working practices in the field of creative writing at youth work;\r\no To provide the participants an opportunity to develop individual set of competencies including communication, creativity, problem solving and team work;\r\no To increase participant\u2019s knowledge on Erasmus + Programme and support developing new project ideas especially under Key Action 1 addressing the need for intercultural learning and dialogue. \r\n\r\nThe training course \u2018Intercultural Dialogue through Creative Writing\u2019 will equip the participants with range of specific competencies that will enable them to deliver creative writing methods, techniques and tools confidently and effectively. By end of the course, the participants will understand the importance of creative writing as innovative learning method and its role in youth development in the field of intercultural learning and dialogue. Also, the participants will develop their competencies (communication, presentation, facilitation, teamwork) that will enable them to open  conversation on discrimination, hate speech, stereotypes and prejudices in their communities and use a range of creative writing techniques to tackle them. Moreover, the participants and their organizations will also feel more confident to apply for or to take part in Erasmus + Programme projects and to empower young people to get actively involved in the processes of establishing intercultural dialogue, fighting discrimination and creating inclusive Europe.  \r\nThe training course will be based on using non-formal learning methods and techniques that will be tailored to the needs of the participants. They will take part in interactive lectures, debates, simulations. They will have an opportunity to work with colleagues from other countries in mix groups and directly experience the methods, techniques and tools of creative writing. Regularly, they will take part in reflection evaluation activities to ensure that the goals and aims of the project are being met. \r\nThe training course \u2018Intercultural Dialogue through Creative Writing\u2019 is prepared and applied by Youth 4 Future Ltd, representing United Kingdom in cooperation with partners from Lithuania ,Albania, Republic of Macedonia,  Poland, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal , Romania, Czech Republic, Kosovo, Turkey and Spain. \r\nThe training course will take place in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

It significantly affects the concentration of greenhouse gases and it threatens electrical and electronic devices, in particular, when placed on elevated structures like wind turbines or aircraft, and when these structures are built with modern composite materials with inherently low electric conductivity. In addition, even our fundamental understanding of atmospheric electricity is far from complete. New discharge processes in the atmosphere above thunderstorms have been discovered, the so-called Transient Luminous Events (TLEs)   in the stratosphere and mesosphere, and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) that emit particle beams of antimatter. These phenomena demand thorough investigations, in geophysics and in the related fields of plasma and high-voltage technology where similar discharges appear.\nThese challenges are approached within the SAINT project with a multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial training platform for 15 ESRs. The platform brings together satellite and ground observations with modelling and lab experiments. It couples scientific studies to applications relevant to industries developing satellite data products, plasma discharge technologies, lightning detection systems and lightning protection devices.  \nWith SAINT, we take advantage of the extraordinary opportunity presented by three simultaneous space missions with dedicated instruments to study lightning discharges, TLEs and TGFs, to integrate the unique space data with dedicated novel ground observations, model developments and lab experiments.
