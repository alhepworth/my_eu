Fortunately, this problem can be transformed into an opportunity, as large volumes of resources (materials,energy & land area) in these LF can be recovered through LF Mining (LFM). In order for LFM to be widely implemented in the NWE region RAWFILL tackles the remaining barriers. The main challenge for stakeholders is the profitability risk due to the lack of reliable data on the recovery potential of LF. Even in the NWE region, inventories of the 100,000 LFs are inadequate, as they lack relevant data on LFs economic potential (quantity,quality & value of materials). Furthermore, traditional LF exploration methods are prohibitively expensive as they require analysis of multiple excavated waste samples.RAWFILL develops 1) an evidence-based,cost-effective standard LF inventory framework (EIF) , 2) innovative LF characterisation by geophysical imaging and guided sampling demonstrated on 2 pilot sites and 3) an associated Decision Support Tool (DST) to allow smart LFM project prioritisation.To interact with the stakeholder community,RAWFILL relies on (digital) promotional & technical materials and participates at/organises public events & training.To sustain long term roll-out of profitable LFM projects, RAWFILL institutes dedicate topic groups, installs & maintains an electronic library, trains ambassadors and ensures academic and extracurricular training.The impact of RAWFILL is guaranteed by long term involvement of all RAWFILLs partners/associated partners&key stakeholders.Beneficiaries are public&private LF owners, their managers&operators.After 10 years, 60 profitable LFM projects, throughout NWE, are expected to have been launched leading to the recovery of 15 Mtons of valuable materials & the creation of 1.500 jobs", 1489622400000, 1584230400000, 175206.0, "nweurope_41_6"]]}}, "5HP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Embedding the European Dimension into our curriculum - step one: mindfulness", "Crossdale Primary School", 12225.0, 1, 1, "The UK currently has a problem with teacher workload, stress and retention due to demanding school priorities, the constant pressures to improve, social issues (e.g, deprivation) affecting the children in their care and severe budget cuts. Consequently, extra-curricular foci, ranging from multiculturalism to environmental action, are often overlooked as school staff are simply not able to fit these activities into their schedules. This results in children missing out on the experiences which would not only enrich their lives, but give them access to a whole plethora of skills and new interests. \r\nOur school is currently engaging with a range of projects to help counteract this by working to embed different extra-curricular activities (e.g. language tandem schools, School Council and Eco Council) into our everyday timetables. Whilst we have achieved some successes, staff workload is still a barrier to taking this further, and at times staff are stressed and exhausted, which means that there is limited enthusiasm for such projects. \r\nAfter conducting a survey across our teaching staff, we found that mindfulness would be an effective technique for improving not just staff wellbeing, but also that of the children in our care too. We found that improved staff wellbeing would result in staff feeling more confident and able to invest extra time into such extra-curricular activities. Most staff felt that they would like to impart mindfulness techniques to their classes but were unsure of how to go about this and were worried that they would teach it incorrectly; our research also indicated that mindfulness taught incorrectly can lead to undesirable consequences. We therefore felt that staff training on mindfulness would have numerous benefits for the wellbeing of our school community and we are very keen to learn more about it. However we believe that a mindfulness course taking place in a different country would be far more beneficial than one run locally because of the impact that it would have on staff engagement and enthusiasm for our school European Development plan.\r\nOur school is located in a very small town, and only a minority of pupils come from a non-British background. We therefore developed our school European Development plan last year to promote multiculturalism and multilingualism. By taking part in a training course in Europe, staff will be energised and engaged with this development plan as not all participants have had experience of working in, living in or visiting another European country. By taking part in a course abroad we will be able to share ideas with professionals across the European community, contribute to discussions which would benefit a range of different partners, share links and network to support our international colleagues, and really bring home to the school the importance of international collaboration. \r\nThe results that we aim to achieve from this project are improved staff and student wellbeing, which will lead to the successful incorporation of extra-curricular activities into our daily schedules. This will in turn benefit the development - socially, morally and culturally - of the children in our care, enabling and empowering them to be global citizens which are keen to involve themselves in the international world. We hope that the project will have a 'snowball' effect, strengthening our European links and involvement, not just with ourselves but also with the other schools in our academy trust. As a trust all eight schools meet regularly to share good practice and implement shared policies - we hope for this to be one of those.", "http://www.crossdaleschool.com/", "Crossdale Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047339_coordinator"]]}}}}
