The project builds strongly on the shared experience with these colleges over time and incorporates several innovative elements to improve the student experience: evolved preparation especially language preparation; enhanced and innovative selection processes; longitudinal integration with academic curriculum to embed the experience within the academic career of the students and provide for continued experience in Tenerife and elsewhere.  The latter achieved through development of international collaborations particularly in the tourism sector which bring together both college partners and critically their students and organisations in Tenerife in long term promotional activities.\r\n\r\n The work placements provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife.  The roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving talks to tourists on nature and cultural activities in Tenerife, working at the Visitor Centre in Puerto Colon, with animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups, developing contacts with specialist culture, nature and activity tourism providers on a local level and supporting them in accessing the global tourist market, both in Tenerife and through the internet.\r\n\r\nStudents receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success. \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that are unavailable to them in the UK.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and generally opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.
