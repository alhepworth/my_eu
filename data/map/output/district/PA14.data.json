Those legislations as well as emission taxes and an increasing public awareness on green shipping have led to the fact, that low emission ships and shipping has become a key competitive factor both for European shipbuilders (including equipment manufacturers and shipyards) and shipping companies.\n\nIn response to topic SST.2013.1-2 of the Sustainable Transport Work Programme 2013 the JOULES proposal aims to significantly reduce the gas emissions of European built ships, including CO2, SOx, NOx and particulate matters.\nJOULES follows an integrated and holistic approach, not only limited to integrating the components of the simulation of the energy grid, but through the consideration of other viable options for emission reduction.\n\nThe specific optimal solutions for emission reduction and energy efficiency highly depend on the transport or service task of ships, as well as on their operational profile. While a wide overview and holistic assessment of all available energy and emission saving technologies is necessary, industrial breakthrough can only be achieved if the available solutions are selected, adopted, integrated, assessed and finally demonstrated for realistic application cases.

Currently all 11 classes are learning the French language throughout daily and weekly routines of a Roman Catholic school. This is achieved by incorporating French vocabulary and culture in planning and implementation of a range of contexts including daily prayer. Saint Michael\u2019s Primary cherish the fundamental relationships with our families and community. We recently celebrated our interrelationships and successes in our language learning through a French Open Day. This rewarding event enabled our pupils to share in their success whilst experiencing the French culture through a relaxed and authentic ethos. Through parental involvement and partnership with our local community, our school have developed a shared vision for the cultural and educational teaching and learning of French.

Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. Improved tactical, technical, physical and mental competences for participants as a direct result of mobility.\r\n2. Improved employment rates for mobility participants either as a professional footballer or in alternative career pathways.\r\n3. Accreditation and validation of mobility informal learning and soft skills.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within Europe.\r\n5.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers.

A greater public awareness, the need to protect natural resources and increase the food safety requires the development and implementation of new environmental regulations. There is therefore an urgent need to address this negative environmental impact of salmon farming. To date, two means are available 1) preventing fish escaping by improving cage design and containment or 2) produce sterile fish. Although considerable technological advances have been made in the design of cage systems, no system will be fully reliable as escapees through natural disasters are inevitable. Therefore, there is a clear need to revive the previously abandoned triploid concept as the only means, known to date, to address the environmental impact of escapees contributing to genetic pollution. Furthermore, the production of sterile fish would be very beneficial to salmon breeders as a way to protect their domesticated stocks which are the result of long and costly selection processes aiming to improve important traits such as disease resistance, growth performance and flesh quality. Triploidy would also alleviate early maturation problems and subsequent welfare associated infringements and decreased quality standards. However, prior to discussing the potential implementation of such a radical change within the salmon farming industry, previously based on equivocal results, a sounder understanding of triploid requirements and performances is needed at a commercial scale given the significant advancement in rearing protocols made throughout the production cycle over the last decades. It is only through the establishment of a strong trans-national collaboration supported by key players of the salmon industry that such a project can be undertaken.", 262744.0, 1160651.0, 5, 9, "SALMOTRIP", "http://www.salmotrip.stir.ac.uk/", "http://www.swim-back.com", null, "fp7_92644_999534949"], [1325376000000, 1483142400000, "Advanced Research Initiatives for Nutrition & Aquaculture", "Landcatch Natural Selection Limited", "Sustainable development of European fish farming is dependent on the availability, environmental sustainability of feeds relying less and less on capture fisheries derived  fishmeal and fish oil.
