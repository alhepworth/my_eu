Children and teenagers today have grown up around this \u201cphenemon\u201d and can harly imagin not to be able to snapchat, istagram or google things. They learn how to use youtube often before they can talk and play games with their friends, whom they have possibly never met over the internet. \r\n\r\nThe side effect of this brilliant thing is that many teenagers of today, lack certain social skills, they know how to play if there is a computer or a mobil at hand but struggle to play with out it. The problem is often that they don\u2019t know any games, and feel akward being face to face with others, and reliving their true identity. \r\n\r\nThe objective of our event is to teach youth leaders how to use physical games to //// activate //// young people and strengthen their social skills and therefor hinder the risk of social isolation. \r\n\r\nThe event will focus on youth leaders working with children, teenagers and young adults. We hope to gather participants from at least 8 countries with experience in youth work. The number of particpats will be 40 of them at least 15 will be from Iceland, where the event will take place.  \r\n\r\nDuring the event teachers from three countries will teach games and methods to use. Workshops will take place where youth leaders from different countries can share their experience. \r\n\r\nWe hope that after the event each participants \"tool box\" will be bigger and that we have learnt how to successfully use games as a teaching method. In Iceland we have already planed youth event during the last weekend of October - where the theme will be games and helping young people to engage in physical activities, and we hope similar events will then take place in our members organisations.

While investigating the curiculla situation that are offered for the Lithuanian and Latvian pupils on the vocational education basis it was found out that none of vocational education institutions offer this kind of programme for pupils.  Latvian and Lithuanian school directors understanding about the necesity of such curricula and the opportunities for pupils to be employed after graduating this curricula decided to prepare the project and using the know how of other European Union countries having the experience working with alternative and renewable energy technicians programme or its development. 5 partners from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the UK and Germany agreed about the importance and potential of such programme and prepared the project \"Green, greener, the greenest wind, water, the world\". The main goal of this strategic partnership project is using the experience and knowledge of project partners to create \"Alternative and renewable energy technician curiculla\" for Latvian and Lithuanian partners.   \r\nIn order to achieve this goal the following objectives have been set: \r\n1. To get acquainted with the experience and knowledge of all participating project partners in the alternative and renewable energy sector in their countries (5 blended mobilities for the teachers, experts of the project partner institution will be organized, total 8 participants from 5 countries, who will work on the creation of the curriculla); \r\n2. To organize round table discussions with labour market representatives in Latvia and Lithuania in order to find out the required competences the pupils should have for successful integration into labour market. \r\n3. To organize multiplier events in Latvia and Lithuania in order to share the gained experience and to present the created curricula to the public and stakeholders.

The Scottish government proposes that by 2020 all Scottish children from Nursery upwards will be learning a second language and a third language will be introduced from Primary 5.  To be ready for this, and to work alongside our local authority's approach to 1+2 languages, we need to address the learning and teaching of Modern Languages in our school.  Our cluster Secondary School has selected Spanish as the language to be introduced from Nursery and French to be taught from P5 onwards.  \r\n\r\nOur project aims to improve staff knowledge of the Spanish language and culture.  The project will enhance our teaching methodologies, including the use of ICT, and will guarantee that staff are trained, motivated and enthusiastic when sharing Spanish with pupils.  As a large school, which has dramatically increased in size over the last nine years, we need to ensure consistency in our approach and in the standard of learning and teaching of Spanish.  We also wish to broaden our international connections by setting up a link(s) with a Spanish school through eTwinning.  It is hoped that by implementing these objectives, Spanish will become embedded into daily school life and will be central to our curriculum development and planning. \r\n\r\nThree staff members have been selected to participate in a Languages for Education Europe (LFEE) Spanish Immersion Course in Malaga in July 2017.  The course will improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish and will provide participants with resources suitable to bring back to our school.  It will help to develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain, and will improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in Spanish.  It will incorporate the use of ICT resources in teaching Spanish.  After attending the language course, the participants will provide staff training to share their knowledge and highlight the new resources acquired.  This will enable the staff of 75 members to take Spanish learning and teaching forward, benefitting the 700 school pupils. \r\n\r\nRegular events and celebrations will be organised within the school to promote the importance of language learning and cultural awareness.  This will help to involve and inform parents, as well as the wider school community, of how our school is improving its learning and teaching of Spanish.  We will embed Spanish within the curriculum, using it in daily classroom life and introducing it through interdisciplinary projects.  Staff and pupil groups will be established to take forward Spanish within the school helping to gain fresh and new ideas.  This will provide children with a wide and rich range of Spanish learning activities to develop literacy and language skills .  This will enable them to become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens; skills at the heart of the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence.  \r\n\r\nThis project will benefit all staff and pupils as well as the wider school community.  In the short-term, it will improve staff confidence and competence in teaching Spanish, whilst increasing our range of teaching methods and resources.  In the long term, we will have improved our school curriculum and linguistic ability in both staff and pupils.  We will be helping pupils to act as global citizens having made links with a Spanish school and brought a European dimension to our curriculum.  We will be equipping our pupils with essential life skills, getting them ready for the world of work.", "http://www.kinnaird.falkirk.sch.uk", "Kinnaird Primary", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035962_coordinator"]]}}}}
