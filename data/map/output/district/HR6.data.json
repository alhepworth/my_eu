It is a major problem in the dairy industry, costing European farmers tens of millions of Euros annually. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is used as a main indicator of mastitis, as the number of somatic cells in milk increases in response to infection in the udder. Krysium Technologies has developed and patented LacDetect\u00ae \u2013 an innovative, portable, economic test system allowing reliable and truly rapid detection of sub-clinical mastitis on-farm based on enumeration of SCCs via ATP-luminescence technology. This allows farm workers and veterinarians to make quick decisions on herd management and avoid significant costs associated with clinical mastitis. Furthermore, as SCC is also used as a measurement of milk quality, dairy producers base their milk pricing policy significantly on SCC values in raw milk. LacDetect\u00ae will enable recording of SCCs on-site for payment purposes. LacDetect\u00ae is at Technology Readiness Level 6. Initial testing has repeatedly shown results from our prototype test system compare very favourably with those from a major milk laboratory. In this Phase I project we intend to review the specification of LacDetect\u00ae, to ensure that production costs are reduced and that the end-product specification meets user requirements. We will re-contact and add commercial partners for field testing and commercializing plus explore other routes to market. On completion of Phase I we intend to progress to a Phase II project during which we will carry out final product development, scale-up manufacture, validation and final customer trials prior to commercial launch of LacDetect\u00ae initially in key EU markets. Completion of the overall project will deliver a one-minute, on-farm raw milk test system enabling EU farmers to detect problems in dairy cows early, enabling better antibiotic treatment decisions, improved production, reduction in costs, higher margins, better animal welfare and less environmental impact.", 36069.0, 51528.0, 1, 1, "LacDetect", null, null, null, "h2020_196167_937966915"]]}}, "8JH": {"nhs": {"data": [["RLQ", "Leominster Community Hospital", "nhs_RLQ06"]]}}, "8QA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1314835200000, 1488240000000, "International Research Consortium on Dengue Risk Assessment, Management, and Surveillance", "Environmental Research Group Oxford Limited", "The overall concept of this research project is to assemble a consortium of international experts working together to develop new and innovative tools to be applied to the control of dengue in a global context.

All of the current electro mechanical devices have a carbon footprint with daily visits to remove dead animals and rest / re bait them.

However, freezing animal and plant tissues causes many irreversible physical and chemical changes within the food matrix, often leaving the final product with lower eating quality than when it was in the fresh state. Ice crystals represent one of the key contributors to quality degradation in frozen foods. As they grow in size, they exert additional stresses on fragile cellular structures and can damage emulsions and lead to negative product characteristics such as poor appearance, unacceptable texture and physical and nutritional product damage. In short, smaller ice crystals promote a better quality product and control of the crystal size distribution in the final product is one of the most important aspects for many freezing operations.  As quality issues take increasing precedence among EU consumers, a key challenge facing frozen food manufacturers is how to reposition their products as health-friendly. Consumers not only instinctively believe that fresh food tastes better than frozen food- they also see frozen foods as cheap and inferior. In response, this project will build upon promising research in the ability of high powered ultrasound (HPU) to initiate ice nucleation and to control crystal size distribution in the frozen product during solidification of liquid food. Past research has also shown promise for HPU to shorten the freezing process and lead to a product of better quality.

PiedPiper Technology is a revolutionary safe and humane pest control system for the control of rats, mice and other pest populations. It is the first solution that does not rely on the ingestion of toxin by rodents. It comprises a novel pest control device (PCD) incorporating an aerosol that delivers a metered dose of toxin onto the back of the rodent sufficient to kill in one application. The toxin passes through the skin and a quick and humane death results within 48 hours (compared to weeks with currently available products) to ensure that future populations of rodents will not develop resistance to the new toxin. This is a breakthrough versus the current multi-feed anticoagulants that are creating a growing problem of highly toxin resistant rodents (super rats).
