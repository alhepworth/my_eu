In 2009 we started with three interns abroad - in 2014/15 we had and have more than 20 students who did and still do placements for 6 weeks or for one year at our partner organisations all over Europe. For the first half of 2016 we have already arranged 15 mobilities among which 6 are long-term stays.Besides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for short and long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2016 is again to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences, widen their horizons, and possibly motivate them to go abroad again for a longer period. Therefore,  we are especially interested in pushing short term mobilities for educators by offering  low-threshold placements at bilingual institutions. But since we still have a larger number of grants at our disposal from 2015, this strategy will have quantitatively no impact on this application. Offering the chance of successfully completing the whole \"year of acknowledgement\" abroad still remains an important objective for us, and is one of our college's special features. Since we are putting this into practice since 2009, we have by now developed well-tested administrative structures. Grant support for long-term mobilities for Italy, France, England, Turkey and Austria are spread between both groups of trainees, educators and educational therapists.Moreover, we would like to perpetuate the opportunity to apply for staff training and teaching mobilities.

The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.

On the one hand for a teaching assignment of one of our arts teachers at our partner organisation in Palermo, Italy. In cooperation with the local staff, she wants to offer a creative workshop for children and teenagers entitled \"Imagining Ideal Living\". This workshop might hopefully initiate a strategic partnership in the long run. On the other hand we apply for a staff training mobility for one of our foreign language teachers and project co-coordinators in form of a job shadowing/observation period at our partner schools in England. The main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into the British educational system. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our interns at English partner institutions and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\".

Altogether we would like to offer 7 short term mobilities for educational therapists at institutions in Austria and 7 short term mobilities for educators at institutions in Austria and Denmark. 14 long term mobilities we would like to offer to educators and educational therapists at institutions in Italy, Turkey, Austria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that we might not be successful in achieving our last objective as requested, because the new Erasmus+ grant support for long term mobilities for German students has been cut considerably (around 30 % compare to the former Leonardo grant support). The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, would need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.

K\u00e4o Elementary School has been running for the past three years, therefore getting important information from other schools\u2019 experiences could be necessary. Even though it is possible to find similar schools in Estonia, teachers still need to further their knowledge in other countries where they have longer history in that field. K\u00e4o Elementary School works closely with K\u00e4o Day Care Center \u2013 it enables students to get different therapies (occupational therapy, music therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc.). K\u00e4o Day Care Centre educators help students during their schoolday and in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe main goals for the project are:\r\n- examine the use of intensive interaction and ABA, which are essential part of working with autistic children. According to K\u00e4o Elementary School, these methods are not widespread in Estonia.\r\n- examine different augmentative and alternative communication opportunities that are used in UK special needs schools\r\n- examine different opportunities for sensory rooms\r\n- get knowledges about planning a lessons and schoolday for students with severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disabilities \r\n- get knowledges about how teachers cooperate with other professionals (social workers, occupational therapists, music therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists etc.).\r\n\r\nThere will be three teachers participating in the job shadowing in special education schools in England. All the teachers have their own (home)groups. Additionally, they teach following subjects to all studens: cognition and perception; art and fine motor skills; social relationships and group work. Therefore teachers need to use augmentative and alternative communication and intensive interaction every day. Even though all the partner schools have students with severe with severe cognitive/ developmental disabilities, each school has an individual approach that the teachers from K\u00e4o Elementary School would like to familiarize with. \r\n\r\nDuring the job shadowing, teachers can broaden their knowledge and get practical experience working with similar study methods. Gained knowledge could raise the competency that again would help to create better environment for a personal growth in obtaining secondary education according to ones capabilities. With this current project, K\u00e4o Elementary School is also hoping to find long time partners from abroad with whom the partnership could continue even after the project. \r\n\r\nThe main communication between partners will take place via email (through the contact person of the school).

Those who start formal education at a disadvantage compared to their peers are likely to remain at a disadvantage throughout their life, and be in greater danger of economic and social exclusion.  They are also more likely to contribute to the education drop-out rates the EU wishes to reduce, and less likely to participate in tertiary education.  However, despite this, the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those practitioners in early years care and education (ECEC) continues to lag behind that of educational professionals working with older children.  For this group of, often lower paid, workers, opportunities to learn from best practice elsewhere, particularly transnationally, are severely limited.  At the same time, there is now greater focus on the contribution wellbeing plays in an individual\u2019s life chances, particularly in the early years.  The Comenius TODDLER project has already identified best practice and developed materials relating to toddler wellbeing.  However, proper training and the development of a holistic approach is vital to bring about a real change in practice for this important group.\r\nToWe therefore aims to provide a unique continuing professional development opportunity for early years practitioners (EYPs) in the three partner countries \u2013 Norway, Spain and the UK, focussing on the needs of disadvantaged toddlers.  Alongside this, and with full stakeholder engagement, the project will also develop a suite of training materials incorporating tools and strategies which will be of practical use to EYPs in the partner countries and beyond.\r\nThe CPD will involve two short-term training visits.  The first will allow the practitioners to be trained in the use of updated TODDLER and new ToWE tools and materials.  The second visit will enable these practitioners to participate in job shadowing in another partner country.  These CPD opportunities will not be stand-alone events, but will be integral to the creation of the eventual  materials, as participants\u2019 experience will feed into the development of all tools and strategies.  This feedback will be ongoing as they use the developing materials in their own settings and participate in local focus groups.  This will also contribute to a detailed impact study of the materials\u2019 use by practitioners, giving practical case studies as examples. Three HEIs will provide the robust academic underpinning of the materials, which will be complemented by this practical feedback.  Quality will be further ensured by an external evaluation liaison group, drawn from key players in the field.\r\nThe tools and strategies will provide a holistic approach to ECEC for disadvantaged toddlers and focus on three key areas which have previously been identified \u2013 toddlers\u2019 voice and expressions; meal times and toddlers with an additional language.  A wellbeing audit tool, with strategies, will underpin all areas.  All ToWe tools will be openly accessible and three national workshops will disseminate the training materials and impact study to practitioners in the partner countries.  National participants will be able to cascade this learning to their own colleagues in early years settings and local authorities/municipalities.  In addition, an International Trainers' Workshop will be held, aimed at academics and training institutes in this field, to promote the embedding of this approach in future research and training.\r\nThrough the provision of CPD and real practical tools to facilitate a change in practice, towards a more holistic approach to ECEC, this project aims to raise the quality of ECEC in the partner countries and beyond, increasing the opportunities for disadvantaged toddlers and provide them with a better start to their lifelong learning journey.", "http://www.achievingforchildren.org.uk", "KINGSTON UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013431_2"]]}}}}
