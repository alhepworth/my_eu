Romania is a new partner selected for the reason that they have many affected children facing the danger of social exclusion and early school leaving.\r\n\r\nDue to the very challenging circumstances all the partnerschools are dealing with, all the schools have numerous learners with disadvantaged backgrounds. (Marriotts' school and Ipsia Cattaneo: situated in urban problem zones, Zespol Szkol Elektronicznych i Ogolnoksztalcacych, Przemysl and \u015ecoala Gimnazial\u0103 \u015eura Mic\u0103: situated in remote areas, Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Secundaria Abyla, Ceuta: situated in a peripheral region, Edinburgh college and Leksands Kommun Sammilsdalskolan: cultural differences integrating many immigrants and refugees.) During the last project (www.gfgm2012.com), the topics of resilience, good practices to face impacts of trauma in the daily school life were already identified as important for all partners. A brochure about trauma and school was written by two partner schools and disseminated among all partners. It turned out that all partners have their special knowledge, competences and sensitivity to the topic. Therefore, we came along to choose \"trauma and school\" as the main topic to head together to new solutions and good practices dealing with afflicted and even traumatised students. \r\n\r\nWe have split our project in a strategic and a teaching level. The strategic level consists of the topic \"trauma and school\" and addresses teachers, heads of schools, social workers, that means experts in a pedacogical field.\r\nOn the strategic level, the title \"YESTERMORROW\" makes understandable that the past of our students has an impact on their future. With a present where the new knowledge how to meet with traumatised and impaired students is applied we can increase their chances for a better 'tomorrow'. This knowledge is based on the new technology of functional brain imaging and neurobiological science. The integration of neurobiological science in the pedagogic daily life makes our project highly innovative and applicable to all schools. The adaption of the brochure to new tendences, the publishing of good practices on our project-website will disseminate our outcomes among teachers and social workers. We are convinced that it will help to reduce ESL and contribute to the development of a European Area of Skills and Qualifications. \r\n\r\n\"YESTERMORROW\" on the teaching levels means including mainly the subject history (= yesterday) and the subject ICT, maths (=tomorrow) to enable our students to improve their basic and advanced skills. Integrating the gained knowledge about trauma in the didactic approach by teachers we will enhance better skills even with weak learners. The method of project based learning and peer-learning will help to adapt to the skills of all students and challenge good learners too. These outputs will be disseminated on Wiki platform linked to our project website and is accessible by everyone. The teaching experiences will give us interesting inputs about the efficiency of our methodology. That means that the horizontal strategic and teaching levels are vertically linked in both directions.\r\n\r\nOur new Partnership YESTERMORROW is built mainly with partners with whom we have already carried out project activities successfully.  (See the website of our previous project: www.gfgm2012.com).  Therefore the partners in the project have already tested their capacity of planning and management of the agreed activities, the habit of working together, their intercultural approach, the possibility of working on teaching methodologies that will be shared and that will become shared contents. We know and will apply effective methods of evaluation to stick to the agreed content and to get the best value possible for everyone. Disseminating our outputs results will be a main issue of our work.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits for the schools and countries involved as well as Europe as a whole are evident. Our outputs (the brochure, cases with objects, videos on youtube, collection of good practices, etc. everything translated in different languages) will help integrating children with learning difficulties, with emotional behavioural and social difficulties. That means that the pedagogical skills of the involved teachers must be raised and the often tabooed topic \"trauma\" and \"traumatised children\" have to be priorised. Our outputs help to do this in an efficient and effective way.\r\n\r\nIn addition to child maltreatment which occurs in families we face a world where so many people are displaced (more than after World War II) where war is threatening people within Europe which can traumatise them. That means we have to work on methods to improve mental health and resilience in a scolar environment too.", "http://www.marriotts.herts.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA219-012259_6"]]}}}}
