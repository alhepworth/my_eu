However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 645448.0, 13189031.0, 5, 15, "TRANSEURO", "http://www.transeuro.org.uk/", null, "/docs/results/images/2012-10/52712.jpg", "fp7_94248_959940228"], [1464739200000, 1590883200000, "PET Imaging in Drug Design and Development", "Imanova Limited", "The drug development strategy currently pursued by the pharmaceutical industry worldwide is inefficient and unsustainable for the health care system. To keep the latter affordable, drug development should become more efficient and drug treatment should become more \u201cpersonalized\u201d and \u201crationalized\u201d. Molecular imaging can play a pivotal role in changing the landscape of drug design/development and improving the health care system. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, in particular, is the technology that has the potential to lead this fundamental innovation by providing at a much earlier stage reliable answers to key questions emerging during the care cycle: what and where is the disease? Is the disease accurately targeted by the therapy? Is the treatment effective? By answering the questions above, PET imaging has the capacity to render much more effectively the transition from pre-clinical to clinical phase, and to strongly facilitate the development of better drugs at an earlier stage and in a much more sustainable manner. The main obstacle to this change of paradigm in drug design and development is the lack of suitably trained translational scientists directly involved in PET imaging and imaging scientists with high-profile training in chemistry and PET-radiochemistry, which is particularly dramatic in Europe. This consortium is ideally suited to fill this gap, by providing top-quality training to the next generation of translational PET imaging scientists who will play a key role in shaping the future of drug design and development.

New scientific evidence about the importance of early years comes from the fresh brain research (Shonkoff, 2001; Greenspan & Shanker, 2004, Mustard, 2010). The World Bank has recommended investment to early education in 2005 based on available evidence. The earlier projects of our team have produced some methodological recommendations. On this bases the following objectives are set for the project:\r\n1. To develop culturally relevant narrative play and learning environments in each country (classroom/school) as a result of new narrative pedagogy.\r\n2. To develop evaluation practices of narrative play and learning practices in classrooms (recording and evaluating play interactions, relation between co- and self-regulation, use of ICT \u2013 technology, and etc.).\r\n3. To develop NEPL guidelines for dissemination and further training of ECEC professionals in all participating countries.\r\nParticipants \r\n1. International multidisciplinary scientific team LEU, Lithuania (4 persons), UKW, Poland (3 persons) and HY, Finland (3 persons).\r\n2. Practitioners in Finland, Lithuania, United Kingdom and Poland (12 kindergarten/school teachers)\r\n3.

After each teaching/learning and training session international scientific team together with the teachers-practitioners reflect and prepare recommendations for the next narrative play project in a new country. \r\nIII phase - as a result of teaching/learning and training activities in spring 2019, international scientific team in collaboration and following recommendations of practitioners will prepare a package - NELP guidelines for new ECEC teachers. This material will be presented during dissemination seminars to the new teachers in each country (Finland, Poland, Lithuania, United Kingdom).\r\nMethodology - a preliminary methodology how tales and stories are transformed to children\u2019s imaginary learning environments is published in Hakkarainen & Bredikyte (2013). The methodology will be enhanced and elaborated. Video taping will be used for collecting data at different sites. The scientific team will be elaborating evaluation methods.\r\nResults - child development and learning will be enhanced while using child friendly learning approach. Methodological awareness and professional competences of teachers will grow (this can be seen in pilot study results).
