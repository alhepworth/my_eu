Currently, we teach technical degrees in hairdressing and aesthetic technician. We also impart 12 certificates of professionalism linked to the professional family of Personal Image.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Erasmus experience began in 2009 with the obtaining of our first letter ECHE (Higher Education). It was complicated, but today we can say that we have established, and consolidated, links with companies in the sector. Since 2014 we started the Erasmus projects for FP, having managed to implement 100% of the mobilities requested. Our commitment to internationalization is firm and we want to consolidate and improve it with this fourth initiative.\r\nAs a sending institution, our FP project focuses for the moment on mobilities of students for internships, taking advantage of the possibility of curricular validation through the FCT (Internship in Work Center). Although we must note that we also make mobilities for students and teachers of Higher Education.\r\nWe are also very active as host partners. We are always open to incoming activities for both teachers and students with similar skills. Having received this past year students from our specialties in Poland and also pending receipt from France.\r\nThroughout our experience as a shipping institution we have managed to consolidate our relationship with our partners in both Poland and the United Kingdom, where we have counterpart partners, small specialized companies in the personal image sector and also, in the case of Poland, with the help of intermediary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this new edition, we have requested 4 mobilities for VET students; 2 for Poland and 2 for the United Kingdom. The number of scholarships will be distributed proportionally among the specialties and existing groups. If in some group or specialty there were not enough interested (a circumstance that is very unlikely given the success of the current project), that / s place / s would pass to the other group / specificity. In principle, they will be aimed at students of the intermediate degrees of the Hairdressing and Aesthetic specialties, but we consider the possibility of opening the experience to students of certificates of professionalism.\r\nThe beneficiaries of this project that will be part of their curriculum and will mark the beginning of their transition to the world of work are our second year students. Their ages range from 17 to 27 years (although the average age is in the 18-19 years) and the majority are women. An important part of our students comes from small urban centers relatively far from Valencia capital and its metropolis. From our internal quality surveys, it is clear that a significant number show a great root for their local nuclei that leads them not to think about labor mobility in the future. However, this trend is decreasing each year, while at the same time there is a feeling of openness to Europe.\r\nAs for the selection process, we would organize an information day, set a deadline for formal application, and then the international department would choose the beneficiaries based on the academic results (35%), English level (30%), And the valuation of teachers (35%). In addition to this information days, there is a need to add more activities before mobility (signing agreements, international meetings, talks with host partners, language training, cultural and Erasmus + training with beneficiaries, etc.) during mobility (meetings / evaluations Weekly study leaders with the tutors of the host partner etc.) and after mobility (evaluation, dissemination of results etc.)\r\nIn terms of impact, students will develop a greater cultural background that will include better language skills and greater openness to other cultures. This baggage will also be academic and professional. When performing their practices in salons linked to VET centers they will know another educational system (we will also do the same with the incorporation of new methodologies) and work and different work techniques specific to the field of hairdressing or beauty therapy. In addition, they will also gain professional contacts and new friendships, autonomy and maturity.\r\nShort-term / medium-term effects include employability (the main objective of this project, which will be reinforced by the cultural, linguistic and attitudinal impacts just mentioned) and the desire to continue to studying. As a long-term impact we find from a future employment in the host country or in any other until we continue to bet on the Erasmus + program and its values as future teachers, entrepreneurs or parents.

Understanding how culture-specific views and practices and energy policy and governance both shape and reflect individual and collective energy choices is of paramount importance for the success of the Energy Union. \nENERGISE responds directly to these challenges by engaging in frontier energy consumption scholarship. Recognising the persistence of diverse energy cultures, both within and between countries, ENERGISE offers an ambitious social science programme to enhance understanding of changes in energy consumption practices across 30 European countries. Moving beyond state-of-the-art research, ENERGISE theoretically frames and empirically investigates socio-economic, cultural, political and gender aspects of the energy transition. It also examines how routines and ruptures (re)shape household energy consumption practices. Adopting a cutting-edge Living Labs approach, designed specifically to facilitate cross-cultural comparisons, ENERGISE fuses tools for changing individual- and community-level energy consumption with a novel method for energy sustainability assessment. ENERGISE will open new research horizons and greatly enhance Europe\u2019s capacity for high-impact, gender-sensitive consumption research.

In a clear view of scope and performance goals, for each sub mission it will be easier to define, research and develop solutions in terms of architectures, technology deployment, as well as the necessary procedures, organizations to manage the specific issue. The PROTECTRAIL challenge is therefore to make interoperable the single asset-specific solutions and to conceive and design a modular architectural framework where each asset-specific solution can be \u201cplugged\u201d, that is the basis to assure a streamlined process of federation, integration and interoperability of respective solutions. The PROTECTRAIL project will address the following security sub-missions: protection of signal and power distribution systems against any terrorism act, track clearance, clearance of trains before and after daily use, staff clearance, luggage clearance control, passenger clearance control, freight clearance control, tracking and monitoring of rolling stock carrying dangerous goods, protection of communication and information systems, stations, buildings and infrastructure protection.", 70528.0, 18229601.0, 11, 31, "PROTECTRAIL", "http://www.protectrail.eu/", "http://www.kingston.ac.uk/", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111954.jpg", "fp7_95607_999864652"], [1204329600000, 1298851200000, "OPTImisation of Multimedia over wireless Ip links via X-layer design", "Kingston University Higher Education Corporation", "The OPTIMIX project will focus on studying innovative solutions enabling  enhanced video streaming in an IP based wireless heterogeneous system,  based on cross layer adaptation of the whole transmission chain.To achieve this goal, it is proposed to develop a scheme including all elements of major importance in a point to multi point video streaming chain, in particular video coding, networking modules, MAC layer and physical layer, efficiently communicating together through the use of joint controllers (at the server side) and mobile unit observers (at the client side).Innovative techniques will be considered to improve the efficiency of scalable video codecs when used in a wireless multi user environment with respect to robustness, efficient dynamic compression and intelligent use of scalability schemes.

Moreover, a dynamic economy (\u2026) will require a greater number of young people willing and able to become entrepreneurs\u201d.In this context, the same document states that \u201cEntrepreneurship Education is essential not only to shape the mindsets of young people but also to provide the skills and knowledge that are central to developing an entrepreneurial culture\u201d. Additionally the need for innovative competencies development is justified  \u201cbecause education is key to shaping young people\u2019s attitudes, skills and culture, it is vital that Entrepreneurship Education is addressed from an early age\u201d.According to the study Entrepreneurship Education at School in Europe (EACEA, 2012), a \u201cgreat majority of European countries address Entrepreneurship Education through national strategies or initiatives\u201d, reflecting the \u201cwide recognition of the importance of Entrepreneurship Education in Europe\u201d.The same study stresses that \u201cnearly half of the countries have incorporated the objectives linked to the promotion of Entrepreneurship Education within broader strategies (lifelong learning, education and youth, growth)\u201d and others countries \u201chave launched specific Entrepreneurship Education strategies\u201d.As for Entrepreneurship Education at primary education level, which roughly includes children aging 6 to 10 years old, it\u2019s referred that only \u201ctwo thirds of EU countries explicitly recognise Entrepreneurship in central steering documents at this education level\u201d. In contrast, in secondary education \u201cvirtually all countries integrate Entrepreneurship into the curriculum in some form\u201d. This allows the conclusion that it is at the primary education level that is needed more attention.Current approaches to Entrepreneurship Education in primary education rely mostly on a \u201ccross-curricular approach (\u2026) where Entrepreneurship Education is integrated into existing subjects\u201d. Another important aspect is that \u201chalf of the countries define learning outcomes related to Entrepreneurship\u201d but \u201cno country addresses practical entrepreneurial skills at this school level\u201d.In this context, the main goal of the project is to create an innovative computer learning game for Entrepreneurship Education of children (6 -10 y), that can be easily implemented in formal and non-formal education settings.In the game, players - individually or in group - will create their own company and cooperate with each other to reach success by making decisions and developing joint activities (in-game and off-game) in response to different challenges. At the same time they compete with other companies in the virtual market. By creating both a cooperative and a competitive environments this learning tool expects to act on knowledge, behaviours and attitudes, contributing to the development of a wide set Entrepreneurship skills, like creativity, teamwork, leadership, market functioning, etc.The game will be developed with the concern to address effectively boys and girls.

On the other hand, dynamics of global economy is changing and SMEs, which are the backbone of European economy, need to adapt those changes in order to remain competitive and continue their existence. The intersection point of these situations is the need for contemporary and transversal skills which are fully embedded in human capital. In traditional terms these skills are regarded within the scope of entrepreneurship. However, while traditional model of entrepreneurship is no longer applicable in modern business world, a more valuable term arises; \u2018innovative entrepreneurship\u2019.The purpose of INNOGROW is designed for increasing employability levels of and new business creation by young unemployed individuals (including NEETs) and higher education students as well as developing initiative taking of key SME staff by the use of an innovative \u2018learning path\u2019 method which includes; self-assessment tool, self-learning materials on innovative entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship (such as; creative thinking, problem solving, risk taking, team work, innovation management and etc.) and also business idea development tool in one integrated and mobile assisted eLearning software, all to be supported/strengthened by tutors and classroom trainings.

The methodology pursued to achieve project objectives with descriptions of intellectual outputs is as follows: The partnership will conduct an in-depth research on SMEs and their key staff on how they are innovative which will help the development of a competence profile of an innovative entrepreneur. A self-assessment tool and innovative entrepreneurship eLearning modules will be developed on the basis of this profile as well as a business idea development tool and all to be uploaded on a web-based and mobile assisted eLearning software.

Electricity generation by photovoltaic cells is one of the main players in this field, but is hampered by its still relatively high cost compared with other sources of energy. Within this project we investigate promising nanotechnology - based strategies to enhance the performance and/or reduce the cost of different solar cell technologies. Specifically we examine the use of metal nanostructures to enhance the optical absorption of light into different types of solar cells, including crystalline Si, high performance III-V, organic and dye-sensitized solar cells. The enhanced absorption can ultimately lead to thinner and therefore less expensive solar cells due to the use of less material. One of the remaining issues in this field, that of better physical insight in the possible plasmonic enhancement mechanisms, will be studied in detail using calculations and experiments on structures with different degrees of complexity. In parallel, we investigate the manufacturability of these nanostructures and the ease of integrating them into existing process flows for solar cells. This will allow us to examine industrially relevant structures, integrate them into solar cells and test their performance. The performance will be bench-marked and assessed by solar cell companies that are participating in the project. European science traditionally is a leader in both the fields of photovoltaics and nanoplasmonics and this project helps to maintain Europe's strong position.
