They have a younger perspective of early years and have come with their own ideas and views of early years  practice and value personal and social development in the highest degree and see creative learning as a major tool for this type of learning, development and support. Intuitively they both believe the importance of supporting a child's emotional needs is paramount within a calm and respectful environment and to use creative learning as a tool to achieve this. This view has stemmed from close family bonds and strong emotional values not from their previous schooling experiences; feeling that schooling didn't support every child's emotional needs.   As a team they are intrigued by the development of a child's learning and have calm and supportive dispositions and value the importance of free creative learning for every child. The team that will lead the Sweden project are both experienced and well qualified early years practitioners , one of which has a Level three qualification and 26  years experience within early years settings from city settings to village settings and the other being the Manager who holds a BA (Hons) Degree in early years and has supported other Early Years Professionals in achieving their status and who worked within early years settings for the last 20 years.   Both team members have a passion for inclusive nurturing environments for all children within an early years setting.   Both believe that children need to explore in a free environment in order to develop their self confidence and self esteem through hands on learning experiences within the natural environment; believing that children should have the opportunity of taking control of their own learning; for the adult to step back and learn from the child. \r\n\r\nWe feel that this will enable us as a setting to gain further knowledge of children's learning through creativity, personalised and explorative play.
