It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus and a new dynamism in the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Reiterating this initiative, the Acad\u00e9mie confirms its commitment to International Mobility of young people and teachers with the support of Erasmus+ Program.\r\nThis innovative consortium reflects the variety of our Acad\u00e9mie with a representative panel of 5 schools in the field of Hotel and Restaurant Business. Supported the Rectorat, this project aims at enriching the professional skills of the staff and the students. It also aims at strengthening the European dimension of this field. This internship abroad will give an international dimension to the participants\u2019 CV, a genuine added value when they are looking for a job in the near future. Within two years nearly 200 students aged 17-19 will go in 5 European countries. These students will be selected on their motivation to invest themselves in their formation. They will receive a linguistic and cultural preparation, which will be evaluated by CERL test. 22 members of staff will also take part in the project as well as 58 partners in 9 countries.\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their expectations. All of them are eager to discover new cultural and professional horizons. We have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving companies, this a real asset because it will create an efficient partnership network and give a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the academic and european scene.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the working program have been agreed on by all the schools and they are committed to respect the phases of the project: selection and common preparation of the participants, mobility and internship and finally evaluation and sharing of the impacts and results. These stages will imply a vast panel of people: teachers, high schools, companies, academic authorities, families, associations, consulates, language assistants in France but also abroad. Each of these step is essential so that the impact felt by all of actors is in line with initial objectives.\r\n\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly defined. The GIPAL carries the project. The Acad\u00e9mie organizes the project with the members of the consortium. The \u201cGroupe Pilotage Qualit\u00e9\u201d is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants. All French and Europeans partners have an experience in placements since most of them have already used Mobility programs. So, each people know one\u2019s mission and it will done seriously. \r\n\r\nThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous. The partners will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices, give a new image to vocational schools.\r\n\r\nExpected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2019. The staffs will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and knowledge, discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills of the teachers.\r\n\r\nThese impacts are tangible and easily measurable. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project.\r\nTo conclude, all the partners will be tasked to transmit and promote the Eramus+ program in addition to proceed at the global evaluation of this program. This evaluation will aim to analyse positive and/or negative points and allow adjusting practices of all partners for next projects.", "http://www.nclanarkshire.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036190_12"], [2016, "Mobility Abroad for Knowledge and Experience", "New College Lanarkshire", 218160.0, 9, 18, "Main Activities: GTI is a committed participant in the Erasmus+ program and has engaged with over thirty European partners. GTI has a proven track record of collaboration and partnership to meet local, national and European needs. The provision of student & staff mobility opportunities across the EU will remain a core activity of the Erasmus+ program at GTI. GTI\u2019s international strategy is based on three key elements:(a) Participation of VET learners in companies(b) Participation of Staff - accompanying persons and work shadowing(c) Hosting of VET teachers and learnersThis application is for: Activity A1 Flow 1-17: 81 participants from each of the ten GTI departments will be involved.Activity A2 Flow 1-17: 32 accompanying staff Activity A3 Flow 1-4: 22 staff on work shadowing placements to shadow staff in similar roles in colleges around Europe to examine best practice and to actively include what is learnt into teaching & learning at GTI. Staff will be asked to disseminate knowledge at staff meetings.Developments: For our KA1 application we have added five new partners to our project. The new partners will allow us for the first time to send students from our healthcare department at GTI. We will also send staff members to work shadow nursing and healthcare teachers in SwedenChanges of Scope of the mobility flows: We are involving staff from our engineering and healthcare departments. This is a new development for our Erasmus+ project. We have added new partners to this KA1.Need for Accompanying Persons:The first accompanying person will travel out with the participants and spend the first week with the group. The second accompanying person will travel out in the final week to evaluate performance and goals achievement and bring the group back to Galway.The role of the accompanying person is extremely important to GTI and the project participants. 1) To co-ordinate and to guide the activities of the participants in the initial training period2) To supervise and to control the work/training plan of the participants3) To evaluate the activities after the first week and suggest alterations should this be required.4) To help to the participants in the resolution of problems or difficulties5) As some of the participants will never have traveled outside of the country before, they will possibly be anxious about traveling. The accompanying persons will help settle them in.6) There will be a mixture of applicants from different socioeconomic backgrounds \u2013 the staff from GTI will assist them settling in to a different culture. All concerns will be dealt with in situ.\u2022  As a mentor \u2013 students traveling for first time to work in Europe will more than likely hope they have someone they can speak with in relation to the role they are expected to perform. \u2022 As a support person \u2013 the students may look to someone to ask for help when it comes to accommodation or travel issues to and from the workplace. While a certain degree of maturity and workability is expected from all learners there should be a support person there in order to listen to the student when required.\u2022 As a negotiator \u2013 an accompanying person may often be the liaison person required if a situation arises that can only be dealt with by a person they are familiar with. For example, if the group dynamics in the apartment are proving to be a challenge, the accompanying person may be able to assist with a supportive voice and presence.\u2022 As a personal and social contact \u2013 this can prove very useful for the shy student for whom traveling away from home may be a daunting and new experience and it is often where younger participants may need a lot of support.Evidence of the success and necessity of  accompanying persons in Finland and Turkey (from previous projects):Finland: Students on the art course have traveled to Finland for the last three years. Up to 12 students are involved and they are not all placed in the same centre, many of the centres are at least an hour train journey up to a maximum of a six hour train journey. It is not always possible to plan in advance for every contingency. The issues have dealt with in the last number of years range from lost baggage needing to be forwarded to a variety of destinations, delays in students being met at arrival, difficulties purchasing tickets for onward journeys due to changes in transport systems and  problems with the accommodation. These issues are all solvable without much difficulty if there is someone there with some local knowledge and experience. In the last number of years we have had applications from students with Asperger's, who are deaf or have had other disabilities. These students need varying degrees of assistance and may need specialised professional assistance. The range of ages of students is quite wide, ranging from 18 years old up to 50- 60 years old.

This validation of informal learning underlines the positive social skills and competences, as well as other key competences relevant to learning and the world of work, thus strongly supporting not only the educational agenda in prison, but also the broader rehabilitative agenda. In various contexts, the provision of informal learning validation has had the effect of motivating adults \u2013 particularly those from broadly socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 to pursue further learning and career-orientation opportunities.  Prison is a prime location for the realisation of such outputs.  If, through the validation of informal learning a learner in prison can become motivated to nurture this positive reinforcement in an educational setting, pursuing additional education (either formal or informal) or engaging more seriously with career planning. The impact of informal learning validation in a prison setting is clearly something with a significant potential to encourage learning and further competence development.  The project VALMOPRIS, supported by the European Prison Education Association (EPEA), designs, delivers and validates informal learning activities with the focus on KC5+1 \u2013 that is, it will look at the primary key competence of Learning to Learn (which supports the overall goal of enhancing motivation for participation in adult education in prison) in combination with at least 5 other European Framework Key Competences.  15 prison educators will be trained in the project to deliver and validate informal competence based learning with a focus on developing the ability and motivation to learn, and they will run various competence based learning projects with a diverse range of 90 prison learners. The project VALMOPRIS formally evaluates the change in learner motivation as a result of the informal learning validation, publishing a report on the impact of informal learning validation in prison.  Based on the final results, a further 15 prison educators will be trained, setting the project outputs up for mainstreaming.VALMOPRIS will actively contribute to policy discourse on prison education, and the role of informal learning.  It hopes to bring a change in the mind-set of education in prison, raising the profile of the social and personal competences acquired through informal learning and the way they can be assessed and validated.

This means that out of 46 third grade students - 21 participate in the Erasmus+ project supported by the European Union, which is almost 50 percent.The 20 female and one male students are between 16 and 18 years old. They are all eligible to take part in the Erasmus+ programme because they have to do a 12-week-placement between the third and the fourth year of our school to be allowed to sit the final exams two years later. That\u00b4s why for them the school year already ends at the end of May and starts again on the first Monday in October. They have to do their compulsory training within these four months.At our school there are two different focuses: 1. language and media 2. wellness and health management. Most of the students have very good English skills as well as good Italian/French skills. Some of them have even attended optional subjects like russian, wine-connoisseur, bar-keeper, patisserie, etc. During their placements abroad students want to practise, strengthen as well as enlarge their practical as well as theoretical knowledge which they have acquired in the first three years at our school. Furthermore, within this project students will get the chance to get to know a country which they might not know at all or only from a short holiday. Another important aim is to improve their language skills \u2013 make use of what you already know, internalize it and expand your vocabulary, phrases, etc. Which skills are to be focused on, will be put down in the Learning Agreements in accordance with teacher, employers and students. During the training (accompanying persons, reports from students and mentors), that is, afterwards - the achievement of these goals will be checked. Additional ECVET aspects included in the project are: Personal Transcript and Memorandum of Understanding which are to be signed in the course of visits in the respective countries.Taking part in this project is therefore useful for the students in many respects. By working in a foreign countries they can consolidate their practical as well as their language skills, brush them up and enlarge them and that way increase their chance on the job market significantly. A further important aspect is that with the help of the Erasmus Plus project the students are to crack prejudices, become more open-minded and tolerant. And last but not least, participants are to become more mobile, even at an early age. The results of the project will be published by means of articles in local and regional newspapers, a radio interview is planned as well. Moreover, experienced project participants will pass their knowledge on to students who are thinking of going abroad in the following year at informative events at school but also outside of it.Staff mobility is another aspect that will be focused on this year.

This way, NCL is a valuable partner for both - teachers as well as  students of our business college (HAK Wolfsberg) - to acquire European and professional expertise.\r\n\r\nAs our college specialises in commercial subjects, it is a substantial advantage for our students to establish contacts to other (European) countries already during their school career.

These internships should last for 14 days, working 10 days at different Scottish companies.\r\nTo maintain, foster and intensify this valuable relationship with NCL this project should be a two-year project.\r\n\r\nThe students will be chosen according to their school performance and their personality in accordance with the European spirit.

Through this experience they will be learning what is happening in other larger countries in sport coaching and youth development sectors covering Football Academy Students and Youths, in order to achieve efficiency in their field.  The professional environment which will host our participants will offer a physical and mental challenge given the difference in sport resources and facilities between two different countries such as Malta and Scotland. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this mobility project is the support of continual professional development of individuals who will lead our youths and children to future success.  Together with our partners of New College Lanarkshire, we are planning and designing an intensive training programme where participants will have the opportunity to enhance their career aspirations in top level sport and also provide academic backup for the fewer talented members of staff.  This will enable them to achieve the qualifications or skills required to maintain their involvement in their particular sport.  \r\n\r\nBeing such a small island, Gozo faces the problem of  lack of opportunities, especially in the employment sector.  Small Gozitan villages have limited resources and the double insularity problem is significant.

The project will benefit participants by giving them the opportunity of a mobility exchange in a European country offering top class sports infrastructure.  Our hosts will offer participants an experience of total inclusion in professional top class sports.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to address our Island's endeavours to bridge gaps, and to encourage innovative and flexible pathways for our families.  This opportunity will enhance vocational learning and facilitate employment prospects.  Participants will develop their personality by integrating invaluable technical and social skills, language development and cultural awareness that will significantly enhance their potential.\r\n\r\nThe  proposed timetable of the 8 day project will provide and include:\r\n\r\nSport practices, techniques, skills and new methodologies in coaching;\r\nSessions covering mental preparation and sport psychology;\r\nTeam work covering basic creativity, negotiating, planning, sharing ideas and working with others;\r\nHealth and Safety regulations;\r\nSocial skills;\r\nVisit to a Scottish Premier Club to observe a full professional training session; \r\nMeal times & evaluation of the day's outcomes.\r\n\r\nOur strategic partners have been instrumental in the development and enhancement of our previous youth programme.

In this strategy, materials bearing a catalytic unit are delivered to the tumour and subsequently non-active prodrugs are administered. The prodrugs are non-toxic and therefore generate limited side effects. Only at the tumour site the catalytic particles convert the prodrugs into active compounds that generate a therapeutic effect. This approach presents several advantages on the classical drug delivery paradigm including limited side effects and prolonged efficacy. \nThis multidisciplinary research programme will be the setting for the training of 13 ESRs.

AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, occurring in between 1-2% of the general population. More than 6 million Europeans suffer from this arrhythmia and its prevalence is expected to increase by more than two-fold during the next 40 years due to increased life expectancy. Thus, AF is said to assume epidemic proportions. Current options for pharmacological therapy are limited by both low efficacy and side effects, including life\u2010threatening ventricular arrhythmias and severe extra-cardiac toxicities.\nA very limited number of novel AF drug therapies have been introduced in the last 20 years. This imbalance reflects a gap in understanding in both how AF develops and how it can be treated, which thereby limits the development of new medicines. Our ambition with the AFib-TrainNet is to fill this gap by producing new knowledge, leading to critical insight into origins and mechanisms of sustenance of atrial fibrillation. We will accomplish this by developing novel experimental and computational models recapitulating human AF, and employing these models on two very promising atrial biological targets. Experimental models will be instrumental in improving the understanding AF\u2019s underlying mechanisms, and will, along with clinical data, inform state-of-the-art computational models of human atrial electrophysiology.
