This involves identification of the nature of the damage, its position and its extent, during different phases of the material and/or structure, i.e. during manufacturing and assembly, as well as during maintenance and repair.   One can also locate damage by simply tapping the composite\u2019s surface and listening to the sound (boundary between good and damaged composite can easily be mapped to identify the area for repair). Inspection for composite damage should be included in the regular maintenance schedules for composite structures.

We took in 2013 and 2014 Leonardo da Vinci project (2012-1-ES1-LEO01-51313) into two streams, and currently we have participated in three national consortiums (2014 -1-ES01-KA102-002276, 2015-1-ES01-KA102-014483 and 2016-2-ES01-KA102-035156) with the Inform Foundation.

These programs open their horizon and convince them that your life is not doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nWe will do two types of activities.\r\n\r\nFor Basic Vocational Training, students will go in a training center to Fossano (Italy), at the school, \"Maria Ausiliatrice\", it belongs to the network of FP CNOS-FAP. The idea is that they perform Compulsory FCT in an atmosphere of real work to finish their studies and graduate. The students will be integrated as center workers and will develop skills acquired in Spain and the linguistic competence in Italian.\r\n\r\nFor Intermediate Vocational Training, students will go in internship companies to Pistoia (Italy) and Dublin and London, by means of CSCS, Zero Negativo, MicroPro and KCC, which are our hosting partners. They are going to have the first work experience, developing autonomously their professional and personal duties. In this way, they are going to develop their professional and social skills, Italian and English language skills and personal autonomy. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used to implement the project has a team of 5 people for this, which are the principal headmaster, the Educational director, administrator, a bilingual English teacher and coordinator Erasmus + designated to fulfill all management tasks.\r\n\r\nThe methodology is to implement a set of requirements to meet the objectives set according to the needs, the learning outcomes which aims to observe,  the implementation of a plan to disseminate the projected Erasmus + program, a  selection process of students, a study of the project impact on our institution and students and an evaluation of the results.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact is a consequence of the results that are expected.

So, the improvement of facilities, faculty and teaching methodology is a must. In the other hand, the students should acquire self-esteem, autonomy and responsibility.\r\n\r\nOur students will improve their academic performance, and they will become the best means to transmit the best practices from the center, and its commitment to European programs, As a result from this, it will improve their employability.

It is already the 9th year that the Ensorinstituut organizes internships abroad. We originally started with 4 years of internships in Helsinki. Then we went to London and this year we expand the project with internships in Nice. The project is constantly improved. We constantly evaluate, improve and expand if possible.OBJECTIVESWe want to prepare our students for the labour market and we want to improve their professional competences. Our students need to speak a foreign language (English or French) so that is really a good practice. We also want to improve the personal skills of our students : problem solving, self-reliance, co-operaration, communication, teamspirit, independence, initiative, dealing with conflicts, showing interest, dealing with customers and colleagues.Finally we want to encourage an attitude for Life Long Learning.PARTICIPANTSAll our final year students of Aesthetic Body Care, Haircare, Fashion & Sales, Commerce/IT/Accounting/Office and Languages, Stage Techniques, Hotel and Restaurant & Kitchen get the opportunity of doing an internship abroad. They have to apply for the job \u2013 just like in real life. We send approximately 12 students of Aesthetic Body Care, Hotel and Restaurant & Kitchen to Nice and approximately 28 students of Haircare, Fashion & Sales, Commerce/IT/Accounting/Office and Languages, Stage Techniques to London.The number of students depends on the interest of the students, their motivation and the number of students in class that year.The students do not have the money to finance this internship so that is why we apply for a scholarship for them.

We also give the students our own evaluation form about the whole project. The teachers (accompanying persons) have a meeting to talk about all the experiences. With all this information we evaluate well and discuss how we will improve. Also with the intern places we discuss what can be improved for the following year. We repeat this flow 2 times because we apply for 24 months.DISSEMINATION OF THE PROJECTWe disseminate our Erasmus+ project via Facebook and our website. We invite the local press a few times to promote what we are doing. The students write a blog and give a PowerPoint presentation to their possible successors.RESULTS AND IMPACTThe project means a perfect showcase of all the different professions at our school. We are really convinced about the value for the education and personal development of the students. They will work on the European labour market so the European borders will be open. It is a unique opportunity for our students and it will be an unforgettable experience.LONGER TERM BENEFITSInternationalisation will become more and more a bigger part of education and in our school it is already becoming a tradition. Internationalisation is part of the policy and opinion of our school (school development plan, policy of internships, GOK-plan, dossier global citizenship, education plan).

A lot of energy has been put into this project, both by the school and the hosting partners.

Therefore we would very much like to continue this project for another 2 years before looking out for a different destination.\r\n\r\nC. Activities\r\n\r\n1. Preliminary phase and selection of the candidates\r\n\r\n- the students have to draw up a portfolio in which they introduce themselves and motivate why they want to participate in the project.\r\n\r\n-Interview in Dutch and English. \r\n\r\nBased on this interview and the portfolio, the participants are selected.\r\n\r\n- a 3-day team-building activity\r\n\r\n- 2 info moments for students and parents , partly prepared by the students\r\n\r\n- Final selection: after the team-building period and info with the parents, the definitive selection is made\r\n\r\n2. The actual internship: The students will do a 3-week internship during the periods March-April of 2015 and 2016. Accompanied by 3 teachers, they depart together on the Eurostar. They stay in serviced apartments. These are apartments with one or two bedrooms and their own kitchen, which improves their ability to be self-sufficient. They are expected at their trainee posts 5 days a week. They have to get there by Tube. The teachers are there to help them with their problems, but also to evaluate them during their internship. Each students is evaluated by the trainee supervisor at the trainee post and by the supervising teachers.\r\n\r\n3. Discussion and evaluation\r\n\r\nAfter their London work experience, each student has to fill in their evaluation in the Ecas System. In addition, there is a more detailed evaluation by both students and supervising teachers.\r\n\r\nAnother assignment for the students is to inform and enthuse the new batch, their \u2018successors\u2019, for a work experience abroad.\r\n\r\nD. Project results: the project plays an important part in the promotion of the different courses offered by our school. It is quite uncommon for students from technical and vocational directions to do a London work experience. Therefore this meets with a lot of response in our town and neighbouring  municipalities through the local press and their own trainee posts. Even schools from different school  communities like to ask for our expert advice in this field.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to being allowed to set up our project \u2018competence-directed internships in London\u2019 for the next 2 years and we hope to be granted the necessary subsidy to do so.", "http://www.languagelink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BE02-KA102-000026_1"], [2018, "Cultivating Europe", "Language Link London ltd", 68376.0, 4, 4, "\"Cultivating Europe\" originates from the Institute\u2019s need for more internationalization in response to the geographical marginality and distance from large urban centers, which causes a strong isolation of the population, especially the school that is characterized by limited relationships and stimulations.

Concrete data show very high percentages of low academic performance in scientific and technical subjects (70% of pupils in primary and secondary schools and 35 % of students of the ITA, with a peak of 43% in the fourth grade) and the need to take action, starting from kindergarten, through adequate responses to special educational needs for the prevention of possible criticisms (in nursery school, 6.8% of children show already special educational needs).\r\nTherefore, considering these training needs and in order to acquire new teaching models for a more cooperative and practical didactics, further it is able to involve students, enhancing their resources and paying attention to their needs, the project involves 25 teachers for job shadowing activities and structured courses in the UK, France and Malta for a period of 17 days, including 2 days of travel.

Therefore, the project staff, after an operative meeting, has defined the following objectives: developing a new vertical curriculum applicable to all types and levels of education; integrating CLIL methodology within daily training plan; implementing innovative training methods for DL: tasked based learning and cooperative learning; improving the knowledge of a foreign language; enhancing the digital skills of teachers in order to integrate new technologies in education and creating opportunities for debates and collaborations; adequately responding to special demands of attention; enhancing teaching skills for more innovative teaching and learning processes so as to meet the national established guidelines; transferring to students the knowledge acquired abroad; increasing the awareness and use of learning materials regarding the issues of environmental education and, in particular, of the agri-food and wine industry.\r\nAs a result of this project, 4 workshop activities will be activated: 1 Lab for children of kindergarten, two workshops focusing on issues such as viticulture and intended for pupils of primary and secondary levels and second degree and 1 language laboratory, aimed at creating a direct contact between the students of the sending institute and the pupils from the partner institutions. 2 didactic units will also be integrated in curricular lessons and they will be in CLIL mode (tasked based learning and cooperative learning methodologies). After the mobility and the activities that will be implemented within the Institute, it is expected, in terms of impact and in response to the European development plan, that teachers will be able, with the help of new methods, to improve the academic performance of pupils at least of 50% and to affect positively on 80% of the special attention requests coming from the nursery school.

Serving hotel restaurant customers\r\nRecreation and services agents have placements and work in a hotel reception, they have to learn how to arrange accomodation, how to plan tours. They have knowledge about catering, work of a hotel, how to organise trips, are able to provide information to guests.\r\nThe participants of this project also study these subjects (70% of teaching time is for practical learning). The modern concept of hospitality is very dynamic. Hotel guests\u2019 needs are changing, requirements are increasing , so the service is individualized. Pupils in Klaip\u0117da Tourism School have school-based practical learning in a hotel, bar and bar kitchen. After getting main skills, they continue practical training and work in cafes and hotels in Klaip\u0117da, Palanga and Nida where they serve tourists from Lithuania, Europe and Russia.\r\nWe try to enable our pupils to find out and  feel what the concept of a highly skilled hotel worker is and to help them seek career in Lithuanian or European hotels. They need to know hotel housekeeping rules, prepare simple dishes and drinks, be aware of national cuisine and traditions, speak some foreign languages and be polite.\r\nAims: 3 vocational school pupils will go to 4 weeks placement in Germany, Unitied Kingdom, Italy and Spain hotels. During placement, pupils will be provided with teaching program and it will be considered to be the practice they need at school. The project will improve all skills required for the hotel worker. Back at school the pupils will disseminate knowledge and information, show their skills to teachers and schoolmates.\r\nThe project lasts 18 months.\r\nResults: Deepened hotel worker skills and competence, possibility to know the requirements of hospitality business of a certain country, technologies used, possibility to improve foreign language skill. This will encourage the pupils of schools \u2013participants to be motivated and competitive in the labor market or continue their studies in a chosen sphere.\r\nStrong international links will continue to develop, they will help in future projects, shape the school prestige in the eyes of society, region and Lithuania. project duration 12 months.", "http://www.languagelink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-LT01-KA102-013070_1"], [2015, "L\u0117tas maistas 2", "Language Link London ltd", 67288.0, 5, 5, "Practical training  helps to prepare future specialists for practical activities  and provides competence, knowledge and skills which are used in real work places.

Constant attention is paid to teach new technologies and promote self-realisation of students.  The examination of problematic children indicated an array of factors influencing their behavior: family, school, economic reasons (emigration of parents, poverty),the inner values, peer subculture, personal qualities (character), influence of the media.Scientists describe the disadvantaged children as children, who do not go to school, have behavioral problems at school, abuse alcohol and psychotropic substances, tend to engage in criminal activities, are at risk of psychological, physical or sexual abuse or violence in the family and their ability to develop and participate in public life is limited. Studies show that these children cannot use their abilities in decent ways, do not participate in social life, do not trust themselves (so they quickly take offense for a teacher\u2019s or peer\u2019s notes), lack social skills, their interests are narrow. They often have psychological difficulties in learning and behavior but can quickly  respond to changes. They are quite well targeted, can react to changes, but they find it difficult to take over the values, because their life experience does not rely on them.In consortium partner schools a number of students come to learn from disadvantaged families where parents cannot properly care for the children because of  lack of social skills or use state support not for family needs, so there is a risk for child\u2019s mental, physical, spiritual and moral development and security.Schools try to cooperate with families, social welfare institutions and help these children. As the survey was taken with partner schools, there are more and more such children coming to schools. There are many challenges facing teachers who first need to solve their psychological, social and personal problems and only later do their direct job-help to learn and teach. Therefore, the project is given for the teachers to visit schools in other countries and have insights about ways and methods to work with the family and to aid students, meet specialists working in institutions. Teachers need not only pedagogical and psychological knowledge, but constantly upgrade the competencies that will be required in the future to better meet the needs of these pupils and help them integrate and adapt in educational and social environment.This corresponds to Klaipeda Tourism School and the partners\u2019 strategic plans to improve the quality and effectiveness of vocational training.It is important while learning at a vocational school to gain not only theoretical but also practical knowledge that after completion of their studies, students could more easily adapt to the labour market.Members of the project are trainers from Klaipeda Tourism, Daugai Technology and Business, Klaipeda Dressmaking and Service Business Schools, Taurage Vocational Training Centre and their authorities, planning educational process. Students get skills and abilities during educational process at school. In order to provide quality education for students in line with labor market needs, it is important that their trainers are competent.

They have taken part in numerous training activities and one of of them was also the coordinator  of  a Grundtvig Adult Learning Partnership.

There they will learn about new methodologies and different approaches to education as well as academic school management.  And how to best use them to the students\u00b4advantage, taking into account the different skills and different learning styles.  The Training activity  will  teach the participant how to adapt to the students\u00b4s needs and motivate them to learn through innovative and creative methodological approaches, where the culture of the language will play a key role. In the job shadowing mobility the Head of the school will observe all the aspects involved in running a language school: new academic approaches and organizational measures.Afterwards, the assessment activities will be implemented through reports, meetings  and interviews with the headmaster.

Throughout the mobilities the methodology will be communicative and practical, through cooperative group work, debates, observation, document analysis, presentations and performances. Results and impact:On the one hand, to improve the teaching techniques and methodological strategies in the classroom of all the teaching staff. Fostering autonomous learning and collaborative learning through innovative resources and methodologies .On the other hand, to implement new ideas and approaches to the academic and administrative management of the school. And  also to help the students and the teachers understand how important it is to be in contact with other cultures in Europe, and how a network of partner schools and contacts in European capitals can help all the members of the school integrate in Europe  personally and a professionally.Possible long term benefits:To have a more varied and motivating range of class activities, to be in touch with teachers and headmasters from other European educational  institutions, to implement different ways of organizing resources and facilities.

The cluster coordinating SUPERBIO (GBEV) has already more than 3 years\u2019 experience in building new biobased economy value chains at regional level and is active in European projects aimed at supporting SMEs to bring innovations to the market. The consortium consists of three cluster organisations specialised in the biobased economy from regions with synergetic smart specialisations, 4 highly skilled and experienced SME intermediates considered as important opinion makers in the biobased economy and 2 cross-sectorial SMEs regarded as specialists in their respective activities. The biobased economy goes along at least 19 different industrial sectors. The project aims at constructing and validating new value chains providing the SMEs in the new value chains the tools to convince investors to contribute to building new emerging industries or to generate improved processes or products. SUPERBIO will create a comprehensive open collaboration space based on the combined network of all partners, an idea validation procedure and a complementary innovation support program.

They are used today in virtually all professional sectors, particularly in those that we have selected: Hospitality and Catering, and Retail.Mobility project provide an immersion in both host countries, namely the United Kingdom and Spain.The Mobility concerns 31 young people with learning difficulties but who are very motivated to participate in this scheme because it is an opportunity for them to \"pull through\" as they themselves explain it.In order to meet the baccalaureate referential for each vocational sector, the Retail students will complete a four week training period in retail and those of Hospitality / Catering will complete eight weeks training in the front or the back of a restaurant. The mobility period will therefore include an immersion in a professional environment, but also cultural tours and an immersion with a host family.The Mobility is part of the three years school and professional curriculum of the young person.This joint project ensures fairness and cohesion among students of two different vocations and who, despite having chosen different curriculums, will live a similar experience.We have implemented a project methodology with the creation of a Steering Committee whose role is to stimulate, develop and create management and evaluation tools, to select the relevant classes and students who will carry out the mobility.

Sequa is familiar with the quality criteria for the management of pool projects and applies them. The objective of sequa\u2019s mobility programme is the improvement and internationalisation of vocational education within Europe. It supports the mobility of trainees and professionals in vocational education.\r\n\r\nsequa is a non-profit organisation of the German private sector. Shareholders are Germany's top four business membership organisations BDA, BDI, DIHK, and ZDH as well as GIZ. sequa is a globally operating development organisation that has carried out projects and programmes of international cooperation in close collaboration with the German private sector since 1991. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and mobility of employees are part of the organisation\u2019s main purposes and thus have  a high priority. sequa\u2019s commitment to support vocational mobility already began in its year of foundation and was further developed throughout the years. From 1991 to 2017 sequa has carried out more than 2,600 mobility measures for apprentices, journeymen, skilled workers, and professionals in the TVET sector. Today, sequa implements the programme as leader of  a consortium of chambers, associations and companies. \r\n\r\nsequa, as the lead applicant, is responsible for the financial monitoring, the coordination and steering of the programme in close cooperation with its partners. The entire consortium is responsible for the implementation of the programme. Roles, responsibilities and quality standards for this cooperation are determined in the \u201cQuality Manual sequa Mobility\u201d which is based on the quality standards for pool projects published by NABIBB. Interested persons may apply either to sequa or to one of the consortium partners. Since 2012 the programme consists of three programme segments.\r\n\r\nThe target group for the programme segments SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL comprises trainees and young professionals. SINDBAD supports study trips of apprentices from all professions; the study trips are mostly group activities of three to four weeks. During their stay in a host company they get the opportunity to increase their professional knowledge and familiarize themselves with the working conditions in other European countries. The programme segment TRANSDUAL addresses trainees in commercial occupations and supports business language and competence training in France, the UK or Spain. The participants attend a seminar of three to four weeks that introduces the basics of the economic and legal system of the host country. \r\n\r\nSINDBAD and TRANSDUAL allow the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country, to increase their language skills and intercultural competences and thus, improve their competitiveness. Through the development of professional, methodical, and social competencies of the participants the programme segments contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment in Europe\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since 2012 sequa offers a programme segment for professionals in vocational education (e.g. teachers, instructors, trainers) of the consortium partners. move-it (mobility of vocational educational institutions and trainers) enables individual professionals in vocational education to exchange work experiences and techniques with other professionals abroad. The designs of the study trips can vary significantly, according to the needs, and give the participants the opportunity to get insights into European TVET structures, to increase their language and intercultural competencies and to develop their European network. The professionals will use their learning experiences abroad to enhance their teaching and the development of new training concepts. Furthermore, they may motivate their apprentices to become more open to working opportunities abroad, especially in Europe. \r\n\r\nBoth target groups of sequa\u2019s mobility programme are important multipliers in mobility, especially the professionals in vocational education. Open-minded TVET professionals and \u201cmobile\u201d trainees with experience abroad, who think and act with an international mindset, contribute to the intra-European recognition of learning experiences and support the harmonisation of European TVET systems. Furthermore, the mobility programme promotes the European Idea that says Europe is diversity and culture, friendship and togetherness, sustainability and future. Especially in politically challenging times, it is important that the EU understands itself not only as a purely economic community of purpose, but also and above all as a cultural and political community with shared values.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004607_17"], [2014, "GoEurope - wir bringen Berliner in Bewegung: Mobilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Auszubildende, Berufssch\u00fcler, Absolventen der beruflichen Bildung, Referendare und Berufsbildungsexperten.", "European College of Business and Management", 650132.0, 14, 30, "15.7 % of all youths in Berlin are currently unemployed - considerably more than most regions of Germany. This difficult situation leads to the most essential goal of our project: improving the employability of young apprentices, students in vocational schools as well as recent graduates. We intend to achieve our goal by offering high-quality, custom-designed stays abroad for these youths - directly related to each participants' individual vocational background. We will collaborate with numerous vocational training centers in Berlin, the participants' training local companies as well as with the Chambers and the unions. Additionally we will improve the \"European competence\" of stakeholders in vocational training and other local institutions through knowledge transfer and will institutionalize this process by integrating these players into our project as project partners. On another level we intend to improve the social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrant background or are disadvantaged learners.\r\n\r\nThe following are the two MAIN activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:\r\n\r\n- internships abroad\r\n\r\n- project work abroad related to participants' vocational field \r\n\r\nMost of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.\r\n\r\nThese main activities will supported by the following FLANKING activities offered to professionals  from vocational training centers in Berlin: \r\n\r\n- Preparatory Visits abroad (e. g. to prepare mobility flows)\r\n\r\n- Training for professionals covering the topics \r\n\r\no \u201eThe European Job Market \u2013 a challenge for local vocational training centers?\u201c \r\n\r\n(also for professionals with a lower foreign language proficiency level, 4 day course)\r\n\r\no \u201eEuropean Training and Instructing Traditions - Learning from the Best in the Field\u201c (for professionals with a higher foreign language proficiency level, 7 day course)\r\n\r\nFurther FLANKING activities will be offered to student teachers in Berlin:\r\n\r\n- \u201eImproving the European and Mobility competence in teacher training\u201c (7-day course)\r\n\r\nOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 40 different partner organizations in 17 EU countries  plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded internship and project-work stays abroad . Most of them can draw on a network of hundreds or more internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions  in their respective regions. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined together with the local training institution the project is actively promoted to the defined target group. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network between the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations. \r\n\r\nOur network has been growing for nine years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 15 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad. For our EUROPASS mobility ceremonies we are often honored to have undersecretaries of state personally handing over the certificates to our proud young participants.\r\n\r\nA development towards an innovation and internationalization cluster including our local, national and international partners is becoming ever more visible. Junior and Senior Management as well as EU-Affairs Representatives are exchanging experiences and inspiring each other in their efforts towards enhanced employability of the youth.\r\n\r\nLast but not least close to 500 youths come back home - excited about their mobility experience abroad. They have gained personally - an experience they will be able to draw on during their whole (professional) life.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing. For trainees and teaching staff alike this should enable an international exchange of outlooks \u2013 not necessarily in English alone. Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017. Along with concentration on the theme of International Commerce, the English KMK Certificate Level B1, qualification in a further foreign language at minimum Level A1 and the ECDL, a three-week work placement abroad with intercultural interaction is also required.

It will take place in the \"European College of Business & Management\" in London and will last for a week A visit is planned to the MidKent College in Kent and we hope that the colleagues can study  the vocational educational  training and apprenticeship of our neighbour country and ameliorate the knowledge about GB. They should also imprive their linguistic competences and get new ideas for didactic methods. We would like to repeat and implement this program and so we apply again for funding to do another flow in the academic year 2019/2020. We also intend to invite colleagues of other schools as well.\r\n\r\nFor the oncoming year we are planning new projects:\r\n\r\n5.We will go to Northern Ireland to Derry with 16 of our colleagues and we will visit the NorthWest Regional Col. in Derry. We hope that there will develop an exchange programme done with techers as lond as this will be possible under the white elephant of Brexit. Northernirish colleagues are kindly invited to come to our school and also visit companies in our area to get to know and learn more about our dual system.\r\n\r\n6. However, we also intend to create a new program for students of our office management department. They should attend school there as well as attending companies to see and to get to know different styles of vocational learning. We do apply for 2 flows - 1 in each year - for a number of 10 students each year. Up to now office management has always been a group which did not participate in any European programs and we would like to change this and integrate them as well and offer them possibilities to experience other cultures and get to know other traditions. We very much hope that we also will be able to host students from the NWRC to create a real exchange of students.\r\n\r\n7. We were lucky to find another new partner in the Netherlands in Alkmaar, the Horizon College. 9 teachers, 7 from our college BS4 and 2 from our neighbouring college 5 are going to Alkmaar in October to prepare a students\u00b4programme together with our partner colleagues. We intend to work out special modules where we can teach the group coming from 2 different countries a common topic which is valuable for both of them. This could be done in the frame of ECVET.\r\n\r\n8.5 apprentices from sales executive will be going to the netherlands to do a three-weeks internship in the Netherlands. Our institution is already hosting 2 students from the Netherlands to help them finding placements in our companies of freight forwarding. Sending apprentices abroad to fulfil placements is new for our school. We haven\u00b4t done this before as companies in the dual system are always reluctant to release staff to be abroad over a longer period of time. However, times have changed in favour of us and more and more enterprises seem to support a three weeks stay abroad. Our partner in the Netherl. is extremely reliable and we are convinced that our program will be successful and it will be expandable and developable.\r\n\r\nUp to now we were lucky to win and add new partnerships and we experienced a high amount of support in doing this. We have started EU-mobility programs six years ago and are developping slowly into a sort of hub and we will involve other vocational colleges in the region  via our own programs  or by giving them advise how to launch new European mobility programs", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004445_1"], [2018, "Betriebspraktika in europ\u00e4ischen Unternehmen 2018 und 2019", "European College of Business & Administration", 126118.0, 8, 15, "The  \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201c in Cologne offers full-time or part-time training programmes to its trainees. Being one of the first European schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, it has always been aiming at enabling all its students the realization of an internship in other European countries. The educational programme \u201cState-certified Commercial Assistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d had been acting as forerunner and was, thus, able to establish contacts and partnerships with business enterprises and schools in France, Great Britain, Spain, Malta and Cyprus in the past decades which every year provide placements to the applicants. This year, 41 trainees will realize an internship in the countries mentioned above as well as in Poland and Ireland. The internship lasting 8 or 11 weeks, respectively, serves as the practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge during the vocational training. It takes place in its last year when students already have acquired very good knowledge in foreign languages and MS Office. The participants of the internship project carry out commercial correspondence, translate texts into the German language, create customers\u2019 files, participate in customer acquisition, verify transport documents and carry out tasks of the front or back office in hotels. Five interns of the course of \u201cForeign Language Correspondence Clerks\u201d will realise their 3-weeks-internship in Great Britain  towards the end of their second year of traineeship. For these students there also exists a pool of partner companies which annually take new interns or help them to find a placement in order to apply and broaden their language skills. Moreover, the internships serve to gain new insights into the practical work of an enterprise. As a consequence, the participants support the employees when doing their daily work and \u2013 depending on the respective branch \u2013 carry out tasks like the re-organisation of a clients\u2019 file, the research of information about topics communicated beforehand or the assistance in an event\u2019s organisation. \r\nFurthermore, this year 10 trainees of the vocational courses \u201cIndividual Insurance\u201d, \u201cRetailers\u201d and \u201cPersonnel Service Providers\u201d will do their 3-weeks-internship in European countries, frequently in subsidiaries of their employing company, where they are offered the opportunity to work quite goal-oriented taking into account probable cultural differences. For the first time, two students of the educational programme called \u201cCommercial College\u201d are aiming at a 2-weeks-internship abroad. Within the framework of the college\u2019s strategy of internationalisation, it is planned to establish a pool of partner enterprises, too, in order to offer the possibility of taking part in the internship programme to even more students than those of the courses mentioned above. Without the financial support and the formal framework of the ERASMUS+, students of any of the college\u2019s educational programmes could hardly realise an internship abroad. All participants firstly apply in writing for a scholarship with the respective colleague in charge. \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201d has got an EU-Team which is led by a project coordinator. Two other colleagues are responsible for the financial processing and insurance matters. Additionally, in each educational programme there is a colleague who is familiar with its specific circumstances and supervises the trainees. Due to the high number of interns deriving from the \u201cAssistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d, there is a colleague responsible for English-speaking EU-countries, Spain and France each, whereas singular internships in Poland this year and the like are cared for by the project coordinator. Once a general overview of the internship programme has been provided by the project coordinator, the teachers in charge draw a selection of the participants, prepare the internship itself, care for the students during their stay abroad and monitor the follow-up work after their return. This also comprises an intensive maintenance of the contact with partner institutions. Due to the possibility of job-shadowing, the personal mobilities in France, Great Britain and Malta predominantly serve the upgrading and broadening of content aspects, especially in foreign trade, customer communication and development of the vocational education in various European countries. Moreover, language skills are intensified and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 improved. The personal maintenance of the contacts with partnership firms enabled by these mobilities, is a vital factor of the project\u2019s success and must not be underestimated. In order to take part in a personal mobility, the staff applies to the head of the college who - according to the qualification and demand \u2013 decides for the teacher to take part in the project. The results of the personal mobilities are communicated to the staff in team meetings, conferences of members of the same subject or educational programme and the students.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004666_10"], [2017, "Mobile Tools and Gamification as a new Language Assessment System in Tourism", "European College of Business and Management", 124796.0, 4, 4, "BACKGROUND\r\nFor 15 years some of the project partners have been engaged in the fostering of the EU L2 standard for professionals in tourism. Various institutions have been supporting this initiative and a significant body of courseware has been produced and implemented in educational and training institutions. \r\nThe first LdV-project \"ESB\", winner of the EU Label 2001, was followed by SLEST (www.slest-tourism.org; EU Label 2007), with which a whole two-level L2 learning courseware has been created, following the \"EU Framework of Reference for Languages\". From 2013 on  further L2 learning materials for the tourism sector in an e-learning format (see also www.slest2-0.eu) has been produced.  \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe project will establish an advanced mobile and gamified eLearning framework for students and professionals in the tourism sector in the form of online L2 training tools. Thus an international social network of professionals will be created, perfectly suited for improving L2 and intercultural communication competences.  \r\nAnalytics, collective diagnostics, measuring learning outcomes and gamification will be addressed in a very innovative way. Psychometrics will be embedded in the online exercises. The games produce big data about the knowledge development of the participants; this is evaluated by a psychometric software component. Participants receive a continuous feedback on their performance with personalised training tips. The trainers receive anonymized collective diagnostics, showing which knowledge is mastered, what is forgotten, and what could be sustainably strengthened over time. We will set up regular tournaments from 2018 on as a sustainable endeavor supported by major educational and vocational institutions.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS\r\nThe project consists of 5 partners coming from Turkey, Germany, Italy, and the UK: municipality of Serik Belek (TR), an university (Selcuk-TR), two vocational institutions (UK and IT), and SNTL in DE (electronic publishing, content management systems, open source technologies, gamification). This partnership and network will guarantee  a high professional standard regarding the outcomes, and also an extensiv dissemination of project results. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES PLANNED\r\na) Publishing and maintaining the project website, also after the end of the funding period. The partners will make sure that  the\r\nwebsite contains engaging and high quality L2 learning and cross-cultural communication contents for the Tourism sector. The very special feature on the website will be the multi-player  application on which the tournaments / training sessions for professionals and students in the EU Tourism Industry will be launched.\r\nb) Production of specific L2 e-learning contents for the online tournaments / training sessions \r\nc) Defining and authoring the dramaturgy of the online tournaments. Organizing the online games and training sessions as a continuing learning outcome assessment in the field of Tourism \r\nd) Organization of training activities on- and offline regarding b) and c)\r\ne) Online assistance for all participants\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY USED\r\nThe project will apply a number of different methodologies:\r\n- Gamification of learning and testing through the deployment of knowledge competitions in social networks with embedded psychometrics\r\n- Self-organised learning with personalised learning tips and references based on analytics\r\n- Learning in social networks through multi-playing \r\n- Intercultural learning through cross-border social gaming \r\n- online social interaction in the learning games \r\n- Ubiquitous learning through mobile access to gaming and learning contents\r\n\r\nRESULTS/ IMPACT ENVISAGED\r\n- A comprehensive L2 programme for the Tourism Sector using a gamified learning and testing methodology with knowledge competitions  \r\n- Creation of a framework for regular L2-knowledge competitions financed by industry and other stakeholders\r\n- The online tournaments become a landmark for innovative learning methodologies and will be taken up by other institutions \r\n- Learning analytics will give high visibility \r\n- Authors and publishers will be encouraged to further develope gamification of education and training. \r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS\r\nWe will establish an eLearning framework in the form of regular knowledge competitions. Users will have the opportunity to improve skills in L2 and cross-cultural communication wherever and whenever they want, with or without the help of teachers/ trainers, also beyond  the funding period of this project.\r\nThe gaming environment will remain active; knowledge tournaments will be organized regularly in all countries of the project; learning contents on the project\u2019s website maintained regularly. The project thus will create a critical mass on contents, materials, organisational infrastructure and visibility and publicity that it approaches, methodologies and concepts will produce a high degree of acceptance and permeate successfully the educational, vocational and human resources sector.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-TR01-KA202-045898_2"], [2018, "Kaufm\u00e4nnische Auszubildende in England und Estland", "European College of Business and Management", 118280.0, 3, 3, "The Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen 1 Villingen-Schwenningen (KS1), Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen G\u00f6ppingen (KSG\u00d6) and Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Offenburg (KSOG) would like to enable young apprentices to get work experience abroad as part of their dual training (e.g. as industrial clerks or financial assistants). The aim of this is an increased intercultural and personal competence to help master new challenges in business as well as personal life. Businesses, which are very often internationally orientated, would thus benefit from highly motivated employees who would be more self-assured in their treatment of foreign customers and suppliers.

It is a long-term goal to enhance mobility and to prepare the students for an unknown environment, as it is less and less likely for them to remain in the places where they are being trained. Intercultural competence is becoming increasingly important at school and in the workplace, with colleagues just as with customers. When dealing with them, it is of particular importance to show understanding and empathy, especially for those who come from foreign nations and cultures.

In a three-week course at the European College of Business and Management in London, with 26 teaching units a week, the pupils apply their knowledge by giving short talks, preparing power point presentations and writing compositions about economic and politico-economic tasks in English. In addition they have typical Business English units such as correspondence, telephoning and cultural differences. The cross-cultural competence will be improved by several excursions. The written project report (approximately 1500 words) will be completed and edited (text processing, image editing, graphics) after the stay at home.

With the project-related work they shall be encouraged to work on their own, improve their presentation skills as well as develop team-spirit qualifications which are essential in a modern business world. The participants in Turin work in a bilateral team.\r\nMoreover, we want the participants to improve their language competence and gain valuable intercultural experience, build up a healthy self-confidence and develop self-worthiness not only for their professional career.\r\nThe acquired competences will be reflected by the pupils and reviewed by the teachers at the end of the project with the \u201cAssessment of Learning Outcomes\u201d. The experiences of the participants will also be analyzed by the BSGZ as pupils fill out an evaluation sheet after coming back from England and Italy.

The students will hopefully gain new qualifications and knowledge, get prepared for the international job market but also reflect and analyse their own competences and skills.\r\n\r\nIn a second step, the participating teachers will do a job-shadowing week in our partner schools and should get an overview about the skills, competences, professional knowledge and key qualifications that are being taught during the students' vocational training. They will then compare those with the students' findings and deduce recommendations for action and good-practice-examples.\r\n\r\nThe project assignments will be as follows:\r\nStudents' project assignment: identifying typical tasks and activities of job starters, required qualifications, support measures and activities of the company (e.g. mentoring, introductory weeks, seminars) as well as obstacles and challenges. They should compare those results with their own experiences (self-reflexion).\r\n\r\nTeachers' project assignment: identifying the skills, competences, business knowledge and key qualifications that are being taught during the students' vocational training as well as the measures to prepare the students for entering the international job market (internationalisation strategy of the school).

We, the Staatliche Berufsschule Eichst\u00e4tt, are a vocational school with more than 1,400 students. The school is located in Bavaria, Germany. As more and more small and medium-sized companies, which are our dual partners, have transnational business relations they need internationally qualified staff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the requirements on local, national and international levels our school is about implementing an international strategy in our school development programme. We aim to develop the skills of our students, to increase their employability and career prospects on the European job market and to modernise our education and training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA first step towards this goal is our mobility project in cooperation with the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London. In 2015 we want to send 40 apprentices to the United Kingdom. The apprentices are part-time students who do an apprenticeship as a management assistant in retail business, in wholesale and foreign trade or office management assistants. In order to increase their business knowledge, intercultural experience and language skills the students attend an Intensive Course (PDP - Professional Development Programmes) that takes 3 weeks. In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics. Their professional competences are developed through team work, communication and and oral presentations. During their stay at  British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding. After the course the students get the European College of Business and Management Attendance Certificate and the German-British Chamber Certificate (AHK London). Moreover, after successful completion of their final exams of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) in Germany they can acquire the Kaufmann/-frau International Certificate (KIC), which is fficially accredited by the German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce (AHK) in London. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we want to enable and support companies and students to establish and maintain international business partnerships it is also necessary to qualify our educational staff to organize and develop European mobility programmes and partnerships and to teach our students language and intercultural skills in a modern way. Thus, we also want to send teachers to the UK to do a training assignment or work placement at the ECBM or the German-English Camber of Industry and Commerce. During their stay some of them are going to monitor and accompany our students in London. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of modern teaching methods and hands-on-learning in order to prepare all participants to work successfully and confidently in an international business environment is of high importance for the whole project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success and quality of the project will be monitored and assessed with different instruments, e. g.  written and oral tests, feedbacks and questionnaires.

After having offered a language course for industrial clerk, bank clerk and office administration clerk trainees at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London for the past years we have now taken the decision to offer a practical training for retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees with B.I.G. Bristol. \u201cProject 1\u201d mentioned in this application form is the course at the ECBM, \u201cProject 2\u201d is the practical training with B.I.G. Bristol.\r\n\r\nAfter getting in contact with the European College of Business and Management by the recommendation of another vocational school, various teachers of our school took part in a further education course at the ECBM. The experiences we gained there concretised the planning of an own project which was implemented the year after. Both the economic and pedagogic skills of the teachers at the ECBM concerning the transmission of central aspects of the British economy, culture and politics have convinced us to continue this project for more than ten years now.\r\n\r\nThe decision of offering another project (project 2) has prompted us to choose B.I.G. Bristol as a further partner organisation for retail clerk respectively wholesale clerk trainees. We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. B.I.G. Bristol organise practical trainings which meet the job requirements of our retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of project 1 is to enable 24 students from the vocational school \"Staatliche Berufsschule II Memmingen\" to attend a three-weeks course at the European College of Business and Management in London. The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 20 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. \r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students. They enter a new field with unknown cultural and social requirements, they learn to communicate and to cooperate with students and teachers.

Many of them are doing their traineeship in internationally operating companies. Therefore, they should gain job-related experience abroad as soon as possible. Getting insights into international business processes and using English as the language of business are elements that give these students a professional and personal advantage. Therefore, we are helping our students to be successful on the European labour market. \r\nOur teachers, taking part in the project gain insights in planning and conducting European projects and exchange skills and methods with English-speaking colleagues.\r\n\r\nDeveloping personal skills and competences:\r\n\r\nBesides, spending time abroad is helping the students to overcome fears of foreign things and helps them to gain intercultural competences. Our students live in small villages in rural Upper Bavaria. Spending three weeks in multicultural London will make a huge impression on them. Besides, working and living abroad in host families will contribute to a positive personal development. That will also help to promote tolerance and to eliminate prejudices.\r\nOur teachers also profit from staying abroad and strengthen their insights into the European idea.

MY AIM III therefore follows a consistent development, continuing the approach of our first projects.\r\nAs a certified European School the Berufskolleg M\u00f6nchengladbach encourages and supports students in developing  a broad European perspective. Promoting mobility is especially emphasized. The new project MY AIM III is directed at trainees and VET students and aditionally focuses on training staff in schools and companies. We offer participants the possibility to do a work placement in another European country so that they can try out and put into practice their professional, linguistic and personal competences in new challenging contexts.\r\nMY AIM combined central objectives promoted by the ERASMUS+-programme  -  lifelong  learning, further development of employability, internationalisation of professional education as well as recognition and certification of learning outcomes \u2013 with a self-management approach. The tools and instruments used in self-management (planning tools, setting objectives, feedback-analysis) are especially suited to develop and expand personal competences in the context of European work placements. The following project MY AIM/ OUR AIM  has aimed at implementing these objectives on all organisational levels: on the individual level of the trainee, on the organisational of the school itself, on the level of cooperations with our partner companies.\r\nECVET-principles (recognition of learning outcomes, identification of units of learning) and  ECVET-instruments are essential elements of the general project management as well as tools for managing the participants\u00b4 learning process.\r\nThe new follow-up project MY AIM III seeks to perpetuate this development.\r\n\r\nThe project MY AIM III will have a decisive influence on:\r\n-  the internationalisation of vocational training concepts\r\n - the \u201eEuropeanisation\u201c of professional qualifications\r\n- the participants\u00b4 abilities to organize and influence their professional development actively, autonomously and self-confidently and to discover broader perspectives regarding their professional mobility\r\n- the cooperating companies to take into account not only purely professional skills, but to a larger extent personal competences \r\n- the Berufskolleg Volksgartenstra\u00dfe to focus more on students\u00b4 individual competences and learning processes and to develop an even broader European perspective in professional education\r\n\r\nThe results of MY AIM will be presented to and made available for a broad public.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004693_1"], [2018, "Internationaler Kaufmann - Neue Wege in der Berufsausbildung f\u00fcr Industriekaufleute", "European College of Business and Management", 66009.0, 2, 2, "We see our newly prepared course \u201eInternationaler Kaufmann \u2013 Neue Wege in der Berufsbildung f\u00fcr Industriekaufleute\u201d as integrated foreign-language training.

Therefore, we want to improve their language, intercultural, personal and professional competences in order to prepare them for the international job market and to contribute to a tolerant and peaceful environment. In the quality agreement of our school we state that our students and teachers should have the chance to spend some time abroad and to acquire international certificates. \r\nFor the long-term realisation of our projects it\u2019s essential to qualify our teachers step by step. We want to enable them to organize and develop European mobility programmes and partnerships and to teach our students language and intercultural skills in a modern way. \r\n\r\nProject description\r\nOne step towards this goal is our mobility project \u201c\u201eOur business is our future \u2013 Enhancing Students\u2019 and Teachers' International Capabilities\u201c  that we organize in cooperation with the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London. Within the next two years  we want to send 40 students  to the United Kingdom. The students do an apprenticeship as a management assistant in retail business, in wholesale and foreign trade or office management assistants. In order to increase their business knowledge, intercultural experience and language skills the students attend an Intensive Course (PDP - Professional Development Programmes) that takes 3 weeks. In the courses they get an overview of British business and culture and an introduction to their specific areas of occupation and interest which can be built upon at a later stage. There are also excursions that have close relevance to the course topics, e.g. to London Stock Exchange, MINI plant in Oxford, Bosch in Denham, The Bank of England Museum or The Thames Barrier. During their stay at British guest families and in London they gain insights in British life and culture and  improve their cross-cultural competence and understanding.\r\n\r\nSecond, we sent 6 teachers to the ECBM for one week in order to do a job-shadowing, to improve their language and professional skills and to gather information. They will talk to project managers and to students and will make sure that the quality of our project is maintained and optimized. They also monitor and accompany our students in London and are responsible for the organization of excursions and trips. \r\n\r\nProject success and certificates\r\nThe success and quality of the project will be monitored and assessed with different instruments. We rely on instruments like the participants and learning agreement according to ECVET-standards to make the project goals measurable and visible. During their stay the students are monitored by our staff and with a set of feedback instruments we make sure that all of our participants meet the project goals. At the end of their stay our students write a test, do an oral presentation and hand in an executive summary. After the course the students get the European College of Business and Management Attendance Certificate and the German-British Chamber Certificate (AHK London). Moreover, after successful completion of their final exams of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) in Germany they can acquire the Kaufmann/-frau International Certificate (KIC), which is officially accredited by the German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce (AHK) in London.

Having started with 40 participating students we are actually sending 60 students to London.\r\n\r\nThe title of the project \u2018Banking centre London among the shades of the financial crisis\u2019 clearly describes our aim: future bank employees should act faithfully and reliably on international financial places. During their stay in London the students should discover banking centre London with its severe problems. They should learn about British economy, banking centre London und British politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the stock exchange for example our students will make up their mind about London.\r\n\r\nTarget group of our project are \u2018Investmentfondskaufleute\u2019 and \u2018Bankkaufleute\u2019 who started their traineeship one year ago.

Their employers are mainly banks and investments funds companies in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIn London students mainly spend their time in college and getting to know the city as a financial centre. The college works out a training scheme tailored to needs of our students and is responsible for conducting the subjects. The lessons are held by native speakers. Excursions are also a part of the training program. At the end of the stay the students have to pass several exams to get 3 certificates. \r\n\r\nEarly planning is very important for us: in September 2014 college, flights and hotel rooms have to be reserved. Booking the flight we also contract a travel cancellation insurance which covers the students\u2019 own contribution of 650 \u20ac. For many years now we are guests of the Lancaster Hall Hotel in London and we stick to all of our partners that we are working now for many years. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s our aim that students improve their professional, social, intercultural and linguistic skills. The following vocational and social competences should be expanded: the participants should discover the banking centre London and they should follow the college lessons about economic, political and cultural topics held in the English language. Furthermore they have to live and work with students of other institutions in an unknown surrounding. This requires a high level of social responsibility. The participants will get to know a foreign culture, because London itself is a melting pot of cultures. Going by tube to the college, going to museums is also a part of the students\u2019 intercultural experiences in a very open and tolerant society.

Backround of the project:The Kaufm\u00e4nnische Berufsschule IV sends students to the ECBM, located in London. These students work in the field of business administration and are involved in an international working area.That\u00b4s why staying abroad would mean a lot to them, both for their professional and personal future. The project is run in two flows:1st flow: 14.05.17 - 03.06.172nd flow: 03.06.18 - 23.06.182. The aim of the project:All participants are expected to improve their professional and social competences, their cultural awareness and also their language skills.3. Number and profile of participants:In each flow 23 participants from all different professional guilds take part.4. Description of activities:- Preparation- Students are hosted by guest families and have to take part in school lessons at ECBM. - They will work in groups, doing Internet research while preparing a final project work dealing with a predetermined topic. - They participate in excursions and different cultural programmes. - In the end they all have to pass a final exam, which consists of 1. a written test, 2. an oral test and 3. a project work.- Monitoring- Evaluation5. Methodology:All participants have the chance to improve their above-mentioned competences and skills. They broaden their horizon by taking part in actively held school lessons and also by experiencing the everyday life in a foreign country. 6. Results, long- term effects and benefits of the project:- All participants get the chance to improve their competences and chances on the international labour market.- Companies benefit from training of their human resources.- The local area remains competitive as compared to international standards.- The unemployment among youth can be reduced.7. ECVET - Europass Mobility/CV, Learning agreements  and various Certificates- Learning agreements with all students and signed by all partners- Europass Mobility/CV for the students to document the Mobilty Activity- the students get also further certificates to document the activities by the ECBM and the German-British ChamberII. 2 apprentices will go to Spain to participate in a four-weeks learning and training programme. Up to now we only conducted 2 weeks programmes in our partner institution. It is our intention to send 2 apprentices -minimum- each year to Spain, to get to know our partner institution and to take part in a training programme in companies for 2 weeks. Also our partners want the exchange projects and will send 3 apprenteces to us at our school.III. This year we will start an exchange programme with our partner institution \"Institut de Vic\" which aims exactly at our colleagues of our vocational college or perhaps some neighbouring schools as well. We would like our colleagues to aquire some knowledge about the educational programme especially in the vocational area which is perfomed in Spain and Catalonia. They should get to know our partner institution in Vic as well as the colleagues who are teaching there and the whole institution. We would like them to to build up contacts there. We will start this programme with a small group of 6 teachers, that they will be able to act as future multipliers. We do this according to our mission statement. We do hope that our partners will also get the funding in Spain, that we can welcome our Spanish friends here as well.This is our strategy for internationalisation especially for the application in 2016. We are dealing on two levels at the moment, on the level of the teachers of vocational training and on the level of apprentices.

After having offered a language course for industrial clerk, bank clerk and office administration clerk trainees at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) in London for the past years we have now taken the decision to offer a practical training for retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees with B.I.G. Bristol. \u201cProject 1\u201d mentioned in this application form is the course at the ECBM, \u201cProject 2\u201d is the practical training with B.I.G. Bristol.\r\n\r\nAfter getting in contact with the European College of Business and Management by the recommendation of another vocational school, various teachers of our school took part in a further education course at the ECBM. The experiences we gained there concretised the planning of an own project which was implemented the year after. Both the economic and pedagogic skills of the teachers at the ECBM concerning the transmission of central aspects of the British economy, culture and politics have convinced us to continue this project for more than ten years now.\r\n\r\nThe decision of offering another project (project 2) has prompted us to choose B.I.G. Bristol as a further partner organisation for retail clerk respectively wholesale clerk trainees. We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. B.I.G. Bristol organise practical trainings which meet the job requirements of our retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of project 1 is to enable 24 students from the vocational school \"Staatliche Berufsschule II Memmingen\" to attend a three-weeks course at the European College of Business and Management in London. The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.\r\n\r\nAt the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.\r\n\r\nConcerning project 2, 20 wholesale and retail clerk trainees take part in a two-week internship in various commercial companies. They will get a close insight into the job-related practical experience and get the chance to interchange with their British colleagues. \r\n\r\nNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. \r\n\r\nAnother major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students. They enter a new field with unknown cultural and social requirements, they learn to communicate and to cooperate with students and teachers.

This shall secure their chances on the international employment market. The involved companies are especially looking forward to the intense training program with the exams for the \"international businessman\" at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\n\r\nAt each flow there will be 20 apprentices participating from mainly medium-sized wholesaler-companies. Most of them take part in the project at the beginning of their second year at school. Some of them could already participate at exchange-programs in their former schools, but up to now, they had no chance to collect job-related experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nOrganization and implementation:\r\n\r\n1. Preparation:\r\n\r\nIn the preparation we discuss with Sarah Iles (ECBM) the content of the course, adjust them with the curriculum and sign the contract with the ECBM (ECVET). We inform the companies, select the participants, determine the learning agreements (ECVET), organize the flights and the airport-transfer, conclude the insurances and prepare the participants intensively for their stay in London.\r\n\r\n2. Project:\r\nDuring the activity the ECBM will be responsible for transfers, selection of host families, the course-program, excursions and evaluations. The attending teacher will work closely with the teachers of the ECBM and secure the transfers of our students.\r\n \r\n3. Post-processing:\r\n\r\nIn the post-processing the participants will evaluate the project and present their experiences to the other students and prospective participants. So we can ensure to go on with the project and to enrich the lessons in school. They write articles for the annual report at school and the local newspapers. Additionally we will complete their EUROPASS-documents. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our main aim, to intensify the job-related knowledge and skills on an international way and to increase the linguistic skills of the participants, to encourage their willingness to achieve life-long learning and mobility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statements of the IHK companies are forced to raise their international activities in case of acquisition and sales.\r\nThe vocational skills of the employees should be prepared for this development.\r\nLinguistic skills in English, the international language of commerce, and knowledge of typical economic structures of an important trading-partner will be a competitive advantage for our wholesalers.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to continue and to intensify our cooperation with the ECBM. Each year shall 20 motivated apprentices take part in this project. For the involved teachers means the close cooperation with the ECBM a possibility to interchange information and ideas on an European level and to receive an insight to the global trading point London \r\nThese experiences and perceptions will be enrich the normal vocational lessons in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe ECBM project is supposed to be a further part of our strategy to internationalize our school.

We have established the project for the apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and we have been extending it to the benefit of our apprentices in Banking. Having started with 40 participating students we are now sending 60 students to London.\r\n\r\nThe title of the project \u2018The financial centre of London affected by the \u20ac-crisis\u2019 clearly describes our aim: future bank employees should be able to act responsibly and reliably at international financial places. During their stay in London the students are supposed to discover the banking centre London with its severe problems as well as learn about British economy and politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange, for example, our students will get a deeper insight into London.\r\n\r\nThe target group of our project are apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and apprentices in Banking who started their traineeship one year ago. They have already passed their intermediate examination and have received theoretical training in form of block teaching in our vocational school. Their employers are mainly banks and investment fund companies in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIn London students mainly spend their time in college and get to know the city as a financial centre. The college works out a training scheme tailored to needs of our students and is responsible for teaching the subjects. The lessons are held by native speakers. Excursions are also a part of the training programme. At the end of the stay the students have to pass several exams to receive three certificates:\r\n- Certificate of the ECBM \r\n- Certificate of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce\r\n- Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK)\r\n\r\nEarly planning is very important for us: in September 2015 the college, the flights and the hotel rooms have to be reserved.

For many years now we have been guests at the Lancaster Hall Hotel in London and we have been working with the college and our travel agency. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s our aim that students improve their professional, social, intercultural and linguistic skills. The following vocational and social competences should be expanded: the participants should discover the banking centre London and they should follow the college lessons about economic, political and cultural topics held in English. Furthermore they have to live and work with students of other institutions in an unknown surrounding. This requires a high level of social responsibility. The participants will get to know a foreign culture, because London itself is a melting pot of cultures. Going to the college by tube or going to museums are also part of the students\u2019 intercultural experiences in a very open and tolerant society. In discussions with their professors they will automatically think about the different strategies that the two countries have to solve their problems.

During this evaluation, an opportunity for growth regarding its international orientation was observed.  The increasing importance of international work experience as part of a successful future work profile is widely recognised. Based on this realisation the German Parliament decided in 2013, that the goal is to enable at least 10% of all apprentices to gain international work experience in some form.  The predominantly small and medium sized company landscape in the region of Kempten/Allgaeu, allows for rather limited opportunities for students to gather international experience e.g. in foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the BS II Kempten decided on integrating the \u201cinternational orientation\u201d into its set of targets. Concrete goal is to support more students, in cooperation with their employers, to gather international work experience.\r\n\r\nAfter analysing the demand and defining the strategic goal, available resources to meet the targets were evaluated. As a key result, the main concern is the financial feasibility for the students. As a consequence, this application form was put together. With the financial support of the Erasmus+ programme for the apprentices, the vocational School Kempten II would be enabled to reinforce an international awareness within its organization by  establishing an annual mobility project and therefore support the Bundestagsbeschluss from 2013. By organizing this annual mobility the school  can realize its target of \"international orientation\". \r\n\r\nWhat exactly does that mean? The BS II Kempten is planning to introduce an annual student mobility activity for 22 students from the professions Bank, Industry, Logistics,  Wholesale and IT. Our partnering institution is the European College of Business and Management (ECBM) based in London. The ECBM is the educational academy of the German-British Chamber of industry and commerce. It already proofed to be extremely reliable and experienced, which supports our selection as a partnering institution. \r\n\r\nEvery year the 22 participants of the mobility will take part in an especially designed 3-week \u201cProfessional Development Programme (PDP)\u201d. Besides the in-depth examination of various topics in business, politics and society from a European and international perspective, the programme will touch on multiple functional and cross-functional topics. The housing of the students will be realized in guest families. Benefit of this is twofold; the students will dive deep into the British culture as well as significantly improve their language skills.\r\nWith the participation in the PDP the apprentices have the possibility to receive the KIC (Kaufmann International Certificate). This prestigious international qualification will be achieved by an oral and a written exam, as well as a dissertation. Additional requirement for this certificate is the graduation of the commercial apprenticeship in Germany. Furthermore all students will obtain the \"Europass Mobility\" as a record of the acquired competences. In combination with the \"Europass CV\" (which will already be created by the students in the project application process) these documents constitute the foundation for future application possibilities all over Europe. \r\n\r\nA multilevel application procedure is conducted for the selection of the participants. A specific preparation phase, the mentoring of the students in London and the reflexion phase at the end of the mobility project are further important components. Rounded up is the mobility by the ceremonial award of the \"Europass Mobilit\u00e4t\", where not only the participants but also the school management and administration, the staff and the cooperative companies will be invited. The realisation of the project is accompanied by a project management concept that helps to ensure the success of the project. Especially appropriate evaluation tools should support the continuous improvement process of further Mobilities. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project is multidimensional. The apprentices will not only achieve a substantial increase in different competences, but also experience a leap in their personality development. Taking part in an Erasmus+ Programme improves particularly self-confidence and proactivity in young adults. The mobility is also expected to have an impact on family, friends, school staff and the cooperative companies. By being involved in a mobility project, even if it is just in a passive way, people will be more aware of the importance of the European idea and the peaceful international cooperation.

During that time, they will be working at the European College of Business and Management (ECBM). The ECBM is the training college for the German-British Chamber of Commerce. It was founded in 1988 and is well established in the fields of basic and continuous training. They offer the \"Professional Development Programme\" (PDP), a 3-week, intensive course, which is tailored to our students. During the PDP, our students will complete and earn the certificate of \u201cinternational businessperson\u201d. This certificate is awarded by the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK London). This is supposed to ensure that the qualifications and skills gained abroad will improve the student\u2019s chances in the job market and that the experiences abroad will have a lasting effect. Selection process:The selection process for the project will be taking place in two different ways. Students from the economics department taking part in the additional qualification \"foreign language correspondence clerk\" offered by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, will be part of the project as well as other applicants from the economics department. All participating students are obliged to hand in a letter of motivation as well as the Europass Curriculum Vitae as well as the Europass Language passport.The participating teachers in the project are being chosen on the basis of their willingness to take part in the project. In the long term, the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen is planning to extend the circle of people as it is one of the main objectives of the school to introduce an internationalisation strategy.Main objectives of the project, concerning students and teachers:Enhancing professional skills and competences:One key objective of the project is a further qualification of the trainees of our economics department. Many of them are doing their traineeship in international companies. Therefore, they should gain job-related experience abroad as soon as possible. Gaining insight into international business processes and using English as the language of business are elements that give these students a professional and personal advantage. Therefore, we are helping our students to be successful on the European labour market. Our teachers, taking part in the project gain insights in planning and conducting European projects and exchange skills and methods with English-speaking colleagues.Developing personal skills and competences:Besides, spending time abroad is helping the students to overcome fears of foreign things and helps them to gain intercultural competences. Our students live in small villages in rural Upper Bavaria. Spending three weeks in multicultural London will make a huge impression on them. Besides, working and living abroad in host families will contribute to a positive personal development. That will also help to promote tolerance and to eliminate prejudices.Our teachers also profit from staying abroad and strengthen their insights into the European idea. Intercultural competences can only be communicated if one is convinced of the idea oneself.Objectives of the project, concerning the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen and its partners:The staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen wants to establish an internationalisation strategy. We want to create a network of national and international partners, from which everyone (companies, students, teacher, and our foreign partners) can profit. Even though, the staatliche Berufsschule Pfaffenhofen is located in the prosperous region north of Munich, which is constantly profiting from a steady influx of people, demographic change has got an impact on all institutions in vocational training. As a consequence, we see internationalisation as a chance to improve our chances as well as those of our partners in the economy to get highly motivated, productive and cosmopolitan trainees.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002853_1"], [2015, "Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK) - Vorbereitung auf die Internationalisierung der Arbeitswelt", "European College of Business and Management", 56813.0, 2, 2, "The project with the title \"Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK) - preparation for the internationalisation of the business world\" is conducted by the two project partners Staatliche Berufsschule Schwabach and European College of Business and Management (ECBM).

The PDP-Programme was especially developed for students of vocational schools. It imparts language competence as well as comprehensive competence in the area of management. It is especially the aim of the project to increase the business knowledge, experience and language skills.\r\n\r\nIndustrial management assistants are deployed in companies of any kind and size. They are responsible for the planning, realisation and control of diverse areas of business responsibilities. It is the aim that an industrial management assistant can handle all business tasks. Due to the international movement of goods two qualifications are becoming more and more important - extended knowledge of foreign languages and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nThe newly developed training for office management assistants puts special emphasis on the internationalisation of the trainees. Office management assistants organise and deal with office tasks i.e. they handle business management activities such as purchase order processing, purchasing, accounting, marketing and personnel management. The fields of activity are very diverse: office management assistants can work for industrial companies and trading companies as well as for public service or business associations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the internationalisation of the business world the requirements that are made on trainees are increasing. The requirements include foreign language competence, openness for other cultures, self-dependence as well as internationally recognized degrees and the readiness for international employment.\r\n\r\nThe training companies of the Berufsschule Schwabach have production facilities, suppliers and customers within Europe and outside Europe. That's why the companies set high value on the ability to communicate, foreign language competences and intercultural competences. Therefore the practical and intensive application of English and the improvement of the students' communication skills are expected to be advanced and deepened by this project. Another aspect is that the students gain insight into another culture, another way of living and another business world. The participants of the project experience another way of living by staying with a host family. This helps them to reduce potentially existing prejudices towards other cultures.\r\n\r\nIn a working environment that is growing together closer and closer it won't be enough in the future to possess only a national degree.

This course aims to enable interested students to complete a vocational, linguistic and cultural advanced training beyond the scope of their daily work and school life.Aims of the project:On the one hand, the course is aimed at improving the participants\u2019 language skills in specific vocational and general topics. On the other hand, by providing them with an insight into the British economic capital, the apprentices will have a chance to widen their perspectives beyond their own/national experience and thus be more able to contribute to the development of the European community.Number/Profiles of the participants: Every year, 22 young people, who are completing their first apprenticeship in different commercial professions, participate in this course. The students are aged between 17 and 22 years (depending on their educational background). As the participants are from different commercial courses, many of the group members first get to know each other during the four preparatory meetings.Description of the activities: In a preparatory phase lasting approx. 6 months, the supervising teachers prepare the apprentices intensively for the training course during four preparatory meetings, in order to ensure productive work at the College. During the three-week stay in London, different lecturers from the College - together with the participants - will work on subjects in English, such as: presentation skills, business correspondence, the modern British economy, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, career development opportunities etc. During a three-hour exam in their third project week, the students will be tested on the knowledge aquired about the topics they have dealt with. In addition, at the end of the training course, the participants have to make a presentation in English about a previously chosen topic, which will be marked together with the summary that has to be handed in. Apart from school activities, the lecturers make various topic-related field trips together with the apprentices. Furthermore, two companies will be visited in order to gain an insight into the work environment of the financial centre of London. To round things off, guided city tours and visits to theatres and museums are offered as well. Despite the wide range of the course content, it is also important for us that the young people still have the possibility to explore the cosmopolitan city of London on their own and come to terms with a multicultural population. For this reason, the accommodation in host families \u2013 in a foreign-language environment \u2013 has proved itself to be very valuable.Methods: It is agreed with the College that the three-week training course is instructed and accompanied by lecturers and supervising teachers. However, the participants have to complete their tasks independently and on their own responsibility.Lasting advantages which can be expected by participating in this project:1) Informing others in their company, school and private surroundings of the many impressions they have gained: these young people come back to their familiar environment with new and diverse experiences from abroad. In doing so, they pass on their impressions to their families, friends and acquaintances which leads to a widening of general interest. The companies feel encouraged in their active support when they recognize that their apprentices have improved noticeably in all areas. Thus, very often, new enquiries from the training companies regarding future projects arise only shortly afterwards. In school, the students present their project work to their classmates in English and thereby awaken their curiosity and earn additional respect because of their good performance.2) Expansion of professional/personal perspectives: Experience shows that the young students returning from the three-week programme in London are more self-confident, balanced and motivated. In many cases, their attitudes towards other cultures have changed and their wish to have further experiences abroad has grown.3) Increased professional/personal opportunities: Dealing intensively with cultural, linguistic and vocational matters in a foreign environment, the students who complete this course will gain new opportunities in their professional as well as in their private lives. Their improved foreign language skills, which can be presented to any (future) employer with the Certificate and the Europass Mobility, provide an undeniable advantage compared to other applicants.

It is the aim that an industrial management assistant can handle all business\r\ntasks. Due to the international movement of goods two qualifications are becoming more and more important - extended\r\nknowledge of foreign languages and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nThe training of office management assistants puts special emphasis on the internationalisation of the trainees.\r\nOffice management assistants organise and deal with office tasks i.e. they handle business management activities such as purchase\r\norder processing, purchasing, accounting, marketing and personnel management. The fields of activity are very diverse: office\r\nmanagement assistants can work for industrial companies and trading companies as well as for public service or business\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the internationalisation of the business world the requirements that are made on trainees are increasing. The\r\nrequirements include foreign language competence, openness for other cultures, self-dependence as well as internationally\r\nrecognized degrees and the readiness for international employment.\r\n\r\nThe training companies of the Berufsschule Schwabach have production facilities, suppliers and customers within Europe and\r\noutside Europe. That's why the companies set high value on the ability to communicate, foreign language competences and\r\nintercultural competences. Therefore the practical and intensive application of English and the improvement of the students'\r\ncommunication skills are expected to be advanced and deepened by this project. Another aspect is that the students gain insight\r\ninto another culture, another way of living and another business world. The participants of the project experience another way of\r\nliving by staying with a host family. This helps them to reduce potentially existing prejudices towards other cultures.\r\n\r\nIn a working environment that is growing together closer and closer it won't be enough in the future to possess only a national\r\ndegree. As a vocational school it is our duty to show that development to our students again and again. The PDP-programme\r\nprovides the opportunity to gain the internationally recognized degree Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK). The students are\r\nalso encouraged to think outside the box and to take international employment opportunities into consideration.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003713_1"], [2014, "Kaufm\u00e4nnische Auszubildende in England und in Estland", "European College of Business and Management", 52391.0, 3, 3, "The Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen 1 Villingen-Schwenningen (KS1) would like to enable young apprentices to get work experience abroad as part of their dual training (e.g. as industrial clerks or financial assistants). The aim of this is an increased intercultural and personal competence to help master new challenges in business as well as personal life. Businesses, which are very often internationally orientated, would thus benefit from highly motivated employees who would be more self-assured in their treatment of foreign customers and suppliers. Participation in the project can also lead to enhanced willingness to work abroad inside the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at students with university entry qualification and those entitled to study at specialist colleges and universities of applied sciences, whose level of proficiency in English is at least B2 (for Great Britain), and good students who graduated from middle school with a sound knowledge of English, which they can use to bridge communication gaps (for Estonia). The participants will be apprentices of various different professions in their second year of training. The focus will be on bank clerks, industrial clerks as well as clerks in administration, but the project will be open to all other professions, like office clerks and automotive clerks. At the time of departure, students in three-year courses will have passed about one half of their training, those in two-year courses (e.g. financial assistants) will have passed about two-thirds of their training. This will guarantee that they have sufficient qualification, competence and profound basic knowledge of economics to benefit from the internships and other offers that are part of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, the focus of the project is on obtaining the \u201coffice worker international \u2013 AHK\u201d qualification of the German-British Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nIn Estonia, the project focuses on \u201cseeing beyond the end of one\u2019s nose\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn both countries, participants are supposed to strengthen their key qualifications \u2013 teamwork, problem solving, testing self-organised procedures.

Dates for the stays have already been appointed, same as the coordination of course contents. In Great Britain, the ECBM course includes English Business Communication, excursions to the Docklands and an oral exam as well as a written essay exam. In Estonia, the agenda includes participating in classes at the two business colleges, a one-week internship, a visit to the German Embassy as well as guided tours of Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki, which will be prepared by the participants themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the project is meant to render the participating students highly independent in planning and organising their own learning situations and environment. It is a long-term goal to enhance mobility and to prepare the students for an unknown environment, as it is less and less likely for them to remain in the places where they are being trained. Intercultural competence is becoming increasingly important at school and in the workplace, with colleagues just as with customers. When dealing with them, it is of particular importance to show understanding and empathy, especially for those who come from foreign nations and cultures. Self-organisation of exchange processes is of central pedagogical importance in this project. The participants will have to let themselves in for each other, make decisions together and coordinate their decisions with those of others. Self-organisation is a crucial educational aim which is meant to enable the young people to be resourceful and to take the initiative.

They should discuss the consequences of Britain remaining member of the EU or Britain leaving  the EU.  Furthermore, they should be able to act responsibly and confidently at international financial places. During their stay in London the students are supposed to discover the banking centre London with its severe problems as well as learn about British economy and politics.  Visiting the docklands, the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange, for example, our students will get a deeper insight into London.\r\n\r\nThe target group of our project are apprentices of Investment Fund Administration and apprentices in Banking who started their traineeship one year ago. They have already passed their intermediate examination and have received theoretical training in form of block teaching in our vocational school. Their employers are mainly banks and investment fund companies in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIn London students mainly spend their time in college and get to know the city as a financial centre. The college works out a training scheme tailored to needs of our students and is responsible for teaching the subjects. The lessons are held by native speakers. Excursions are also a part of the training programme. At the end of the stay the students have to pass several exams to receive three certificates:\r\n- Certificate of the ECBM \r\n- Certificate of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce\r\n- Kaufmann/Kauffrau International (AHK)\r\n- Certification of participation in the OLS language course.\r\n\r\nEarly planning is very important for us: in September 2016 the college, the flights and the hotel rooms have to be reserved.

The experiences we gained there concretised the planning of an own project which was implemented the year after. Both the economic and pedagogic skills of the teachers at the ECBM concerning the transmission of central aspects of the British economy, culture and politics have convinced us to continue this project for more than ten years now.The decision of offering another project (project 2) has prompted us to choose B.I.G.

We got familiar with this company during a further education course about \u201cLeonardo DaVinci\u201d. B.I.G. Bristol organise practical trainings which meet the job requirements of our retail clerk and wholesale clerk trainees.The main aim of project 1 is to enable 24 students from the vocational school \"Staatliche Berufsschule II Memmingen\" to attend a three-weeks course at the European College of Business and Management in London. The students, who train to be a bank clerk, industrial clerk or office clerk, are all in their second year of vocational training. During the course the students are able to improve their language skills in English as well as their knowledge in business administration issues.At the college the students attend lessons every working day between 9.30 am and 4.45 pm. The lessons deal with topics which are related to their vocational training in Germany. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from the college. In addition to the daily lessons, the participants have to write out an assignment on a special economic or social-economic topic, which is chosen by them individually. This as well as the final presentation at the end of the course, enhances the language skills immensely.Within project 2, twenty wholesale and retail trainees get the opportunity to do a two weeks internship in several different commercial companies. There they can obtain a fundamental insight into several types of businesses, gain practical experience and have the chance to get into contact with well versed colleagues on-siteNext to the course, the students of both projects are obliged to plan and prepare several group excursions. The group leaders decide on relevant topics and talk them over with the students during the preparation meetings. The topics are then prepared in English by the student teams, so that they can be presented by them in London respectively Bristol and the surrounding area during the group excursions. Another major aim of the project is to enlarge the intercultural, social and individual skills of the students. They enter a new field with unknown cultural and social requirements, they learn to communicate and to cooperate with students and teachers.

Europe is characterised by its linguistc and cultural diversity. As a continent where three dozen languages are spoken, it is known for the high number of cultures that border on one another. But Europe means more than being able to travel and work without frontiers and customs: Europe is a true vision of society and understanding.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of globalisation, there is a greater demand than ever for multilingualism. Hardly any company can survive without international links. There is a growing need for international staff who speak foreign languages. As citizens of Europe we must be able to communicate and co-operate across borders and cultures...\r\n\r\nBackground and Participants:\r\nStudents completing a vocational education as Commercial Assistants at the Kolping College of Commerce and Foreign Languages in Heilbronn enjoy a predominantly theoretical education. In order to enhance the quality of their training and to improve the employment prospects of our young students, it is desirable for their education to include a period of practical experience abroad. Within the framework of this project, a total of approximately 25 future commercial assistants from both the first and second years of the course will take part in three-week study trips to Spain or Great Britain during the spring of 2019. At this juncture, they have yet to gain any practical experience in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe activities comprise instruction in the foreign language and business administration at partner institutes, company visits, excursions and school projects, as well as cultural events. Participants orient themselves by the GUIDE they themselves have created and, in addition, complete their project \"A DIFFERENT DAILY ROUTINE\". The contents of the trip are organised so as to complement and augment the mostly theoretical education provided by the College.\r\n\r\nAims of the Project:\r\nThe study trips are founded on the three elements of the foreign language and culture, and the world of business, and are designed to achieve goals relevant to the students' education. The knowledge students have acquired of the foreign language in the classroom can be tried out and deepened in another European country. Students are given the opportunity to undertake operational tasks while gaining an insight into the business life of the foreign country and familiarising themselves with its work culture and lifestyle. The encounter with the country's culture takes the form of their daily routine combined with visits to museums and the theatre.\r\n\r\nProcedure and Implementation:\r\nWe remain in continuous contact with our partner institutes, so that we can involve students, parents, teachers and the college as a whole during the course of the year leading up to a study trip. As soon as assurance of support has been granted, the project managers contact our partner institutes in order to co-ordinate the details. Host families are selected by our partner institutes. The project management team deals with the organisation of the trip and the formalities of insurance and legal contracts, also communicating with the parents of the participants on these matters. The students themselves finally draw up the supporting programme as well as their GUIDE as part of their course in project management at the College.\r\nAims and Benefits:\r\nParticipants write reports in which they present their results and how they personally have benefited from the study trip. \r\n\r\nThe results we aspire to achieve are to increase participants' abilities in the foreign language as well as their intercultural competence, and to improve their school marks and education. In addition, they gain practical experience, a more attractive profile for their CV, and contacts at companies in other European countries, all of which are beneficial when seeking future employment. There are long-term gains not only for the future careers of our participants but also for firms, inasmuch as they are provided with well-educated skilled personnel.\r\n\r\nOne result our institute strives for is to foster close and trusting ties  to our co-operation partners in other European countries and the willingness to conduct further mobility and other EU projects.\r\n\r\nA final positive effect is the promotion of the European vision through the international orientation of our vocational training. \r\n\r\nThese study trips may be interpreted as part of a great story helping us to understand others, the people we live together with as Europeans.", "http://www.eurocollege.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004513_1"], [2014, "Background to european business", "European College of Business and Management", 50532.0, 3, 3, "Ulm Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK Ulm) is submitting an application to offer trainees in commercial occupations requiring formal training the opportunity to acquire the additional qualification of \"international merchant\" (AHK) in a three-week stay in London or a four-week stay in Madrid. \r\n\r\nThe application is being submitted by three institutions: Ulm Chamber of Commerce and Industry (sending organisation) and the European College of Business & Management (ECBM) in England as well as the German Chamber of Commerce for Spain in Madrid as receiving organisations. \r\n\r\nUlm Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a self-regulatory body of the regional economy with approximately 30,000 member companies in the administrative districts of Alb-Donau and Biberach as well as in the urban district of Ulm.

Open data -- data that is available to everyone -- is exponentially growing, and it has completely transformed the way we now conduct any kind of research or scholarship; it has changed the scientific method. The recent development of Linked Open Data has only increased the possibilities for exploiting public data.Given the value of open data how do we preserve it for future use? Currently, much of the data we use, e.g. demographic records, clinical statistics, personal and enterprise data as well as many scientific measurements cannot be reproduced. However, there is overwhelming evidence that we should keep such data where it is technically and economically feasible to do so. Until now this problem has been approached by keeping this information in fixed data sets and using extensions to the standard methods of disseminating and archiving traditional (paper) artifacts. Given the complexity, the interlinking and the dynamic nature of current data, especially Linked Open Data, radically new methods are needed.DIACHRON tackles this problem with a fundamental assumption: that the processes of publishing and preservation data are one and the same. Data are archived at the point of creation and archiving and dissemination are synonymous. DIACHRON takes on the challenges of evolution, archiving, provenance, annotation, citation, and data quality in the context of Linked Open Data and modern database systems.

It has propitiated the present project that will.meet the demands of educational VET Schools, enhancing better relationships among them  and national and European companies.\r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to 72 VET students and former students: second-year students of middle level vocational training of Tourism and Gastronomy, Computer Science and Administration or recent graduated (who graduated the last year), like mid-level technician of the mentioned professional sectors. \r\nThe project foresees 8 mobility flows: 4 to Italy, 1 to France, 1 to Poland and 2 to United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nEach VET school will select 3 former students and 9 students. The project foresees that 4 mobility flows will be carried out to Italy as the profile of the Italian partners as well as the different geographical areas they are located, will provide the students with the chance to be trained in very diverse companies of the same sectors.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the ODEE project is to promote student\u2019s development of skills and competences through internships in companies in order to integrate the vocational competences they have already acquired and to efficiently enter the single European labour market. Therefore, students need, from one hand, to develop specific and technical skills in their professional sector, and from another hand, they also need to acquire and improve other key competencies, like cultural, linguistic, entrepreneurship, personal initiative, team, as well as to acquire knowledge about new different work environments. All these competences will enhance student\u2019s access to the EU labour market, both as self-employee and/or hired worker.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES that partners of the project will carry out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\nThe impact on the partnership\u2019s VET schools will be:\r\n- Improving qualifications and competitiveness of youngsters, enabling them to adapt to the digital era\u2019s demands and to a global knowledge-based economy, enhancing , at the same time, the increase of the youth employment and a sustainable growth.\r\n- Consolidating and increasing contacts with European entities to modernise education, to share good practices and to develop new projects in the field of European cooperation\r\n- Improving the quality of the training, delivered in the school, and adapted to linguistic, social and cultural diversity.

Social inclusion means enabling every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job, that means:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adequate income support together with help to get a job\r\n\r\n\u2022 Inclusive labour markets making it easier for people to join the work force,\r\n\r\n\u2022 Access to quality services helping people participate actively in society, including getting back to work.\r\n\r\nThe fight against poverty is at the heart of the Europe2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth: 2011 statistics states that 24% of all the EU population (about 120 million people) are at risk of social exclusion \u2013 20,5% of those over 65, and 9% of those with a job [DG employment and social affairs]. \r\n\r\nOne of the most promising areas to address these problems is the promotion of business creation by people who are disadvantaged in entrepreneurship and self-employment. In the last years the employment losses where concentrated among temporary and permanent employees and overall there was job-creation among the self-employed [EU Employment Observatory Review2010]. A great example is represented by cooperative enterprises. According to the ILO an increase of cooperative start-ups has been noticed [EACB2010], showing resilience over the last 165 years, adapting to different political regimes, continuously integrating new needs and aspirations linked to the deep social and economic transformation through democratically controlled enterprises [2014, Resilience of the Cooperative Business Model in Times of Crisis,ILO]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite these significant challenges, many people with disadvantage still want to, and can have careers as entrepreneurs. What they often lack are the support systems, funding, access to training and especially the encouragement that can make the difference in bringing their entrepreneurship hopes and aspirations to fruition. The inclusive aspects of cooperative enterprises can lead to self-empowerment including confidence-building and social inclusion for individuals at risk of exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IT WILL HAPPEN?\r\n\r\nConsistently with Erasmus+, the project will contribute to improve the level of key competences and skills of disadvantaged individuals that are potential or actual self-employers, through strengthened cooperation between education and training, work and the social economy, non-profit and voluntary sectors, in a EU dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperationally this will be achieved by developing and testing an ONLINE ROLE-PLAY PLATFORM, designed to discover, enhance and promote entrepreneurial skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY A GAME?\r\n\r\nPlaying is maybe the most natural human instinct and it is the best way in which people learn and experience reality. Most people intuitively understand that when they play, they learn. Learning within serious games occurs through smart play. In this context, the partnership sees \u2018play\u2019, as a construct of innovation connecting, reorganizing and redeploying from small groups to more players around specific endeavours and enabling them to self-organize based on their capabilities, interests and reputation capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY AN ON-LINE ROLE PLAY GAME TO APPROACH SELF-ENTREPRENEURSHIP?\r\n\r\nStarting from these considerations, the partnership thought about the potential use of games in transferring knowledge and competences in the context of Social Economy, focusing in particular on social entrepreneurship and cooperation. What makes cooperatives unique and powerful is the centrality of each member, in particular of those with experience of vulnerability. Being a member of a cooperative is about building relationships, sharing rules, common intents and working together in order to produce mutual benefit. This inborn humanity is what makes cooperatives flexible and resilient, in some way it is what makes them so similar to Role Play Games (RPG).  In RPGs each player has its own proper abilities, strengths and weaknesses, he/she has to face threats and seize opportunities. Through cooperation with other players, he/she can achieve objectives that would have been impossible to reach if alone. \r\n\r\nPlayers can\u2019t help but learn the skills necessary to master a game while they play, and they usually improve quite rapidly. This approach improves access to learning for vulnerable groups while shifting from costly and infrastructure-heavy training and development programs to more flexible contextual learning models that allow people to develop emerging new skills as needed.", "http://www.tavinstitute.org", "TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RELATIONS LBG", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA200-001830_coordinator"], [2017, "Community Networking for Integration of Young People in NEET Situation", "TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RELATIONS LBG", 305248.0, 5, 8, "Given the scale of youth unemployment, Member States share a sense of urgency of developing effective interventions aimed at promoting youth employment and preventing the disengagement of NEETs from society. The EU youth unemployment percentage is more than double the overall unemployment rate (19% compared with 9% in Aug.2016) and masks big differences between countries: from DE, with 7% to ES, with 43%. It is EU policy that after finishing secondary school, young people should either obtain a job or enter further education or training: if not, they should receive appropriate support through active labour market or social measures. Young people who have fallen through the net need tailored support to get back on track. Disengaged young people often have complex problems that act as a barrier to getting back into learning or accessing and sustaining appropriate employment. This can rarely be addressed by one institution, but needs joined up ways involving cross-sectoral and interinstitutional cooperation to provide targeted and individualised solutions.

(2)To DESIGN, CONCEIVE AND DEVELOP A MODEL OF INTERVENTION relevant to the countries of the partnership; (3)To conduct a PILOT APPLICATION of the methodology at local level in PT, ES and IT; (4)To promote AWARENESS MEETINGS in the context of the project to EXCHANGE EXPERIENCES and identify best practices already in place; (5)To validate the model through a LOCAL MULTI-STAKEHOLDER approach and to evaluate the impact of this experience/model; (6)To reinforce and match the role of different local/regional stakeholders to find the best means of optimization, and increase the NETWORKING CAPACITY, with a view to enhance NEETs social inclusion and employability; (7)To DISSEMINATE and EXPLORE, the project results among relevant beneficiaries and ensure their SUSTAINABILITY at a practice level through the training of professionals and at the institutional level, influencing policies and changing the culture of services provided.\r\nTo achieve these aims and objectives, the project is organized in 5 intellectual outputs, multiplier events (1 focus group, 3 networking activities and 3 national seminars in PT, ES and IT), 6 transnational meetings, one combined with a European final Conference in PT, 2 learning activities, a sound dissemination strategy and a solid evaluation plan, and impacting directly around 330 target groups representatives. \r\nThe partnership will work cooperatively to develop a model of intervention, test it and evaluate its impact. The intervention will combine innovative elements designed to address key local needs in target countries, with an evidence review of EU and national literature and existing good practices identified in partner countries. A particular focus will be on identifying ways of enhancing the \u201csocial capital\u201d of young people most likely to become long-term NEET or unemployed by working with relevant network community stakeholders in PT, ES and IT. \r\nThe project expects to achieve an impact at micro level (young people in a NEET situation); at a meso level (professionals working for and with young people in a NEET situation); and a macro level (the ecosystem of organisations that are part of the NEET issue, at local/regional and national level).

In addition standard \u201eone-size-fits-all\u201d solutions have proven to be ineffective. The project focusses on developing and building on existing interventions which identify potential NEETs EARLY ON, by identifying typical risk patterns, addressing the INDIVIDUAL needs of such learners and exposing them to suitable work-based environments, and to elaborate with them TAILORED and FLEXIBLE pathways to further education, training or work.  \r\n\r\nResults: 5 intellectual outputs (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5), multiplier events (focus groups, networking activities, national seminars, EU conference), transnational meetings. The length of the project will allow the research team to measure the results of the screening and intervention pilots. It\u2019s innovative and sustainable as it will provide unique policy solutions to address systemic problems. \r\n\r\nImpacts: it\u2019s expected to benefit young people (15-24) through pilots and mentoring and coaching sessions; others not involved directly in the testing will also be reached through dissemination; the intellectual outputs will be available and able to be used/applied. To be a success, enterprises and social partners must also be involved; with a stronger approximation between VET system and the world of work, helping/supporting the curriculum design, providing opportunities for students to get in contact with the job requirements. Local or regional authorities with VET and employment responsibilities are also expected to experience impact. They are as much interested to act preventively as youth unemployment is scaling, calling for urgent measures at political level to promote youth employment and preventing the disengagement of young people from society. They are expected to be involved in multipliers events, pilot testing (coaching/mentoring), and access to the IO and results through group reflections, holistic approaches and local solutions, large scale dissemination (Part G2).\r\n\r\nA strong Strategic Partnership, the IO, the Network of Stakeholders and learning activities are expected to bring high level of potential longer benefit. Despite the recent changes and the economic interventions, there are still challenges to solve at EU and national level, and authorities continue to need to engage in measures to solve unemployment, in particular among the young population.", "http://www.tavinstitute.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PT01-KA200-000980_1"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RELATIONS LBG*", 187535.0, "Fostering inclusive, innovative and reflective European societies (08.02.03.06)", "fts_2017_10546"], [2017, "TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RELATIONS LBG*", 4015.0, "Other management expenditure (26.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_37871"]]}}, "4XW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Linguacuisine", "Workers' Educational Association", 262928.0, 3, 5, "The Linguacuisine project addresses the future of equality of access and participation in learning linked to two core skills gaps recognised by today\u2019s changing Europe: digital skills and language skills. The project will promote learning of digital literacy, languages, cuisines and cultures. It will do this by co-design of downloadable apps and social recipes by means of an authoring tool to develop an online community of practice. We aim for mass adoption of these learning materials with a focus on social inclusion.Whereas our previous very successful LLP-funded \u2018Lancook\u2019 project www.europeandigitalkitchen.com  produced sensorised digital kitchen equipment, we will create for the new project free downloadable smartphone and tablet apps (android and Apple) using an iterative development methodology. These will enable users to be guided through cooking a range of recipes in 6 different European languages. The phone or tablet will speak to the users in the foreign language and offer multimedia help to users in terms of photos and videos. Users will be able to access different levels of help to support their language learning depending on their levels of competence. As no sensors are involved, users will let the phone or tablet know when they are ready to move to the next step. The main aim is to create a sustainable model for the production and use of multimedia materials for learning languages, cuisines and cultures based on user-generated content in support of a community of practice in those areas. We will take 40 digitally marginalized project participants with little or no digital experience. These will include migrant and refugees. We firstly provide them with digital, transferable and language skills. We will co-design the app and authoring tool with them, thus ensuring that the apps will be usable by most social groups in the EU. Then we enable them to use the authoring tool to author a multimedia social recipe for language learning. \u2018Authoring\u2019 here means a) writing an existing cooking recipe onto the system in short, simple stages using the authoring tool b) creating audio files for spoken instructions c) creating photos and videos together with subtitles as help facilities. The \u2018authoring tool\u2019 is a software system that allows both technical and non-technical people to programme content for use in the app. We will disseminate the social recipes through the development of online communities of practice in 6 EU languages which bring people together in sharing and cooking the recipes. Dissemination activities will ensure that people across the EU will share and author social recipes themselves.Objectives are: To produce a downloadable  tablet and smartphone app (android and iphone) which will enable users to be guided through cooking a recipe in 6 official EU languages. Further languages can easily be added using the authoring tool. To create an online community of practice with access via the apps.Participants will learn aspects of a foreign languages, cuisines and cultures by using the apps.To develop a certification system for the digital competence which participants develop. The needs addressed are: improving basic skills, specifically digital competence, and engaging digitally marginalized groups (including refugees and migrants) with technology; certifying and assessing levels of digital competence; learning foreign languages, cultures and cuisines;The rationale for this project is that it creates a motivating way of learning digital skills together with foreign languages, cultures and cuisines, making engaging technology available and accessible to a very wide audience. We develop an inclusive approach to technology design by including users with low levels of digital competence in the design process. The project promotes active EU citizenship and promotes mobility within the EU by familiarizing people with other countries and cultures, engaging with the \u2018Languages for social inclusion\u2019 agenda. It promotes integration of migrants and refugees into the host culture. It combines internationalisation of education with digital learning. Anyone anywhere who downloads the app software will be able to write any recipe in any language and submit it for potential inclusion in the range of recipes available to play with the app. They will also be able to gain access to the online community created by the project, which will provide feedback on contributions and exchange of ideas.

This will enable 16 trainers from la Ligue\u2019s network to discover, observe and adapt participatory methods used by the partners of the project. Dematerialized training, including Open Badges, of volunteers and facilitation techniques of Study Circles will be the main focus.At the end of this project, la Ligue de l\u2019enseignement wishes that the trainers involved adapt and experiment these new participatory pedagogical methods on their territory.
