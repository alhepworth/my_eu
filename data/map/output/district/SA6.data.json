These six schools clicked instantly when they realized they are all currently engaged with delivering lessons in a creative and experiential way employing, for example, both traditional PLAYMOBIL toys or modern devices such as the iPad. Consequently this common feature led them to embark together on this project about cooperation and innovation for good practices. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the project is sharing, testing and compiling cross-curricular good practices both during transnational project meetings and online. The resultant compilation will turn into THE EUROPEAN TEACHER'S TOOLKIT, a Blog packed with didactic resources and practical classroom strategies that will enable teachers to meet the needs of different learning styles, stimulate their own creativity, add a spice to their teaching and challenge the gifted and the disruptive students. \r\n\r\nThe project also includes the creation of a PLAYMO LEARNING CENTER at each participant school. This is a classroom furnished with PLAYMOBIL, LEGO and SCHLEICH toys carefully selected for their significance as a tool to support the acquisition of foreign languages and other curriculum contents. \r\n\r\nThe icing on the cake is a Science Fair and a Children's Literature Fair which will be held every school year to promote inquiry-based learning and the use of authentic materials among teachers and students. \r\n\r\nIn short, the motto of the project is that we teachers should be as concerned with HOW we teach as we traditionally have been concerned with WHAT we teach.", "http://www.ynystawe.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-003378_5"], [2015, "Teachers Learning and Teaching Through Play (profesores aprendiendo y ense\u00f1ando a trav\u00e9s del juego).", "Ynystawe Primary School", 6177.0, 3, 3, "How can teachers deepen their understanding of the importance of play? How can they develop the ability to skillfully and intentionally guide children\u2019s learning through play? When teachers engage in creative, open-ended play experiences, they learn firsthand the power of play. They also become more knowledgeable about the purposeful use of materials and intentional teaching strategies they can use to help children engage in open-ended play.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why the project TEACHERS LEARNING AND TEACHING THROUGH PLAY will offer our teachers workshop or job shadowing experiences employing chess and LEGO EDUCATION sets as didactic resources which will help them understand and promote play-based learning as part of developmentally appropriate practice in primary education. \r\n\r\nThe participants are Primary teachers with a B2 and C1 certification in English language. The planned activities are job shadowing in Ynystawe Primary School (UK), training courses on educative innovation and bilingual education in the UK, training courses on the use of LEGO EDUCATION didactic resources in London by SATRO Foundation, job shadowing in a Polish school which has traditionally taught chess in Primary education.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the previous training activities and job shadowing experiences, the participants will improve their personal and professional competences. At the end of the day, and this is what actually matters, our students will be the final beneficiaries since they will be taught by teachers who learned through play. Now more than ever, children need help connecting deeply to learning through play.", "http://www.ynystawe.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-014052_2"]]}}, "6NL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1214870400000, 1341014400000, "ChIP and MIRA for clinical diagnosis", "Swansea Nhs Trust", "DIA-ChIP seeks to develop state-of-the-art molecular techniques for the routine high-throughput analysis of clinical samples for advanced molecular diagnosis and biomedical research. This will be achieved through a collaborative partnership between academic, SME and public health partners interacting through the IAPP, and the secondments and recruitments it supports. New molecular diagnostics in clinical pathology need to be robust, cost effective and offer significant advantages over existing techniques. With the move towards personalised medicine the specificity of diagnosis will need to be enhanced significantly, yet in the short to medium term will need to be compatible with current gold standards of analysis. In this project the focus will be on the most important cancer affecting the female European population \u2013 Breast Cancer. The ability to analyse archived clinical material is currently limited to immuno-histochemistry and quantification the native biomolecules (DNA, RNA, protein). The advent of functional characterisation of these molecules i.e. DNA-protein interactions and DNA status will provide information to enhance diagnostic histopathology. Application to archival material will provide access to a hugely valuable resource and will contribute significantly to scientific understanding of disease processes by allowing the examination of large patient cohorts, and by facilitating direct comparison to model systems. Also by examining patient samples in concert with model human cell culture systems, alternatives to animal model systems will be developed.  DIA-ChIP features the creation of a strategic partnership between 4 groups that is critical in realising the project. The partners will develop strong long-term collaborative links for future research projects and intellectual exchange that will serve to strengthen each of the partners positions. The ultimate aim is to ensure long-term co-operation between all sectors -Business, Academic, Public Health", 16751.0, 629334.0, 2, 5, "DIA-CHIP", null, "http://www.swansea-tr.wales.nhs.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153890.jpg", "fp7_88296_999952340"]]}}}}
