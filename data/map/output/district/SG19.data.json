ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.

The project will also provide documented evidence to show the importance of connection with nature for health well-being and education, which can be used by international project partners to support implementation in their own and other European countries. The project aims to achieve these objectives by enhancing transnational cooperation between education and training providers and other stakeholders. By working together we can share best practice and learn from each other, neither education nor the environment can be contained within national borders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will work to address the EU 2020 objectives of reducing the rates of early school leaving to below 10% (in 2013 Malta's rate was 20.9%). It will do this by providing learning opportunities for all young people including academics, low achievers, those with behavioural or learning difficulties, and those who would rather learn through vocational studies. The current school structure does not suit all young people and alternatives need to be provided to allow the continuation of learning in alternative settings. Through this same process this project will also work to address the EU 2020 objective of 40% of 30-34 year olds completing third level education (in 2013 Malta's rate was 26.0%). If young people are suitably engaged they will wish to continue their studies to remain involved in the programme. The pathways of lifelong learning will also be supported by developing links between formal, non-formal and informal learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project also aims to provide a model for designing education policy in relation to science, learning through the natural sciences. It will seek to address the imbalance in Malta in the national education curriculum in science education, particularly at primary and secondary level, and establish pathways for the achievement of a better connection to the growing importance of the environment in European priorities, lifestyles, and concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYear one of the project will be based on research, developing innovative ideas, producing relevant resources and working with the Education Ministry to ensure curriculum links and qualifications are in place. Each international project partner will prepare baseline data on the current level of involvement in their environmental education programme and research into the areas where new ideas could be developed. The expert group will then meet to develop a programme plan involving the innovative ideas to be trailed for each partner. Small scale piloting of these ideas will take places in the first year. In this initial stage this project will engage with all primary and kinder schools in Malta, and initially 10% of Secondary Schools. This will gradually increase to 50% Secondary Schools and tertiary level involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYear two of the project will see full implementation of the programme plan in Malta with partner organisations from RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland and OTOP visiting to observe and review progress. Following the report from the first year of full implementation the relevant programme ideas will then be developed and expanded to be implemented in both Ireland and Poland. Full implementation will also continue in Malta in the third year with any necessary amendments or additions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected result of this project is to engage with at least 80% of young people aged 5-21 in Malta, and to test implementation of the same resources and ideas in Poland and Ireland. This programme will be evidenced by the changes in policy and curriculum, and by the action guides developed. The outline of this programme will be relevant and transferable to other European countries and can be broken down in to sections for gradual implementation. Good practice guides and case studies will be available for dissemination. This project will develop environmental qualifications which are recognised within the education system and in other European countries. This project will provide documented evidence to show the importance of connection with nature for health, well-being and education.

With growing obesity and lack of exercise in young people in our countries and living in a throw away society which consumes many of our natural resources, there is a need to address these with young children.  Our project  is about being fair to each other and taking care of our environment.  We would like the children to be aware of the responsibility for themselves, community and environment and encourage them to think critically, whilst maintaining fairness.  Our overall aim is that the knowledge and motivation gained in the Project will change the habits of the pupils and they will have a positive influence on their parents in having a healthier lifestyle for a more sustainable future. During the project we will make different products, do activities like singing, dancing and playing games with fairness always in mind.  In this way we want to show the importance of our topics and how it concerns everyone. Children will learn to appreciate the outdoor environment, manage risks and learn skills of resilience, perseverance, communication and teamwork.  Share ideas between schools of how we use the outdoors and compare and contrast the flora and fauna, resources of the different countries.We also will work on the ecological footprint of every child, family , school...   At the end of the project we will have an exhibition about our results.  We will send fair bears as reporters to every school to find out the habits in each country, concerning lifestyle, fairness and environmental issues. To evaluate the progress we will carry out a survey at the beginning and at the end of the project.", "http://www.gamlingayfirst.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA219-016671_4"]]}}}}
