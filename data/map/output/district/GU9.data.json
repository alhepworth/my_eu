We believe that by sharing our learning and other European best practice widely, and by sharing detailed professional development toolkits and information, we can have a profound impact on European cultural institutions and their engagement with disabled people.Partners: Onassis Cultural Centre (ARIONA HELLAS SA) \u2013 GreeceStopGap Dance Company \u2013 UKHolland Dance Festival \u2013 NetherlandsSkanes Dansteater \u2013 Sweden", "http://stopgapdance.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-EL01-KA204-023548_2"]]}}, "7QU": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 98835.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_3843"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 40439.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_6138"], [2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 40242.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_10361"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 14240.0, "Support expenditure for the programme Employment and Social Innovation (04.01.04.02)", "fts_2017_50840"], [2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 9604.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_29044"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 8798.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_29345"], [2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 8500.0, "Better climate governance and information at all levels (34.02.03)", "fts_2016_56853"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 6973.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_14147"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 1374.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_52158"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 885.0, "Other management expenditure (02.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_47560"], [2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 857.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_37236"], [2016, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 699.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_53706"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 577.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_35773"], [2016, "PALLADIAN PUBLICATIONS LIMITED", 407.0, "Better climate governance and information at all levels (34.02.03)", "fts_2016_67751"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 290.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_43356"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 229.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_27643"], [2017, "PALLADIAN PUBLICATIONS LIMITED", 174.0, "Better climate governance and information at all levels (34.02.03)", "fts_2017_64570"], [2017, "STB LIMITED*SURREY TRANSLATION BUREAU", 92.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_55318"]]}}, "9HF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Fostering critical thinking, responsibility and participation at School: a Challenge for Teacher and Pupils as well", "All Hallows Catholic School", 37446.0, 3, 3, "Fostering critical thinking, responsibility and participation at School:  a challenge for teacher and pupils as well.\r\n\r\nContext and Objectives\r\n\r\nThe Collegio Celestino Endrici is a private school which is officially recognised by The Italian State. The school is on two sites: the central administration being at Trento and the other at Rovereto.  The total number of students, (primary, middle-school and secondary) at Trento and Rovereto is 1301. The teaching Staff at Trento are 102 whereas at Rovereto there are 64. The site at Rovereto has a two form entry in the primary school,a three form entry in the middle school and a one form entry at the grammar school. Rovereto  is the leader in this project. In the course of its history it has always paid particular attention to innovation and experimentation. For instance, having introduced the fourth year abroad in England for the whole grammar school class; for having extended the use of English outside the classroom and through Clil; for having started experimental courses (philosophical practices) at school right from the beginning of the primary school.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n\r\nTo support and develop an inclusive, participating and interactive teaching system through Clil and philosophical practices;\r\n\r\nTo enhance the international vocation of the school in an European framework\r\n\r\nTo continue building a learning environment for teaching staff through exchange of good practices and mutual collaboration between the three school levels.\r\n\r\n \r\nNumber and profiles of participants\r\n\r\nThe number of participants involved in this call are 11, of which three are from elementary, two from the middle school and the remaining six from the secondary school. Three are from Trento and the others from Rovereto. The teachers come from both humanistic and scientific fields. To be selected they have had to satisfy at least two of the following criteria:\r\n\r\nThey have already been engaged in courses relevant for this call: language courses; Clil; active teaching courses; exchange projects at an international level;\r\n\r\nThey have innovated their own teaching methods through experimental project or they have expressed the wish to work in such a way;\r\n\r\nThey have had an international experience, either through studying, living or collaborating in projects abroad;\r\n\r\nThey already hold the linguistic skills necessary to participate to this call, apart from those who hold a B1 and would like to follow language courses.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nActivities and methodology\r\n\r\nTo answer the needs identified by the school (A,B,C,D,E) the following activities will be proposed (a,b,c,d,e), prepared, activated, monitored and evaluated by the Head with the project staff.\r\n\r\nFor A) to support linguistic competence\u2026 a) language courses to obtain officials certification\r\n\r\nFor B) to intensify Clil methodology, at the various school levels\u2026b) Clil courses to deepen this particular methodology;\r\n\r\nFor C) to allow the teaching staff to experiment \u201cteaching methodologies\u201d in the spirit of collaboration between students, teachers, students and teachers, not only through languages (Linguistic Teaching) but through all subjects (i.e. Science Lab), with particular attention to philosophizing with others: c) P4C (Philosophy for Children); Socratic Dialogue\u2026\r\n\r\nFor D) and E) to back up integration and organization between teachers to build transversal curricular courses at different school levels\u2026: d) e) Job Shadowing\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResults, impact and potential longer term benefits\r\n\r\nWe expect the group of teachers involved in mobility to become a \u201cgroup of leading teachers\u201d. This group will have to be  able with enthusiasm and a critical eye, to transmit what they have learnt and integrate this with the experience of their colleagues by building a sort of community of enquiry with them.  Moreover they will be engaged in a common process of motivation, integrating and  enhancing one another towards a common goal: to foster critical thinking, participation and responsibility in the school.\u2026  This ought to result in better collaboration by building an open learning environment, with a direct impact on organization and teaching. As a long term benefit we expect to achieve those competences which will allow us to participate in further international projects, (for instance KA2\u2026), to intensify collaboration with our international partners, to be  more integrated in a web of schools and local institutions active in the goals of this project,  being also engaged in \u201cProgetto trilinguismo\u201d of Trento.", "http://www.allhallows.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA101-014383_2"]]}}, "9QL": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXX", "Farnham Hospital", "nhs_RXX29"]]}}, "9QT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1448928000000, 1543536000000, "Piezoelectronic Transduction Memory Device", "Electrosciences Ltd", "Computer clock speeds have not increased since 2003, creating a challenge to invent a successor to CMOS technology able to resume performance improvement.
