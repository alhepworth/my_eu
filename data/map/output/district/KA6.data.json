The CyClaDes project plan accepts this challenge by introducing a user-centered perspective for key stakeholders (i.e., designers, operators, authorities, end-users), through a framework that captures, \u201ctranslates\u201d, and disseminates usable tools, methods, and information to provide maximum support for the human element across all stages of design and operation.  The outcome of the project will help to increase the safety for ship, crew, cargo and consequently the environment by:\n1. Increasing researchers\u2019 understanding of stakeholders, including when human element input can best be applied, in what format, and what the barriers are.\n2. Assembling existing applicable knowledge (i.e., guidelines, tools and methodologies) from maritime and other domains into an easy to use format for the end user.\n3. Developing and applying selected methodologies in order to demonstrate their use and impact in the shipping context.", 65520.0, 3373588.0, 8, 14, "CYCLADES", "http://www.cyclades-project.eu/CyClaDes/", "http://www.processforusability.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157268.jpg", "fp7_105721_953405047"]]}}}}
