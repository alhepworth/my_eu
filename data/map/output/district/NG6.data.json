The urban renovation strategy will be focused on the citizens, because they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality and will not only be the most affected by the improvements but also they will be the common factor of each of them.\n\nHOW THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED \n1. Developing a sustainable urban regeneration model, considering a holistic approach, which supports the decision making of the main stakeholders for addressing wide renovation and city transformation processes.\n2. Validating the urban regeneration model by means of large scale interventions on several cities called lighthouse cities, Valladolid, Nottingham and Tepebasi/Eskisehir (more than 1.000 dwellings retrofitted, more than 190 EV deployed and a total investment higher than 14 M\u20ac).\n3. Guaranteeing the replicability of the model at European level. Two cities will be also involved in the consortium, called follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) and will be developed a procedure for assessing the replicability potential of the model.\n4. It is planned an intense activity focused on generating exploitation and market deployment strategies to support the commercial exploitation of the project outcomes.\n5. It will be deployed a powerful communication and dissemination plan. This plan will integrate a citizen engagement strategy and will disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences (more than 11.000 citizens engaged).", 143339.0, 19781880.0, 7, 22, "REMOURBAN", null, null, null, "h2020_194449_941910935"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "STEM meets MINT", "SASIE Ltd", 148185.0, 2, 2, "THE ISSUE OUR PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSTEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - are essential to keep pace in the technological race that fuels the global economy today.

OBJECTIVESThis mobility project seeks to immerse young people in the very specific STEM based industrial sector of renewable energy technology. After the programme, the participants will have a good understanding of renewable energy technologies. Our partner, Christiani, as both a manufacturer of renewable energy equipment and a VET provider in Germany, has arranged an itinerary to train participants through practical workshops and project based activity over two weeks. Our objectives are :1) to raise aspirations and fuel motivation of participants to seek a STEM based career by illustrating the exciting, varied and challenging nature of the work to be found in this industry2) participants will be qualified to assist in the undertaking of an Energy Audit in a commercial and domestic property so that they are able to make sound and reasonable recommendations to the owners on improving energy efficiency.Through our dissemination plan we will promote the mobility; those that travel will be used as advocates amongst their peers, teaching staff and governors of their schools to increase interest in STEM. This will be used as a template as the sort of initiative that should be used to address the major issue highlighted earlier.PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThere will be 100 young people from disadvantaged backgrounds aged 16-18 selected from Colleges and Academy schools in the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire area to participate in this project.  Gender will be mixed and we are hoping for a 70/30 split as minimum. Disadvanted groups will be targeted and we are hoping to actively promote ethnic minority students into the programme as this group is severely under represented in the renewable energy industry.ACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGYThe project activities involve experiencing innovative and sophisticated deployments of renewable energy so that learners can understand the significance and possibilities of the technologies. Learners will see renewable technologies up close and will complete tests and experiments to further their knowledge in renewables. Learning will be through vocational methods with as much teaching being 'hands on' as possible.RESULTS AND IMPACTIt is hoped that following this programme, the vast majority of the learners will be encouraged into STEM based apprenticeships, university courses or employment. SASIE, as one of Nottingham's market leaders in renewables, will also encourage students into internships or work experience in the industry and may be able to assist with placements. Learners will gain a recognised qualification as well as the softer 'employability' skills which are mandatory for a successful career.LONG TERM BENEFITSThe intention is that many of the students completing this programme will embark upon careers in the energy industry; specifically the renewable energy industry.
