Consequently, the current CRT population (1.9 billion screens; 500 million of them in Europe) is becoming obsolete and will require processing (not landfill) according to WEEE regulations, since the high proportion of lead in the glass means that landfills have an unacceptable risk of lead leaching into groundwater. The very low manufacturing rates for new CRT worldwide now mean that recycling the glass back into CRTs is no longer an option, and the only alternatives to avoid landfill have been to use the glass as a smelting flux (85% of it remains as a toxic slag), or using foundry temperatures (1000\u00b0C) melt extraction for the lead, which is extremely energy and CO2 costly, and at best produces an 80% co-stream of low value glass.\nOur idea is to process leaded CRT glass using a novel hydrochemistry method to precipitate out the lead, which can be sold.\nThe residual output stream from our VirtuCrete process contains an alumino-silicate mix that can be used as an alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), to produce a high-silica concrete geopolymer block. This new material has exceptional resistance to salt, acids and water, making it suitable harsh conditions and flood defences, and high temperature resistance (over 1200\u00b0C) making it applicable to fire risk applications such as road tunnels or waste storage segregation. The novel chemistry also allows use of recycled aggregate, potentially reducing the cost of our geoblocks by 50% compared to OPC blocks. The new technology could enable EU waste recyclers and concrete block producers to co-operate to solve the CRT problem and to increase competitiveness through new products, to gain market share and capitalise on new business opportunities.", 35835.0, 51194.0, 1, 1, "VirtuCrete", null, null, null, "h2020_197191_936072505"]]}}, "3QB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1264982400000, 1359590400000, "GEneric diagNosis InstrUment for SOFC Systems", "Ceramic Fuel Cells (Europe) Ltd", "'The state of health of any SOFC system is currently difficult to evaluate, which makes it difficult to respond to a fault or degradation with the appropriate counter measure, to ensure the required reliability level. Therefore, the GENIUS project aims to develop a \u201cGENERIC\u201d algorithm, based on a validated diagnostic \u201cGENERIC\u201d approach. This algorithm would only use process values (normal measurements and system control input parameters) and the approach would allow all SOFC developers to use and implement the algorithm in their respective systems according to their specific constraints.\nTo guarantee the \u201cGENERIC\u201d character of the algoithm, stacks and systems from four different manufacturers will be tested using commonly defined test plan that will be based on the \u201cDesign Of Experiment\u201d method. Three different types of models will be evaluated in parallel by four different academic institutions in order to define the optimal tool for fault detection and degradation identification. This will be done taking into account both \u201con board\u201d diagnostic and 'off-line' diagnostic requirements. The diagnosis would generate a set of indicators able to quantify either the drift or the difference of the actual status with respect to nominal or expected performance. A diagnostic hardware integrating the best algorithm will be developed and validated in two different SOFC systems. Finally, physical parameters and interactions will be correlated with degradation mechanisms. This correlation will allow the definition of either counter measures (in case of fault or degradation) or of a more optimal operation point. This will make it possible to reduce maintenance to yearly intervals. It may also help reach a target of tens of thousands hours for stack or system operation lifetime.

Slag contains impurities and forms a protective crust of non-metallic & metallic oxides, and contains significant \u2018free\u2019 & alloyed metal (from 10 to 70% by weight). While slag can be used as aggregate, there are increasing concerns over \u2018leaching\u2019 of heavy metals into water courses from using these materials in civil engineering. While some metal can be recovered by re-melting slag (at very high temp), this is extremely expensive with very high energy burden which often makes recovery un-economic, but necessary. Landfill of slag is increasingly not an option. Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called \u2018implosion\u2019 to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles. This will be combined with ultrasonic vibration sieving for accelerated recovery of metal from the finest fraction. This novel technology was originally developed to recycle waste glass by reducing it to fine \u2018sand\u2019, with uniform size and no \u2018sharps\u2019 compared to normal crushing techniques.
