These partners have cooperated previously in the exchange of staff and students. The partners would now like to lift their cooperation to a higher and more sustainable level.\r\n\r\nThe animal husbandry sector needs only te best students that graduate from vocational colleges to fill the job openings at the labor market. The partnerschools therefore aim to prepare their students extra well for their future jobs in the sector.\r\n\r\nThey will prepare students by offering them modules that are built around new innovative subjects in the field of animal husbandry. The modules will be offered in an international learning environment, enriching students with both subject specific knowledge as well as a meaningfull international experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of your project & description of activities:\r\n\r\n1. Agree on the content and the level of at least 8 educational modules in the field of animal husbandry to be developed within the partnership, using input from companies from the sector related to the partnerschools;\r\n\r\n2. Agree on the learning outcomes in these modules (8 clusters of learning outcomes);\r\n\r\n3. Create at least 8 educational modules in animal husbandry (of roughly 60-120 guided learning hours each), consisting of a theoretical and a practical component. These modules all address topics in the field of animal husbandry. Each school decides on what topics they would like to develop an educational module. When making this decision the following factors are taken into consideration:\r\n\r\na. The expertise of the (staff members of) the school.\r\n\r\nb. The existing expertise and demand of the related partner companies (in animal husbandry) in the region of the school.\r\n\r\nc. The demand for skills that the partner companies have. Issues they deem important should be addressed within the partnership.\r\n\r\nd. Attractiveness of the content of the modules for the students from the partner institutions.\r\n\r\n4. Working out uniform ways to assess the learning outcomes in each unit in such a way that both knowledge and skills are assessed;\r\n\r\n5.

The meetings will consist of a number of working sessions in which the partners work on intellectual outputs (module-descriptions, educational modules and exams). Not only do they work on the outputs, but they also exchange best practices by visiting each other classess, exams and practical students training. Before each meeting, the coordinator assigns a number of 'homework tasks' to the partners. All partners will participate in all 5 international meetings. Besides the partnerschools, during the meetings there are also opportunities to visit related companies that will be used for the practical components of the educational modules. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the results and impact envisaged and finally the potential longer term benefits:\r\n\r\n-Development of 8 innovative, international modules in the field of agriculture;\r\n\r\n-Agreements about the exchange of students, so that they can study these modules;\r\n\r\n-Recognition and validation of the learning outcomes obtained by the students between the partners (ECVET practices).\r\n\r\nThese are the results envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the colleges involved to start up international learning activities: offering international education to international groups of students.

In the past we have sent around 20 students a year on a two week traineeship with a farmer, and around 10 students attended a practical course in one of our agricultural partnerschools within the Agri-ECVET project.\r\n\r\nWith this application we fuse both projects and we apply for the schoolyear 2017-2018 for 53 students. The strategy is still to send students on practical courses and working placements on agricultural companies, but this time we also want to give the students of the other directions in our school (horticulture, animal care and biotechnics) the opportunity to have an international experience. The project name \u201cWings\u201d has a connection with most of these directions and refers to exploring. The students we want to send out will mainly come from the following directions: +/- 30 students from 6TSO/7BSO agriculture, 12 students from 6TSO/7BSO animal care, 8 students from 6TSO/7BSO horticulture and 3 students from 6TSO Biotechnics. The majority will still come from the direction agriculture, of which all last year students will be sent out. For animal care, horticulture and biotechnics there will be a selection based on motivation, attitude, level of English,\u2026 . We will also take into account the social background of the students in order to give chances to the socially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFlow A1: 30 students will attend a traineeship in France or the Netherlands. These are students of agriculture and horticulture. These students will be placed on an agricultural or horticultural company in France or the Netherlands. The countries are very different concerning language and culture, but also in terms of agriculture and horticulture. The student can choose the type of company: a pig farm, a dairy farm, an arable farm, a greenhouse company, a gardener, \u2026 We find it important to place our students in companies with a warm family-like atmosphere. Most of the time the students can stay with a hosting family and in this way they experience other customs and other cultures. The weekend is the perfect time for cultural excursions with the hosting family. We go to different countries because every country has its own agricultural and horticultural specialities. The Netherlands are famous for their pig farms and greenhouses, Normandy is famous for cattle and arable farms. The just before the actual traineeship is used to introduce the region to the students. There is a weekend program with cultural and agricultural or horticultural visits organised and accompanied by two teachers. Sunday evening all students are at their working placements and the actual traineeship can begin. In these two weeks the students are also visited by two teachers and in the end of the traineeship the teacher picks them up again, after evaluating the traineeship with the farmer.\r\n\r\nFlow A2: 25 students will attend a traineeship of 3 to 4 weeks on an agricultural school in Wales, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Austria. Already two years we are involved with Vabi in a network of 5 agricultural schools (KA2-project Agri-ECVET), and now we will join a parallel animal care schools network, that exists for 2 years under the name Ahene (the Ahene-project is a highly regarded KA2-project in the Netherlands, https://vimeo.com/161062967). By linking both networks, we are in a network of 9 European schools each organizing 1 or 2 practical courses. Vabi organizes one course already in this network and will organize an extra course in the future. At the\r\n\r\nmoment there are around 12 innovative courses, especially around animal care and agricultural subjects. The courses are practically orientated with a lot of visits, working placements, \u2026 Some topics students can choose are: the lambing season in Wales, sledgedogs in Sweden, First Aid for small pets in the Netherlands, high yielding dairy cows, agro-marketing, \u2026 In each course there are around 10 students from different countries and this makes it especially interesting for young people to learn from each other\u2019s cultures.\r\n\r\nWe are growing in our international story, not only in quantity, but also in quality thanks to partners we have known for years, but also thanks to the new partners we are looking forward to work with.

CollegesWales has  offered a reciprocal visit to Wales for Helsinki Vocational College staff in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities that will take place\r\n\r\nThe visit will last 5 days - 2 days travel and 3 days training - an outline of the proposed training programme is in Section G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\n\r\nParticipants will return to their partner organisations & report on the visit to the senior management team at the college - there may   be ideas that could be immediately put in practice and ideas that need to be considered in more detail or piloted before putting in to action but the main reason for implementing or piloting these ideas is that they will lead to an improvement in teaching and learning within that organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollegesWales' Teaching & Learning network will provide a national forum for discussing the training that took place in Finland and deciding on what aspects could be progressed within the network.  In addition, with the involvement of Welsh Government and Estyn representatives who are also members of the IQG, the longer term picture may see changes implemented at policy level to improve teaching & learning.", "http://www.nptcgroup.ac.uk", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000496_4"]]}}, "7TY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Erfahrungen mit \"Gentle Teaching\".

Social compentences of teachers as well as of pupils will be improved. \"Gentle teaching\" was developed by John McGee in the 1980ies. It is a method for pupils who have difficulties in behaviour. McGee travelled around the world to inspire people to use gentle teaching in their work as parents, nursing staff, teacher, manager, psychologists, etc. Gentle teaching builds a community, which is living its values daily. In excess of the teachings, the method should be lived within the pupil community, it is called \"gentle experience\"then. \r\n\r\nIn line with the school developement to higher quality, the involved schools will work on good education for difficult pupils. Schools and parents work together with this respectfull and mindfull method of gentle teaching and gentle experience (respectfull acquaintance). Employee and pupil compentences have to be trained. \r\nPupils will get used to the new concept and will learn to treat each other with more respect and politeness. With this they will gain more compentences which can be used in their later work life. They will train the ability to work in a team. Through the european dimension of our former \"keyaction1\" project we experienced that these important and new impulses from this projects will take fruit in the participating schools. \r\nIn an announcement in etwinning these 4 schools were found. They seem very suitable to improve their school developement and education quality with this project. From a big pool of interested schools these schools were selected, because they have experience in this field, which will be a valued input for the results of the project. From this common project new teaching and learning methods will be indrudoced (e.g. Learning-counters, digital learning). \r\nThe project is very sustainable as the training includes video recording. By buidling up a messenger employment of all project participants, the project content will be enhanced even over the projects extend.  The messenger employment of the pupils include near and regional schools. Teacher, with a messenger task, will make the project known in and out of regional areas. It is planned, that at least two schools will be acompanied scientifically. By this acompanion a broader publicity will be reached through scientific publishing. As members of the principal teams of all schools are taking part it can be assumed that over-regional publicity will be possible. All five schools agreed to care for distribution and organisation themselves in their country. \r\nWith these new competences, methods are gained to give new learning options to difficult pupils. They will be collected in an national and international database and can be accessed publicly. \r\nThe pupils are very versatile. Diversity needs variety - this is our motto, which we want to fullfill.", "http://www.npted.org/schools/primary/ysgolmaesycoed/Pages/default.aspx", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035460_4"]]}}}}
