Using a multi disciplinary approach, the exchanged staff will work on three main research areas.\nThe first one is focused on trade and investment flows and aims at identifying critical issues, gaps, and potentials in Europe-China relationships. Major effects of Europe-China agreements on foreign direct investments (FDI) and trade flows are examined. Problems encountered and opportunities to be seized at firm level will also be analyzed. The economic perspective is supported and enriched by the engineering and legal perspectives. Engineering knowledge is fundamental to defining concretely the sectors, products and processes which have high deployment potential. Engineering research activity is focused on two main research areas, both related with energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction: mobility and the transportation sector and low carbon buildings. The legal knowledge is relevant to understanding obstacles due to the regulatory environment, as well as to identifying appropriate solutions to enhance collaboration. Main investigation areas will be: offshore oil and gas and renewable energy; anti-dumping; environmental and social standards and corporate social responsibility.\nPOREEN aims at increasing the availability of interdisciplinary studies, with a comprehensive overview of Europe-China relations.

The long-range forecasts for investments and energy market are determined by highly interconnected environmental, geological and technological research despite scientific differences in modelling the scenarios and interpreting the data. The medium-range forecasts for investments and energy market largely depend on geopolitical considerations and internal pressure by public opinion and stakeholders. States, firms and other actors play their game within the current legal framework at the international, regional and national level. Accordingly, the proper policy design for the sustainable energy needs to be complemented by research on the legal, regulatory and geopolitical side.\nHowever, the characteristics of social sciences which drive their approach to such issues are determined by their fragmentation into sectoral domains and national traditions. It is commonly agreed that there are great benefits in overcoming the disciplinary divisions combining  scientific, social and economic considerations in order to assess the policy impact of sustainable energy.\nThe evaluation of the policies for sustainable energy investments requires to connect several national approaches on such topics, not only in Europe, where the fragmentation of social sciences into national traditions is a matter of fact.

The project intends to support migrant women, adult and language educators, health practitioners, social workers and volunteers at European level by providing to them tools that have been produced with a European approach and dimension thanks to the project\u2019s transnational nature. Migration is a challenge that all European countries are facing not only as a result of the war in Syria, but also as a result of the economic crisis and the intraregional migration which is particularly dynamic in Europe. Researchers predict that the numbers of migrants will keep growing, especially because of climate changes. We are faced with a European challenge that needs European cooperation to address the growing needs of migrants. \r\nAccording to the Report \u201cPromoting the health of refugees and migrants\u201d (WHO, 2017) women, children including unaccompanied minors, and people with disabilities \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to health problems. These individuals are at higher risk of developing communicable and noncommunicable diseases, including mental health problems. Migration and displacement can also pose specific health threats, including sexual violence, especially against women and girls. This is particularly significant, since women and girls who are refugees or migrants often face diverse sexual and reproductive health challenges and are most vulnerable to preventable mortality and morbidity arising from lack of sexual and reproductive health services.\r\nIn the Annex of the above mentioned report, among the proposed priorities for the promotion of the health of refugees and migrants is to \u201cProtect and improve the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents living in refugee and migrant settings. Priority should be given to the provision of essential health services such as: a minimum initial service package for reproductive health, sexual and reproductive health information and services; maternal health care including emergency obstetric services, pre- and postnatal care; prevention, treatment, care and support for sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and specialized care for survivors of sexual violence, as well as supporting for child health activities.\u201d \r\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that \u201ceveryone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices\u201d. However, legal status has proved to be one of the main formal barriers to migrants' access to healthcare services, and communication and cultural differences the main informal barriers. \r\nThe project \"Migrant Women as Healthcare Mentors\" will facilitate the access of migrant women and their children to the healthcare services of their host countries by developing innovative language learning tools related to healthcare issues. These tools will be available to adult language educators and to migrants for self-learning purposes. Moreover, a Multimedia Mentoring Guide will be created available to adult educators in order to train migrant women to act as healthcare mentors within their communities, providing useful information to their peers about the healthcare system of their host country, and promote a positive attitude towards preventive practices. \r\nIn addition, healthcare providers will have access to innovative tools for their communication with migrant women that will help them through the examination process (application with medical history questionnaire translated in 15 languages, mobile app with e-vocabulary and useful phrases). It is of most importance to have tools that healthcare providers can easily use in order to communicate with women migrant patients. Such tools can safeguard the confidentiality of information shared between the doctors and the patients as migrants often tend to use other relatives, friends, even their children as interpreters.  \r\nGeneral Objectives\r\nTo support the social inclusion and integration of migrant women\r\nTo raise awareness of the healthcare and educational needs of this disadvantaged group\r\nTo disseminate widely the idea of the project and its results at national and European level \r\nSpecific Objectives\r\nTo supply high quality learning opportunities tailored to the needs of migrant women via OER\r\nTo train migrant women to act as healthcare mentors within their communities\r\nTo facilitate the access of women migrants to the healthcare services of their host countries by providing specific information for the healthcare system in partners\u2019 countries\r\nTo support adult and language educators by extending and developing their competences through the effective use of ICT\r\nTo support healthcare providers in their work with migrant women\r\nTo organise National and European Conferences to spread the project's products and results", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-IS01-KA204-038799_4"], [2018, "Music for children\u2019s multicultural learning", "The Mosaic Art Sound Limited", 194029.0, 7, 7, "Twenty-first century children live in an increasingly interconnected, diverse and rapidly changing world.

As they will be expected to look after themselves, communicate in a foreign language and interact with different cultures these will develop their self-reliance, confidence, tolerance, maturity and overall independence. \r\n\r\nIn terms of vocational staff - through the interaction with different educational systems, European colleagues (students in the cases of teaching), ways and practices of teaching, different methodologies, industry standards, employer engagement, different legislation and regulations (and the effect they have on the specific industry and how they transcend into the teaching/training of learners) staff will be able to facilitate their continuous professional developement. Furthermore, the cultural aspect will impact their awareness and will play a role in developing a wider understanding in engaging with different cultures.", "http://www.havering-college.ac.uk", "HAVERING COLLEGE OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000207_coordinator"], [2015, "AIM SKILLS & KNOWLEDGE UP", "HAVERING COLLEGE OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION", 38573.0, 2, 2, "Education and training activities play a very important role in providing people with the necessary means to participate actively in the labour market and in society at large.
