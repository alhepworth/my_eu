Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody.

In the car industry it is has been shown that diesel nozzles produced with ultrafast lasers lead to significantly reduced air pollution in comparison to nozzles produced with conventional fabrication techniques. Spinning nozzles used widely in the textile industry are also produced using ultrafast lasers. The main goal of RAZipol is to demonstrate laser material processing at unprecedented levels of productivity (leading to drilling process times below 4 s of high aspect ratio [40:1] holes compared to current times of 25 s) and precision material processing (structure dimension below 1 \u00b5m) using beams with novel radial and azimuthal polarization. The challenge is not only to achieve high productivity at moderate levels of precision or highest quality at low speeds, but to reach both targets at the same time. Therefore an adequate ultrafast laser source with a very high average power and well-adapted beam parameters, including pulse duration, pulse energy, intensity profile, and polarization, is needed. Additionally, the laser beam has to be applied to the work-piece in a well-defined application-specific manner. Finally, advanced processing strategies are required to obtain optimum results at high productivity. The ultrafast laser source planned for RAZipol project combines several quite unique features. Its modular 3-stage master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) concept offers a high degree of flexibility to generate a broad range of pulse durations, pulse energies and repetition rates. The MOPA combines an ultrafast oscillator together with a Single Crystal Fiber as 1st amplification stage and a thin-disk multipass amplifier as final amplification stage. Although the potential range of material processing applications for this laser source is extremely broad, within the project, we will focus on two demonstration applications. The first application will be based on a fast scanner system which facilitates the production of complex structures like a 'lab on a chip' on large wafers (8' diameter). For this application, the MOPA system providing up to 500 W average power will be set up for repetition rates in the 20-40 MHz range with pulse duration of approximately 1 ps.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES a) enhance the attractiveness of VET in metrology, integrating features such as the use of modern content delivery tools (e.g. tablets, apps) and social networking;b) produce high quality learning content on innovative measuring technologies (including: Mobile CMMs, Laser tracking and Large Scale Metrology);c)  Upgrading of the learning content delivered by a previous EU project with 10 years of successful follow-up activities;d) facilitate the participation of companies to VET activities, in particular companies in aeronautic sector, allowing innovative way of doing PRACTICAL WORK on real equipment  in adequate infrastructure;e) develop a European system for the identification and recognition of skills and qualifications in relation to VET in Geometrical Quality Control as a contribution to the implementation of the ECVET in a relevant area of competence for the advanced manufacturing industry with special focus on aeronautic industry.PARTICIPANTSCATIM \u2013Centro de Apoio Tecnol\u00f3gico \u00e0 Ind\u00fastria Metalomec\u00e2nica, Portugal (Coordinator)Univ. of Padua, Dept. of Industrial Engineering, Italy CMTrain -Training for Coordinate Metrology e.V., GermanyUniv. of Huddersfield, Centre for Precision Technologies, UKUniv. of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland, Institute for Production Metrology, Materials and Optics, SwitzerlandRESULTSThe project will deliver the following concrete results: 1. new procedure for  Positioning  assessment of competence and definition of personalised learning paths2. new procedures and ICT tools for innovative content development and distribution;3. new Open Educational Resources (OER) on innovative measuring technologies, produced in Europe;4. enriched and updated outputs of a previous EU project with 10 years of successful follow-up activities;5. translation of revised existing content to additional European languages; 6. modern tutor-learners interaction, bridging the worlds of education and work;7. a European Qualification System for VET in Geometrical Quality Control and Large Scale Metrology.IMPACT1) Advanced manufacturing industry- reduction of quality issues due to lack of competence in metrology, especially at suppliers- improved new product development, based on better understanding of parts functionality - understanding metrology without having in-house measuring equipment- increased general acceptance of qualifications related to Geometrical Quality Control and Large Scale Metrology2) Suppliers of metrology equipment and services- faster introduction of innovative measuring systems and new services- better acceptance of new technology by customers3) VET and Higher Education institutions - new courses and training services on innovative measuring technology in Aeronautic industry- universities can offer the new content (advanced levels) to engineering students  AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL- contribute to increased the leading role of Europe in advanced manufacturing- global access to high quality new training materials in English, German, Italian and Portuguese that illustrate the benefits of innovative measuring technologies, mostly \u201cmade in Europe\u201d in Aeronautic related industryLONGER TERM BENEFITS- improved quality of life (e.g. less noise and vibrations due to better control of form)- more reliable products (e.g. understanding part functionality using advanced metrology)- more efficient products (e.g. improved efficiency thanks to complex shaped components)- environmental benefits (e.g. reduction of scrap during production and less prototype iterations)", "http://www.hud.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA202-022964_4"], [2014, "Children's Identities and Citizenship - Best Practice Guides", "THE UNIVERSITY OF HUDDERSFIELD", 242080.0, 17, 25, "This proposal has focus on European Integration promoting active citizenship in young people through guidance for the training of education professionals and young researchers. It links 25 institutions from 17 states that are involved in training education professionals and concerned with citizenship education (CE) and the development of identities in young people. We emphasise that our concern is not with legally defined notions of citizenship, rather with issues around belonging, status and active participation, and is in line with European and UN childhood and youth agendas that promote student voice and the right to education for all.Moreover, we recognise the need for quality education and training that envisages the European Community as an advanced knowledge-based society, with sustainable economic development and better social cohesion. More specifically our proposal is informed by EU policy (eg ET2020), research (eg Bruter2012) and guidance (EU,2004) that promotes active citizenship and the understanding that European identity and integration goes hand in hand with national, sub-national, and minority group identities. With respect to this the need for improved CE is highlighted by Eurodice (2012); ICCS (2009) and others.

From previous surveys it has been found that the majority of graduates who are leaving regional universities tend to migrate out of the regions to find attractive jobs closer to capital cities and in large companies. The reason is on both sides: students are not prepared and educated practically to be able to enter SME jobs and fulfill the specific needs of SMEs and SMEs are not sufficiently attractive and therefore in general cannot recruit and retain graduates. Furthermore, the regions already face or will face in the near future challenges with successfully integrating immigrants into local jobs.Therefore the SHARPEN project will focus on training HR teachers in the universities to prepare students to start their careers in SMEs and to be ready to meet the needs of SMEs. Furthermore, the project will prepare and educate SMEs about how to create appropriate conditions and to be attractive employers for young graduates, but also for people with other specific needs such as disabled people, elderly people or immigrants. HRM learning modules in English will be useful tools to deliver these objectives to students who will also visit SMEs and work in real practice. Various seminars, lectures and conferences will be prepared to disseminate findings for SMEs. International training and workshops for teachers will be held to share knowledge and best practices mainly on new HR methods and inclusion issues from regions where they already have this experience (Germany and the UK) to the other partners (CZ, FIN, LI) which will enrich current knowledge amongst the participating institutions.Intended objectives: graduates finding jobs more easily in the region where they studied the university, mainly in SMEs, that are the largest group of employers in these regions; HR teachers who are better equipped with knowledge and expertise based not only on HR theory but more on daily practice and needs of companies, particularly SMEs; programmes that combine the needs of SMEs with the expectations and competences of graduates, foreigners, elderly people. Understanding that regional employers have to be flexible and adaptable to fill open job positions successfully with local unemployed people.This project will include up to 15 HRM specialists and teachers working on the HR project courses. Five specialists will be dedicated to direct and continuous communications with SMEs in their respective regions, directly involving 75 students who are active in international mobility. There will further be approximately 500 students attending HRM courses during the project and approx. 50 SMEs in the regions who will collaborate with preparing case studies, and developing a knowledge-base and exemplary practices for the content of the handbook chapters. The eHandbook will be than delivered and available to hundreds of SMEs to guide them with effective HR policies and processes.The activities will include workshops facilitated by HR teachers, the creation of HR modules for students, research on current HRM trends in SMEs, seminars, lectures, conferences, social-media communications and other dissemination activities. Key knowledge production methods used will include questionnaire-based research conducted amongst SMEs, together with active collaboration with students and SMEs which will inform the research study, case writing and handbook chapters.Summary of intended project results and impact: First, the development and modernisation of the curricula on HRM and business administration courses related to SMEs within the collaborating universities will be key success factors. More relevant, up-to-date and highly practical HR course content, based on real needs and case studies conducted in SMEs will lead to better educated students whose expectations and competences will be matched more closely with the needs of the SMEs that are seeking new employees. Second, SMEs participating in the project and benefiting from its outputs will better understand how to facilitate their working conditions and define their employer brand to become more attractive employers that will more easily recruit and retain young workers and other job seekers with specific needs to boost the sustainability of local economies.", "http://www.hud.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA203-023916_3"], [2016, "Capacity building in agricultural innovation services in CEE countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF HUDDERSFIELD", 179723.0, 6, 8, "Short Project DescriptionCapacity building in agricultural innovation services in CEE countries (CATAlySt) project aims to support agricultural innovation within the CEE region by identifying the necessary skillset and knowledge for practicing agricultural innovation professionals and providing them with a well elaborated training programme based on Dutch and British examples.ObjectiveThe aim of the current project is to develop effective training materials and tools in order to boost the capacity building actions in the field of agricultural innovation services in the CEE countries. The project aims to clearly define the expectations of end-users with regards to the agro innovation services and professionals, to develop and describe the optimum profile of these professionals and to prepare training materials and tools to be used during the agro innovation vocational trainings.RationaleInnovation is the driving force of development and progress in each industry, and agriculture is certainly no exception. However, innovation and innovative results do not always reach the end-users who could benefit from them. There is a large gap between research institutes and potential end-users of the research results.As the field of agricultural innovation services and professionals (brokers) is a very new field, the skillset and the competences of these professionals have not yet been clearly defined, specific training materials have not yet been developed.However in Western Europe a few tools were developed over the last decade to stimulate sustainable innovation with the support of innovation brokers. For example the Free Actors in Networks (FAN) approach (Wielinga, 2011). Within this approach several tools are described which can be used in innovative capacity building. Currently the role of innovation brokering is fully embedded in the frameworks of research programmes and innovation funds, the VET approach is still missing.Target GroupThe primary target group of the project includes the trainers of agro innovation professionals and the agro innovation professionals (farm advisors, extension service providers, local action group leaders). The end-users of the project results are the farmers, rural communities working in agriculture and training institutions dealing with capacity building in agriculture.Project description The project consist of 10 phases. The aim of the first phase is to finalize the roadmap and milestones of the project. After that, a situation analysis of Agro Innovation Services (country reports) in the partner countries will be created. In the next phase, relevant feedback from the stakeholders of the project will be collected. Focus group discussions will be organized about the result of the IO1 with farmers and advisors. In the fourth phase, On the first international meeting, the aim is to assess the project quality and risk management of the project, to present the draft Intellectual Output 1 and to assess the dissemination.In the 5th phase, the Agro Innovation Broker Training curriculum , study materials and methods will be created. In the next phase, a short term staff training will be organized by the main applicant for the lecturers and teachers from the CEE universities in Budapest. Next, National Implementation Guides for CEE countries will be developed. Then, the project partners will test the training curriculum on the final target group by pilot trainings to collect relevant feedback from the the stakeholders of the project. On the second international meeting, the aim is to assess the project quality and risk management of the project, to present the draft Intellectual Output 3 and to assess the project dissemination. In the final phase, the project partners led by the main applicant will close the project.ParticipantsDuring the implementation period 180 Trainers of agro innovation professionals, Agro innovation professionals and Farmers will benefit directly from the projectDuring the continuation period nearly 6 500 Agricultural innovation professionals, nearly 600 Local action groups and more than 400 Research institutes and other AKIS (Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems) organizations will benefit from the project.ImpactAs a result of the participation of selected agricultural innovation professionals, they will get to know new methods, will gather new knowledge, and will get access to new materials in the field of agricultural innovation services and innovative vocational education and training.
