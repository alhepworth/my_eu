The focus was on the use of practical Maths resources in order to enhance the teaching of Maths across the Primary phase.  This was then disseminated across the school in order to improve the teaching of Maths through the use of practical resources within problem solving.  In February 2015, two teachers from Pansio school, one of them being the Lead Maths specialist, carried out a reciprocal visit in order to develop child initiated learning, through the use of open ended questioning and further practical resources. During her visit, she also worked alongside teachers at Bourne Westfield Primary school from Y2 - Y6, offering constructive feedback and modelling outstanding teaching. The outcomes of these short visits prompted a focus for Bourne Westfield Primary Academy school which has since been written into the mathematics action plan and the school improvement plan. This is to further develop the use of concrete resources to deepen children's understanding through open ended questions to enable staff with the confidence to differentiate and challenge to gain depth whatever the ability is. Throughout this process, the teachers and learners will be enthused and inspired. This identified a need for further training and observation of good practice from Teija Laine from Pansio school, who is not only a Class Teacher, but a regional mathematics Specialist trainer.  Alongside these, we also identified a need in the development of the English language within Pansio and the sharing and learning of each others culture.  With these needs identified the following objectives were decided:\r\n\r\nObjective 1\r\nTo improve pupil progress by increasing children\u2019s understanding and application of Mathematics at Bourne Westfield Primary Academy\r\nObjective 2\r\nTo improve the quality of teaching in mathematics at Bourne Westfield Primary Academy.\r\nObjective 3  \r\nTo develop a strong Maths coaching team in Bourne Westfield Primary Academy.\r\nObjective 4\r\nTo disseminate to partner schools through the Keystone Teaching School\r\n\r\nDescription of activities and the methodology:\r\nListed below is a mixture of approaches that will be used to influence and develop teachers practice of which exchanging will play an integral part.\r\n*team teaching, coaching, mentoring, observing teachers and pupils\r\n*pupil interviews and work scrutiny \r\n*workshops with pupils\r\n*staff training \r\n*Using video cameras to record lessons to use as a teaching tool - demonstration videos alongside lesson designs\r\n*planning lessons to produce a bank of outstanding lesson designs to support the practical teaching of coding and mathematics\r\n*sharing new found knowledge with other schools through web seminars. \r\n\r\nResults and impact (longer term benefits):\r\nAt Bourne Westfield Primary Academy:\r\n* increase the number of children that will make greater than expected progress in order to be above the national average in mathematics\r\n*to enable teachers to become more flexible in the use of practical resources, in order for them to be better equipped to differentiate for less able learners and challenge within the same learning objective \r\n*To improve the quality of mathematics teaching so that children develop a deeper understanding of mathematics through the use of concrete resources.\r\n*To develop a strong Mathematics coaching team at Bourne Westfield \r\n\r\nWhen addressing low achievement in basic skills through more effective teaching methods, we will foster innovative approaches through problem based learning using practical equipment and scaffold innovate mathematics teaching using innovative and learner-centered pedagogical approaches to promote a deeper understanding of mathematics. This will  strengthen  teachers to deal with complex classroom realities and adopt new methods and tools.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to build on our long lasting partnership, we will continue to analyze data and results gathered from new innovative approaches to mathematics to support each other to ensure teachers receive the training or support they require to maintain and continue to improve the quality of teaching and learning. We expect to embed the learning throughout the teaching school alliance and use it to support schools in our region to improve their mathematics knowledge.", "http://www.bournewestfield.lincs.sch.uk", "Bourne Westfield Primary Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035961_coordinator"]]}}}}
