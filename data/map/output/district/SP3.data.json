Covering some 14,000 ha, the site is a haven for a wide range of flora species that characterise this type of habitat. Its fauna value is not to be ignored either - a third of the UK\u2019s population of stone curlew Burhinus oedicnemus breeds within the SPA boundary and surrounding farmland, and one of the largest colonies of the Marsh fritillary Euphrydryas aurinia can also be found here.\n\t\nIt is rare that such a large area of chalk grassland still exists in this part of the country. Most will have been a prime target for agricultural improvement schemes. But Salisbury Plain was spared this fate thanks to its strategic importance to the British army. It is in fact the UK\u2019s prime military training area. As a consequence, the impact of intensive modern agriculture has been very limited compared to the wider countryside. But the particular restrictions in land uses imposed by military exercises have had their down side too. Much of the area is suffering from management neglect \u2013 invading scrub, insufficient grazing, areas of over-grazing, fragmentation, etc.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=1712", "http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/default.htm, http://www.english-nature.org.uk/salisbury/ ,", "life_268"], [2009, "Reintroducing Otis tarda - Reintroducing the great bustard Otis tarda to southern England", "The Royal Society for the Protection ofBirds", 1771692.0, 1328769.0, "The great bustard (<i>Otis tarda</i>) is a globally threatened species listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive and a priority for LIFE+ funding. It was once found in large parts of lowland Europe, but started to decline in the 18th Century and is now absent from much of its original range. It became extinct in the UK in 1832 and in numerous other European countries during the 19th and 20th centuries. Though it is a \u2018flagship\u2019 species for lowland and dry grassland Natura 2000 sites across Europe, it is continuing to decline in most countries where it is still present. In 2004, permission was granted by the UK government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) for a 10-year trial reintroduction programme on and around the Salisbury Plain SPA in the south of England. To date, this programme has succeeded in establishing a population of some 15 great bustards. The first great bustard chicks to hatch in the UK for more than 170 years appeared in June 2009.

The key to MAPPING\u2019s success would be its planned mobilisation of a wide spectrum of ICT-related stakeholders and social actors from both EU Member States and associated countries, including academics, law and policy makers, ISPs, international and EU Internet governance bodies, NGOs and civil society organisations. The project would provide these actors with a forum for informed discussion of issues related to the digital transition, such as problems of personal data and IPR protection online, business models and e-government applications based on the use of personal data, economic exploitation of IPRs and open innovation. MAPPING would then move to create an Action Plan and put forward workable policy guidelines based on a multidisciplinary perspective on the latest and foreseeable developments in ICTs taking into account conflicting interests, perceptions and practices of different societal actors that shape the EU\u2019s technological future.
