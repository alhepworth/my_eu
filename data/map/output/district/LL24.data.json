They mainly comprise a mosaic of two Annex 1 Habitats Directive woodland habitats: \u2018Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles\u2019 and \u2018Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines\u2019. However, the conservation status of these two habitats is \u2018unfavourable-bad and declining\u2019 and \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019 at the Atlantic biogeographic level. The primary cause is invasion by non-native plant species, especially the shrub Rhododendron ponticum, which alters light and soil conditions, outcompetes native flora and suppresses regeneration. Among the other threats are over- or under-grazing, a lack of management, and atmospheric nitrogen pollution. The UK holds around 95% of the old sessile woods and 70% of the Tilio-Acerion forest habitats, and therefore has a particular responsibility to return these habitats to a \u2018favourable\u2019 conservation status.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6690", null, "life_1"], [2014, "SciuriousLIFE - Sciuriosity - Evolving IAS grey squirrel management techniques in the UK.", "Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts", 2191757.0, 1315056.0, "The presence of the invasive alien grey squirrel (<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) in the UK is detrimental to several native species and the overall health and resilience of affected woodland ecosystems.

This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_9"]]}}, "0PA": {"life": {"data": [[2006, "Active blanket bog in Wales - Restoring active blanket bog in the Berwyn and Migneint SACs in Wales", "The Royal Society fot the Protection of Birds", 3057095.0, 2292822.0, "The project focused on the Berwyn and South Clwyd Mountains SAC and the Migneint-Arenig-Dduallt SAC, which are two of the most important SACs for blanket bog in the UK.
