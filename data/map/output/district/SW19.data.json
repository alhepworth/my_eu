The seminar takes place in Georgia, a country where minorities are a very present and often delicate issue and will involve a particular focus on minorities in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentity is a very real preoccupation for young people in general, and particularly for those with a minority, immigrant or otherwise unusual background. For better or for worse, multiple and layered identities are a lasting feature of modern Europe. It is therefore important to help young people to deal with them without losing their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the identity landscape of modern European societies is complex, it is particularly so for some groups, including the three groups involved  in this seminar - Jews, Roma and Armenians.

Identity constructions, whether anchored in fact or not, can result in difficulties, misunderstandings, prejudice or conflict. Whether we like it or not, our daily work can be powerfully impacted by the action of countries far away, by international conflict, by media reporting of distant events or by prevailing representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seminar aims to train youth workers to explore this subject and exchange experiences between groups and countries. This will lead to a greater awareness of the many frameworks available for identities, and particularly how these implicit frameworks vary from one country to the next. With this it mind, participants will be better able to adopt a pragmatic approach in which identities and cultural resources can be negociated creatively between minority groups and the rest of society. This approach involves in particular an inquisitive and open approach to culture, politics and history, a critical approach to national mythologies and a more active participation in public, including political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of individuals from diverse diaspora/minority groups, furthermore, will make it possible to open up the discussion and explore new ground together, and to lay the ground for future exchanges of best practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seminar will dedicate particular attention to the situation of minorities in Georgia.

Collaborative learning will take place when students organize their ideas for the project. The first year they will work within their own country and the second year they will work with the other countries. This part includes creating their own company in each of the collaborative countries. In order to improve their digital skills, students will be in touch via TwinSpace where they can upload monthly the work they have been doing and also interact virtually with each other. The second year they will work on a blog together while they are still part of TwinSpace. They will also chat via Skype to do presentations to the other partners. Short-term exchanges are a very important part of the project as well. Students will be able to assess the first year in the organizing country in the month of June. They will also work together planning the following year project after entrepreneurship training. In the first meeting they will present their products and they will also create the new \"four teams\" for the next year. There will be two participants from each country and they will have to plan the functions of the different Departments. In the second short-term exchange the students will put in common all the things they have done during the year and they will assess the second year of the project.\r\n\r\nThe expected results will focus in three different areas. The impact on the students, the school and the school environment. The impact concerning the students will focus on both their learning process and their studies motivation. In this way we expect them to enhance their linguistic skills and the use of the ICT. Regarding to the teacher\u00b4s impact, we expect and improvement in the teaching ability and their development in their linguistic abilities to communicate in a foreign language. Also implement the using of new methodologies and the ICT within the classroom.  For the schools it will mean a step forward in the linguistic projects and its presence in the European Framework of Reference. To finish, the project achievement  will be share with the Educational Community trough virtual spaces like e-twinning and other social networks.

Activities in the project are divided into two categories: A) job shadowing activities at the partners' insititution - St John Bosco College in London and B) methodological courses of the \"second foreign languages\" (Spanish, Russian and German). As for the job shadowing during the physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, geography and history we focus mainly on two aspects of succesful, modern and effective teaching - \"problem solving\" (creative way of solving problematic tasks in a process of learning the natural and specialized school subjects, when the pupils personalize their knowledge, by which they are able connect the theory with the practice and take responsibility for their own learning, get into the process and become self-conscious) and \"critical thinking\", in which pupils realize their own attitude towards the subject matter, select the essenatial infomation and learn how not to just automatically learn formal things by heart, yet to find new perspectives and solutions. We believe that both will lead them towards the employability, because they will know how to face the challenges with crativity. Our London partner is, moreover, the specialist at business and enterprise in teaching, so we feel highly enthusiastic about the idea of getting these into our curricula as well. Partner school develps their philosophy on the values, positive attitude towards the religious and racial diversity, or individual approach to disadventaged students. This is the added value for us and we welcome this kind of experience very openly, since similar challenges are to be even more urgent in the Slovakian social context. The international and European dimesion is going to be covered  by good methodology within the area of \"second foreign languages\" (SFL, i.e. the foreign languages that are different from English, which is constantly the subject of the highest academinc priority in our school). Our goal is to make certain parts of curricula in SFL to connect selected topics of specialized subjects in an adequate way and level so the students can compete at international European labour market because they have skills and knowledge from the professinonal point of view and are able to communicate the solutions in national languages of a given country (withing the EU 15% Spanish speakers, 13% German speakers and about 5 millions of Russian speakers, mainly Baltic countries). ACTIVITIES: A) 6 different teachers doing job shadowing activities in pairs or three members groups for all various subjects B) 4 different teachers of SFL in Spain, Latvia and Germany, while taking part in different methodological courses, in one case it's meant to be for informal education purposes (extracurricular activities). SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS: decisive factors were motivation, objective factors, specialization, language level and voluntariness. After returning of participants from mobilities, we plan partial re-designation of our curricula, and all kinds of activities leading to getting feedback, preparation of methodological guide cumulating theoretical and practical outcomes and evaluation activities, mapping measurable degree of project successfulness in three different target groups: studernts, teachers and the institution itself (examples of the selected activities: mentorship, teambuilding, formal analysis of the academic results, evaluated job shadowing, etc.) Impact lies in successful implementation such changes, which might enable us to reach the aforementioned goals and to become modern school which progresses and along with it all the students for our common future.", "http://www.sjbc.wandsworth.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SK01-KA101-022389_3"], [2018, "Innovaci\u00f3n, TIC, Integraci\u00f3n e Idiomas", "St John Bosco College", 12805.0, 2, 2, "The project \"Innovation, ICT, Integration and Languages\" is an activity involving the teachers from the Salesian School El Pilar, an state-subsidised school with 1200 students and 90 teachers.

In order to do so, teachers who participate will carry out campaign activities and training with other teachers and other professionals in schools of the region. This way, they will communicate the experiences and the materials developed throughout the various networks that we are involved with (European Network of Salesian Centres and Catholic Schools of Madrid). We also expect, that this will help consolidate the processes of innovation in the centre and the European dimension of education that we have been working on during the past five years in our school.
