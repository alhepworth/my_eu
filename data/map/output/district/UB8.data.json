This will require the project to create, develop and integrate a comprehensive range of components from the generic technology of 3D imaging. Real and virtual 3D content will be homogeneously combined/mixed producing a novel form of rich and interactive content, defined as '3D Holoscopic content'. 3D Holoscopic imaging is a technique for creating full colour 3D optical models that exist in space independently of the viewer. The images exhibit continuous parallax throughout the viewing zone. The continuous nature of the images produced with this method eliminates the effect of cardboarding (flattening of objects into discrete depth planes) and flipping (a visible effect created by moving between image fields) present in multiview stereoscopic systems. Unlike multiview stereoscopy, information about a point is contained in many different parts of the image plane. In this respect 3D Holoscopic imaging is akin to holography. However 3D Holoscopic imaging is more advantageous, since it can operate under incoherent illumination, which is in contrast with holography, and hence it allows more conventional live capture and display procedures to be adopted. Furthermore, in viewing the 3D optical model accommodation and convergence work in unison (i.e. the viewer's eyes focus and converge to the same point) to prevent eye-strain from occurring.The 3D VIVANT project will investigate the possibility of using different technologies for capture and display of 3D content.

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains linear chromosomal DNA ends by the addition of TTAGGG repeats, is completely repressed or present only at low, tightly regulated levels in normal human cells as a safeguard against cancer. Normally, telomere shortening in the absence of sufficient telomerase leads to telomere uncapping, activation of a DNA damage response, and either replicative senescence or apoptosis. Paradoxically, however, under certain conditions (when damage response pathways are defective, eg through p53 gene mutation) unchecked telomere shortening can generate a chronic genomic instability that drives and accelerates clonal evolution and cancer progression. As a result, telomeres are dysfunctional in human cancers.  Individual protein components of the core telomere higher-order structure (known as the telosome, or the \u2018shelterin\u2019 complex) represent highly promising candidates for novel biomarkers of telomere dysfunction and human cancer progression.

Significant cost reductions can therefore be achieved, as well as allowing the machining of difficult-to-cut materials without incurring the larger costs typically associated with this. The system is based on the development of a combined sensor/actor system. By using an innovative micro cooling device a closed coolant circuit can be used for the measurement of the tool temperature, and by variation of the coolant flow the temperature can be controlled. A further significant advantage of the system is the possibility of avoiding the need for cooling lubricant.

Whereas existing frequent mobility in this sector, training contents at the European level would facilitate the qualification of professionals and will facilitate the mobility of staff between countries.\r\n- At present, this sector has courses with traditional learning techniques and contents. This sector is characterized by the relocation of the workplace, making it difficult to support the organization and training centers. With innovative training tools using ICT the distance learning will be facilitated.\r\n- In today's job market there is a growing demand for highly qualified for wind farm maintenance staff, not only in mature markets such as Spain but also in growing and emerging markets (other European countries). To this need for highly skilled operators will also add the growing sophistication of wind turbines requires specialization of workers.\r\n\u201cTrivial: SKILLWIND\u201d\u00b4s OBJECTIVES are:\r\n- Standardize at European level the operational skills needed to qualify suitable to the wind energy sector\u00b4s staff (installation and exploitation) of wind farms \r\n- Promote an innovative development of the training in the wind energy sector through a serious game.\r\n- To promote the professional development of staff and the competitiveness of the sector.\r\nThe game technology has an enormous potential to develop with a suitable guarantee the teaching-learning process. Serious games are a useful learning method to alleviate the practical training needs of the learners and efficient tool in the learning processes. This assertion is supported by the intrinsic educational features to the game, because suppose a motivating device for the users, achieves significant learning while playful; promotes the teamwork, so necessary for society today and have great flexibility in use.\r\nNew technologies applied to training available to the student and teacher interaction media , significantly improving the learning process. These innovative learning tools based on the use of ICTs allow the use of interactive contents through a serious game will provide a more efficient quality training and distance learning can be developed at any time and place. \r\nTherefore, through this proposal seeks to use ICT as innovative educational tools. However, with the current economic situation, this is a high stress hard to take, motivating the search for external funding\r\n- The consortium will be formed by 3 professional associations of different countries (Spain -AEE-,Italy -ANEV-and Belgium-APERe-),1 multinational corporation, training company and expert in the ICT and training European Projects (SGS TECNOS) and 1 University (UBRUN in United Kingdom) \r\nThese entities have an experience and capacities that as a whole are essential for the achievement of the specific aims of the project: \r\n- Unlike the individual companies of the sector that identify what needs it has his CONCRETE activity, the PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (AEE, ANEV and APERe) know closely the wind sector IN THEIR SET so much in his country as to European level. They identify so which is the development and needs of all the areas that shape the sector from the projects of construction of parks, construction of parks, assembly and installation, dismantlement, SMEs, average and big companies, suppliers, auxiliary elements, regulation, market, training\u2026. In addition they give diverse services, between which stand out those of training and professional qualification of the workers of the sector (object of this proposal). For this, the associations form specific workgroups that treat these topics and articulate tools to contribute to the companies and workers the means necessary for a suitable and updated professional training. Associations have also a high experience in activities of national and International diffusion (fairs, Congresses, Conferences \u2026.)\r\nFor his representation in the negotiations with the state agencies, these entities identify the sectorial and European needs being able to intervene in the improvement of the learning as well as allow an easy access to a major number of beneficiaries \r\n\r\n- The main result expected to develop in this project is a SERIOUS GAME: \u201cTrivial: SKILLWIND\u201c with the training for the development of the daily activities of the sector.

The remote PV laboratory will be installed outdoors at the facilities of the TEI of Athens - Greece, which is in a geographical region characterized by a large number of annual sunshine hours, allowing the users to perform real-world tests and experiments with photovoltaic panels over the internet, in real time. At the same time, the student can have a live view of the systems through a web camera, offering him/her a sense of personal presence in the place where the experiment takes place. The system should be accessible by everyone on the planet with an internet access and will be offered in at least five different languages. It also should be accompanied by appropriate educational material, for several target groups, such as students, postgraduates, professionals and educators, allowing it to be used by a broad variety of users directly. Moreover, the remote laboratory could help students with disabilities, to increase their participation in a laboratory environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the remote PV laboratory, open educational resources (OERs) will also be adapted and developed to accompany it. These OERs include educational texts, tests and documentation developed for various types of users, from high-school students to professionals seeking to expand their field of knowledge. In addition to open educational material, a series of experimental exercises will be developed on photovoltaic systems, using advanced information and communications technologies, which could be adapted for courses currently present in higher education curricula and based on the innovative remote photovoltaics laboratory. A specialized website will be created to communicate the users with the remote laboratory in order to perform the experimental exercises. These remote experiments could be used for distance education, professional training and part time study. Thus, students from Europe and around the world, whose institutes/schools do not have laboratories, or their countries do not have a high annual number of sunshine hours, can perform experiments and then analyze the results according to the taught theory. Classroom courses can also benefit from this system by letting the teachers demonstrate the behaviour and analyze the characteristics of a photovoltaic panel in real conditions. This approach opens new ways in the teaching and educational process by giving students the feel of an almost direct experience with the experimental device and  providing an excellent context for developing remote collaboration skills that will be important in their future careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experimental exercises and educational material will be integrated into a global remote laboratory gateway. This gateway will be a specially designed web-portal for worldwide higher education, and it will act as the basis of all educational and training activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive well-recognized European Universities are involved in the project as well as the Technical Chamber of Greece. All the partners have their specific role in the project and the expertise of each partner provides the means to a successful complementary collaboration between the partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of workshops will be organized to disseminate the project and train the interested parties. Seminars will be provided to local professional organizations, such as the Technical Chamber of Greece, so as for their members to be informed of, use and provide feedback on the proposed system. The system and some of its capabilities will be presented in relevant peer-reviewed scientific conferences, in order to disseminate the system towards other scientists with expertise on the fields of online/remote education and for the opportunity to receive feedback from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duration of the project will be three years.

European participation in labour and leisure for people with disabilities\" is about the perspectives of people with disabilities in European societies that become more inclusive. All participating schools are special education and / or inclusively working schools. Most of our students are intellectually disabled and / or from disadvantaged backgrounds. The project idea came to three partners during a Comenius Project (LLP) and so we looked on etwinning to find new partners to contribute their ideas to our project. We were glad to find \"Newcomers\" and experienced partners with different backgrounds that will promote ideas and contribute their expertise to our common project.  Furthermore we involve our cooperative partners in all countries that are dedicated to facilitation of  job search processes for disabled people in our countries. The transition of our students into employment and later life has become an issue in all particpating countries since inclusion started throughout Europe. All partners consider new solutions and options for integration into existing and newly developed school curricula for the final years education plans. To ensure prosperit and lively cooperation students and teachers use all means of modern media techniques such as websites, chatrooms, DVD production, ppt-presentations, etc. and learning activities will take place in every participating country to learn about possibilities our partners offer to their students and to make use of products like self-made travelguides for people with disabilities. Students will lead interviews with people who are responsible in facilities that employ them after school, develop art obects and present them to audiences and websites, share ideas and perspectives among peer groups throughout partner countries. There will be a lasting impact on involved students, teachers and further staff, school communities and regional partners that are ensuring the educational processes to employment of our students. Local authorities are invited to take part in certain venues and in order to enrich the project by providing space for discussions and exchange about topic specific matters. Participating schools will gather enhancement for their curriculas and students that will attend our institutions in future will gain from experience and efforts others have undertaken to ensure education that takes recent developments in job market into account for their transition into employment despite of their backgrounds and disablities. By developing a network in between many partners and providing expertise among each other and distribution of outcomes in twinspace,  other websites and local press many facilities and professionals that are working in the field of Special Education Needs (SEN) are invited to get in touch for discussion and / or to profit from our experience.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of space the german translation will be attached to this application form in section N.
