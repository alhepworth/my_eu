RTIs (e.g., tonsillitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis) will be diagnosed by means of DNA/RNA differentiation so as to identify their bacterial vs viral nature. Together with antibiotic resistance screening on the same platform, a more efficient treatment management is expected at the point-of-care. High impact is expected on socioeconomic level too, as the healthcare system is expected to benefit from: less crowded hospitals (patients find equally efficient chair-side diagnosis); less budget spent on excessive antibiotics and progressed-stage disease treatments; less insurance costs for oral diseases, which are largely age-related. At the heart of DIAGORAS lies a centrifugal microfluidic platform (LabDisk and associated reader) integrating all components and assays for a fully-automated analysis: interface of the collection tube with the disposable disc; on-disc sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification with pre-stored buffers); amplification & detection (rapid PCR); protein isolation and detection (bead-based multiplexed immunoassays); microarray-based antibiotic screening. Low-cost disposable fabrication (microthermoforming of polymer foils) will render the platform batch-producible and affordable to end users. The entire setup will be validated at clinical settings and compared with gold standards (e.g., tissue extraction and culture methods). The modular nature of the platform, the non-invasive sampling, the rapid and multiplexed molecular-based detection, and the sample-to-answer analysis are DIAGORAS innovative features.", 364256.0, 4666338.0, 8, 10, "DIAGORAS", "http://www.diagoras.eu/", null, null, "h2020_193255_950120918"], [1420070400000, 1546214400000, "Epigenetic regulation of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer: A systems medicine approach to predict treatment outcome", "Clinicageno Limited", "The mission of EpiPredict is to train a multidisciplinary cohort of young researchers in a new approach to fully exploit the epigenetics of complex diseases. The 12 early-stage researchers (ESRs) will focus on a narrowly defined case, Tamoxifen-induced resistance in Estrogen Receptor positive (ER\\) breast cancer, considering five resistance interacting pathways. Given the frequent Tamoxifen treatment failure, resistance prevention and reversal is an urgent clinical problem that is central in EpiPredict. The EpiPredict intersectorial training programme employs a timely systems medicine approach combining next-generation systematic epigenetic, gene/protein profiling with innovative gene-specific epigenetic interference technologies for iterative computational modelling. Together the ESRs will identify key epigenetic changes underlying Tamoxifen induced resistance. This will provide an important step towards diagnostic markers/tools to predict treatment outcome and response monitoring setting the scene for breast cancer personalized medicine. The fellows will be trained by experts from 6 academic and 2 non-academic beneficiaries and 7 partner organizations (1 academic, 6 non-academic including industrial/socio-public parties) and 5 visiting scientists, from fields ranging from epigenetics to both computation and medicine. Strong involvement of the private sector ensures exploitation of EpiPredict achievements and exposure of the ESRs to an entrepreneurial mindset. \nThe cohort of supradisciplinary researchers represents a new generation of research leaders equipped to address complex diseases whilst taking personalized patient aspects into consideration. They will be equipped to compete successfully and succeed in their personal careers. EpiPredict will boost academia and pharma/biotech environments, providing extra impulses to drive European translational science, systems medicine, pharmaceutical industry, and Medical ICT offering ample job opportunities.", null, 2299008.0, 8, 15, "EpiPredict", null, null, null, "h2020_193941_950120918"]]}}, "3PX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1199145600000, 1293753600000, "Smartest Cars Video Project", "Ian Catling Consultancy", "The Smartest Cars Video Project proposes to produce a high quality video documentary to raise public awareness of eSafety systems via mass media broadcasting. The project is in response to the stated need for such video documentaries in the i2010 Intelligent Car Initiative. The project directly addresses the ICT Work Programme Challenge 6: ICT for Mobility, Environmental Sustainability and Energy Efficiency in terms of the goals of achieving a 50% reduction in road fatalities by 2010 and strengthening the competitiveness and technological leadership of Europe's automotive and supplier industries on the world market.<br/>Smartest Cars will be engaging, entertaining, and educational for the everyday TV viewer. It is intended to be shown on the major television channels throughout Europe. The project budget will support 180 minutes of video content, organized into several episodes. The documentary will be based on consultation with the vehicle industry. We will work with the industry to film the latest (non-proprietary) smart-car technology in action, as well as interview industry professionals. The experiences and perceptions of end users will play a major role. The documentary will avoid favouritism towards any particular company as well as the promotion of any particular product. A specific project task focuses on making arrangements with major broadcasters in Europe for airing the video program. Smartest Cars will also be shown to selected live audiences. A companion website with more information and extended video clips available for on-line viewing will be created. The project will also liase with relevant eSafety Forums and ICT for Mobility projects.<br/>The project coordinator H3B Media is the production company for Smartest Cars. The H3B team includes experts in ITS media, intelligent vehicles, and documentary filmmaking. Administrative support is provided by Irion Management Consulting.
