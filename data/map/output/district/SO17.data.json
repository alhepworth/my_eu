Thus, studies have estimated that reefs will be lost within the next one hundred years as a result of global warming. High temperatures undoubtedly play a major role in triggering coral bleaching. However, observations made for instance during the 1998 bleaching event, suggest also a connection between the susceptibility of corals to heat stress and anthropogenically elevated nutrient levels. Here, I present evidence that unbalanced ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus in the water column perturb the lipid composition of photosynthetic membranes of zooxanthellae and result in an increased susceptibility to thermal bleaching.

Thus, MER+ was conceived by EHU, SOTON, UBx and ULg, with the invaluable contribution of a global network of Associates, as a result of the invaluable experience achieved by the MER Consortium along with the EMMC programme. MER EMMC was focused upon the integration of environment and resources; however, we have evolved towards an environmental scope, in agreement our most recognised academic and scientific strength. Career prospects are promising, ranging from fundamental and applied science, to consultancy and management (www.merconsortium.eu). Stakeholders are committed to the compliance of international recommendations and conventions, together with environmental directives and regulations; they require high quality graduates, who can make a difference in marine environment management.

Yet, museums in Egypt are facing a serious setback, which is affecting their cultural, social and economic roles; it is the need for specialised education and professional training in Museum Studies. Out of more than twenty universities in Egypt offering, for decades, undergraduate and postgraduate education in different aspects of archaeology, cultural heritage and the history of Art, only a handful are offering some individual courses in museum related topics. Accordingly, the great majority of those who working in museums in Egypt are not specialised in that field. This has resulted in the lack of innovative, attractive and informative displays in most Egyptian museums. Also the educational and social role of museums in Egypt is quite limited due to the paucity of dedicated public educational and outreach programs.

The goal of the UNCRPD is an inclusive society in which persons with disabilities have equal rights and equal access to education, built environment and information and communication technology (ICT). However, there is a great lack of knowledge and expertise on accessible design of professionals in the ICT domain across Europe. Therefore, one of the recommendations of G3ict's CRPD 2013 ICT Accessibility Progress Report is to build capacity, e.g. through training programs for future professionals about digital access for Persons with disabilities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will build the required capacity in Europe by bringing together European universities with the according expertise and existing curricular activities in the field. The goal is sustainable exchange and harmonization of knowledge and teaching materials, and a joint provision of educational services, to foster a more inclusive higher education in Europe, and to provide a low-barrier education and training on accessible design in ICT to current and future professionals. The vehicle for this goal is a joint framework for teaching massive open online courses (MOOCs), employing available interoperability standards and infrastructures for scalable learning design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental concept for this framework is separated into two iterations: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIteration 1: Planning, implementation and evaluation of an introductory massive open online course on basics in accessible design in ICT, to be hosted at one of the wider known international MOOC platforms, with the goal to enhance visibility and to draw participation from students and professionals in the field. The course will be jointly designed and evaluated by all partnering universities, with each partner providing the content for one unit (according to their expertise). The course will be open to everyone and will provide a basic level of exposure and knowledge in accessible design in ICT. It will itself be accessible, to allow for the participation of persons with disabilities. It will also include an overview on areas of specialization within the field. The online course will be highly scalable and cater for participation from a massive number of participants throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIteration 2: Planning, implementation and evaluation of a set of online courses with more in-depth and focused learning topics. The specialized courses will serve as logical follow-up for the participants of the introductory course who want to gain expertise in one of the specialized areas. The choice and structure of the specialized courses will be jointly defined by the partnering universities, based on the feedback gained in the dissemination/follow-up phase of iteration 1. Due to the higher specialization degree, these courses will be designed to address a less massive amount of participants, which enables a more individualized learning experience.

The model combines a well-established approach to professional learning, known as \u2018lesson study\u2019, with an emphasis on listening to the views of students, which is a distinctive feature of the model. Most importantly, the model facilitates dialogue between children and teachers in order to develop inclusive responses to diversity.  \r\n\r\nThe issue of including all children in schools is a challenge faced by teachers across Europe (Corak, 2004). In addition, though there is research that has involved students in commenting on practical aspects of schooling - such as school uniforms and aspects of the environment \u2013 much less research has focused on using their ideas to improve learning and teaching.

Researchers will work closely with the headteachers and a trio of teachers in each of the hub schools in using the model.  Children will also be trained as researchers. \r\nCycle 2. The approach will be used in 5 more schools in each country, whilst at the same time expanded in the hub school, with systematic monitoring of the impact on teachers\u2019 thinking and practices, and students\u2019 engagement. \r\nCycle 3. The approach will be used extensively in the 30 participating schools and disseminated to all schools in each of the cities involved. \r\nThe intended outcomes are:\r\n1. A Guide\r\n2. A DVD\r\n3. A Manual for Training children as researchers\r\n4. A Pupil Voice Toolkit\r\n5. Case studies (5 in total)\r\n6. A Guidance document for monitoring impact on teachers \r\n7.

This complementary partnership brings together the skills and human resources needed for a successful project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodological approach to project management has been to share the responsibility for key activities among the partners, while ensuring the involvement of all partners in every activity. UM2 will provide financial and administrative management of the project. Project management will be carried out by Montpellier\u2019s Faculty of Education. A Steering Committee will oversee the running of the project and make any necessary adjustments. A Scientific Committee will ensure that the targets are appropriately met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive work groups, each led by a university with proven expertise in the field for which it is responsible, will plan the development, training and dissemination activities:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup 1 \u00ab Digital infrastructures \u00bb: University of SOUTHAMPTON (United Kingdom);\r\n\r\nGroup 2 \u00ab Development of Digital Resources \u00bb: National University of Distance Education (UNED, Spain);\r\n\r\nGroup 3 \u00ab Training of Teachers in the use of digital technologies \u00bb: PERUGIA (Italy);\r\n\r\nGroup 4 \u00ab Development of the Joint Master\u2019s \u00bb: UM2, Faculty of Education, (France);\r\n\r\nGroup 5 \u00ab Internal and external dissemination and exploitation of results \u00bb: University of LINK\u00d6PING (Sweden).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers from all of the partner universities will participate in the work groups. Finally, the development and dissemination of a good practice guide on the use of digital technologies is a key element which will ensure the sustainability of the project outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes\r\n\r\nOutcomes to be assessed during the project include positive changes in the professional practices of the teaching staff (300 teachers trained), improvement in the digital environment of each of the partner universities and better institutional recognition of the efforts of teachers. The training modules will be added to the continuing professional development plans of the partner universities and the joint Master\u2019s will become part of their educational offer. Through their various academic networks, the results of the COLISEE project will be disseminated within and outside Europe to teachers and students. Finally, in the longer term, the employability of graduates with the joint Master\u2019s degree will be evaluated.", "http://www.southampton.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA203-008505_9"], [2018, "\u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd  \u0392/\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u0395.\u0395.\u039a. \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd & \u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c7\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2", "UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON", 207564.0, 7, 10, "Due to the fact that the role of Vocational Education and Training is not only professional but also social, Sivitanidios Public School gives priority to the creation of a modern and attractive educational environment that responds to the ever-increasing demands of the future and at the same time limits the phenomenon of converting social inequalities into educational ones.\r\nVET executives, responding to a continuous lifelong learning process, should acquire skills and experience in order to connect the technical skills with the labour market.\r\nThe Strategy of our Foundation's Internationalization, through the implementation of the proposed mobility activities under the Erasmus + 2018, meets the following needs of  our students and  teaching staff:\r\n\u2022 Use of ICT-based training methodologies\r\n\u2022 Development of basic and horizontal skills (entrepreneurship, language and digital skills) of staff and trainees\r\n\u2022Teach effectively in heterogeneous classes of pupils from different social and cultural backgrounds and with a wide variety of abilities and needs\r\n\u2022 Relevance and connect the supplied learning and training with the labour market\r\n\u2022 Equal opportunities, social inclusion, employment integration into minority groups (migrants, refugees) in vocational education & training.\r\n\u2022 Integration into the School Organization the knowledge and the experience of VET mobility projects\u2019 implementation at pedagogical, administrative and operational level\r\nThe proposed mobility activities meet the fore-mentioned needs of our Foundation and are divided into three groups:\r\nA.

Combine the expertise of three universities to explore and offer innovative ways of meeting the educational needs of occupational therapists and evaluate these outcomes to demonstrate how working with \u2018real\u2019 projects in a contextualised manner which engages students differently develops their understanding. 2. Use the international community to strengthen and deepen professional identity to encourage students to work confidently with an occupationally focused approach. This unique approach aims to bring about transformational change to small and isolated groups in society.  3. Further develop an intercultural skilled workforce who can support the increasingly diverse populations of all partner countries to meet the needs of global health concerns.4. Develop a future workforce with the confidence and skills to work within the European and global work market to address global health and societal issues.The project will impact directly on 420 students and 35 staff from the 3 participating institutions. Approximately 84 community projects impacting directly and indirectly on 21,000 participants will be undertaken with opportunities to further this number through links with new partners. This does not include the ongoing impact of the work or the long term impact on the practice of the students involved in the project once qualified. Four types of activity will be used to achieve the objectives:1. Physical exchange learning week - Students will participate in education, practice and research based activities with community partners, focusing on how occupational therapists may support socially isolated groups in society to improve their health and wellbeing. Students and staff will work in mixed groups to develop professional knowledge, skills, professional identity, and language and cultural competencies. 2. Development of web-exchange and digital technologies to internationalise the classroom - Over a 10 week period mixed groups of students from each University will form a web-exchange group. They will establish informal relationships with one another learning about their educational programmes, healthcare and other sector systems. Each country will draw on authentic project work with their community partners considering the occupational needs of particular individuals, groups and communities. They will discuss and debate the similarities and differences in OT practice and consider how occupational issues might be solved differently. 3. Extend web-exchange partners - During the 3 year project the participating institutions will share links with existing partners and develop further European partners to expose the students to greater diversity, intercultural aspects and worldwide occupationally focussed solutions. 4. Staff exchange - The project aims to develop a clear and coherent scoping of staff working within all participating institutions to identify where staff may contribute to one another\u2019s curriculum offering research expertise, new knowledge and innovative educational approaches. The project will strengthen the professional identity of occupational therapists who assert that meaningful engagement in everyday meaningful activities can influence health and wellbeing of socially excluded and marginalised groups. The projects will offer marginalised groups opportunities to have their stories heard and acknowledged while preparing graduates to think creatively about complex situations. Students and staff will offer solutions that benefit not only the service users but also families and communities and the organisations they work with so that they may make choices, and take control of their lives and aspirations. The project will develop guidelines on how the classroom might be \u201cinternationalised\u201d in a different way so that all students can be included and begin to develop cultural competencies that will impact on their future practice in increasingly internationalised practice within their own countries.
