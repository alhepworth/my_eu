The liberalization is expected to increase competition and thus increase cost-efficiency in energy production, transmission and distribution with the result of decreasing electricity prices. The efforts of Member State governments to create a more competitive and sustainable electricity sector are currently clouded by a major economic downturn in Europe\u00b4s economic activity. Such economic hardship often triggers reluctance to change which is becoming visible in particular in the electricity sector, where measures to protect jobs and national industry start to compete with market liberalization. The affordability of sustainable electricity is questioned.\n\nThere is a strong need for innovative business models for Renewable Energy Source (RES) electricity generation in the long and mid-term because support schemes will fade out in the long term pushing renewables on the market at no marginal costs which then in particular for strongly correlated generation as wind and PV leads to price deterioration during production hours. Already today many Member States have drastically reduced measures to further support the development of the RES sector, so that new investment is not possible without tapping new revenues with new business. \n\nThe aim of the BestRES project is to identify best practices business models for renewable electricity generation in Europe and to improve these further taking into account new opportunities and synergies coming along with changing market designs in line with the EU target model.

Build trust and upgrade competence for the trainers in ecological building", "Earth Building UK and Ireland Ltd", 332425.0, 6, 8, "JUMP! is a proposal aimed at building trust and upgrading competence for the trainers and training centres in ecological building.\r\n\r\nSince 2002, several European projects have worked towards providing vocational development and mobility opportunities for eco-building learners, trainers and crafts people. With growing demand for natural building technologies, there is a need for skilled craftspeople, short and long certified training offers and for specialised trainers. But the consortium identified 3 major challenges: training centres and specialised ecological building trainers need:\r\n- To strengthen their identity,\r\n- To be introduced to the resources and European level networking,\r\n- To have better access to the resources of the training and assessment offer.\r\n\r\nCompetence already exists in our different networks, cooperation allows good practice to spread. Training for trainers and dissemination are the levers to remove those blocs. \r\n\r\nFirst, a new common core curriculum, units of learning outcomes and tools for trainers will be enhanced and tested. The new tools will be an innovative process to create a paradigm shift. As Einstein stated hundred years ago: \u201cthe significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.\u201d Sustainable building cannot only be achieved by technology but also has non-technical and non-material aspects. We believe that change is a major motivator driving designers, builders and customers of eco-construction which should be explicitly included in the learning process. This will empower and give strong identity to the whole European eco-construction network.\r\n\r\nAccess to new and existing resources will be improved by the creation of a new European online portal. It will map and connect the existing European and national websites showing the available tools, including the trainer training modules developed by the JUMP! Project. A dynamic agenda of training and assessment offers, and of learning and teaching tools for natural building materials.\r\n\r\nThe federation Ecoconstruire has invited national associations (RFCP and AsTerre \u2013 France ; ASBN \u2013 Austria ; ArTUR \u2013 Slovakia ; EBUKI - UK and Ireland ; BiWeNa \u2013 Germany) that work with craftspeople who act as vocational trainers offering comprehensive training in eco-construction in their country. Those organisations have developed European competence standards and experienced mobilities. Another partner, Johannesdalsinitiativet \u2013 Sweden, has been chosen for the unique elements and innovative activities they developed with their work on people's awareness of values other than materialism: change and trust. \r\n\r\nEach country will host at least one of the seven international meetings, organise dissemination events and send at least 2 trainers to the training tests. A team of 3 people (1 from the coordinator and 2 from other countries) will lead and be responsible for the final production for each of the 3 main outputs (1/ Common core curriculum, 2/ Units of learning outcomes and tools, 3/ New common European online portal). Each output has preliminary steps (sub-products) with a leader who sub-divides the 4 stages: analysis, development, validation and production. At each level partners will work in constant collaboration and feedback loop with Johannesdalsinitiativet \u2013 Sweden, to encourage innovative teaching practices. \r\n\r\nThe impact envisaged and potential longer-term benefits are: \r\n- To give eco-construction training centres a basis for selection, training and induction of their teaching staff\r\n- To facilitate introducing eco-building when eco-building trainers or training centres co-operate with conventional training providers \r\n- To consolidate confidence among MoU signatories of the earth and straw bale networks and encourage transnational mobility of learners and trainers. \r\n- To support ongoing national certification strategies for ecological building techniques\r\n- To provide our network with a shared culture of pedagogical tools and practices\r\n- To raise awareness about European added value and support the trainers to implement European competence standards and use the existing resources.\r\n- To increase transferability between our network organisations to go beyond the project consortium, to any educator keen to learn about eco-construction or ECVET and mobility, any educator keen to support adults to build trust through play and creative activities in order to contribute to a positive sustainable development\r\n- To provide access to essential information around the existing tools\r\n- To facilitate the learners research on courses that suit their learning pathways\r\n- To allow the training providers and umbrella organisations to respond to the learners request in an efficient way\r\n- To develop collaboration between training centres \r\n- To increase training offers for short and long certified trainings in eco-building", "http://www.ebuki.co", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA202-037414_1"], [2016, "Earth Building Assessment and Training", "Earth Building UK and Ireland Ltd", 39814.0, 7, 7, "The objective of the project is for the first time, to train and qualify assessors and verifying assessors in the earth building sector from the UK and Europe. This is an enormous step forward in the creation of training and employment opportunities within sustainable building in both the UK and across Europe.  It would also be in direct support of the global Paris agreement on climate change 2015, through the accreditation of natural, low carbon emission building materials in construction.With the recent acceptance and recognition of earth building training within the UK National Occupational Standards (NOS 2015),comes the need for recognised qualifications (NVQ or other) which do not currently exist in the UK.  To meet this need an approved assessment process with verified assessors is required, opening the door to National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and other certified training in the UK. NOS and NVQ development are successful outcomes of a previous European Partnership Programme (KA2 PIRATE).  The UK is unique within Europe for having achieved the NOS for earth building, and as such is in a unique position to empower not just our own industry to accept, adopt, train and employ workers in earth building technology, but to help European partners to do so. It is only possible to offer accredited training in earth building when verified assessors are appointed.  Assessors in turn need training, assessor experience and validation, which can only be gained from partner European countries already trained and proficient in delivering assessment and qualifications in earth building techniques.  So the project aims to train potential assessors (all of whom will be practitioners and trainers in different earth building techniques, many of whom will already have been instrumental in the creation of the Units of Learning Outcomes for the new PIRATE Earth Building Training Program.  Our partner countries of France, Germany, Slovakia and Spain are committed to a partnership of assessor training for EBUKI members, which in turn will offer UK accredited  training and qualifications for both European and UK earth builders and trainees.Earth building is  both traditional and modern, businesses operate in the UK which both build new dwellings, public and commercial buildings while others are conserving and repairing the thousands of existing earth structures.Earth building is sustainable, using materials which are both locally available do not have the climate changing emissions associated with most modern building materials. The PIRATE project allowed 18 organisations from 8 countries to analyse and write the activities involved in earth building. Units of Learning Outcomes were written allowing training organisations, builders and contractors to structure their training in a new way, respecting European differences in training culture but at the same time allowing the assessment of outcomes to be universally applied. In the UK this process of writing Units has already allowed the National Occupational Standard (NOS), to change to accepting earth as a material with a training curriculum, the first country in Europe to do so under the active engagement of EBUKIParticipants to this application are lifelong learners who already work with and have experience of earth building and as trainers. As a largely self taught industry which has had little mainstream support all will already have shown a great deal of self motivation. They are also passionate about passing on the skills they have to another generation. For most this is the first opportunity to pioneer an officially recognised qualification in their field and will be a boost not only to what and how they teach but to their own practice.Activities include attending assessed workshops under the supervision of certified assessors to give experience of assessment and to certify new assessors. While ECVET assessors have been working for some time with earth plasters qualifications earth structures qualifications are the next step. Participants will have the benefit of seeing assessors from the earth plasters sector at work and benefiting from that experience.Workshops will cover a range of earth building activities, mixing, building, repairing, plasteringMethodology, how European partners work, in the European visits needs to be analysed and learned. Methodology in the UK will then be set with partners Fife College and HS to ensure CITB criteria met.The expected result will be the growth of youth and lifelong learners certified in earth building both here and cross Europe.

The school is composed of a primary school, a lower secondary school and a boarding school for girls and boys. We have 320 pupils. The project TIICEE aims at renovating the pedagogy in our school because we have to admit that too many pupils aren't interested in learning any more and we, teachers, find really difficult to motivate them. We need to teach differently and they need to learn differently too. We have listed our priorities: first we think that it is vital to widen their intercultural approach so that they can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Then we think that the pupils must use the ITC tools intelligently and properly. Finally we need to develop the \"working together\", the autonomy, the creativity and the choice-making process in all the teenagers so that they can find a good job. A group of 6 teachers and a member of staff have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The structured courses with school visits (\"job shadowing\") are meant to observe and understand new and innovating teaching practices in countries such as Iceland, Finland or Ireland. Other training sessions are more specialized and concern the science teacher, the sports teacher, drama techniques  and ITC tools. Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality is also planned. The teachers  will implement these new teaching techniques but also take part in new European partnerships and projects. These new practices will be tested by the teachers for two years and will play an important part in the school project.

The school has also had falling results on students' national tests and grades, even there is a need to reverse that trend and improve the outcomes and quality of education at Upplands-Bro High School. In addition to the work in progress at school with study days and auscultations with teaching teachers as part of collegial learning, the staff and the municipal council have jointly expressed the need to strengthen the European dimension at school and to learn from other countries and schools that have been faced same challenges. By meeting colleagues from other countries under the professional guidance of course organizers, hope is to gain new skills and contacts that will lead to the school's desire to increase internationalization at school and, as a result, improve the quality of the business.\r\n\r\nThe school has participated in Erasmus + projects over the last year and everyone involved has been very pleased with that experience and it has become a renewed energy for the staff who have left and it has led to changes in the school.

Therefore, it is essential to tailor our school\u2019s current educational strategy to suit the latest EU norms and standards for education. Accordingly, it is important for both teachers and students to develop \u2018soft skills\u2019 such as proactivity, creativity and competitiveness, and for this, the approach to teaching, and learning, respectively, has to be rejuvenated. In this sense, our major objectives are: \r\n- to improve knowledge about the new teaching and assessment methods with regard to the competences that can be acquired in formal/ non-formal context. Eight teachers (selected in consideration of their availability to get involved in a long-time enterprise like this) are to acquire four innovative methods in four different countries with the help of four different partners throughout the two-year project;\r\n- to acquire soft (practical, analytical, emotional and social) skills that the participants in the mobility  to schools with a strong tradition in education of high standards can share with their colleagues\r\n- to put our school on the map of the European schools, and thus manage to attract better prepared students and teachers. It is expected that those already learning/ working in our school will become more motivated and active to improve themselves on a professional as well as interpersonal level; \r\nWe have made up a project team with very clear tasks such as applying various types of questionnaires in order to identify problems, set up objectives and suggest the best activities that can be organized in order to get the expected results. We have collaborated in this sense with our Belgian partner with whom we have also developed a number of eTwinning projects, and decided to organize a job shadowing activity in order to gain hands-on experience on their approach and practices. \r\nWe have selected three different courses in three different countries by different providers with the aim of expanding our opportunities to access various educational representatives in the European community. Two teachers will take part in each mobility; one of them is responsible for teachers\u2019 training, and the other has to carefully observe the activities that those schools have designed for students. \r\nThe fact that each participant in the mobility has to train two teachers and provide two educational materials to integrate and evaluate curricular competences into non-formal activities will have a cumulative and long-term effect. All the resulting materials will be uploaded on the Internet to be freely used by both students and teachers  so that: \r\n- they all become well aware that education continues in the non-formal context, too. Such a context strengthens the student-teacher-parent and even teacher-teacher interrelations even further, due to the more relaxed and friendly environment that it creates, but it also offers a more concrete approach to real-life situations and work market.   Therefore, the competences acquire in the non-formal/ informal context must be included to complete formal education; \r\n- teaching staff will grow more motivated and self-confident in their own ability to readjust their teaching methods to the standards of quality and interactivity like those proliferated in schools in the European space, as well as to include new technologies in the curriculum. By actively participating in a mobility and coming into direct contact with colleagues from other European schools, our teachers will trust in the school\u2019s capacity to regain its success and prestige by starting to carry out activities similar to those observed during the mobility;\r\n- our school will win a vote of confidence from potential students and teachers who may consider choosing it as a viable institution where education can be delivered in the best conditions. Thus, the new activities will have a positive impact especially on students, which may lead to an increasing number of learners who opt to continue their studies in our school.\r\nAt the end of the two-year project, we expect that:\r\nThe entire community in our school will become aware of the importance of life-long learning approach and the significant contribution that the non-formal education brings along.  \r\nNew technologies will be integrated more frequently into the teaching/ learning process\r\nTeaching staff will be more assertive and motivated to apply the newly acquired methodologies because students are more familiar with the latest technologies and will thus respond to the proposed activities more actively\r\nA better educational environment in which both students and teachers feel they can easily engage themselves with one another.", "http://www.merganser.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA101-014818_3"], [2016, "Growing and Playing Together", "Merganser Consulting Ltd", 8693.0, 2, 3, "Amor de Dios is a charter school .
