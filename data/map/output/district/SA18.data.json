They will become naturally involved in European innovation and diversity with regard to cultural, geographical, linguistic, well being, entrepreneurship, innovative working and preparing pupils for the world of work and employment. Their use of ICT as teachers and educators will be enhanced along with their ability to work within a network of fellow professionals communicating during and after the project. School staff will develop their use of e twinning. The project will increase the participation of teachers who play a vital role in the labour of education. Their professional knowledge will be expanded as a result of sharing the best practice through specific professional network activities planned.      This project deals directly with common challenges facing each country in terms of up skilling the future national and European workforce. As entrepreneurship and innovative initiatives are generally under developed in all participating countries, the planned activities deal directly with combating this problem.Schools will promote the exchange of their most effective teaching techniques and develop the power of resources of each educational establishment. Minds will be broadened and horizons will opened into Europe as a community. Schools will also benefit from the opportunity of sharing innovative practice.Parents, school governors and community members will be involved in European diversity with regard to cultural, well being, entrepreneurship, innovation and employment factors. Their knowledge of the progress of their children will increase.2941 pupils will take part in this project, of which (1692 are disadvantaged) along with 242 school staff.The common activity related themes for each specific part of the project are:-Pupil Networking (i)-Professional Networking (for teachers) (ii)-Development of innovation, business, basic  and entrepreneurial skills. Pupils will organize a local market to sell their product (iii)-Exchange of language and culture (iv)Student Inclusion was placed at the heart of our early communication as we planned this project. Even though pupils will not take part in international visits they will be fully engaged in our project. Through this project an International School Council will be formed, communicating using e twinning. Project participants will stay in contact beyond the official project end date.

This is a new country for the Y-top to be and we are delighted to be partnering with new friends in Ireland for the first time. The HRF project title comes from the theme of the gathering which is to create a human ecology inspired by the Rain Forest (RF) ecologies of the planet. RFs absolutely teem with a huge diversity of fauna and flora life all of which have incredible connections to each other. Life in the RF is very specialised, some species evolve to eat only from one vine, or to pollinate only one type of plant, or to be the planter of one kind of seed. The RF depends upon these connections all working together in mysterious ways.  Altogether these connections sustain the incredible eco system that RF are and the wider  function they play on behalf of the planet and all who live here. What can a HRF eco system do for those who live in it and also the wider human world?Can this gathering create an ecology in which the participants find their own unique source of nourishment, where they find the ways to pollinate their individual growth and development, where they can become planters of new seeds for the future of humanity?We will be working with the following objectives:1.To find and discover within what the next stage of growth is in each person\u2019s life and what nutrients are needed to support that within the Human Rain Forest.2.To find ways of providing those nutrients one to another and by enrichment of the ecology for the benefit of all people who are within the Human Rain Forest of this gathering and also beyond it.3.To create opportunities for the Human Rain Forest to express itself through all manner of skills and importance\u2019s of innovation and intelligent possibility with artistic and theatrical events where the human essence can be expressed.In addition to these objectives there will also be a focus on discovering Ireland and what is unique about this special land and the people who live there. A further focus will be on the diversity of trees and plants we will be surrounded by and discovering the functions they fulfil and the connections they make in the natural worlds of Ireland.One methodology will be to spend lots of time in the stunning location of natural beauty we will be staying in. Our base, Killarney Youth hostel is surrounded by the Killarney National Park which is itself protected and revered by many as The Western Atlantic RF. This will assist in the slowing down necessary to tune in to the inner nudges life gives us. This process will also be assisted by the good housekeeping life of the camp with all participants assisting in everything that is needed to keep our ecology clean, to keep us well fed and hydrated and well rested thus eliminating stress or mess which can prevent inner quiet and thus the ability to listen internally. The emphasis with all the domestic works we will do together is to ensure the youth develop the skills to do the necessary maintenance tasks of adult life thus being able to move into the responsibilities of adult life with ease and less internal noise thus aiding self-awareness. Another methodology will be new experience leading to new self-realisation about what one is capable of,how being oneself can affect others, how good it feels to do things on behalf of others, how in working with others amazing beyond imagining things can be achieved.The HRF Y-top gathering will be hosting 90 + people and will,in addition to the youth coming with our Irish partners, be inviting local Irish youth to join some days of the process, we will initially meet these young people during the APV.  Most of the young participants will be aged between 14 and 20 years,there will also be a few in the age group 20\u201330 and at least 15 adults between the ages of 30\u201367 years.The funding being asked for is for 60 of the young people and 15 of the adults.

What am I and what can I do? Learn about expressing oneself, inner balances, learning about other cultures, the EU and world, responding to gentle challenges. Increasingly taking on responsibilities in safe areas and improve independency for every age according to the age possibility of the person.\r\n\r\n2) Acquire more and better skills needed in life. How to live life as a responsible adult, self leadership skills. Activities such as the young people cooking their own meals, cleaning  the camp area, or any place we visit, learning to share your room with more people, self-hygiene, helping  the camp logistics, transportation, content and more. This will develop respect for standards, for other people and nature, and taking responsibility within the Y-Top in which everyone has a role and part.\r\n\r\nIn the area of giving back, making the world a better place.\r\n3) To discover the importance of service to the community and the country which each Young Person is from. To do a project in The Netherlands for a Dutch community or target group, to show appreciation and thankfulness to the host country and do volunteering work. Before the start of the camp the organising and planning youth team will be researching and finding out the needs in the country and get together to find way to give help and support.\r\n\r\n4) To work together on the core motives and principles relating to creating safe humanitarian platforms in guiding youth and youth work and international cooperation. This relates to the further development of the Y-TOP as an international youth network in many countries in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the area of doing and learning together for the future. \r\n5) Preparing for the future, what do you need for that? Learning to deal with fears, such as the fear of the unknown, dealing with setback and insecurity, being flexible in a changing world, being open to new (not yet existing) jobs, try new kinds of food,try new experiences, like new sports.\r\n\r\n6) Trend watching, researching what is coming from the future. Seeking different expressions and descriptions of what the future might be like (language, art, design, new learning). Developing the sensitivity to recognize and appreciate new knowledge. What will be the tools for humans to deal, translate, workout together importances and standards for society, humanity, the ecology.

It is a four day get together of 50 participants from different ages, from 10 countries wanting to train themselves to get more skills that are needed to guide Y-Top and other youth camps.\r\n\r\nThe last 7 years there has been an annual Youth Exchange with Y-Top partners. The non formal and informal methods and techniques developed over this period have led to success, with the result that the number of participants of the youth exchanges grows substantially every year. \r\nSome youngsters have participated for 7 years in this. These youngsters take on more responsibility every year. And they are asking for training to do this better.\r\nIn consultation with them the following key areas have been identified to seek to both develop capacity within and develop competence in:\r\n1. Improve Skills Transference Ability\r\nDuring Youth Exchanges we have found that skills are both developed by young people and also transferred between people, both younger and older.  This is particularly true where someone has set themselves the goal of developing a skill and seeks a circumstance where this can happen.  It can also happen when someone finds themselves in a circumstance that they are attracted to and they then discover the love of a new area.   \r\nWe have also found that somebody can transfer the essence of a skill or subject to a person who is seeking to develop that skill.  This can also happen with groups of people who for example are able to catch the way of something during a workshop process.  The workshop itself may provide the person with the challenge in a particular area and then in the process of engaging with the workshop new skills are developed.  \r\n2. Versatility and Competence Development Across Subject Areas\r\nFor a Youth Worker (volunteers both young and old with a variety of backgrounds) being able to respond at the point according to learning needs and what\u2019s appearing is a great skill.  To do so requires versatility for Youth Workers across a range of subject areas and the ability to work with different cultural characteristics.  We want to develop the competencies of Youth Workers across a range of topic areas. \r\n3. Design of Workshops and Processes in the Context of Non Formal and Informal Learning\r\nWe see that the design of workshops and processes that facilitate skills transfer and the essence of a subject is a vital competency.  We have found that processes which are open, exploratory and prompt explorations about the future are very attractive to young people.\r\n\r\nWe are now at a point where there is the possibility of engaging with more young people in further Youth Exchanges.  In order to engage with more young people we need to know what works well in skills transfer and have more people who are skilled in this.  There are 3 objectives of this gathering for Youth Leaders and Young People as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To improve skills transference ability and to increase the number of people who are able to do this during youth exchanges.\r\n- To review and evaluate what has worked well in earlier Youth Exchanges.\r\n- To discover & understand how the coding of essential skills development and skills transference can be developed for better learning performance on youth exchanges. \r\n2. To develop the ability to transfer vital skills using different media such as theatre, dance, magic, music, movie making, communications media, oratory and other techniques.\r\n- For young people and older to practice skills transference during the gathering leadership and workshop development.  We all have the need to improves skills in this unique time of life. \r\n3. To develop expertise in the design of workshops where both skills transfer and skills development exchange can take place.\r\n- To develop skills in working with new ideas as they appear in each person\u2019s life and within groups of people to create a better future for all.  \r\n- To find ways putting into practice ideas that encourage initiative within each person\u2019s life and which encourage entrepreneurship.   \r\n- Development of skills to enable young people to take greater responsibility in their own lives, within youth gatherings and also for a better future society.\r\n- Creating a workshop circumstance where transference of skills and knowledge takes place that has an openness, no judgment, is safe and where creativity is present. \r\nThe 'Young Template of Peace: Slinky' in Wales will be hosting 50 people, consisting out of 41 youngsters and 9 Youth Leaders.
