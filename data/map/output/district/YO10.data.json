This should also have a positive effect in terms of the national economy revitalization, especially in the South of Italy.\r\nTourism and Agribusiness are key sectors for all of the regions involved in the project and recently they have been object of important development strategies for the promotion of the Italian territory and its typical products at European level. Hence, there is a need to dissolve the preexistent general skill mismatch and lack of coherence, in order to raise and train professionals with excellent skills and abilities, who could also contribute to the growth and development of the Italian territory in itself. \r\nV.A.L.L.E.Y. proposes to develop a model that is able to meet these needs. The first step of this model is the transnational mobility. This concrete experience abroad will be functional to  the participants\u2019 orientation in the labour market and their subsequent job placement, eventually leading to the equal recognition of the participants\u2019 acquired competencies  thanks to the EVCVET  methods and tools.\r\nProject\u2019s specific objectives are:\r\n- to acquire technical and professional skills in Tourism and Agribusiness sectors;\r\n-  to acquire and improve a foreign language;\r\n- to develop soft and transversal skills ;\r\n- to contribute to the process of skills and transparency validation and recognition at European level, in line with the ECVET system provisions ;\r\n-to promote the development of the South Italian employment level together with its productivity and competitiveness.\r\nIn terms of impact, the project will produce a significant impact on the participants, increasing their chances of employability: on the way back from their experience abroad, they will get the opportunity to do a post-mobility internship in Italy so as to contribute to the project\u2019s main purposes and to maximize the local impact.\r\nVALLEY will definitively trigger  positive effects both on the young professionals and on the local community. The local educational and employability systems together with the national economy  will benefit from the project outcomes at a regional and European level and will increase the general consciousness about the importance of Tourism/ Agribusiness for the local community and for Southern Italy in itself leading to the subsequent valorization of its typical products, culture and human resources. \r\nThe beneficiaries will be 150 young graduates from Campania, Puglia, Basilicata and Calabria, which will have the opportunity to carry out a 120 days traineeship in foreign companies operating in Tourism and Agribusiness and located respectively in  United Kingdom, Spain, France, Ireland and Malta.", "http://www.thetourismbusiness.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005323_17"]]}}, "3JB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1380585600000, 1475193600000, "Probabilistic real-time control of  mixed-criticality multicore and manycore systems", "Rapita Systems Limited", "In the next decade, EU industries developing Critical Real-Time Embedded Systems (CRTES) (safety, mission or business critical) will face a once-in-a-life-time disruptive challenge caused by the transition to multicore processors and the advent of manycores, tantamount to complex networked systems.

We can promote coherence between weakly-related aspects of knowledge as required, and also achieve the timely release from patterns of retrieval when the situation changes.

We consider whether flexible semantic retrieval involves the recruitment of additional brain regions, organised within large-scale distributed networks, that place constraints on patterns of retrieval in the semantic store. In this way, semantic flexibility might relate to the evolving interaction between distinct brain networks.

This is a key problem in human perception, but it also has practical implications in forensic and security settings. This project has its roots in a simple observation: pictures of the same face can look very different indeed. In the standard approach to face recognition, this commonplace fact is treated as an inconvenience. Differences between pictures of the same person are regarded as \u2018noise\u2019, and either ignored, or eliminated by systematically controlling the images used for research. This research programme takes exactly the converse approach. Instead of trying to control away this variability, we wish to study it explicitly.

(ii) We undertake a similar comparison of different tasks in healthy participants, using mixed lists containing both words and nonwords, as these stimuli have been found to elicit more phoneme recombinations for words in our past research. (iii) We adopt the highly novel approach of teaching people either the meanings or just the sounds of new words in order to examine the separate effects on phoneme binding.

The outputs produced consist of:\u2022 one study on the best innovative practices developed by partners in their CPD programmes; a full edition of the English version of the study will be available as well as executive summaries in all languages of the partnership;\u2022 five guidance tools and their brochures will be similarly produced and disseminated on the cross-cutting issues mentioned above.In order to reinforce the dissemination and the exploitation of the results, partners organise events -five national seminars and one European conference- with a total of 245 key stakeholders and decision-makers. These events are conceived in a very participative way, seeking for the feedback and ideas of target groups for improved quality and further ownership and exploitation of results.To implement these activities and produce the outputs, partners mobilise around fourty-five members from their staff with various expertise. They gather and analyse experiences from the entire national networks.Indeed, the main impact expected is, in the longer term, the increased mobilisation of other stakeholders and decision-makers in the design and implementation of large-scale and sustained STEM CPD programmes inspired by those developed by the partners. In the process leading to this impact, short-term impacts are expected on the participants (reinforcement of their own individual expertise and subsequent changes in their practices); on their respective organisations (inclusion of innovative inputs learnt from the specific expertise of others); and on other structures of the national networks to which they belong.The Foundation La main \u00e0 la p\u00e2te (France) coordinates the project and organises the work following a very participative approach in which all countries are involved in the coordination of one issue and all partners participate actively in the production of the outputs, the organisation of events and the general dissemination process.

The PASSAGE project (Professionalizing Gender and Equality Studies) offers an innovative and pioneering contribution to meeting this challenge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5 principal objectives of PASSAGE: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Improving the employment prospects of young people in the current economic context: The PASSAGE project aims to identify the competencies required for a successful professionalization in gender and equality related jobs; this knowledge will serve to enrich the course content of the EGALES  Master and of its\u2019 associated continuing education modules. \r\n\r\n2 The transnational validation of competencies: The PASSAGE project aims to promote the process of widespread recognition of competencies, specialisations and occupations in gender and equality related areas. \r\n\r\n3 International mobility and linguistic diversity: The PASSAGE project favours the international mobility of students, as well as that of their trainers; thus contributing to the construction of a pan-European citizenship. \r\n\r\n4 The modernization of higher education and research institutions. The PASSAGE project adopts an interdisciplinary, transnational and collaborative perspective, in partnership with public sector institutions, private enterprise and voluntary sector organisations, with a view to encouraging the social relevance of the European university system. \r\n\r\n5 The consolidation of links with the labour market. The PASSAGE project adopts the principal of systematic consultation between academic and non-academic partners, in order to improve the content of teaching modules, the organisation of work placements and to bring higher education institutions closer to their economic and political environments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5 main strengths of PASSAGE:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 A network of European universities, experienced in collaboration and open to new partnerships: The 6 partners of the EGALES project (Abo Akademi, UAB, Bucharest Univ., Lyon 2, Toulouse Univ., York Univ.) have learnt to work well together and are delighted to welcome 2 new additional European universities (Brussels Free University, Goethe Frankfort University), along with associated partners from Switzerland and America. \r\n\r\n2 A network of well-established contacts and collaborations with a wide range of political and socioeconomic partners, who will provide an undeniable boost to the effectiveness of the project outcomes. \r\n\r\n3 An effective methodology, based on the synergy and pooling of available resources: The PASSAGE project benefits from the implication of academic institutions, students and professional bodies in the fielding of surveys and studies. Cooperation is optimized through regular international meetings and the publication of an internal Newsletter. \r\n\r\n4 A tried and tested communications strategy, immediately available at the outset of the project. \r\n\r\n5 A potential for lasting effects: The PASSAGE project has anticipated the need for long-term institutionalisation and has foreseen the need to multiply the sources of political support for the aims of the project, beyond the duration of EU funding. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5 tangible results of PASSAGE:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 A European good practice guide to professionalizing gender equality within different socioeconomic areas: education & culture; health & gender violence; social policy; international development & migration; higher education and research. \r\n\r\n2 A European Directory of occupations, specialisations and competencies related to gender equality, established on the basis of multidisciplinary surveys and case studies. \r\n\r\n3 A Report on the current State of the Art in relation to the recognition of occupations, specialisations and competencies related to gender equality, based on the identification of the institutions and procedures involved in the certification of emergent fields of expertise. \r\n\r\n4 A fine-tuning of the course content and teaching methods of the Master EGALES, and their extension to other universities (in Europe \u2013 Free University Brussels and Frankfort University \u2013 and elsewhere), thanks to strengthened collaborations with policy makers and socioeconomic stakeholders. \r\n\r\n5 Transferable course outlines for modules on professionalization, for the intensive modules and for innovative continuing education programmes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of PASSAGE: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver and above the effects on the partners directly involved, the PASSAGE project aims to consolidate international academic networks in the field of gender and equality studies; to reinforce collaboration between universities, policy makers, private enterprise and voluntary sector organisations, in order to improve professionalization in the field of gender and equality studies, notably through the harmonization of competencies procedures.", "http://www.york.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA200-008482_6"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", 265932.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.york.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000357_coordinator"], [2014, "Children's Identities and Citizenship - Best Practice Guides", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", 242080.0, 17, 25, "This proposal has focus on European Integration promoting active citizenship in young people through guidance for the training of education professionals and young researchers. It links 25 institutions from 17 states that are involved in training education professionals and concerned with citizenship education (CE) and the development of identities in young people. We emphasise that our concern is not with legally defined notions of citizenship, rather with issues around belonging, status and active participation, and is in line with European and UN childhood and youth agendas that promote student voice and the right to education for all.Moreover, we recognise the need for quality education and training that envisages the European Community as an advanced knowledge-based society, with sustainable economic development and better social cohesion. More specifically our proposal is informed by EU policy (eg ET2020), research (eg Bruter2012) and guidance (EU,2004) that promotes active citizenship and the understanding that European identity and integration goes hand in hand with national, sub-national, and minority group identities. With respect to this the need for improved CE is highlighted by Eurodice (2012); ICCS (2009) and others.

PowerLaPs is also intended to PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and principal scientists to enhance their knowledge and improve their educational skills. This field of science and technology is considered to play a leading role for at least the next twenty years as proven by the thematic areas of the EU road-map of technology and research infrastructures (among others HiPER/NIF, ELI, XFEL) concerning laser matter interaction and laser fusion.\r\nAll 8 participating Universities have great expertise, theoretical or/and experimental in the field of laser plasmas and have\r\nbeen worldwide recognized for their contribution to education and science in their fields of expertise. For instance, CPPL of TEI of Crete  (the project coordinator) will provide the of state-of-the-art experimental infrastructure (such as the 45TW laser system and the 7fs phase locked laser) for the implementation of new state of the art training of the students of this proposal. Similarly, all partners including the associated company will provide their state of the art facilities for the same reason. \r\nThe great expertise of the scientific personnel involved in this project ensures the successful outcome of the project. More than 35  students (including the additional local students of the IP's) will benefit from the teaching and learning activities and will be given the chance to participate in ERASMUS+ activities in a multicultural environment.\r\nThe training scheme as has been analytically described in the proposal aims to make trainers and trainees members of a multinational and multicultural audience that will gain additional skills through innovative training in a field that is now and will be for the coming twenty years will be at the top of interest for the academic and industrial sector. \r\nIn addition, the training that the students will gain outside of their home countries will encourage cross-border co-operation, will contribute significantly to the increase of higher education quality provided by the partner Universities as well as by other higher education institutions in EU and worldwide via the dissemination programme of this project and will remarkably enhance the  profession skills of the participants. Furthermore, this project will give the opportunity to the teachers and the University authorities to collaborate in a multinational and multicultural environment obtaining all the benefits of such collaboration (as described in details in the proposal).\r\nThe PowerLaPs output will become an open platform of advanced training to EU universities, providing them access to the digital\r\neducational material that will be delivered among with the offering of the worldwide unique CPPL facilities for hands on training.\r\nAttendants that will successfully complete the proposed education and skill development program will gain high quality and\r\nprofessional training from top scientists & engineers (including training in high technology industrial sector) in the innovative field of high power laser produced plasmas. \r\nSuch training will have a significant impact in developing new skills for successful employment in a high tech industrial (as well as academic) private sector environment for plasmas and lasers as well as related technologies such as optoelectronics, microelectronics and optomechanics.

These opportunities should be equally available to all, promoting social inclusion. This is a concern of modern society and a key issue in European Education.However, the access to these opportunities by disabled people is constrained, in particular for deaf people due to the barriers they face in daily communication. These are facts that severely compromise the development of creative, emotional and social skills in deaf students. Barriers to education limit future opportunities. Any contribution to tear these barriers down promotes equity.The I-ACE project will establish an innovative infrastructure to promote fluid communication with, and between, deaf students from different European countries. This infrastructure includes an automatic European Sign Language Translator allowing the automatic bi-directional translation between sign language and written speech in six European sign languages thus reducing the communicational gap and contributing to promote the access to education and a better quality of life of deaf students.The I-ACE project transfers innovative research results and puts them to the service of the European community.OBJECTIVESThe I-ACE project aims to promote the access of deaf students to education and citizenship. The specific objectives are:(a) shorten the barriers to the inclusion of deaf students in education(b) promote active citizenship of the European deaf communityPARTICIPANTSThe partnership of 7 full partners and 6 associated partners includes 5 higher education institutions, the European Association of Career Guidance and the \u201cProvedoria Municipal do Cidad\u00e3o com Defici\u00eancia\u201d from C\u00e2mara Municipal do Porto, 2 schools, one Education School, an Association of Sign Language Interpreters and 2 Deaf Associations.Every partner institutions expect to actively participate in the process of social inclusion and European citizenship.ASSOCIATED PARTNERS are end-users and the main stakeholders benefiting from the I-ACE outputs. They have key roles in the project and are our gateway to sustainability. The consortium will implement pilot installations at the Associated Partners to test the project outputs in real scenarios (list of Associated Partners available at ANNEX VII). METHODOLOGY AND PROJECT ACTIVITIESThe project work plan covers an initial preparation phase aimed at implementing the required management framework and performing a comprehensive study of the challenges faced by deaf students.At the implementation phase we will transfer the results from the VirtualSign research project. VirtualSign is a bi-directional translator between written Portuguese and Portuguese Sign Language, a research product developed at IPP, the applicant institution.  In concrete we will extend it to support several European sign languages, a product we will call the European Sign Language Translator, and to develop applications to assist deaf students in educational settings and in daily life. We will organize certified staff training sessions in each country to train staff in the fundamental of sign languages and on the operation of the I-ACE applications.At the closure of the project we will evaluate the European Sign Language Translator through several pilot installations in schools and public attendance services. The results from the pilot installations and the outcomes of the project will be presented to the media and public at an open session.RESULTS AND IMPACTSIn order to disseminate project activities and results, we will provide information to the stakeholders through press-releases, the I-ACE Community of Practice, the project website, Facebook, LinkedIn, email messages sent to the project stakeholders, participation in conferences and other events and meetings.Given the relevance of the matters addressed by I-ACE to the civil society and to governmental institutions we expect that the products delivered by I-ACE will have a very significant impact on media. We aim to have the I-ACE project announced in the national media (TV, radio and printed press) in all partner countries.LONG TERM BENEFITSThe I-ACE project promotes inclusive school by transferring to the civil society innovative assistive technology research products that facilitate the communication between/with deaf people. I-ACE provides unique conditions to promote social inclusion, active citizenship and an improved educational experience to the European deaf community.Given our former experience with the VirtualSign impact in the Portuguese institutions related to the deaf community it is expected that the I-ACE outputs will be requested by public services, schools, museums, tourism offices, airports, police stations and many other places where fluent international communication is important.", "http://www.york.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA201-022812_5"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", 203509.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.york.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012666_coordinator"], [2016, "Fremdsprachenassistenten und Industriekaufleute EU - Kompetenz f\u00fcr Europa", "UNIVERSITY OF YORK", 88679.0, 2, 3, "For many years the Robert-Schuman-Berufskolleg in Essen has been offering, among others, a two and three-year course to become a \u201cState-qualified Commercial Assistant with Languages\u201d.

The mandatory 13-week work placement in the UK is absolved in their second year and is one of the main focal aspects of this year.\r\n\r\nGlobalization of markets in international companies makes it necessary for employees, who have comprehensive language skills at their disposal, to possess inter-cultural awareness and demonstrate a high degree of flexibility and mobility. As these requirements need to be met during the initial vocational training, the above-mentioned courses with the following objectives were introduced:\r\n- increasing language and inter-cultural skills\r\n- the application of such skills in companies in other European countries\r\n- extending communication skills as well as the ability to acquire experience of working  \r\n  internationally and being mobile\r\n\r\nAs a result, the trainees should be in a position to cope well with the increasing requirements of the job market.\r\nAll the 32 trainees will complete their work placement predominantly in small and medium-sized companies, in administrative as well as tourist businesses i.e. 18 Commercial Assistants with Languages in various European countries or respectively 14 European Business and Administration Assistants in the UK. Contracts for these placements have been concluded. This type of work placement is particularly suitable because there they can better experience how complex company operations are than in large companies. A language course together with the work placement for the European Business and Administration Assistants also improves language skills and is completed with a BEC qualification. The trainees are accommodated either with host families or in student hostels. \r\n\r\nFor both courses, the work placement abroad takes place after approx. half of the course. On the one hand, this has the advantage that the trainees have obtained considerable insight into how companies operate, as well as extensive language and commercial skills during their lessons at college. On the other hand, in the final year, they have to sit numerous final exams which certify the skills they have acquired and the relevance of the important role of their work placement abroad.\r\n\r\nAs a result it has been possible to strengthen and expand the cooperation with our numerous international partners which has developed over the years. This has led to a high degree of satisfaction for everyone involved in these work placements. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that we set great store on continuity and reliability when building up our partnerships and this is reflected in the structural growth.\r\n\r\nIt is our wish to work together with companies based in the countries whose languages are taught at our college, in companies which mainly use these languages or with whom we have been involved in international projects. In various companies, the trainees can, with skilled instruction, put into   practise and improve their foreign language skills as well as the theoretical knowledge which they have acquired. As a result of the mobility programme, the perspectives of life-long learning can be taught. Furthermore, motivation and the ability to work under pressure independently can be developed, while at the same time prejudice towards people who think and behave differently can be diminished.

First generation biorefineries, producing biofuels and bioplastics by the fermentation of sugar or starch, are seeing a rapid expansion and are adding stress to food supplies.

Conversion of these polysaccharides to sugars will provide cheap and abundant raw materials for industrial biotechnology. The use of plant biomass in this way is hampered by the high cost of saccharification due to the recalcitrance of cell walls to enzymatic hydrolysis.

Combining these approaches, we will identify new genes that can be manipulated to improve the ease and yield of biomass saccharification and will generate rational approaches for improving the quality of plant biomass as an industrial feedstock", 72953.0, 6597837.0, 7, 17, "RENEWALL", "http://www.renewall.eu/", "http://www.bioniqs.com", null, "fp7_88402_998867104"], [1359676800000, 1422662400000, "Collaboration to Clarify the Cost of Curation", "Digital Preservation Coalition Limited by Guarantee*dpc", "The Collaboration to Clarify the Costs of Curation (4C) project will help organisations across Europe to more effectively invest in digital curation and preservation. Making an investment inevitably involves a cost and existing research on cost modelling provides the starting point for the 4C work. But the point of an investment is to realise a benefit, so work on cost must also focus on benefit, which must then encompass related concepts such as 'risk', 'value', 'quality' and 'sustainability'. Organisations that understand this will be more able to effectively control and manage their digital assets over time, but they may also be able to create new cost-effective solutions and services for others.<br/>Existing research into cost modelling is far from complete and there has been little uptake of the tools and methods that have been developed and very little integration into other digital curation processes. The main objective of the 4C project is, therefore, to ensure that where existing work is relevant, that stakeholders realise and understand how to employ those resources. But the additional aim of the work is to closely examine how they might be made more fit-for-purpose, relevant and useable by a wide range of organisations operating at different scales in both the public and the private sector.<br/>These objectives will be achieved by a coordinated programme of outreach and engagement that will identify existing and emerging research and analyse user requirements. This will inform an assessment of where there are gaps in the current provision of tools, frameworks and models. The project will support stakeholders to better understand and articulate their requirements and will clarify some of the complexity of the relationships between cost and other factors. The outputs of this project will include various stakeholder engagement and dissemination events (focus groups, workshops, a conference), a series of reports, the creation of models and specifications, and the establishment of an international Curation Costs Exchange framework. All of this activity will enable the definition of a research and development agenda and a business engagement strategy which will be delivered to the European Commission in the form of a roadmap.<br/>The consortium undertaking this project includes organisations with extensive domain expertise and experience with curation cost modelling issues.

In this context, the EU has adopted ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. So far, most attention from policy makers and industry has been paid to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which intends to concentrate CO2 and store it into geological sites.\nThe current SCOT project is focusing on an emerging and insufficiently addressed area presenting strong research, market development and economic growth potential: the recycling / utilization of CO2 through its transformation into valuable products via chemical or biological technologies. In addition to reducing net CO2 emissions, this approach brings the benefit of reducing the consumption of non-renewable resources. Indeed, CO2 is no longer considered as a waste but as an efficient resource enabling industries to:\n- reduce dependency on fossil fuels and primary raw materials for the production of industrial and transportation fuels, basic chemicals, and building materials;\n- increase the use of renewable energies from intermittent sources (e.g. solar, photovoltaic, or wind) by providing a solution for electricity storage, via the conversion of CO2 into gaseous or liquid fuels in periods where potential production exceeds demand on the grid and would otherwise be wasted.\nSCOT is the first ever European initiative in the field of CO2 recycling / utilization.\nThrough a stronger coordination of efforts among the consortium, the SCOT project will enable to:\n- define a Strategic European Research Agenda aimed at developing new breakthrough solutions and market applications\n- attract additional EU clusters, regions and investors to participate to multi-disciplinary research programmes and other collaborative actions defined in a Joint Action Plan\n- propose structural policy measures to favour the transition to a new European society based on the paradigm of \u201cCO2-as-a-resource\u201d, thereby significantly improving the EU\u2019s overall competitive position and environmental performance on the international scene.", 12947.0, 1850832.0, 5, 11, "SCOT", null, "http://www.lowcarbonfutures.org", null, "fp7_111299_972822313"]]}}, "5GA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Industry 4.0 for wood and furniture manufacturers", "OCCUPATIONAL AWARDS LIMITED", 951091.0, 5, 13, "The furniture and woodworking sectors can benefit from the advantages that Industry 4.0 brings. However, as other traditional sectors, these show a shortage of professionals with high qualification in ICTs and other emerging technologies. Some of the specific skills and competencies that stand out as critical for managers in the furniture sector are ICTs skills that are crucial to operate in a modern business environment.Under this context, the In4Wood alliance is working towards the design, development andrecognition of a Joint Curriculum for filling the skills gaps of productions managers and CEOS of such industries in those relevant Key Enabling Technologies (hereinafter, KETs) from the Industry 4.0. With the support of the the Sector Skills Alliances action from the Erasmus+ programme.Being the project objectives clearly aligned with both the needs of the sector in terms ofsustainability and the main aims of the participant institutions, In4Wood is composed byassociation and bodies representing the furniture and woodworking industries, educationalinstitutions from regions highly influenced by such sectors, authorities in the field of Labour and Vocational Education and Training from Spain, Italy, Germany and UK, and one federation representing regional development agencies from all Europe.During the 1st period of the project, this Sector Skills Alliance has worked in developing a deep desk research and thorough consultation to deliver a clear analysis of the skills needs in the field of Industry 4.0 within the addressed sectors, where sectorial, educational and ICT experts were involved. Results from this first stage were used for building up a common curriculum proposal for manufacturers of smart furniture factories.

As a consequence, recruitment difficulties have arisen, especially for high-level, food science and technology roles. Moreover, employers and experts feel that young people are often ill-prepared and are not sufficiently focused on the development of skills that are required in the workplace.In the field of food quality, safety and defence assurance, tests still rely on traditional laboratory analyses as well as on personnel expertise. However, new inspection technologies have been developed with great potential to be transferred to the food sector, such as: optical spectroscopy, X-ray radiology, gas sensing, and biosensors. Unfortunately, very few of them have been introduced neither in industry nor in educational and training programmes.The objective of UPDATEST is to bridge this transnational gap by increasing the knowledge, competences and skills on new technologies for food quality, safety and defence assurance in FDMP industries. The target group of the project comprises initial and continuing vocational education and training students, such as: students in the initial education system; individuals entering a job at an entry-level position; and food industry professionals who have already gained experience in the labour market. These people are recognised as being capable of, firstly, assessing both in-place and alternative, technological solutions to address food quality, safety and defence issues; and, secondly, influencing decision-makers and so bringing about change in their organisations. As a result, the project will contribute to the transformation of the EU FDMP industry in the short-medium term and in line with the Commission\u2019s priorities.The consortium consists of a Spanish technology centre (AINIA), a UK sector skills council (NSAFD), a Spanish federation of food associations (FEDACOVA), an Italian federation of food associations (FEDSERV), and a Greek university (Agricultural University of Athens, AUA).The work plan to achieve the project objective has been structured into six activities (A1 - A6). A validation analysis will be performed in A1 by surveying 100 stakeholders from FDMP industries, technological research institutes, VET centres, and academia. On the basis of the analysis, the learning programmes guidelines will be produced. These documents will be used in A2 to select potential participants for the courses (teachers and students; researchers and technology providers; and trainers and staff members of FDMP industries); and to produce the materials for the in-person and on-line courses. Both programmes will be evaluated through the execution of 2 pilot courses for 50 IVET and CVET students in A3. The goal will be to extract valuable information to improve the quality of the generated guidelines and materials. Additionally, three horizontal activities have been devised to take care of communication and dissemination (A4); exploitation and sustainability (A5); and management activities (A6).The three main outcomes (identified as intellectual outputs) that will be produced by the project are explained in more detail as follows:\u2022 The guidelines of the learning programmes. They will be produced on the grounds of the initial (academic, VET and industrial) gap analysis. The resulting documents will assist teachers and staff of learning centres in their planning for the introduction of the new courses.\u2022 Support materials for the in-person programme. The courses will aim at giving a general, practical outline of new food inspection technologies. The materials inventory might consist of: publications, brochures, showcases, presentations and/or lectures, among others.\u2022 Support materials for the e-learning programme. The courses will be based on an easy-to-follow decision tree and will aim at guiding users to a set of resources tailored to fit their specific needs. The materials inventory might consist of: open-source, e-learning platform, videos, links to internet-based resources, virtual instruments and on-line questionnaires.It is important for the consortium to ensure that the project results will be used beyond the lifetime of the project in order to contribute to the sustainability of UPDATEST.
