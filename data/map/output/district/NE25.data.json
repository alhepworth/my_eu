Staff will network with their fellow teachers in a cross curricular and supportive manner. Careful monitoring of progress with a robus, fair and equitable eward system will ensure that all pupils will make progress regardless of their gender, background, disability or special need. \r\nThe principal objectives include; encouraging children to use physical education, sport and cross curricular outdoor learning as a tool to motivate them to express themselves and be more confident and competent with speaking, reading and writing, Strategies will be put in place to encourage greater engagement from boys, particularly in writing.  It will also provide many opportunities for pupils to be encouraged to follow an active lifestyle, promoting their language and celebrate their own partnership member's sporting culture and heritage and share it with partner countries developing skills in creative cross curricular ways with particular focus on ICT and also to build bridges, and break down barriers between European partners. This project will have a major impact on the pupils' self confidence, self-esteem and interpersonal skills. This strategic partnership will create a strong relationship between the schools involved in the project. It will provide all participants with the opportunity to share innovative teaching methodologies and will fully involve staff, pupils, parents, governors and the much wider community. The main aim of the project is to enlighten participants and the whole local community about the role of physical education, sport and cross-curricular outdoor learning in enhancing basic language and communication skills. We will aim to promote young people's social inclusion and well-being by providing equity and inclusion of disadvantaged participants involved in the project , SEN pupils, those students with learning difficulties,  young people with poor school performance will be provided with stimulating differentaited tasks so that they can achieve and gain enjoyment. Good practices and innovation will be prevalent in this project. There will be mutual respect for partners and each country's expertise in the many areas of the curriculum, in particular, ICT will be harnessed for the benefit of pupils, staff and the schools. We will cooperate with the NGOs, local formal and informal institutions, school's PTA, schools in the local area disseminating the effects and results of the project.\r\nAll participants will be aware of the many benefits of regular exercise whilst at the same time learning how they can become more confident in their literacy classes.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\nAll partners will work collaboratively throughout  the 3 years of the project. A comprehensive resource bank and stimulating ideas around the development of language skills will be incorporated into a Language Learning website. This will be accessible to all.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that moving to music (developing hand-eye coordination) prior to the commencement of lessons has a dramatic effect on the brain. With this in mind it is for sure that the students will enjoy compiling a series of progressive exercises to be uploaded on to a DVD. This resource can then be shared among partners and the wider community. With sports leaders from each partner school leading fellow pupils through these exercises there is so much scope for them to also develop their language skills\r\n\r\nUltimately all pupils will make gains academically and they will gain in confidence. This will prepare them well for future employment.", "http://www.valleygardensmiddle.org", "Valley Gardens Middle School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013738_coordinator"]]}}}}
