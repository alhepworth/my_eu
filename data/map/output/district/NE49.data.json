Unfortunately, harvesting this reservoir  is difficult, because useful candidates are rare and hidden in an overwhelming majority of irrelevant genes. Screening campaigns of metagenomic libraries thus require massive capital-expenditure for robotic systems and much manpower, making them expensive, slow and available to very few users. To enable valorisation of the potential of the metagenome, this project assembles an interdisciplinary and intersectoral consortium that will integrate a range of technologies into a platform designed to beat the odds of identifying library hits faster, more efficiently and by a wider user base. Exploration and exploitation of the metagenome will be made faster and more successful by (i) ultrahigh-throughput screening in picoliter droplets that dramatically lowers the cost per assay to well below 0.01 cents and allows throughput of 10e7 assays per hour; (ii) workflows that streamline and increase the yield of library construction and functional expression and (iii) workflows for efficient bioinformatic analysis of hits based on user-friendly software solutions for metagenome analysis. Emphasis is put on technologies that are straightforwardly implemented in non-specialist labs, maximising the impact of METAFLUIDICS.

Chemical oxidation is both hazardous and has high environment impacts. Many oxidative bio-catalytic reactions and transformations have been identified in academic laboratories but only a very small number have been applied by industry to oxidize non-natural substrates.\nHence biocatalysis for oxidative chemical manufacture processes can deliver a major advantage to the European chemical-using industries and the environment. In this project we intend to develop the tools for implementation of bio-oxidation to synthesize and oxidize alcohols.\nCytochrome P450 enzymes will be investigated for hydroxylation of fatty acid derivatives and terpenes which have potential to be used in biopolymers and fragrance chemicals respectively form one line of investigation. The second is the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to give products with added value in their own right and as intermediates towards other valuable products.\nTo support the implementation culture collections and literature reported DNA sequences will be used to identify diverse enzymes with predicted oxidase activities, which will be used as starting point for an enzyme improvement program. Then fermentation and enzyme formulation techniques will improve reaction performance to a level where useful quantities of target products can be produced for evaluation by industrial partners, and engineering techniques will analyse and implement reactor configurations that will further improve this technology platform to enable this technology to be introduced as a routine technology in the IB industry and support the European KBBE.\nFurther a dynamic public engagement and dissemination program will be used to promote the project, IB and the FP7 program within the science community and the public, especially schoolchildren, to create extra value for the funders.", 352951.0, 5945848.0, 6, 12, "BIOOX", null, "http://www.prozomix.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163340.jpg", "fp7_110259_986590396"], [1427846400000, 1553990400000, "Sustainable industrial processes based on a C-C bond-forming enzyme platform", "Prozomix Limited", "C-C bond forming reactions are at the heart of industrial organic synthesis, but remain largely unexplored due to long development timelines and the lack of broad biocatalytic reaction platforms.

The proposed consortium, with 50% industrial participation, represents academia but also commercial interests in different stages of the research-to-market process. This top-down approach, together with a life-cycle innovation approach ensures an industrial drive to the project.\nClearly aligned with the scope of topic BIOTEC3-2014, CARBAZYMES will pursue the biocatalytic synthesis (spanning TRLs 5-7) of 4 APIs and 3 bulk chemicals \u2013corresponding to market needs detected by the industrial partners in the Consortium. This will be accomplished through an inter-disciplinary approach which includes: i) a broad platform of 4 types of unique C-C bond-forming enzymes, mostly lyases; ii) the capacity to rapidly evolve enzymes to operate under industrial conditions by means of novel enzyme panels and massive screening methods; iii) application of microreactor technology for bioprocess characterization; iv) demonstration actions comprising technical (up to 100L) and economic viability studies carried out by industrial partners.\nCARBAZYMES unmistakably aims to have social and economic impact by addressing markets worth bn \u20ac, developing enzyme evolution technologies beyond the state of the art and creating qualified jobs and technical-scale facilities at the industrial partners\u2019 sites.

We will then apply synthetic biology to improve fermentation processes in order to generate better enzymes.  Chiral compounds are an important class of chemicals that biocatalytic transformation has already demonstrated great potential to compete with chemocatalysts in their production with associated benefits that come from reductions in use of organic solvents, toxic metals and energy but application has been relatively limited.

It is expected that promising candidate chemicals will be commercialised within three years of completion and so scale up with economic and feasibility studies that are also key technology developments.\nThe consortium includes a strong presence of SMEs including SME leadership and also a large multinational company which ensures multiple routes to market for the outcomes of this project.

Complex, distinctive changes occur in the glycomics profiles or - Glycan Signatures - of human glycoproteins during progression of many chronic diseases including cancer and inflammatory conditions. The three beneficiaries of the GlySign Consortium have been instrumental in contributing to knowledge in this field through development of glycomics technology and discovery of clinically important novel glycan biomarkers in a variety of diseases. \nGlycan signatures have great potential for adding useful diagnostic and prognostic information in PM. However, advancement of this field is slow because (a) glycans have immense structural complexity resulting in major technical challenges for their analysis and (b) there is a lack of experts with required glycoanalytical skills. GlySign will address this gap by training six young scientists within an innovative training-by-research programme with high industrial-academic mobility to eventually push forward the translation of novel glycomics-based diagnostic tools into clinical practice. This will be achieved by further developing a range of selective and sensitive glycomics technologies for the analysis of samples from patients and healthy controls in close collaboration between industry/academia as well as clinical chemists and clinicians who will be the end users of GlySign\u2019s final products.
