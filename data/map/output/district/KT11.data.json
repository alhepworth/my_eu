Attend regular classes (Intensive group classes) - 4 hours a day -  in Spanish at level A of the European framework. This will not only enhance my fluency and competence in Spanish but will also make clear to me what teaching methods are most effective.\r\n2. Observation of Spanish teachers at the language school. This will help me to work out what methods to use with my students. I\r\nI hope to learn new ideas/methods for teaching the language and grammar.\r\n3. In addition to the group classes, I will also have 1 hour a day of individual one-to-one lessons with a Spanish teacher where I will explore teaching methodology for teaching a) tenses, b) ser & estar,  c) irregular verbs.

At the very early response stages voice communications are critical, after which non-voice communications are an important requirement dependent on the nature of the disaster.\nAs most mobile telecommunications networks located in a disaster area are designed to support normal traffic loads, they will not have the capacity to provide effective PPDR communications. As disasters require effective co-ordination, support and communication between all agencies involved, it would be ideal if one communication solution could be provided to meet all needs.  Radio communications networks used by public safety and the emergency services will normally be used to provide Public Protection.  Most public safety organisations have the capability to rapidly deploy mobile communications network elements to provide additional capacity and/or maintain communications if the main network fails. As the trend in parts of Europe is to allow non-public safety organisations that could be involved in major emergencies and disasters to operate on the same networks as used by public safety organisations, it is reasonable that provision could be made on these networks to Disaster Relief (DR) agencies.\nThe goal of PPDR-TC is to specify an interoperable, secure and resilient voice and data communications architecture, tailored specifically for the needs of the PPDR community. It will provide the foundation for the evolution of mission critical communications. PPDR-TC will address both mission critical and non-mission critical situations in an integrated and uniform way.

However, data sources are typically fragmented and contain information gaps which prevent their full exploitation. EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access.
