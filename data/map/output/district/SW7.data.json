The works selected for this project have been carefully picked due to their exceptional literary merit, and fit into Fitzcarraldo Editions' commitment to take risks on publishing only literary works of the highest quality, where other publishers do not. By building a larger readership for work that might be rejected by mainstream publishing houses due to size or length or supposed \u2018difficulty\u2019, we hope to introduce a host of \u2018literary\u2019 writers writing in other languages to a British and Irish audience and thereby to fill a gap in a publishing market where only 4 per cent of books published annually are in translation. For this project, Fitzcarraldo Editions will work with some of the best and most experienced literary translators working today to ensure that the excellence of the original texts is matched in the English language. The translators involved are Jennifer Croft, Paul Russell Garrett, Antonia Lloyd-Jones, Damion Searls and Frank Wynne.

However, to exploit this potential, a method for direct conversion of spin information into an electric signal is indispensable. Spin-charge conversion in inorganic semiconductors and metals has mainly relied on the spin-orbit interaction, a fundamental relativistic effect which couples the motion of electrons to their spins. The spin-orbit interaction causes a flow of spins, a spin current, to induce an electric field perpendicular to both the spin polarization and the flow direction of the spin current. This is called the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). We have very recently been able to observe for the first time the inverse spin-Hall effect in an organic conductor. This breakthrough raises important questions for our understanding of spin-charge conversion in materials with intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling.

However, some pathogens evade antibody responses by rapidly changing their composition. Designing vaccines that elicit antibody responses against invariant parts of the pathogen is a rational strategy to combat existing and emerging pathogens. Production of antibodies is initiated by binding of B cell receptors (BCRs) to foreign antigens presented on the surfaces of antigen presenting cells. This binding induces B cell signalling and internalisation of the antigens for presentation to helper T cells. Although it is known that T cell help controls B cell expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting and memory B cells, how the strength of antigen binding to the BCR regulates antigen internalisation remains poorly understood. As a result, the response and the affinity maturation of individual B cell clones are difficult to predict, posing a problem for the design of next-generation vaccines. My aim is to develop an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that underlie critical B cell activation steps. My laboratory has recently described that B cells use mechanical forces to extract antigens from antigen presenting cells. We hypothesise that application of mechanical forces tests BCR binding strength and thereby regulates B cell clonal selection during antibody affinity maturation and responses to pathogen evasion. We propose to test this hypothesis by (1) determining the magnitude and timing of the forces generated by B cells, and (2) determining the role of the mechanical properties of BCR-antigen bonds in affinity maturation and (3) in the development of broadly neutralising antibodies.

At the molecular level, the memory of these events is laid down in a complex layer of epigenetic modifications at both the DNA and the chromatin level. Unidirectional character of the developmental progress dictates that the key acquired epigenetic modifications are stable and inherited through subsequent cell divisions.

Whilst I will lead this grant and the research within it, the proposed innovations are truly multidisciplinary in nature and will be accelerated towards clinical translation through the numerous clinical, scientific and industrial collaborations that I have established.", 1646552.0, 1646552.0, 1, 1, "Naturale CG", null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "fp7_185628_999993468"], [1401580800000, 1559260800000, "Systems Medical Diagnostics by In-vivo Ambient Mass Spectrometric Profiling of Tissue Lipidome", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "'The objective of the proposal is the development of ambient mass spectrometric methods for the characterisation of mucosal metabolome and lipidome. While recent advent of ambient MS provided new means for in-situ and imaging analyses and led to the development of real-time, in-vivo MS characterisation of tissues, there are no methods available for minimally invasive testing of mucosal surfaces including the associated microflora. Human mucosa-associated microbiome (with special emphasis on the gastrointestinal microbiota) has been recently demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of localised (cancer, chronic inflammatory disease) and systemic (hypertension, diabetes, obesity) conditions. While the microbiota interacts with the host mostly via production of a variety of metabolites, currently there is no method available for the in-situ metabolic profiling of mucosa. The envisioned methods will presumably fill this gap, by providing a technique for the diagnosis of a wide range of diseases ranging from acute infections through cancer to dysbiotic conditions of the microflora leading to chronic illnesses.\nIn the current proposal we put forward the development of different ambient ionisation setups utilising Jet Desorption Ionisation, Sonic Spray Ionisation and Rapid Evaporation Ionisation MS covering a broad range of invasiveness. We plan to combine the methods with standard endoscopic tools and develop the concept of \u00b4chemically aware\u00b4 or intelligent endoscopic device capable of the unambiguous identification of pathological conditions of the mucosa. Since the metabolic profile-based identification approach requires large authentic datasets, we plan to create both histopathological and bacterial spectral databases with histological and 16SrRNA-based validation.

They display a characteristically \u2018compressed\u2019 cell cycle in which G1 is shortened, contain a high proportion of cells in DNA synthesis (S)-phase and lack several cell cycle checkpoints. This unusual cell cycle signature is important for maintaining their identity since cell cycle arrest, or lengthening, results in irreversible differentiation, and somatic cells assume this unusual signature when successfully reprogrammed.\n\nWe have shown that ES and EG cells rapidly convert somatic cells towards pluripotency in transient heterokaryons, and this can be enhanced by genetic modification or using ES cells enriched at G2-phase. On the other hand, mouse epiblast stem (EpiS) and ES cells that lack specific repressor activities (such as Polycomb) although pluripotent, do notdominantly convert somatic cells and show increased doubling times. To determine the importance of cell cycle control for pluripotent self-renewal, we have optimised elutriation to allow the isolation of ES, EG and EpiS cells at progressive stages of the cell cycle. Pilot studies show changes in the levels of modified histones as ES cells transit the cell cycle, and increased levels of specific reprogramming factors during G2-phase. We will extend these analyses genome wide (using ChIP and RNA Seq, and high throughput proteomics) and use fluorescent microscopy to document changes in chromatin dynamics during ES cell cycle, and during somatic cell reprogramming. This will be achieved using novel micro-fluidic approaches to generate heterokaryons between ES, EG, EpiS and lymphocytes. The importance of cell cycle stage and its relevance during early events in successful reprogramming will be tested in heterokaryon and hybrid assays using conditional mutant cells, RNAi-based approaches and cell cycle inhibitors to block critical components.", 1635389.0, 1635389.0, 1, 1, "REPLENICHE", null, "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/", null, "fp7_102958_999993468"], [1393632000000, 1551312000000, "Gravity, Black Holes and Strongly Coupled Quantum Matter", "Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine", "States of matter in which the interactions between the microscopic constituents are both strong and quantum mechanical lie at the frontier of our understanding of nature. Such states appear in a wide variety of settings including high temperature superconductors, gases of cold atoms and the quark- gluon plasma created in the high-energy collisions of nuclei. Understanding the properties of such strongly coupled quantum matter poses huge conceptual challenges because standard perturbative techniques break down at strong coupling. In a remarkable development, the mathematical framework of string theory has provided a fundamentally new way to study strongly coupled quantum field theories using a dual, weakly coupled gravitational description. Furthermore, this duality states that the phase structure of the quantum field at finite temperature is precisely described by black hole geometries. The principal thrust of the proposal is to develop our understanding of these gravitational techniques in order to make contact with real world systems, particularly in condensed matter physics.\n\nThe proposal focuses on four main topics in this emerging, rapidly developing and interdisciplinary field. The first is to extend our understanding of known strongly coupled quantum critical ground states using gravitational solutions and also to search for new ones. The second is to map out the phase structure of strongly coupled quantum field theories at finite temperature by constructing a wide variety of new black hole solutions.

Such a system is still fragmented and requires to undergo a deep process of modernization, in order to tackle an increasing intra-EU innovation divide.\r\nIn this effort, mobility plays a pivotal role pooling competences and resources without draining local and regional knowledge ecosystems. However, mobility goes beyond the transnational dimension. Indeed borders and divides are not just geographical, but can be clearly observed along other dimensions.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the EU paradox, it has been already emphasized the divide between the academic and the business/social sectors (sectoral divide). From another perspective, due to intra and inter-organizational barriers in HEIs, there is a need to tackle the divide between diverse knowledge domains (disciplinary divide). Thirdly, the need to conjugate efficiency with efficacy requires to explore smart combinations of both digital and face to face education.\r\nThe C-Extended aims at contributing to the EU effort in overcoming boundaries in HE, exploring mobility opportunities going a step further than those focused on geographical barriers. It views mobility also as that occurring from theory to practice (intersectoral) and theory to theory (interdisciplinary) while exploring new opportunities to conjugate the needs for effective physical presence with that of efficiency by means of digital technologies (blending).\r\nSuch a vision is here addressed, more specifically, by designing, testing, monitoring and evaluating an Interdisciplinary/Intersectoral/Blended-Mobility Scheme targeted to master level students in a core scientific domain (in our pilot ICT related) whom are offered to undergo, transnationally, an interdisciplinary pathway (here either energy-climate or socio-economic), engaging also in an intersectoral experience while exploiting blended learning opportunities. \r\nMore generally, the objective is to propose to policy makers a novel pathway in reforming higher education enabling new forms of intersectoral and interdisciplinary dialogues and cooperation between societal actors from the business, public and social sectors while fostering a stronger collaboration and sharing best practice within and across HEIs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed scheme will be targeted to master level students (30 in the current testing) in a core scientific domain (in our pilot ICT related) whom are offered to undergo, transnationally, an interdisciplinary pathway (here either energy-climate or socio-economic), engaging also in an intersectoral experience while exploiting blended learning opportunities. \r\nIn terms of activities, the project will design, develop and disseminate six intellectual outputs, being the key one the Interdisciplinary Intersectoral Blended Mobility Scheme (IIBMS). On the base of these outputs, learning activities are envisioned to implement the proposed mobility scheme with selected participants across the countries of the 6 partner HEIs. In particular the participants will engage in three main learning activities:\r\n\r\n1) interdisciplinary modules during standard Erasmus+ mobility scheme at participating HEIs (host universities). These are 6 per each of the 2 interdisciplinary pathways;\r\n2) blended learning activities in their home universities for the newly developed interdisciplinary modules before and after the physical mobility;\r\n3) interdisciplinary and intersectoral placement in an organization embedded in the local ecosystem of host universities relying on the project\u2019s mobility funding for up to 2 months.\r\n\r\nMethodologically, the project will rely on a mix of methods each able to match specific requirement, ranging from top-down analysis to guide the development of the proposed mobility schemes, to bottom-up through a constant monitoring, evaluation and assessment of the project development, based on the acquisition of both quantitative and qualitative data.\r\nIn terms of main results, besides the tangible outputs and the actual testing of the scheme, the project aims at disseminating and extending these results to new HEIs as well as new HE networks, both in the ICT field and in other core scientific domains. \r\nAs for the impact, the C-Extended Strategic Partnership aims to contribute towards bringing mobility schemes a step further, providing to regional, national and EU policy makers evidence based recommendations that could feed into the reflection on the evolution of successful instruments such as the Erasmus+/Erasmus Mundus or the EIT.

The main target group of the IPs comprises 60 (2x30/IP) students from MSc (BAC + 4 years higher education graduate students) and PhD study programmes related to EBS subject, from the partner universities. A broader target group will be addressed by the dissemination activity, especially by the conferences to be organized after each IP. This group includes at least 100 young teachers, researchers, specialists from industry and governmental organizations, active in the field of EBS. The main activities of the project will consist in: 2x10 days intensive study programmes (one IP/year, during two years); 2 multiplier events (one international conference/year, during two years and one international workshop) that will bring together a minimum of 100 participants/event, national and transnational specialists from the academia, industry, research institutes, and governmental organizations; 4 transnational project meetings and numerous dissemination activities. The main beneficiaries of the IPs will be the participating students.

Our target product is a disposable device for monitoring cardiovascular health - an EU-wide healthcare priority. To date Microfluidic (or Lab-on-a-Chip) devices have not been well suited to point-of-care applications. Although the chips themselves are cheap and small, they must generally be used in conjunction with bulky optical light-sources and detectors. The lack of an integrated, versatile detection scheme is a major obstacle to the deployment of portable diagnostic devices. Consortium partners have demonstrated that integration of organic diodes and photodetectors is a viable route to meet this need. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a radically new generation of devices, in which organic photonic field-effect transistors are used for both light generation and detection. The use of transistors in place of diodes has four principle benefits. Firstly they can be pre-fabricated on the substrate (the microfluidic chip), ensuring optimal registration between the organic photonic components and the underlying fluidic architecture. Secondly the devices can be completed by depositing a single layer of organic semiconductor followed by the gate electrode, thus avoiding the need for complex multilayered structures. Thirdly in-plane light generation by the transistors provides improved optical coupling into wave-guiding structures, leading to significant performance gains. And fourthly current-multiplying auxiliary transistors can also be included thereby enabling immediate amplification of the signal at the point-of-generation.

The Mathilde-Weber Vocational College in T\u00fcbingen promotes the said project and has been engaged in annually implementing occupational mobility since 2003. The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part. Participants are involved in all aspects of  procedure within the partner setting and take on responsibility for their own  personal activities and for tasks within the group.\r\n\r\nThe project is planned to comprise 46 participants who in September/October 2015 or September/October 2016 will travel abroad as members of two separate groups. At the time in question, they will be in their third year of training  and will have gained practical experience during work placements and will have a grounding in  professional skills which will be enhanced by the occupational mobility project.     \r\nInter-cultural experience gained during work placement abroad also promotes an improvement in the quality of early years care and education. Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period. During the \u2018Education in Europe\u2019 lesson, they deal with various aspects of cultural diversity, prejudice and the experience of foreignness. They research other European countries and their corresponding educational systems and also address the curricculum for children under six in diverse countries. In further lessons, they learn songs, games and finger rhymes in other languages and experience picture books from the country to which they will travel. They study the importance of social skills to successful life within the community , receive encouragement in and exercises for observing individual social skills and develop ideas and methods with which to further social competence. In addition, they are prepared for the placement abroad through conversation sessions held in the relevant language.  \r\n\r\nEvery participant is visited in their work placement setting by a member of staff from the Mathilde-Weber College. In addition, an assessment is made in the group of participants in which the participant is working with the teacher in attendance. It is a matter of principle that regular contact is sustained between student and college during the entire work placement. Upon return, experience made is assessed and evaluated in a number of ways. ( questionnaires, discussion groups, in-lesson conversation, documentation). The results are then presented to other college classes, members of staff in early childhood settings and at external information events, both locally and regionally.    \r\nIncreased personal competence  such as independence, trust in onesself and self confidence is expected as a result . Furthermore, openness, tolerance, the ability to reflect and deliberate and flexibility, all of which will have a positive effect on further studies and future work placement. It is expected that concrete experience is made and a solid understanding gained in professional and methodical areas of practice.

Hence, the \u201cage of migrations\u201d that MeLa adopts as its framework reflects a set of global processes that do not only involve the transnationalization of labor, but also the refashioning of the cultural and political spheres under the impact of today\u2019s global mobility. In this context, the main objective of MeLa is to define innovative museum practices that reflect the challenges of the contemporary processes of globalization, mobility and migration. To succeed in its intentions MeLa will devise strategies for museums to enhance the European cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, and turn it into an effective agent of shared forms of citizenship and identity building. At the core of the MeLa research, in fact, lies the idea that shared values, memories and identities can drive a change in European museums and turn them into crucial venues for the contemporary age of migrations. This process implies a redefinition of the museums\u2019 ways of organizing and representing their collections in order to encompass a complex variety of voices and subjects. This strategy brings out the concepts of multiplicity (of voices, points of view, theories, etc.) and hybridity (of forms and physical expressions in architecture and exhibition settings) that operate in contemporary culture, and exploits them to create truly democratic forms of European citizenship.\nOn an operative level, MeLa is characterized by an innovative research methodology that entails the use of both traditional and experimental research tools, like brainstorming sessions, \u201cresearch by art\u201d and \u201cresearch by design\u201d activities.

Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy.

Disruption of cell signalling pathways that dynamically regulate the cytoskeleton underlie the altered migratory potential of tumour cells. Rho family GTPases are major regulators of the cytoskeleton dynamics during cell migration. They are regulated by activators: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that stimulate GTP binding and in-activators the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). There are approximately 85 GEFs and 75 GAPs of which very little is known regarding their role in the regulation of migration machinery.

To this end, cell subpopulations with bi-lineage progenitor features will be isolated from basal-like (normal and tumourigenic) breast cell lines and their ability to conduct complete myoepithelial differentiation will be tested. The differentiation process will be further characterized by gene expression profiling in order to identify novel candidate genes involved in this process. The results obtained will be translated to the study of human breast cancer by two complementary approaches: (i) in silico analysis of gene expression data from basal-like tumours, (ii) immunohistochemical studies in normal and tumour breast samples. Finally, in vitro and in vivo functional studies will be performed to further define the role of candidate genes in myoepithelial differentiation.   As cancer stem cells are suggested to be resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for tumour recurrence, the possibility to differentiate basal (stem cell-like) carcinoma cells into myoepithelial cells would open new potential avenues for the therapy of these aggressive cancers.", 146640.0, 146640.0, 1, 1, "BASAL BREAST CANCER", null, "http://www.icr.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-02/45676.jpg", "fp7_88702_999460841"], [1430438400000, 1493510400000, "RNA Polymerase III Rpc4/Rpc5 subcomplex and Selenocysteine tRNA transcription", "Institute of Cancer Research - Royal Cancer Hospital", "In higher eukaryotes, the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) participates in the transcription of small RNAs such as the tRNAs. RNA polymerase recruitment to their specific promoter relies on the activity of several transcription factors. Brf2 is a transcription factor that exclusively recruits RNA Pol III at the selenocysteine tRNA (tRNASec). Unpublished work from our group has unravelled an unanticipated central role of Brf2 in the oxidative stress response pathway, by acting as a cellular blockade during prolonged oxidative stress.\nWe are interested in understanding the molecular determinants that govern RNA Pol III recruitment at tRNASec promoter and its interaction with Brf2-bound promoters. In general, RNA Pol III subunit\u2019s size is conserved amongst the eukaryotic kingdom. However, an exception is the human Rpc5 subunit, whose C terminus has 450 residues that are not present in its yeast counterpart C37. Similarly to Brf2, the Rpc5 C-terminal extension is only present in higher metazoans, which suggests a phylogenetic link between these two proteins. The recruiting mechanism of RNA Pol III to Brf2-dependent promoters has not been described to date. Preliminary results in our lab provide evidences that indeed Rpc5 C terminus is responsible for the accurate recruitment of RNA Pol III at TBP/Brf2/DNA complex. Interestingly, structural homology predictions indicated that the human Rpc5 C-terminal extension is a eukaryotic homologue of the prokaryotic protein SelB, a factor that interacts with the tRNASec and with a specific region of mRNAs, the SECIS-element, during translation of SeCys containing proteins. This similarity suggests a regulatory role for Rpc5 C terminus in the interaction with the SECIS-element and/or the tRNASec.\nOur main objectives are to determine the structure of the Rpc5 C terminus in isolation and in complex with Brf2/TBP/DNA by X-ray crystallography and to characterise the role of Rpc5 C terminus in the context of tRNASec transcription.", 144311.0, 144311.0, 1, 1, "Human Rpc5", null, "http://www.icr.ac.uk", null, "h2020_195075_999460841"], [1243814400000, 1354233600000, "Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone treatments in Europe", "Institute of Cancer Research - Royal Cancer Hospital", "Recombinant growth hormone (GH) has been used since 1985.

ADPr can be attached either as a single moiety or as chains forming poly-ADPr polymers (pADPr). The best-studied member of the ARTD/PARP family is ARTD1/PARP1, a DNA nick sensor enzyme that is activated following DNA damage. ARTD1/PARP1 is able to pARylate itself and a number of other protein targets, such as histones and DNA repair proteins, modulating their activity. Another member of this super-family is the telomeric ARTD/PARP, Tankyrase 1 (ARTD5/TNKS1), which plays an important role in maintaining telomere integrity, by pARylating its telomere partner, TRF1.  Since the discovery that defects in homologous recombination sensitise cancer cells to PARP inhibitors there has been a renewed interest in ARTD/PARPs as attractive therapeutic targets. Furthermore, similarly to kinases and phosphorylation it seems likely that ARTD/PARPs and pARylation will have significant roles in the controls of a diverse range of cellular mechanisms.

As people move eastwards and northwards increasing diversification is seen in their stone and bone tool industries which indicate human development. This project examines whether climate a) drove the human dispersal and development, b) played a more indirect role, or c) was of little significance to humans at this time. State-of-the-art scientific techniques (radiocarbon dating, DNA, stable isotope, clumped isotope and charcoal ring width analyses) will be used to create integrated chronological, palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological frameworks that are directly linked to the Late and Final Palaeolithic archaeological record. Temporal and spatial trends in climate change, prey abundance and behaviour, and technological development will be compared and considered in light of regional and global climate trends and archaeological evidence for hunting strategies, human mobility and landscape use.

This newly discovered major lineage has demanded i) that the new family is thoroughly characterized and understood in the broader context of amphibian evolution, ii) that the generality of the historical biogeography of Chikilidae is tested using independent but broadly similar lineages, and iii) that the environmental and biological history of NEI is reassessed, especially the implications for recognising biogeographic units and demarcating hotspots.\n\nThe applicant will address these issues by a) analysing the internal anatomy, life-history, distribution and genetic variation of Chikilidae in a comparative context, b) inferring the phylogeny and biogeographic history of two other soil-dwelling vertebrates with overlapping distributions \u2013 ichthyophiid amphibians and swamp eels, and c) determining to what extent the two lineages resemble Chikilidae in having radiated in NEI for a long period.\n\nThe applicant is a world expert on NEI and Indian amphibians.

Myxozoa demonstrate perhaps the most extreme example of simplification known to date, lacking a nervous system, gonads, cilia and centrioles. Differing degrees of simplification within the group provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the genetic and developmental bases of morphological simplification in a comparative approach. The myxozoan Buddenbrockia plumatellae forms muscular worms with a polarised body plan while the very closely related Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae occurs as simple, unpolarised sacs.

They play a key role in the global carbon cycle as a pump of  inorganic carbon to the deep ocean and to the sediment, and are responsible for a considerable part of the ocean/atmosphere exchange of climate relevant gases (CO2, DMS). In the context of global climate change, and especially ocean acidification, understanding the role of  plankton in modulating oceanic biogeochemistry has become a critical interdisciplinary research priority, with the need of developing reliable quantitative knowledge of  the biogeography and ecology of key groups at oceanic scale. COMBINE specifically aims (a) to develop modern techniques for accurate coccolithophore biodiversity assessment, (b) to apply them within the AMT program to produce a high quality reference database on Atlantic coccolithophore biogeography, (c) to use this database to produce reliable data on the autecology of key species, i.e. their affinities with physico-chemical parameters like temperature and pCO2, and (d) to use/develop a molecular genetic tool (COD-FISH) to investigate the ecology of haploid and diploid phases of the life-cycle of common coccolithophore species. Overall this will both develop our understanding of coccolithophore ecology at species-level and produce a robust quantitative model of their biogeography through the Atlantic, which will help predicting their role as booster/reducer of global warming and ocean acidification. COMBINE will be conducted at the NHM, London where the necessary instrumentation, expertise and AMT samples are available, and will involve the CEREGE, Aix en Provence and the SB, Roscoff for automatic coccolith recognition and coccolithophore genetics expertise.

As a first step towards a modern treatment of these extraordinary ray-finned fishes, the present project will provide an up-to-date taxonomic analysis of the family Polypteridae incorporating for the first time all major museum holdings in Europe and the rest of the world. In a second step the phylogenetic relationships of all polypterid species will be analysed using state-of-the-art morphological and molecular methods. The core of the proposed project will comprise a detailed description and analysis of polypterid skeletal ontogeny, based on complete developmental series of the two extant genera Polypterus and Erpetoichthys, which are unique in the world.

The most innovative part of the project will be the use of supertrees in the development of strategies to effectively identify areas of poor overlap in large phylogenies.

It is hoped that the strategies developed in this project will have broad applicability and will become essential to efficiently plan and successfully culminate ambitious research initiatives aiming tree of life reconstruction (with real savings in time and cost), which is primary to almost every biological study (phylogenetic knowledge is necessary for the correct classification of any organism). Hence, these results will contribute to the more efficient implementation of strategies of conservation and sustainable management of biological diversity and natural resources, which is very timely and in line with the objectives of EU environmental research under FP7.

The Mathilde-Weber Vocational College in T\u00fcbingen promotes the said project and has been engaged in annually implementing occupational mobility since 2003. The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part. Participants are involved in all aspects of  procedure within the partner setting and take on responsibility for their own  personal activities and for tasks within the group.\r\n\r\nThe project is planned to comprise 46 participants who in September/October 2015 or September/October 2016 will travel abroad as members of two separate groups. At the time in question, they will be in their third year of training  and will have gained practical experience during work placements and will have a grounding in  professional skills which will be enhanced by the occupational mobility project.     \r\nInter-cultural experience gained during work placement abroad also promotes an improvement in the quality of early years care and education. Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period. During the \u2018Education in Europe\u2019 lesson, they deal with various aspects of cultural diversity, prejudice and the experience of foreignness. They research other European countries and their corresponding educational systems and also address the curricculum for children under six in diverse countries. In further lessons, they learn songs, games and finger rhymes in other languages and experience picture books from the country to which they will travel. They study the importance of social skills to successful life within the community , receive encouragement in and exercises for observing individual social skills and develop ideas and methods with which to further social competence. In addition, they are prepared for the placement abroad through conversation sessions held in the relevant language.  \r\n\r\nEvery participant is visited in their work placement setting by a member of staff from the Mathilde-Weber College. In addition, an assessment is made in the group of participants in which the participant is working with the teacher in attendance. It is a matter of principle that regular contact is sustained between student and college during the entire work placement. Upon return, experience made is assessed and evaluated in a number of ways. ( questionnaires, discussion groups, in-lesson conversation, documentation). The results are then presented to other college classes, members of staff in early childhood settings and at external information events, both locally and regionally.    \r\nIncreased personal competence  such as independence, trust in onesself and self confidence is expected as a result . Furthermore, openness, tolerance, the ability to reflect and deliberate and flexibility, all of which will have a positive effect on further studies and future work placement. It is expected that concrete experience is made and a solid understanding gained in professional and methodical areas of practice. Long term, impulses originating in the experience made whilst on work practice abroad will result in later working life in an hightened sensitivity towards children and families with a history of migration.
