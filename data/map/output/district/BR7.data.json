The system will be composed of innovative solutions for the building envelope, for building energy generation and management, and for energy management at the settlement level. A reduction of operational energy usage to an average of 0-20 kWh/m2 per year (compared with the current average of 70-230 kWh/m2) will be achieved through a transition from single NZE buildings to NZE settlements, in which the energy loads and resources are optimally managed.\nA primary objective of the project will be to develop a system whose investment costs will be at least 16% lower than current costs. In order to reduce 'balance of system' costs, an approach of mass customization will be employed. Mass produced technologies will be integrated in a system that is optimally designed according to the local climate and site of each project in which it is implemented. To this end, a structured process will be developed and applied for the integration, optimization and verification of the design.\nThe project's work programme will ensure a rapid market uptake, within its four-year scope, of the innovative solutions that will be developed. These solutions will be implemented in four different demonstration projects throughout the EU, with varying climates and building types. The results of their implementation will be monitored, analyzed and disseminated. A comprehensive market analysis and business plan will support the commercial exploitation of the project's results. The project will be carried out by a consortium that includes universities, project owners, technology providers and organizations, which will closely collaborate in all the project's phases.'", 88167.0, 3538506.0, 8, 16, "ZERO-PLUS", null, null, null, "h2020_198347_945648151"]]}}, "6HX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1441065600000, 1456704000000, "Advanced Intelligent Raman System for detection of explosives and harmful substances at urban soft targets", "Is-Instruments Limited", "Chemical analysis of unknown samples is a vital measurement in a variety of sectors, from protein characterisation, identifying illicit and counterfeit drugs (est. \u20ac3bn cost to the industry), pharmaceutical quality control through to security applications (e.g. detection of explosives). There is a major security requirement is for a new reliable detection method of explosives, especially at soft targets. The ideal solution is a robust in-situ method for rapid non-invasive detection of hazardous materials, including explosives, that is portable and can be located at borders, ports and other sensitive targets around Europe.\nThe most powerful and promising method being adopted for in-situ observations of suspicious substances to detect explosive is Raman spectroscopy. All molecules provide a unique Raman signature making the method very flexible and effective. However, Raman observations thus far have proven unreliable in the field, due to the very weak signal strength, background fluorescence masking this signal and complicated spectral returns that are difficult to interpret in the field.  \nIn this project ISI will seek to develop an Advanced Intelligent Raman system (AIRS) that builds on the strengths of the Raman observational approach, and dramatically reduces it current limitations of existing instrumentation. \nAIRS will achieve this by combining three technology development to produce a new portable easy to use chemical identification instrument. Specifically the instrument will use a Time resolved measurement technique using advanced detector technologies to remove the fluorescence and improve the signal to noise of observations. Machine learning analysis tools to interpret instrument returns in the field quickly and efficiently allowing for multiple species to be identified. This will be combined with a new class of static Fourier transform spectrometer to increase the light capture and hence the sensitivity of the instrument.", 36571.0, 52245.0, 1, 1, "AIRS", null, null, null, "h2020_198400_931959317"]]}}}}
