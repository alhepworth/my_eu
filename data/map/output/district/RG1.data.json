Those systems are also called dependable systems, as our lives can depend on them. Examples are controllers in an airplane, breaking controller in a car, or a train control system. Those safety-critical systems need to be certified and the maximum execution time needs to be bounded and known so that response times can be assured when critical actions are needed. Even with high performance processors in our desktop PCs we notice once in a while that the PC is 'frozen' for a few seconds. For a safety-critical system such a 'pause' can result in a catastrophic failure.The mission of T-CREST is to develop tools and build a system that prevents pauses by identifying and addressing the causes for possible pauses. The T-CREST time-predictable system will simplify the safety argument with respect to maximum execution time striving to double performance for 4 cores and to be 4 times faster for 16 cores than a standard processor in the same technology (e.g., FPGA). Thus the T-CREST system will result in lower costs for safety relevant applications reducing system complexity and at the same time faster time-predictable execution.Standard computer architecture is driven by the following paradigm: make the common case fast and the uncommon case correct. This design approach leads to architectures where the average-case execution time is optimized at the expense of the worst-case execution time (WCET). Modelling the dynamic features of current processors, memories, and interconnects for WCET analysis often results in computationally infeasible problems. The bounds calculated by the analysis are thus overly conservative.We need a sea change and we shall take the constructive approach by designing computer architectures where predictable timing is a first-order design factor. For real-time systems we propose to design architectures with a new paradigm: make the worst-case fast and the whole system easy to analyse. Despite the advantages of analysable system resources, only a few research projects exist in the field of hardware optimized for the WCET.Within the project we will propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core and many-core system architectures. The resulting time-predictable resources (processor, interconnect, memories, etc.) will be a good target for WCET analysis and the WCET performance will be outstanding compared to current processors. Time-predictable caching and time-predictable chip-multiprocessing (CMP) will provide a solution for the need of more processing power in the real-time domain.Next to the hardware (processor, interconnect, memories), a compiler infrastructure will be developed in the project. WCET aware optimization methods will be developed along with detailed timing models such that the compiler benefits from the known behaviour of the hardware.

These are training materials expressly developed for L2 learning based on e-books, videos, webinars, MOOCs, Apps and other specific software, available for free or for a small fee, Additionally, the web allows free access to written texts, videos and TV and radio programs in many different languages developed for native language speakers that can be used directly by intermediate and advanced L2 learners. Finally, thanks to Skype and social media, direct interaction with teachers, other learners and native speakers has become easier and cheaper. From and educational point of view, the Internet has widened the possibilities for not formal and informal learning and for individualized learning strategies, as well as for self-directed learning.\r\n\r\nSome learners are able to find their way and benefit by themselves of this large amount of resources, while others needs to be guided and supported in the process, hence the need for a L2Learning Supporter (L2LS). \r\n\r\nThis project wants to explore and promote the role of the L2 Learning Supporter using the web based OER.

The participants will have finished, or will be next to finish the fourth year of study. Abroad, the program includes a week of preparation and 4 full-time internship in company. Although mobility is recognised as school-work alternance to all intents and purposes, its duration cannot fully overlap school lessons.  For this reason it can take place with only partial overlapping at the beginning or at the end of the school year, as in the past.  The participants come from different schools where they study technical subjects (Agriculture; Computer Sciences), Economics (Administration, in a Marketing framework; Tourism) and Vocational subjects (Wine and Food and Hospitality services, Rural Development Services). The foreign partners and destinations for this first year of the project with the Erasmus+ Charter have been identified on the basis of past experience, taking into account participants\u2019 needs, the educational opportunities they can offer and their relevance for the project subjects: UK (Reading, Cardiff, Plymouth), France (Nice), Spain (Valencia), and Austria (Vienna).  These are destinations where the management and promotion of tourism and the valorisation of resources are supported by digital technology (typical agricultural products or their transformation, but also cultural and landscape resources). Mobility will be very important for the young participants in an economic context where exports of quality products are particularly significant and at the same time the foreign tourist trade has a relevant market share.  It will assist learning in new contexts different from those of a school laboratory or local enterprise for the development of language skills and to experiment work environments that employ different technologies and job organizations and have different missions.  The experience will make it possible to develop both specific professional and transversal competences: the business environments will stimulate reflection, curiosity and a desire to learn; to promote and increase adaptability and flexibility, autonomy and the ability to work in a team.  Experience in an unknown international context will also be a wonderful opportunity to develop relationship skills, intercultural open-mindedness and personal responsibility, all characteristics necessary to work in the local economy.As at the end of the fourth form many participants are still minors, schools consider it necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher who will act as facilitator and take care of the participants and their safety.All institutes will take part in STAFF mobility.  The six participants involved will be five teachers of CLIL subjects in the English language (computer sciences, wine and food, maths and physics, etc.) and the administrative assistant of the Cerletti Institute dealing with the project.

All the schools also intend to take part in the FSE and PON regional competitions for language studies abroad for the purpose of achieving certification.The schools will extend their initiatives of hospitality, referral and exchange of both students and teachers (partnerships in Key Action 2 projects in progress, bilateral relationships with schools, invitations to visiting professors and intercultural activities).  In the framework of alternating school-work, the institutes wish to provide a broader horizon in terms of links to the world of work through category associations and internationalised businesses, with lectures in the original language by experts in subjects relating to internationalisation and pertinent to the different studies.

In this framework, the QUALITY-W 2014 project, in which \u2018W\u2019 stands for \u2018Welcoming\u2019, takes into account the quality of welcoming guests as an issue to be investigated, in which to insert the learning programme that will be developed during the work experience.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018quality of welcoming\u2019 concerns the way one deals with guests and involves the ability to meet their requirements and understand their problems and cultural background. Moreover, it also concerns the guests\u2019 feelings towards the management of the environment as a system, and therefore towards the appearance of the territory and the impact that structures and economic activities have on it. \r\n\r\nMany skills involved in this field are based on personal gifts that the school, despite its educational efforts, cannot always develop and evaluate properly. Both the knowledge and the technical-operative skills need, through their application to the business reality, to be transformed into competences and to be constantly updated.\r\n\r\nThe school has been sensible to this formative issue for some time and has activated a path that, through the use of schemes such as school-work dual systems, tends to fill in these gaps. The ERASMUS+ programme, inside which the QUALITY-W  2014 project stands, offers a further opportunity by financing a mobility period of vocational educational training abroad.\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at 90 students from a multi-regional network of three Vocational and Technical Secondary Schools\u2019 (level ISCED 3).

This becomes essential in a land that was also recently put to the test by the earthquake swarm that is ravaging the Italian Centre, and who is trying to use the proceeds of the various economic activities to support the reconstruction of the affected areas, but also the expensive restoration of too many artistic heritage endangered.\r\nOnly the mastery of suitable competencies will create a quality, innovative and competitive offer, able to produce positive impact on employment in the long run. \r\nThe beneficiaries of learners mobility are 110 students attending the fourth and fifth classes of the following fields of study: business& administration, foreign languiuages, , catering & hospitality, tourism and related services. The different profiles are integrated in the attention to the development of the tourist company as a whole.\r\nMobility will last five weeks, and will be placed within an educational path that aims to develop: - linguistic knowledge; -  professional and transversal competences, required to operators of the tourism industry; - the sense of European citizenship and intercultural openness; - self-knowledge through processes of self-analysis and strengthening of personality thanks to the management of new situations that require flexibility, responsibility and problem solving attitude. \r\nThe selected countries of destination are Austria, Spain, France, UK, Ireland.

In addition, next year the number of staff applications will be more than double the places available thanks to the promoting activities carried out by each individual institution.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the Consortium plan of international development is the increase of other kinds of mobility: the schools are applying for MOVE 4.0 Call (DGR Veneto n.1866/2016) in order to organize study holidays with compulsory B1 certification. If financed, 90 3rd year students will be involved and they are prospective candidates for Erasmus + mobility in 2018.

This curriculum change is driven in part by the need for a highly digitally competent workforce to remain economically competitive, but also by an understanding that thinking computationally will enhance students cognitive abilities, their understanding of the world and their ability to create using digital technologies. The partners in #co-think- 5 5 local school authorities/educational centers and 5 pilot schools from Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, Finland and Denmark - believe that computational thinking is an area of learning not only crucial to our students adaptation to their digital surroundings, but also to their ability to problem solve, develop new knowledge, and above all to harness the full potential of their creativity. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of computer science concepts, including computational thinking, into the education systems in many European countries, has been challenging, especially as many teachers have not received pre-service or in-service training to teach these areas.

The project will culminate in a final training and dissemination event to ensure that learning from the project is integrated into local practice and outcomes from the project are embedded into each region's professional development programme for local schools. The project will also create an international network through which teachers can work together on resources and documentation to support ongoing progression in their learning and collaboration around computational thinking.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe transnational nature of the project will enable each partner to apply methods developed in other countries\u2019 contexts and to learn from best practice outside of their immediate environments. Tasks have been divided into 5 work packages ( PROJECT MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION, LEARNING AND TEACHING ACTIVITIES, CURRICULUM IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION)  and distributed democratically among the country coordinators on the basis of their expertise.
