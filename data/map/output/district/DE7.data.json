Mechanical recycling of this waste is challenging due to the presence of inks and adhesives so that this recycled material is only suitable for manufacture low value products (rubbish bags, irrigation pipes and pots) when not diverted to energy recovery and landfill which has a negative environmental and societal impact.  \nCLIPP \\ aims to introduce into the market a cost-competitive environmentally friendly recycled PE film to be reused in the original or other high added value applications (such as packaging films)  through a innovative technology based on a previous EU project (CLIPP) which demonstrated the effectiveness of supercritical CO2 technology to remove the contaminants associated to this type of printed/laminated  plastic packaging. \nTurning waste into a valuable resource is a goal for SKYMARK in order to contribute to raw material savings and more sustainable development.

The CLIPP Recycling System for printed and laminated plastic fraction, will contribute to the post-industrial waste management goal of this new century: the development of intelligent solutions that are technically and environmentally innovative, and economically viable. The project proposal is based on the elimination (90% w/w) and compatibilisation of the paint contaminants in packaging by the synergetic combination of CO2 in super-critical-conditions (sc-CO2) with innovative high performance filters (micro-filters) and suitable coupling agents as a dispersion-aid. The sc-CO2 is a promising technology in the plastic processing industry due to its special properties such as polymer viscosity reduction and dispersion and removal of low molecular weight substances. The advantageous physic-chemical properties of CO2 compared to conventional organic solvents are capacity of mass transfer and more environmentally friendly operation. Three machine configurations will be studied and scale-up using one-step process by combining different types of extruders and devices in order to improve the quality of the pellet, increase remain contaminants dispersion and matrix-filler compatibilization and reduce CO2 foaming problems: 1) A two consecutive single screw extruder (Tandem extrusion process), 2) MRS (Multi Rotation System) and 3) Tandem extruder system with a MACD (Multiple Annular Channel Device).

Demand of these foods is forecast to growth, reaching 148Mton globally during 2016. Dried baby food market reflects this trend, as parents have decided to satisfy nutrient requirements of a child using commercial food. This growth is translated to a huge production of packaging and associated wastes.\nModified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) is a preserving technique usually applied in dried food. Applications are commonly based on multilayer plastic materials. However, there is no cost-effective and proven technology capable of fully recycling these materials. A 5% substitution of these materials using Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) applications would reduce over 300.000 tons of non renewable plastic packaging wastes disposal .The use of bio-based materials is a promising alternative in the packaging industry to reduce the disposal and the use of non-renewable resources.\nBIOACTIVELAYER consortium will develop a multilayer biodegradable structure that can provide a sustainable and more environmentally friendly alternative to materials currently used in MAP.\nBIOACTIVELAYER solution will provide a novel biodegradable multilayer structure based in paper for dried baby food packaging. Paper properties will be enhanced following a three steps approach. 1) To increase paper moisture barrier, blends of waxes and resins will be applied. 2) Main moisture barrier improvement will rely on a composite based in PHA. PHA lacks of the barrier required for MAP applications. Therefore,  composites with mineral fillers will be developed to obtain a moisture barrier layer. 3) Oxygen barrier materials will be improved through use of oxygen scavenging compounds.\nA whole sustainable and tailor made solution that will maintain the product quality and assure food safety, will be developed by BIOACTIVELAYER consortium, reaching a shelf life of 24 months.", 142421.0, 983713.0, 5, 8, "BIOACTIVELAYER", null, "http://www.skymark.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157200.jpg", "fp7_110091_983844423"], [1351728000000, 1414713600000, "Advanced cellulose packaging", "Skymark Packaging International Limited", "The use of bio-based materials is a promising alternative in the packaging industry to reduce the disposal and the use of non-renewable resources.
