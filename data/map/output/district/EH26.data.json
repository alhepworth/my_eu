In the EU, most human infections are due to consumption of meat containing Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts. Prevalence of Toxoplasma is higher in outdoor reared animals, such as sheep, than in animals reared indoors, and consumer interest in animal welfare and free-range meat production may contribute to a further increase in the prevalence of Toxoplasma unless control measures are implemented. Vaccination of consumption animals to prevent Toxoplasma infection and tissue cyst formation could be highly effective in reducing the disease burden in humans. The only commercially available vaccine against toxoplasmosis in sheep, Toxovax, prevents congenital disease in lambs but the effect of vaccination on tissue cyst development has not been studied. Toxovax uses a live attenuated strain of T. gondii and there may be a risk of the vaccine strain reverting back to wild-type and causing disease in animals or humans.
