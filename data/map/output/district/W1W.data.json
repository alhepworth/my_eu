This project will look at the employment market, analysing the demands and needs of the labour market and create a link between the people, their education and the labour market.  Allowing young people to take advantage of this prism to find the best employment solutions, either in their countries or abroad.\r\n\r\nThe labour market is like a prism, it is diverse, complex and full of opportunities.  The educational system in the EU is equally diverse allowing people to follow a path to their unique desires, let\u2019s assume that education is the light and the labour force is the prism, together, in the right conditions we have a rainbow of colours, the various jobs and employment opportunities.  Most young people see the employment/labour market as a piece of glass, meaning what they study should result in a job.  This shows us that young people don\u2019t really understand the diversity and ever growing labour market, not only in their countries but in the EU.  We see that young people enjoy the freedom of mobility in the EU and often take advantage of the possibility to work in other country, often larger or richer countries, yet leaving a labour market searching for qualified people and often resulting in these countries searching for employees from abroad.  The mobility is a fantastic opportunity and allows for the EU to grow and diversify, but this still leaves us with a gap between the labour force and the labour market.\r\n\r\nThis project will address this gap, looking at ways to better understand the labour market, the needs of each labour market, both local and European, then taking the skills, knowledge, education and competences of young people and matching them to needs of the labour market allowing young people to find the best employment opportunities based on these.\r\n\r\nMany young people have complained that most employers need experienced workers, and this is one thing that young people are not able to get without employment.  The project will explore various EU and national tools that will allow young people to gain experience, gained added knowledge, skills and competences so that they can meet the needs of the labour market.\r\n\r\nOur project was developed by the partnership by identifying the most common concerns of young people in the partner countries involved.  We have a diverse level of experience in the labour markets allowing us to share and exchange knowledge and good practices for a European solution for young people, allowing young people to be empowered and innovative in their approach to the labour market and allowing them to understand the labour market and its needs and also understanding their skills and competences and matching these with the needs of the labour market, thus creating employment opportunities and letting them pave the way to their own future.\r\n\r\nThe project will also have business experts talking to the participants giving them the perspective of the labour market from those who are in the labour market.

Initially, 4 departments have been earmarked ( the international relations department, the administrative teaching department, the hospitality and culture department and part of the team of language trainers).\r\n\r\n16 mobilities  have been requested concerning 4 teaching establishments located in the following countries : Germany,  Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. This will focus on structured modern language courses which are necessary, due to the large number of adult learners who stem from these countries and who attend courses at CAVILAM \u2013 Alliance  fran\u00e7aise.\r\nIn addition to the linguistic aspect, the development of intercultural skills will be part of the aims of this mobility project.\r\nIt will allow the diversification of skills (know-how and social skills) of the CAVILAM \u2013 Alliance  fran\u00e7aise staff and is registered in a professionalization process which our language centre has been committed to since its creation.\r\n\r\nPromoting team mobility develops motivation and encourages initiatives.

Furthermore, we expect to get some new input concerning historical and cultural aspects of other European countries. These insights might enable us to apply the acquired knowledge to our own classes.

Additionally, the new insights into the British and Italian culture may allow us to better understand the cultural background and its effects on society. The acquired knowledge could then be applied to our classes to increase cultural awareness among our students and it might also have a positive effect on our teaching.\r\nIn the long run, we expect to broaden our professional skills and to develop and establish a school profile on an international level.", "http://www.stgeorges.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA101-004874_1"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "INDEPENDENT CINEMA OFFICE LBG*ICO", 65419.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_52584"]]}}}}
