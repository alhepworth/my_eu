development of many computing technologies which have subsequently been exploited in the mass market. Delivering an exaflop (or 10^18 calculations per second) by the end of this decade is the challenge that the supercomputing community worldwide has set itself. The Collaborative Research into Exascale Systemware, Tools and Applications project (CRESTA) brings together four of Europe's leading supercomputing centres, with one of the world's major equipment vendors, two of Europe's leading programming tools providers and six application and problem owners to explore how the exaflop challenge can be met. CRESTA focuses on the use of six applications with exascale potential and uses them as co-design vehicles to develop: the development environment, algorithms and libraries, user tools, and the underpinning and cross-cutting technologies required to support the execution of applications at the exascale. The applications represented in CRESTA have been chosen as a representative sample from across the supercomputing domain including: biomolecular systems, fusion energy, the virtual physiological human, numerical weather prediction and engineering.<br/>No one organisation, be they a hardware or software vendor or service provider can deliver the necessary range of technological innovations required to enable computing at the exascale. This is recognised through the on-going work of the International Exascale Software Project and, in Europe, the European Exascale Software Initiative. CRESTA will actively engage with European and International collaborative activities to ensure that Europe plays its full role worldwide. Over its 39 month duration the project will deliver key, exploitable technologies that will allow the co-design applications to successfully execute on multi-petaflop systems in preparation for the first exascale systems towards the end of this decade.", 623275.0, 9812227.0, 5, 15, "CRESTA", null, null, null, "fp7_100077_996393895"], [1383264000000, 1477872000000, "Exascale Programming Models", "Cray U.K. Limited", "Exascale computing power will likely be reached in the next decade. While the precise system architectures are still evolving, one can safely assume that they will be largely based on deep hierarchies of multicore CPUs with similarly-deep memory hierarchies, potentially also supported by accelerators. New and disruptive programming models are needed to allow applications to run efficiently at large scale on these platforms. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) has emerged as the de-facto standard for parallel programming on current petascale machines; but Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages and libraries are increasingly being considered as alternatives or complements to MPI. However, both approaches have severe problems that will prevent them reaching exascale performance.<br/>The aim of this proposal is to prepare Message Passing (MP) and PGAS programming models for exascale systems by fundamentally addressing their main current limitations. We will introduce new disruptive concepts to fill the technological gap between the petascale and exascale era in two ways:<br/>\u0095 First, innovative algorithms will be used in both MP and PGAS, specifically to provide fast collective communication in both MP and PGAS, to decrease the memory consumption in MP, to enable fast synchronization in PGAS, to provide fault tolerance mechanisms in PGAS, and potential strategies for fault tolerance in MP.\u0095 Second, we will combine the best features of MP and PGAS by developing an MP interface using a PGAS library as communication substrate.<br/>The concepts developed will be tested and guided by two applications in the engineering and space weather domains chosen from the suite of codes in current EC exascale projects.

Development of incremental and disruptive technologies will have key impacts on the world\u2019s societies, and on safety, security and competitiveness of Europe. Amongst those technologies, gas turbines will play a major role. Recovery of shale gas depends decisively on compressors. Modern gas supplied power plants are bridging towards the age of renewable energies. Aeroengines are to undergo the most massive changes in their history with the advent of composite materials, gear boxes, and turbine-electric concepts separating generation of power and thrust. A technological commonalities of the upcoming challenges is the need for full model based development and computer system simulation.\n\nThere is agreement on this in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community. The structural dynamics and vibration questions are at present far from being addressed adequately. While US agencies and Asian powers have already started to prepare themselves, European research organisations and companies still seem to be too fragmented to reach critical research ressources and start corresponding initiatives. There are two main reasons for this. First, the physics of mechanical joining technologies that dominate the damping behavior of the large-scale structures under debate, are still poorly understood. Second, there is a lack of high performance computing (HPC) capabilities in structural dynamics, which goes back to the lack of knowledge of effective HPC technologies for structural dynamics. \n\nSince the US, China and India have started efforts in the field, we propose a European contribution through a Marie Curie ETN to allow a first generation of early stage researchers to catch up on the topics, ideally open up new fields of insight and approaches, and finally form a seed group for the upcoming challenges of the European turbine industry with respect to nonlinear structural dynamics and HPC.", 238604.0, 3331653.0, 7, 11, "EXPERTISE", null, null, null, "h2020_208795_996393895"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "CRAY U.K. LIMITED", 238375.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_11332"], [2016, "EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGEONS LIMITED", 179324.0, "Third programme for the Union's action in the field of health (2014-2020) (17.03.01)", "fts_2016_32043"], [2016, "EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF CORNEA AND OCULAR SURFACE DISEASE SPECIALISTS", 79618.0, "Third programme for the Union's action in the field of health (2014-2020) (17.03.01)", "fts_2016_32045"]]}}, "7WS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1435708800000, 1501459200000, "Airlander Civil Exploitation Project", "Hybrid Air Vehicles Limited", "The Airlander hybrid air vehicle is a new form of aircraft designed by Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd (HAV).
