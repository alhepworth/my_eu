They got a good feedback about their application, so they decided to make the youth exchange real. They had similar ideas about the youth exchange, so it was easy decide about it.\r\n \r\nWith this youth exchange we hope to gain international cooperation of the youngsters. Also important is to get to know about others culture and meeting new people, learn about education in each otherscountries, how young people are heard/acknowledged in each others countries and to recognise ones own learning through self assesment. \r\n \r\nParticipating youngsters will learn and improve their design, execute introduction and leading skills. They will also learn to plan, execute and estimate workshops. Youngsters will expand their mobility inside the EU. They will meet new people from another country, and keep in touch with them. They will also get skills, knowledge and possibilities, what they can share with their own local community. Youngsters with different backgrounds will learn about each other\u2019s cultures, countries, historical places and sports. They will improve their English skills and might learn each other\u2019s languages.

From Northern Ireland there will be 24 youngsters and 3 adult instructors. Participants from Finland will be 20 youngsters and 3 youth leaders.\r\n \r\nIn our youth exchange the Northern Irish group comes to Finland. Northern Irish will come to live in summer camp Asinsaari which is owned by the city of Lappeenranta. We have planned activity for every day, but Northern Irish will plan activity for some day\u2019s themes, for example on the day when we have a open festival for everyone, they will bring out their own dance culture and show us their dances. In this way both groups learn about each other\u2019s cultures. We have planned to cook together too, on that day we will bring out food culture from both countries. We also have planned sport, dance, nature and to explore the city days. We will have activities focusing on youth councils and how to make a change in your community. Many evenings there will be evening campfire.\r\n \r\nOur methods are based on that that we do a lot of teamwork with the other participants. We will also do things individually, then we will estimate ourselves in other words we will do self-evaluation for example: What do I want from this youth exchange? What do I want to learn? What could prevent me from learning? etc. And we always have youth leaders, who can advise us and help us. However we will try do as much as possible ourselves, because this is our youth exchange.\r\n \r\nWe hope that this youth exchange only affects the participants in positive way, in other words we hope that they get new and unforgettable experiences and good friends who they can keep in touch with. The participants will benefit about the change, because they will learn to use their knowledge of languages better, which makes possible them to be multilingual. This helps if they want have an international job, where you need to be multilingual. The participants will learn how to communicate with others more skillfully with new people. They will benefit also about that that they will see new country where they maybe have never visited and will learn about new cultures and about different ways. The impact to our organization (Youth Council of Lappeenranta) is surely positive, because our youth council will get more to tell and advertise about this topic. Our town will surely pay attention to our youth council more, also trust our organization and will want to hear more about our opinions. The local community will surely get pleasant memories, which they can recall cheerfully sometimes later.

They found a partner in Bavaria, Germany who were very experienced in exchanges and had a history of links with Northern Ireland.  They had previously completed exchanges several years with Brownlow Area Youth Project in Craigavon, which is a controlled youth centre within SELB Youth Service.  The feedback was so positive from Craigavon that they contacted the group in Bavaria and established a new link.  This is a new opportunity for this Newry and Mourne group as they have never participated in a bi-lateral exchange in Europe before and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for them.  Its also a great opportunity for us in the Youth Service in the SELB as its been several years since we engaged in exchanges.

Pooling complementary expertise and resources of 6 partners gives a project whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.", 168732.0, 2140559.0, 6, 6, "EU-UNAWE", "http://eunawe.eu/", "http://star.arm.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/53687.jpg", "fp7_97906_998279187"], [1230768000000, 1356912000000, "European Planetology Network Research Infrastructure", "Armagh Observatory and Planetarium", "The Europlanet RI project will provide the European planetary science community with a unique research infrastructure, combining access to a suite of state of the art facilities while fostering their joint development and integration in terms of capacity and performance. This research infrastructure will include access to laboratory and field site facilities, advanced modelling, simulation and data analysis resources and to data produced by space missions and ground-based telescopes hence maximising the scientific impact of major European space missions and ground-based installations.   Access will be provided in two forms. Three coordinated Trans National Access activities will open to many users the unique range of laboratory and field site facilities selected for this project. In parallel, the IDIS e-service will provide a user-friendly web-based access to the available planetary science data, information and software tools.   Four Joint Research Activities will broaden the scope of the infrastructure, opening access to new field sites, offering new models and data analysis tools for users and widening the opportunity of remote data access by progressively upgrading IDIS into a Planetary Virtual Observatory.  Four complementary networking activities will publicize the objectives and opportunities of Europlanet RI and disseminate project results amongst the scientific community, industries, SME\u2019s, space agencies and the public. They will consolidate the establishment of a European Research Area for planetary science and exploration.  Building on the synergies between its services, joint research activities and networking activities, Europlanet RI will provide the ideal scientific and technical environment to fully analyse data from past and present planetary missions and prepare the next generation of missions. In this way it will play a vital role in establishing the European Community as a leading player in planetary and space exploration.", 22763.0, 6360765.0, 15, 28, "EUROPLANET RI", null, "http://star.arm.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156533.jpg", "fp7_92505_998279187"]]}}, "9HG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "in omnibus omnia est", "Saints and Scholars IPS", 109811.0, 6, 6, "In Omnibus Omnia Est \u2013 Everything is related to everything else The project built on innovative approaches, providing more attractive education and training programs in line with 21st century needs and expectations. The added value of the project consists in the transnational character facilitating the exchange of experiences and good practices at European level in order to promote learning through outdoor and non-formal activities.The project will encourage higher thinking. Students will be placed in new educational situations where knowledge acquisition is not enough; they will have to apply knowledge in new constructions. This will be reinforced by the continuous international exchange. The frequent use of 21st Century Skills will encourage students to make their own educational materials while participating in learning/teaching/training activities. This kind of partnership will lead the development of the spirit of active citizenship to all participants.In the previous section we indicated many teachers lack the ability to customized education and applying 21st Century Skills. To tackle this assumption, this project provides training courses (workshops), good practice, Implementation conversations (meetings, website) and working together, will have a stimulating effect and reduce fears. Through this approach, we create a group where it is always possible and safe, asking for help. Education is teamwork at its best.Participants from Greece, Spain, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have joined forces to pursue three objectives:   1) Cross curricular approach by making use of   2) 21st Century Skills, and   3) Strengthening the European dimension in our education.Although the schools are from totally different educational cultures, they are united in pursuing these objectives, because they should do so in accordance with the multi-annual policies and the requirements of the (national) curriculum. The five topics are:     1. Culture; connectedness in diversity     2. History; the sea: driving force behind the development of civilization     3. Keeping healthy; despite 21st century temptations.     4. Ecology: national problems require European solution     5. Keeping Safe; 21st Century threats overpoweredThe topics will be conducted according to a set pattern and by making use of various subjects in a cross-curricular approach, using 21st Century Skills.Emphasis is put on: Creativity - Critical thinking - Problem solving skills - Communication - Cooperation - Digital literacy - Social and cultural skills and Self-regulation.In the topics there will be established moments in which children have to share results and experiences with their colleagues abroad. (Video conferencing / traveling abroad)For both teachers and students, the heart of the project will be the Learning / Teaching / Training Activities. By making use of the expertise available among partners, supplemented by seminars, workshops and class visits and all brought together in (international) conversations / meetings; the educational skills and knowledge of teachers as well as the effectiveness of the learning process will increase.The educational website and e Twinning, provide teachers reflection and help (chat / video). Students will be involved in two mobilities. Their tasks are:1) Representation: presentation of school / country, Puppet, poster etc.2) Cooperate: in international groups in various activities, visits and experiments, concerning the topic3) Create: a booklet about the topic (part of the E-magazine)4) Collect: information about the country (officially and from their point of view \u2013 photo, video) 5) Keeping a diary6) Experience the culture and history.The last three tasks are the basis for a comprehensive briefing for parents and classmates.The younger students will carried out a second group of activities called: PUPPETS WITH A MISSION, based on the same three main objectives of the project.A Puppet represents a topic. Holland chose Kermit, because our topic is water. Kermit travels on a fixed schedule. In his suitcase a number of tasks that must be carried out by the host school. (Music, dance, language, history, experimentation, etc. all related to water) In addition, Kermit will teach host school children something about our country.His diary, allows Dutch children to see what Kermit has experienced. Halfway there is Skype contact with the host school. All project activities will result in:1) rewriting and updating of multi-year policies and curriculum2) adjusting the documents that stipulate the personal development (Knowledge, educational skills, improvements) teachers3) a number of end products that will serve as a database for the years following the closing of the project.
