This should also have a positive effect in terms of the national economy revitalization, especially in the South of Italy.\r\nTourism and Agribusiness are key sectors for all of the regions involved in the project and recently they have been object of important development strategies for the promotion of the Italian territory and its typical products at European level. Hence, there is a need to dissolve the preexistent general skill mismatch and lack of coherence, in order to raise and train professionals with excellent skills and abilities, who could also contribute to the growth and development of the Italian territory in itself. \r\nV.A.L.L.E.Y. proposes to develop a model that is able to meet these needs. The first step of this model is the transnational mobility. This concrete experience abroad will be functional to  the participants\u2019 orientation in the labour market and their subsequent job placement, eventually leading to the equal recognition of the participants\u2019 acquired competencies  thanks to the EVCVET  methods and tools.\r\nProject\u2019s specific objectives are:\r\n- to acquire technical and professional skills in Tourism and Agribusiness sectors;\r\n-  to acquire and improve a foreign language;\r\n- to develop soft and transversal skills ;\r\n- to contribute to the process of skills and transparency validation and recognition at European level, in line with the ECVET system provisions ;\r\n-to promote the development of the South Italian employment level together with its productivity and competitiveness.\r\nIn terms of impact, the project will produce a significant impact on the participants, increasing their chances of employability: on the way back from their experience abroad, they will get the opportunity to do a post-mobility internship in Italy so as to contribute to the project\u2019s main purposes and to maximize the local impact.\r\nVALLEY will definitively trigger  positive effects both on the young professionals and on the local community. The local educational and employability systems together with the national economy  will benefit from the project outcomes at a regional and European level and will increase the general consciousness about the importance of Tourism/ Agribusiness for the local community and for Southern Italy in itself leading to the subsequent valorization of its typical products, culture and human resources. \r\nThe beneficiaries will be 150 young graduates from Campania, Puglia, Basilicata and Calabria, which will have the opportunity to carry out a 120 days traineeship in foreign companies operating in Tourism and Agribusiness and located respectively in  United Kingdom, Spain, France, Ireland and Malta.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005323_5"], [2015, "Grant for Learning Opportunities in european Countries Aimed at promoting Local development", "IBD Solutions Limited", 621665.0, 5, 14, "The project GLOCAL 2015 (Grant Opportunities for Learning in european Countries Aimed at promoting local development) fits the local, regional (Campania) context where has arisen which is particularly affected by the problem of youth unemployment.

In addition, a recent study by Eurostat points out that  the creative ability of a company is inversely correlated to the  age of its employees. The under-40 produce about the 70 percent of innovations. In line with the demands of the market and the reform of the educational system that imposes a growing bond between schools and businesses, the Lepido Rocco always develops close cooperation and strict relations with the world of work and in particular with the companies of reference of its based  students, many of which have foreign branches. The participation of entrepreneurs in defining and planning of training promotes the desired continuous modernization of the offered profiles. Businesses often complain of young people, their lack of flexibility and adaptability, entrepreneurship and personal autonomy. The project EN.PASS therefore assumes great importance since it allows beneficiaries to a direct comparison with situations linguistically, culturally and technologically different from their local context stimulating their curiosity and self-study, in an international dimension. The opportunity to experience completely new experiences even in terms of personal commitment, is a unique opportunity for the 150 students: it will substantially affect on their future professional life, given their location in an area (particulary VENETO-FVG-SICILIA Region), subject to strong pressures for change and in need of new ideas and initiatives which are geared to sustainable development model.

By centralizing resources in a consortium, the schools in the consortium will be able to send their students abroad to do parts of their VET and teachers for job shadowing. Each school can then develop at its own pace with a few students where they can work on internationalization and continue work on developing local routines and processes with the support of centrally developed materials and key persons. Using period placement schedule as a resource allows the flow of students to be evenly distributed over the academic year and receiving partners can maintain a good quality over time and our organization can handle the amount of students who then continuously can send smaller number of students and increase the number over time.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nIn the IT- and retail industry, new technologies are being developed both nationally and internationally.

The project is timely with regard to EU goals \u2013 Higher Vocational Education in Sweden has never before been allocated so many places. The political direction is clear \u2013 there is a strong commitment to HVE. \r\n \r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to obtain more knowledge about EU tools, and to gain better insight into the overall goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy for Higher Education. Knowledge is needed about SeQF, EQF and how ECVET can be implemented concerning credit transfer. Staff will gain knowledge by learning how tasks are performed, taught and assessed in Europe within the professional roles that students are educated for at Frans Schartau. Further aims of the project are to see how the European dimension can be reflected in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for students is to provide them with international professional experience, and increased language skills as requested by the labour market. One consequence of mobility is that employability increases while strengthening the student\u2019s ability to work in an international labour market. Through exchange, students get the opportunity to acquire key competencies such as communicating in another language, learning new technologies that increase digital skills. Living in another country leads to the development of social, personal and cultural skills, and by participating in exchange projects a person\u2019s capacity to take initiative is stimulated. \r\n \r\nThree members of staff with experience of international cooperation will organise the project.

Staff should be in the position to immediately apply their new skills to benefit students and promote work on internationalization at the school. The 25 students participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across the various areas of work. Students must have a good communicative ability to be able to pass on what they have learnt after their Work Placements. After selection, mobility goals will be anchored with the host organization or company and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\nThe intended outcome is that the school should be at the forefront of internationalization work. There will be more knowledge within the organization about professional roles seen from a European perspective. The knowledge acquired will give courses and teaching at the school an international dimension, increase knowledge of SeQF, EQF and ECVET as well as ensuring that international Work Placements maintains high quality.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of the City of Stockholm, which organizes education at all levels so that circulation of results will be via the City's Intranet and in the newsletter.

Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration. IVVEC has long-term international experience in organizing mobilities for both staff and learners.  \r\nThe objective of the project is to implement a two-year project of high-quality mobilities which will enable the learners and staff of IVVEC to be more competitive.

The project application has been prepared in cooperation with the partners and the mobilities have been planned in accordance with their best learning conditions.\r\nThorough planning definitely serves a solid ground for successful project implementation. If funding granted, the project management team will be made up to implement the project in cooperation with the partners. The selection of the best candidates is carried out in accordance with the special procedure adopted at IVVEC. The staff members have already expressed their wish to study abroad. All the activities are documented which also guarantees the project implementation in case of unexpected changes in the project management team.\r\nThe opportunity to undertake independently a training placement abroad for students who come to study at IVVEC after both basic and secondary schools, enables them to grow more competitive both in Estonian and European job markets and gain more foreign language skills. The opportunity to have a practice placement abroad motivates the first- and second-year students to study harder. The knowledge and skills of the participating staff grows as well as their competence in advancing the apprenticeship system at IVVEC, which definitely have positive effect on the learners' motivation to study and reducing the drop-out rate.  Being abroad the participants have a great opportunity to get acquainted with foreign culture which brings to higher tolerance and respect towards it.   \r\nAll the mobility participants are issued a Europass Mobility and all the learning outcomes and assessments in different learning environments are taken into account and properly registered at IVVEC.\r\nThe successful international projects and their implementation make vocational education more popular in the region, creates a solid ground to raise the quality of education and attract more basic school graduates to study at IVVEC.

The project also includes the mobility of 6 staff aimed at developing better competences in those who will be in charge of the whole in transnational mobility Programming, in a larger perspective.  \r\nAs regards the learners, the project will be not only aimed at reinforcing non-formal learning thanks to the opportunity to play an active role in a work context but also at improving their competencies and qualifications for better and faster job opportunities. The mobility learning outcomes will be tailored to the single participant in order to give them the chance to obtain the final qualification of expert in MECHATRONICS AND AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. Along with the professional competencies, the mobilities will also be expected to improve participants\u2019 linguistic and social competencies.  \r\nParticipants will be divided into groups of about 6 learners each. Mobilities will take place in Germany, UK, Bulgaria and Spain and will have a duration of 12 weeks. Hosting Partners abroad have been selected in view of their connections with host-companies in the mechatronics and automation sector and their capacity to offer quality internships. The contents and the learning outcomes for the internships will be discussed with the companies and the participants. Participation to the project PLUS-MUSE will be based on an application by the participants on the basis of public open calls. Before the internship abroad, a preliminary linguistic, cultural and pedagogical preparation stage of 2 weeks will be carried out in Trento, to be financed with regional resources. The learners will also benefit from using the European OLS platform. The experience abroad will also include a 3-day initial induction and preparation to the workplacment. At the end of the experience abroad, 2 days of programme follow up will be organized in Trento. \r\nUpon return to Italy, a second internship experience of 8 weeks in Trentino in the mechatronics and automation sector will be available, this time aimed at work placement. This final stage will be entirely financed with provincial resources. The project identifies specific quality tools which will be applied and combined in the tutoring, monitoring, and certification stage, both by the Sending and by Receiving organizations. \r\nAs regards the 6 staff, a mobility of 4 days will be activated in collaboration with a British Receiving Organization who have already managed several quality internships for the Trentino learners and who have developed special programmes for the improvement of competencies of the key-staff of transnational mobility organizations. The programme will deepen cutting-edge tools, practices, methodologies and procedures, and will have a strong component of job-shadowing and practical observation. The programme will be aimed at improving the competencies of the staff in managing and coordinating VET mobilities, and in enhancing the value of transnational mobility as a training tool.  \r\nThe whole PLUS-MUSE project will be accompanied by promotion, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination actions, to take place at the start, during and at the end of the project.", "http://www.ibdpartnership.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005770_2"], [2017, "APL-utomlands", "IBD Solutions Limited", 223548.0, 3, 4, "Internationalization\r\nToday we have more and more students with international connections who see a future working internationally. Working life requires more international cooperation in which we need to develope our students and staff. In order to continue to develop our vocational program, students and staff, we need to take another step and it is towards internationalization. Retail-, handcraft- and IT-industry contains many international relations and English terminology. Students will have the whole of Europe as labor so it is very important that during the studies they take part in the work environment, culture and customs to make it easier to work in other countries as well as to get a better understanding of cultural differences and how English is used as a technical language. Vocational training abroad gives our students an understanding of and familiarity with the international labor market.\r\n\r\nQuality\r\nThe purpose of this project is that several schools and students get the opportunity to do a few weeks of its work-based learning and vocational education training, in another country with a different professional culture, professional identity and professional community. They may also take part in and learn new skills from an internationalization perspective in their future professional field. This allows students to gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness and described in the regulations for the Swedish school system and approaching the exam objectives for vocational programs which create higher quality of the students' training. Assessing learning and tacit knowledge within a profession emerges with the best quality at a physical meeting and therefore we want to create opportunities for our vocational training teachers to be able to visit the students and conduct three party talk.\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\nFinding partners, apply and create procedures and processes to enable vocational training abroad is demanding resources. Since we are centralizing resources in a consortium will the schools in the consortium have the opportunity to send their students abroad to make parts of their vocational training. Each school can then move at their own pace with a few students where they can work with internationalization and work up local procedures and processes with support from centrally produced materials and key stakeholders. To use the period of time as a resource will allow the flow of students to be evenly distributed over the school year and the host partner can keep a good quality of time and our organization can handle the amount of students who then continuously becomes a smaller group of students.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nWithin IT-, retail- and handcraft- industry is constantly developing new technologies, both nationally and internationally. To give our students the opportunity to practice problem solving and exploring materials and techniques in another country can provide students with innovative ideas.

The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model.

Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 6700 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.\r\n\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to allow, since 2004, almost 16100 apprentices to benefit from a 3 week mobility project within the European Union, combining all trade sectors (industry, construction, baking, leather and textiles trades). \r\n\r\nIn order to institutionalize our actions, we manage to officially integrate the 3 week mobility project in to the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract for all our level 4 apprentices since 2009. \r\n\r\nFor 2018-2020, we would like to maintain this momentum and keep the objectives shared under our strategic development plan by sending again more than 1000 apprentices on group mobility projects together with their VET trainer (110 groups in total), 180 post-apprentices for a long term mobility (one year), 108 apprentices for 3-months to 9-months individual mobility \u2013sharing time between a company and a VET center in the host country, 60 post-apprentices on 2-week technical training courses and manage two different job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these actions Les Compagnons du Devoir are continually aiming to improve and since 2016 we have put in place our own quality management processes developed through the ISO 9001 certification. \r\n\r\nThe quality of our mobility projects relies greatly on the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest precise programs compatible with the apprentices\u2019 syllabus in France and with the specificities of the host country. This approach guarantees the relevance of our programs and reassures the employers of our apprentices, who could be concerned about the benefit of a mobility outside France.\r\nThese projects will allow the participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills as apprenticeships and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. \r\n\r\nOur partners involved in these projects are VET centers, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organizations in over 20 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in these countries, therefore most work placements will be renewed year after year. \r\nYears of experience with our partners allows us to organize our projects with mutual trust and better prepare each participant for their mobility.\r\n\r\nEach participant\u2019s skills and competences gained abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French VET trainer on our online training platform \u201cAquisav\u201d. We also would like to use ECVET system. With this in mind, our partners have already signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). \r\n\r\nAs part of this project our International Department will maintain relationships with partners, prepare and coordinate the monitoring and the validation of each project. They will also help their VET centers, in France, with the practical organization of the mobility projects for apprentices (short-term and long-term) and support post-apprentices following technical training or going abroad for one year (individual mobility).\r\n\r\nThis ambitious project couldn\u2019t be organized without the considerable investment of VET centers, in particular our VET trainers and administrative teams.", "http://www.avantages.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA116-046192_22"], [2014, "European Mobility project for Apprentices and vocationnal staff 2014-2016", "AVANTAGES EXPERIENCES LTD", 1370320.0, 21, 30, "Boarders of European Union are quicly expanding and the development of skills  for our European workers becomes essential nowadays.

They are in the vocational school preparing the \u2018baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel\u2019 in three years. They will be doing their work placement during their 2nd year (at the spring of 2019 or 2020). These volunteers are attending 2 extra hours of English class a week. Therefore they practise their English more intensively and they are more sensitive to the international opening. Most of the time, they are not familiar with trips abroad and often, they are not very at ease with communicating in English. So they live up this experience as a real opportunity which leaves a long-term mark.\r\nAll along their degree course, these pupils have to undergo several periods of work placements, and we noticed there was a real need to bring back together our students and the learning of foreign languages, especially English. Also, we felt the need to offer them a window on the world. Consequently we thought it would be interesting for them to experience an immersion in a company through a work placement related to their studies for a 5 week-period\r\nThe 2nd year of their school curriculum is the most appropriate moment for they have gained the professional autonomy necessary to work thanks to their previous work placements and they are not so much involved in the preparation of their exam and their course choice.\r\nOn the first week of the mobility, one of the teachers will stay with the candidates. This person will make sure they are well integrated to their new environment and to their company. Again, at the end of the stay, they will have the visit of a teacher who will, this time, assess the students in the companies and with the partners. \r\nTo get an insight into the culture of the country they are staying in, and to improve their knowledge in technical English, they will be offered about 10 hours of English. As for the Norwegian stay, the students will get lessons of Norwegian for beginners before they go. These spending are financed on our own account.\r\nThey must integrate the company which was attributed according to their professional field, curriculum vitae and cover letter. Then, they must fit in the working team, do the tasks expected by the tutor and the technical teachers.

On their baccalaureate diploma, they will get an added value thanks to the obtaining of the European distinction and the optional mobility unit. Finally, this experience will certainly give them more opportunities as for their course choice after the \u2018baccalaur\u00e9at\u2019 diploma and a better professional integration.\r\nThese mobilities have also a positive impact on our high school which is considered as a go-ahead school in terms of international opening: our recruitment is getting better, labels such as \u2018Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers\u201d and \u201cQualyc\u00e9e are renewed, links with the local companies are stronger.

First, we were aware of the necessity to bring back together our students and the learning of foreign languages, especially English. Also, we felt the need to offer them a window on the world.\r\nConsequently, a group of teachers and the board of directors decided to enrol in a mobility approach.

This sharing of tasks is visible on an organization chart. Also, we have created a working schedule based on our previous experiences and this programme constitutes our guide for the school year.\r\nRegarding our investment and the continually growth of our actions, our headmaster appointed a referent for the mobilities and granted 5 hours a week for this person. He also provided the team an office with a computer and a phone.\r\n\r\nThanks to our experience, we know that we can trust the seriousness and the efficiency of our partners who are with us from the beginning of this adventure. However, we are constantly trying to improve our existing collaborations and we are always looking for new partners.\r\nThe mobilities are intended for the first-year-students who joined the \u2018European section\u2019 of our school for the school years 2014 or 2015. The number is estimated at 63. These volunteers have 2 more hours a week in their timetable : one hour for an English class and one hour for the Non linguistic subject. Therefore they practise their English more intensively and they are more sensitive to the international opening. Most of the time, they are not familiar with trips abroad and often they are not very academic so they live up this experience as a real opportunity which leaves a long-term mark.\r\nAs they are in a vocational school, they must undergo several periods of work placements. We thought it would be interesting for them to experience an immersion through a work placement in a company related to their studies. The 2nd year is the most appropriate moment, for they would have gained the professional autonomy necessary to work.\r\n\r\nGenerally we organized this mobility on 5 weeks (3 in Norway), including a period of adaptation to their new environment. The participants will attend language lessons: about a dozen of initiation hours, either within our school, before the mobility (for the Norwegian and Swedish partnerships) or on site (for the other partners) so that our students get familiar with the technical English they will need during their work placement. We encourage them to open up to the host culture (visit museum, take part to different events such as Easter...). Then, they rapidly integrate the company which was attributed according to their professional field, curriculum vitae and cover letter. Then, they must fit in the working team, do the tasks expected by the tutor and the teacher.\r\n\r\nWe aim at several objectives but the main ones are focused on our pupils. What we principally expect is : the upgrading of their professional path, a better motivation to learn other languages, their improvement in English, better marks at their English exam. On their baccalaureate diploma, they will get an added value thanks to the obtaining of the European distinction and the optional mobility unit.\r\nWe noticed that most of the participants go on with their studies, find more easily a work placement or summer jobs in the short term, and in the medium term, we observed that they are better integrated in the working world.

Amongst the main initiatives introduced in Italy, in 2010 there was the proposal to take up the model of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). At the time of this proposal, it was clear that the training of the educational staff (both teachers and technical personnel) is fundamental to allow the introduction of CLIL into the Italian system.In line with this vision, the \u201cAntonio Rosmini\u201d Institute has identified the training of educational staff to be the key passage for the achievement of its development and modernization strategy. Therefore, the project aims to carry out two main activities for strengthening the professional competences of 15 teachers and 5 ATA personnel, namely some structured courses and some job-shadowing activities abroad in Avantages Experiences Limited \u2013 United Kingdom, New Deal Institute \u2013 France and the Cervantes Training S.L. \u2013 Spain for the acquisition of CLIL models to be applied to subjects such as Maths, Physics, Biology and Chemistry.

A direct benefit arising from the training of the administrative staff will enable the Institute to exploit better models and best practices used in Europe but adapted to the local context. Besides, an improvement of the language, communication and management skills will enhance a major awareness about cultural diversities as an enriching opportunity leading to w renewed collaborative spirit towards foreign partners.On a long-term view, it is noteworthy mentioning that a modernized teaching system with positive repercussions on the educational and training offer will lead to cause benefits on the preparation of the students themselves that will show more developed skills that are in line with the demand of the labour market, that shows to have a more competitive profile (combining both theoretical and practical knowledge) and that are willing to travel and work in European contexts whether for studying or working (thanks to the improved language skills).

Besides, the socio-professional profile of our area is predominantly composed of manual workers and economically non-active people, a situation which is often related to a difficulty for student in developing a successful and ambitious educational progress, taking into account high-achievement training possibilities and current and future opportunities of mobility. \r\nOne of our major missions is to broaden the horizons for the actors of the educational chain in our school. In this perspective, we do our best to provide our staff with the best possible opportunities of international development and outlook, while always bearing in mind a central concern of both our school, our academy, our country and Europe: How do we help our students to develop their ambition and create their own success in higher education and their professional life? \r\nSome staff may want to get involved in the already-existing relationship with European partners along collaboratively organised programmes and thus increase our European mutualisation and cooperation.
