This is an attractive alternative in alignment with current EC regulations that are demanding a significant reduction in the use of sulphur dioxide in wines.\nA novel continuous pressure change technology system to stabilize wine and wine must with high- pressure (500 bar), was successfully developed and validated at a 120L/h scale. This process provides a \u201ccold pasteurization\u201d process, with the advantage that heat-labile components, colour and taste remain unchanged. The novel PreserveWine system significantly reduced the amount of oxygen in wine, thus providing protection against oxidation directly after treatment and during long-term storage in barrels or bottles. Further positive effects including the protection of wine from colour changes and the maintenance of physicochemical and sensory quality of red and white wine and must be more extensively validated. The effects of various parameters such as gas type and retention time have been determined.\nAn industrial scale unit has been designed and specified.

Application of ozone via protein skimmers has become a costly component of RAS operation due to poorly designed equipment for ozone feeding, inefficient configuration of skimmers and lack of controlled ozone dosage combined with poor understanding of process.

Multitasking micromachining can be best described as the ability to perform multiple machining operations in one workholding configuration. This guarantees greater accuracy, reduced handling and plant area, faster throughput and increased productivity. The availability of several machining technologies on a single machine allows important synergies between the different machining methods. For instance, combining machining by chip removal and laser micro machine will provide the capability to remove (by laser) the burr remaining from the previous chip removal operation. Alternatively, chip removal machining and laser LIGA technique can be combined in order to machine small components that could not be produced otherwise.
