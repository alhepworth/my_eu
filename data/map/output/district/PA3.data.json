Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers. This data will collected in co-operation with Skills Development Scotland and published as part of the dissemination process.", "http://www.saintmirren.net", "Adjuvant Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036123_3"], [2018, "ST Mirren Apprenticeship Lifelong Learning", "The St Mirren Football Club Limited", 50494.0, 2, 2, "St Mirren Football Club wishes to send our Modern Apprenticeships on an Erasmus exchange to Malta to develop them personally, professionally and culturally and we wholeheartedly believe that this opportunity would give them an enhanced understanding of the professional game with the added value of supporting greater and broader employment opportunities within the EU market place.  Very few, if any, apprentices will succeed as sports professionals so this richness of experience will provide a life affirming opportunity to broaden horizons.\r\nThe apprentices will have some ability and talent but almost by definition will have demonstrated limited horizons and with a narrow perspective on the wider world and require both physical and mental stimulation to enhance their future career and employment prospects which may not be exclusively within the sports arena.  An exchange would provide this opportunity and would provide an invaluable broadening of horizons and the acquisition of transferable skills and enhanced personal CV.\r\nThe  apprentices will not have had the opportunity to experience warm weather training/coaching,  exposure and experience of  a healthy  and sustaining European diet, European cultural engagement or the understanding of a wider European employment market place.  All of this would improve their ability to learn and grow as an individual and as part of a collective group.\r\nAlmost all of the apprentices are from the local Paisley catchment area and according to the SIMD, the Scottish Government's official tool for identifying small area concentrations of deprivation across Scotland, Paisley\u2019s Ferguslie Park area sits at the very top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation tables one of the most deprived data zones in Scotland this area suffers very seriously from particularly high and growing levels of youth unemployment where a significant percentage of these are school leavers. Self confidence and lack of self esteem outwith the narrow focus of football is an issue for these apprentices who in many cases will have a poor or a very limited educational experience.  The exchange will allow participants to gain knowledge and experience in new methods of coaching and intensive training in a highly accommodating climate with a valued and highly experienced host partner with a ten year track record in developing this type of EU project and partnership.To provide a context for the participants many of these apprentices will not have passports and will not have been abroad before, therefore St Mirren Football Club aims to stimulate an added interest and mental stimulation to inspire and engage young people from the local community through this innovative high quality football,  educational  and cultural exchange programme.   An organised and well structured exchange experience will provide accountability, dedication, leadership and other skills.  \r\nParticipating in an intensive sports exchange sports has a positive influence in many areas for young people with limited  aspirations. Intensive  sport develops healthy living habits that provide physical benefits such as developing coordination, physical fitness and strength. In addition, raises their competence levels: personal skills, citizenship, intercultural awareness and language learning in a European setting. Furthermore, this project will help to positively assist our local youth and support local development by helping to create pathways for participants towards either further vocational training and/or work. \r\n\r\nAnother crucial aspect of the exchange is to allows us to match up with Luxol in Malta and learn from their EU developmental work , coaching, training and community engagement ethos.  This latter aspect is a key developmental aspiration for St Mirren. Enhanced local community benefits will also be an outcome of this exchange programme since St Mirren have a fully developed and growing local commuity football engagement programme within 5 local centres, including 4 local secondary schools.  Our apprentices are fully engaged with this network complementing the Scottish Government agenda of continually aiming to improve the sporting landscape through local communities.   In addition St Mirren runs \"Street Stuff \"in partnership with Renfrewshire Council, Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, and Engage Renfrewshire. Street Stuff is a much required diversionary project providing young people with an opportunity to have fun, get fit and active and meet other people their age.  This enhanced training opportunity of an EU exchange will provide further coaching and training expertise  for this engagement network. since the football apprentices are fully engaged in this delivery programme as part of their club duties.", "http://www.saintmirren.com", "The St Mirren Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047268_coordinator"], [2014, "Success Through Mobility.", "The St Mirren Football Club Limited", 40132.0, 2, 2, "A key factor contributing to the development of the skills gap between Scottish and European players has been a relative lack of interaction between our apprentice players and those at European clubs. This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 20 St Mirren FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Turkey. The Turkish host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Turkish and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Turkish partner and the associated local Turkish clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. St Mirren FC have recently completed a successful mobility trip to Turkey in January 2014 and this has formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people in Paisley and West Renfrewshire are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people in the region where many have poor records of academic achievement and are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in West Renfrewshire will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this regional shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. Football clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSt Mirren FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.", "http://www.saintmirren.net", "The St Mirren Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000417_coordinator"]]}}}}
