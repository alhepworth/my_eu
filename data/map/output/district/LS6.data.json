Hence an increased and well equipped Para-Disability Coach Workforce will increase the number of disabled people participating in sport and also increase the opportunities for performers to gain national representation. However, research within Para-Disability Coaching continually identifies the need for relevant coaching education and learning opportunities. Additionally, current Sport Coaching Frameworks which influenced the development of coach education, fail to grasp the complexity associated with coaching disability such as impairment specific functions, ethical coaching philosophy, promoting social inclusion and effective pedagogical practices. Therefore hundreds of thousands of Para-Disability coaches could be ill-preprepared to work effectively and also lack the eduction and qualification to enhance employability and mobility across the EU. Furthermore, the lack of coach education and learning could also be a barrier to new coaches wanting to work within this context. \r\n\r\nTherefore this Para-Disability Coach Education and Learning Project (PDCELP) seeks to enhance  Para-Disability sport coaches' learning, mobility and employment through the development of a Para-Disability Sport Coaching European Framework (PDSCEF), Para-Disability Massive Open Online Coaching Course (PDMOOC) and Course Study Guide.

The development of a suitably educated coaching workforce has been recognised as a priority area at the highest levels of European policy. The European Commission has also expressed the need to bring coaching qualifications into national frameworks and thus align them with wider tools such as EQF, ECTS, ECVET and EQAVET. Where coaching qualifications already sit within national frameworks, they tend to do so within the vocational education and training (VET) sector. Enhancing the quality and status of VET is a European Commission priority. Member States have made a commitment to investing in VET to raise the effectiveness and attractiveness of VET qualifications. These policies seek to increase the employability of people, reduce skills' mismatches, facilitate the transition into employment and promote personal development and quality of life (European Commission, Riga Conclusions, 2015). Coaching qualifications must therefore be re-considered in light of these developments. This is specially true in the case of youth sport. Approximately 80% of the 6-10 million coaches in Europe work with children. Most importantly, the majority of them are not qualified or hold low level qualifications. Those qualified tend to hold a generic qualification that does not prepare them to work specifically with 5-12 year-olds. As a result, there is a vast skills-gap between the world of coach education for coaches of children and the needs of the labour market. In turn, children are not receiving high quality coaching which increases attrition rates and reduces the chances of sport having a positive impact in their life. To start solving these issues, iCoachKids proposes the following project outputs:1. Report the children\u2019s coaching workforce in the seven European countries represented in the partnership to better understand its demography and needs 2. Case Study Compilation to capture examples of best practice in the education of children's coaches in VET.3.

A supplementary goal is to increase access of persons with a disability to self-defence learning experiences, an important outcome in light of evidence that persons with a disability are often targets for violent crime, including homicide, assault, rape, and robbery across Europe.Specifically, this proposed programme seeks to develop, trial and implement a coaching framework for coaches of the martial arts working with disabled people. The project aims to build on the evidence demonstrating the importance of coaching quality in promoting positive sporting experiences. It would ground the new framework on the lived experiences of disabled people (both those who have and have not experienced martial arts instruction), a strong understanding of national and Europe-wide policy and legal expectations for coach education, and interactive web technology.The PRIME partnership is a unique consortium of international agencies, organisations representing a range of martial arts styles, and from different EU Member States. In addition to groups at the forefront of inclusive practices in the martial arts, such as the Disability Karate Federation and the International Taekwondo Federation, the partnership includes the International Council for Coaching Excellence, the UNESCO Chair \"Transforming the Lives of People with Disabilities, their Families and Communities, Through Physical Education, Sport, Recreation and Fitness\" at Tralee Institute of Technology, Ireland; the Sports Coaching Science with Disability", "http://www.icce.ws", null, "erasmus_579775-EPP-1-2016-2-DE-SPO-SCP_6"], [2015, "Sport Psychology as a strategic tool for prevention and training on grassroots sports", "INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR COACHING EXCELLENCE", 277248.0, 5, 14, "Racism and violence challenge the fundamental values of European political and cultural integration. Equally, racism and violence in sport jeopardize the role of sport as an important contributor in the fields of education and social inclusion and its capacity to generate jobs and economic growth. Sport is a growing social and economic phenomenon which makes an important contribution to the EU's strategic objectives of solidarity and prosperity. However, sport is confronted with a number of threats from which athletes and citizens in general need to be protected, such as violence, discrimination, intolerance and manipulation of results. Based on these ideas, general objective of PsyTool project has been to take full advantage from the implementation of the Sport Psychology as a strategic tool to promote integrity and tackle violence, discrimination, intolerance and match-fixing among young practitioners of grassroots sports. To achieve this goal a complete methodology was established and has been followed by partnership.After the development of a research phase with the purpose of identifying the state of the art, next step from a methodological point of view was the identification of \"Agents of Change\" (coaches, trainers, teachers, referees, parents, journalists and others stakeholders responsible for the delivery of grassroots sport), selected to take part of the PsyTool training program.The next important milestone was the creation of the Web Educational Tool \u2013 PsyTool Platform, created to train the \"Agents of Change\" and the elaboration of training materials for them. Then, the implementation phase started. It was integrated by 2 main activities, which impacted into main project direct target groups: \"Agents of Change\" and final beneficiaries (young practitioners of grassroots sports). These activities have been: \u2022             Training period of \"Agents of Change\" (both online and face-to-face trainings). In overall, 158 Agents of Change completed the training program. \u2022             Pilot Workshops to young practitioners of grassroots sports: This allowed to test the benefits of PsyTool training and evaluate the results, with the aim to improve and enhance its impact. A total of 189 young athletes took part in the 2 pilot workshops with Sevilla FC and Sporting Clube de Portugal. Finally, a powerful dissemination strategy has been developed. The great showcase for dissemination and transference was the presentation and announcement of the results of the project during the ISSP 14th World Congress of Sport and Exercise Psychology, held in Seville (Spain), 10-14 July 2017, with around 1.000 participants from more than 60 countries all around the World. Summing-up, in the last 20 years multiple programs have focused on teaching life skills to foster positive development, promote social responsibility in general, and prevent violent behaviours.

Previous EU projects focused on awareness raising campaigns and suggested that match-fixing is a relatively unexplored research area that requires more systematic empirical study; prevention efforts should be evidence-based and multidimensional, and multiple stakeholders should be involved. Project FtF was developed in order to address each of these areas by developing a European-wide strategic partnership between academic institutions and sports organizations, in order to empower and strengthen the fight against match fixing. Project partners will work together with those at risk for match fixing in order to develop an innovative, web-based education tool (FtF Tool). This web-based tool will target those at risk for match fixing, and will be used as an educational resource for effective interventions.The objectives of FtF project are to: 1. Measure public and stakeholder atittudes, values, norms and expectations towards match-fixing as a threat to the integrity of sport. 2. Identify trends in match-fixing discourse and public views at a massive scale by analyzing public and open social media data. 3.

Austria in general and especially Carinthia live from the interdependence with the European and international economic and cultural areas. Accordingly qualified young people are urgently required here. At the same time we want to continue to internationalize our education that already conveys a strong international component. We also believe that in this way we can counter tendencies towards stronger national differentiations with positive experiences with international exchanges. Aims:The emphasis lays on the development of occupational competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. The interns are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills as they are deployed in enterprises of great interest and quality. Consequently their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, their qualifications are increased to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more multifaceted society in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.Participants and activities:In the first year of the project probably 6 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part as \u201cpioneers\u201c in this special project. They will carry out economic activities, for example in a hotel, a welfare institution and a language school (office, marketing, event management, customer service, reception, \u2026) in the United Kingdom for six to nine weeks. In special workshops they will be prepared for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management accompanied and assisted by the project team, teachers of diverse subjects and our language assistant-teacher. Later on the experiences will be passed on to a larger target group in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026). In the second year of the project the number of internships will definitely will be raised. There is a tangible interest of students and relevant traineeships so that we expect that the internships for 2017 can be fixed in time.Implementation:The Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. Our English assistant teacher Lewis Hamilton is intensively involved in our project and he strongly supported us in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation facilities and he will also coach and assist our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.The application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.Expected results and consequences:Mainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.Also the participating institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees (respectively the involved partners) who will improve their competences in international project organizations. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.Moreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.Long-term benefit:Our project is just at the beginning. We want to extend it in the course of the next years and we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education. We hope that we will be able to inspire motivated young people for this opportunity and to make contributions that our region will also be able to unfold its potential in Europe in a better way.", "http://www.englishsteps.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016446_5"]]}}, "4LD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "EU - grenzenlos sozial", "Meanwood CofE Primary School", 29236.0, 5, 8, "With this project we want to give our students the possibility to fulfill their obligatory internships within the EU.
