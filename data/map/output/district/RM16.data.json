We also wish to improve the effectiveness of the school's Spanish curriculum in order that children leave the school in Year 6 able to communicate basically, yet effectively, in Spanish and have gained an understanding of the Spanish culture.\r\nIn order to do this the school aim to send the school's languages coordinator on a two-week, immersive training course in Spain. The aim is that the coordinator will be able to improve her own language skills, experience the culture first hand and be able to bring artifacts back to the school, gain experience in planning effective language lessons, and make connections with teachers and schools in Spanish speaking countries with which the school can develop future curriculum projects. \r\nThe coordinator will then be able to return to the school and use the new learning experiences, alongside her previous languages training at university, to guide colleagues in delivering effective language lessons that engage the children. The coordinator will also be able to support colleagues in increasing their confidence to use more target language in lessons. The coordinator will continue to improve own language abilities building on the basic level attained so that training may be provided regularly. Regular sessions will be held for teachers to share the impact the training has had on their lessons.\r\nIn the long term we aim to work on projects with Spanish speaking schools  in English and Spanish to give pupils first hand experience of communicate in Spanish with a native speaker. We also aim to integrate our use of the Spanish language and knowledge of Spanish culture further into our curriculum.", "http://www.woodsideacademy.org", "Woodside Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002065_coordinator"]]}}, "2PX": {"nhs": {"data": [["R1L", "Thurrock Community Hospital", "nhs_R1L50"]]}}, "2WU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Special VET 2018", "Treetops School", 126252.0, 11, 13, "Special  VET 2018, the second VET project for Ljubljana School for the Deaf after receiving the Quality Charter.
