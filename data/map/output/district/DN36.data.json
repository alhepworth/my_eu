The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs. The project will be the first nationally co-ordinated programme of action for the species, working with 29 colonies (about 65% of the total population) in 15 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the Natura 2000 network.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4755", "http://www.littleternproject.org.uk/,", "life_87"], [1999, "saline lagoons  - Conserving saline lagoons & their birds on ten Natura 2000 sites in England", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1108104.0, 554051.0, "Saline lagoons are a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive and now total just 1300 hectares within the UK.  They are subject to ongoing degradation and loss through natural and man-induced processes.  Threats include development pressure, pollution, erosion, disturbance and disruption to salinity and water exchange processes.  \n\nSaline lagoons also provide nesting sites for internationally significant concentrations of terns (Sterna spp.) and gulls (Larus spp.) and feeding and roosting sites for migrant populations of waders and wildfowl.  Breeding populations of the avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, an Annex I bird, are virtually confined to this habitat in the UK.  Threats specific to the bird populations present on the sites include vegetation encroachment, erosion, predation and human disturbance. \n\nBecause of the importance of the habitat, a saline lagoons action plan has been established as part of the UK\u2019s Biodiversity Action Plan.   The aim of this LIFE project was to give a significant initial boost to the plan by maintaining and enhancing the conservation of saline lagoons and their birds on 10 English Natura 2000 sites.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=470", null, "life_229"]]}}}}
