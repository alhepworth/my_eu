However European SMEs are continuously being confronted with the dual challenge arising from the trend towards increasingly complex geometries coupled with intense pressure on market prices.\nStill the state-of-the-art to manufacture complex shaped glass optics is not efficient enough to meet the requirements of mass production sufficiently. The process requires large amounts of energy and manual work resulting in a very time-consuming and expensive process. Therefore the European SMEs pull for new technology developments enabling them to build up a new and improved process chain which allows for an efficient and economically viable glass optic replication.\n\nThe key to success in developing an efficient integrated production chain for complex optics is to mould optics directly from a gob of molten glass. By moulding directly from a gob of molten glass reheating of glass is obsolete saving large amounts of energy. Due to the precise cutting of glass gobs no subsequent mechanical processing is necessary and the amount of glass waste will be reduced to almost zero. In order to provide the SMEs with this efficient and economically viable production chain extensive developments are necessary.\n\nThe project CENTiMO will start with a detailed analysis of the gobforming and the moulding process. Based on this the RTD Partners Fraunhofer IPT and Glass Service will develop a suitable melting and gobforming process which is able to form gobs which can directly be moulded into glass optics. In parallel, the glass moulding process will be developed. In order to achieve the required quality and mould lifetime new mould materials will be evaluated. Finally an evaluation and qualification of the developed processes will give decisive feedback for the improvement of the whole process chain.", 179432.0, 896173.0, 4, 6, "CENTIMO", null, null, null, "fp7_110698_952890850"]]}}, "9XF": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Living with the sea  - Living with the sea : Managing Natura 2000 sites on dynamic coastlines", "English Nature", 1814120.0, 907061.0, "There\u2019s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_216"]]}}}}
