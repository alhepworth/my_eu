Several reports and studies on Industry 4.0  highlighted that there are many gaps in levels of competences and certification of workers. In the automotive sector the critical point lies in the fact that it is not clear which will be competences required in 3/5 years, which will be job-profiles needed by companies.

The target group of this Training Course are youth workers, who either live in rural areas in need of development or in urbanized areas. Rural regions often provide few possibilities and little infrastructure for the local youth, who thus often abbandon the areas or suffer from isolation and, eventually, even from addictions to narcotics or mass media. The urbanized areas, on the other hand, might offer more infrastructure and opportunities, but the youth has easier access to and is subject of criminal behaviours, experiences the struggle of those moving to the cities hoping for a better future and is  thus more aware of the unfair distribution of wealth and opportunities focalized in cities. The objective of this Training Course is to find new and innovative ways to create new opportunities for young people in rural areas and empower them to implement such means and structures theirselves. By sharing examples of best practices from different countries, by developing ideas and solutions and promoting the exchange of knowledge, active citizenship and entrepreneurship, the participants become more aware of the dangers of such negative developments, learn to see the need of change and, above all, create a set of tools and measures to find solutions for their individual and common problems.
