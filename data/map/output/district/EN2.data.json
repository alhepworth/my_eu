Traditional cloud security has been based on assurance to customers that cloud providers follow sound security practices. As a result, current security mechanisms are commonly located within the cloud platform, hence compelling customers to trust cloud providers. However, customers might be reluctant to outsource sensitive data due to lack of control over data storage and management. To reach its full potential, cloud computing needs solid security mechanisms that enhance trust in cloud computing by allowing cloud customers to have a greater control over the security and privacy of their data. Moreover, it is also necessary to consider countermeasures to ensure that vulnerabilities or attacks do not have a negative impact on cloud security and that applications continue to operate and provide a good level of service even during an attack.\n\nThe main objective of CLARUS is to enhance trust in cloud computing services by developing a secure framework for the storage and processing of data outsourced to the cloud that allows end users to monitor, audit and retain control of the stored data without impairing the functionality and cost-saving benefits of cloud services.

The recommended treatment up to now for absorbing these nutrients was bathing in Epsom salts, a procedure that calls for a considerable amount of time, water and electrical energy.  \nMgSO4 Ltd (UK) has developed and patented MgSpa, a new revolutionary alternative to electrical showers, which enables the user to quickly and effectively absorb the necessary Magnesium and Sulphate through the skin, while at the same time ensuring huge savings in water (97% less) and energy (80% less). The MgSpa makes the Epsom salt treatment an easy low cost everyday habit, like taking a shower.\nThe concept behind the product is to make use not only of the therapeutic properties of the salts, but also of their cleaning ability. So far, the use of soaps made water recirculation in showers impossible and the showers\u2019 water and energy consumption significant. The innovative product uses Magnesium as a cleaning agent and recirculates and reheats shower water to create an invigorating shower experience with minimum environmental impact.\nThe Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy and planning all activities for deploying a large scale pilot supported by a large hotel/spa chain.

We will develop a pan European curriculum for non-verbal intercultural trainings, synthesizing the experiences of our partners in different areas of training and creativity, such as theatre, dance, humor therapy and storytelling. This project is crucial in terms of Europe\u2019s relationship to migrant communities and other minorities, especially under the current political and social tensions all over in the Continent.\r\n \r\nIntegration of migrants and other minorities is not a simple question of willingness. Lacking of basic skills for communication strongly hinders the mutual understanding between migrants and other social groups. Communication barriers also include difficulties related to cultural differences even when people understand the language.\r\nThe integration of vulnerable groups in European societies is a challenge that transcends borders, and requires a pan-European, multi-agency strategy as a response.\r\n \r\nThe main outcome of the project is therefore a European training module, offering new approaches for both governmental and non-governmental agencies in responding to these highly significant challenges. Other intellectual outputs will include a synthesis of good practices, an online platform of intercultural training, and a documentary film presenting the different stages of the project implementation. All these will be disseminated through local multiplier events allowing user organizations to benefit from the findings and methodologies.\r\n \r\nMore than Words will follow a three years long project circle oriented on work packages, intellectual outputs, milestones, staff trainings and transnational meetings. The leading of work packages will be divided among the partners, a system that will ensure that all partners will take an active role and responsibility in the implementation of the project.  Work packages will take place parallel and in deep interaction with each other. Within them the main project activities will be as follows:\r\n-      organization of five staff trainings that, based on an initially prepared guideline and needs assessment, will present four methods of non-verbal intercultural training and their synthesis;\r\n-      creation of a pan European training module in strong interaction with the trainings, tested at local multiplier events;\r\n-      creation of an interactive platform of intercultural training;\r\n-      creation of the different parts of the documentary film all along the project circle;\r\n-      dissemination of the project\u2019s results, among others, at the local multiplier events.\r\n\r\nOur project is based on a strategic partnership of like-minded organizations across Europe, working with migrant and disadvantaged communities, to develop and share practice to create a collective working methodology in intercultural training. The project lead partner, Border Crossings is a UK-based organisation working in intercultural dialogue through vocational education and performing arts.  It has developed strong creative methodologies to encourage understanding between cultures through theatre and creative learning practices. The partners\u2019 approach, experiences and areas of work are different and complementary.  The partnership is composed of two main groups according to their main roles in the project: the needs assessment group is composed by 3 organisations having a direct experience dealing with the needs of migrants and vulnerable groups: Narud and AEL and dla Ziemi. The training providers group will contribute with their innovative methods of non-verbal intercultural training: Border Crossings for theatre performance, CRN for digital storytelling, Euro-Net for humor and clowning strategies and IKTE for dance and body movement therapy. They will provide the staff trainings, create the synthesizing training and report based on the needs and accompanied by the monitoring activities of the first group.\r\n \r\nMore than Words will have a direct impact on 87 participants of the trainings obtaining a certificate, on approximately 5000 people visiting and/or joining the online training platform, and on all the associated partners and organisations participating at the testing of the training module and signing the letter of intent to use this curriculum in their training activities. The project will have an important indirect impact on migrants and people in vulnerable situation benefiting of the new methods of empowerment to be used by the trainees of the workshops.

The partnership aims to affect the practice of VET and education for refugees and migrants in Europe across a range of sectors and countries, both by directly influencing training providers and educational institutions, and by influencing policy-makers.  We expect to influence (through the recommendations and good practices) European discourses on teaching and learning for refugees and migrants.

The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. \r\n\r\nThe EVS project will take place in three Leonard Cheshire services, located across the UK: Fethneys, Bradbury House and Arnold House.  The project involve 6 volunteers, 2 volunteers per every service and will last 12 months with starting dates in March and May 2016. The volunteers are aged from 22 to 29 years old and  come from Egypt, Germany, Greece and Spain. \r\n\r\nVolunteers selected for this project have background in social work, psychology, education or engineering and logistics and have previous personal or professional experience supporting people with disabilities.

This is achieved through the following objectives:\r\n1. To introduce new, diversified activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective\r\n2. To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals and with accessing local community services and leisure activities\r\n3. To promote local and international volunteering\r\n4.

Activities include but are not limited to: arts and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, movement, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraising, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes.\r\n\r\nDiversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community. This will improve residents' confidence which we envisage will lead to long term benefits of getting residents to do things like volunteering, organising events, talking about disability issues in the local community and be more involved in decisions made locally and nationally in regards to the care sector and disability issues.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally. In addition, participants will improve their life skills and key competences through working and communicating with diverse people and gaining a better understanding and solidarity with people who face barriers to participate in society.
