ETNA will facilitate the improvement of the overall quality of NCP services across Europe in the area of transport \u2013 thereby making future calls more accessible for all stakeholders and contributing to an improvement in the average quality of proposals submitted. This will be accomplished by carrying out a series of well-coordinated tasks and measures. The project will benchmark the activities of the Transport NCPs with the goal of identifying best practice and pinpointing existing weaknesses within the NCP network. Identified weaknesses will then be addressed by a multifaceted training programme aiming at efficient eradication of deficits and an overall improvement of the performance of NCPs \u2013 on both the individual and network levels. ETNA will also develop effective tools and activities for the entire Transport NCP network aimed at raising awareness about the network and the services it offers as well as increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to support potential participants in their search for qualified partners. Finally, the project will work to improve contacts and communication with other networks and organisations with the ultimate goal of securing a sustainable flow of information of benefit to the European transport research community. All of these efforts will contribute to achieving a greater coherence of approach to NCP work and to the achievement of a high level of service in all countries participating in the Framework Programme.'", 307238.0, 1764177.0, 13, 15, "ETNA", null, "http://www.marinetechnology.co.uk", null, "fp7_89905_999581218"], [1356998400000, 1451520000000, "European Transport Network Alliance", "Cliff Funnell Associates", "The European Transport Network Alliance-ETNA Plus-is a 3 year coordination action that will build upon the activities and knowledge acquired in the ongoing project European Transport NCP Alliance (ETNA) with a new and wider approach reflecting the new political context and the priority given to Europe 2020 and to the Horizon 2020 objectives. It will also take advantage of the positive results of TransNEW and MARKET-UP FP7 projects and, to avoid duplication of efforts, will make use of existing data and information, collaborating with the TRKC (Transport Knowledge Research Centre) and CORDIS PS.\nThe overall objective of ETNA Plus is to foster innovation in trans-national cooperation in Transport with a focus on promoting the active participation of new actors and regions in EU research calls and projects. Transport NCPs will be key players in this mechanism, but their role will be complemented and enhanced thanks to the contribution of other relevant stakeholders, which will bring to the project a real added value both in terms of knowledge and expertise.\nETNA Plus will also seek the active involvement of 56 Associated Partners (APs) nominated officially as Transport NCPs.\nETNA Plus will target transnational cooperation through different activities, following a two-fold approach; on one side, specific initiatives to raise awareness on the EU transport R&I landscape will be carried out, on the other side, efforts to improve the level of expertise on EU funding (e.g. Horizon 2020) will be undertaken both at NCP and researcher level.\nTo this end, the proposal foresees: the development of a web tool on EU funding opportunities, both public and private; an analysis of innovation strategies implemented in the industrialized Countries; the support to stakeholders to build trans-national consortia and the reinforcement of Transport NCPs\u2019 and researchers\u2019 expertise through ad hoc training and twinning measures; networking with other initiatives relevant to transport R", 141706.0, 1503221.0, 14, 21, "ETNA PLUS", "http://www.transport-ncps.net/", "http://www.marinetechnology.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148171.jpg", "fp7_104533_999581218"], [1209600000000, 1296432000000, "European Network to Support the Sustainable Surface Transport SMEs", "Cliff Funnell Associates", "The strategic objective of the Star-Net transport is to increase the participation of surface transport-related SMEs in the surface transport programe.
