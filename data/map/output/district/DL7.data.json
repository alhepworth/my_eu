However, this is not the case. SOTERIA innovates the approach to the dynamics between PSOs and citizens in emergencies, allowing (i) the understanding of the impact social media entails in emergency management systems; (ii) the use of all communication channels in emergency situations, including social media, to the benefit of PSOs and citizens, (iii) the exploitation of mobile platforms\u2019 ubiquity to locate and effectively communicate with citizens in distress and (iv) the leverage of PSOs\u2019 levels of shared awareness and performance, benefiting from citizens\u2019 social media information.\nJoining companies, universities, research laboratories and a wide community of expert end-users across Europe and beyond, the SOTERIA Consortium is one of the Project\u2019s strengths, having solid competences and experience developing research and development projects.

The result is often a weakening of institutions, an undermined economy and a loss of confidence in the rule of law. This project will undertake research to create and develop secure interoperable situation awareness platform for the EU to combat organised crime and terrorism. The project will use technical (non-personal) ballistics data and crime information initially but will also demonstrate how migration to other data sources can take place. The project will automatically combine data from disparate high volume data repositories for cross correlation and automated (and semi-automated) analysis with data from different cultural/domains with multiple reference models using real-time data feeds and historical databases. Intelligence will be extracted using advanced semantic knowledge extraction and data-mining to facilitate appropriate, fast and responsible decision making and alerts. The platform will develop and demonstrate a trust management and security system, controlled access and an automated reporting tool for cost effective operations as well as providing the policing of existing information systems. The platform will enhance mutual co-operation, security and sustainability across the EU and is supported by EUROPOL, the police and other end users as a being urgently required.
