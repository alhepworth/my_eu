While until a few years ago, it was small to medium-sized enterprises that were active mainly at regional level, it is now high-tech companies acting on a global basis that predomi-nate. This increased internationality can be seen in the job de-scriptions and vacancies: Working in international teams, multi-lingualism and international work experience are increasingly sought-after and ever more important job qualifications. Moreover the entry into professional life is getting harder for young people. If they can provide professional experience, the chances of get-ting a job are better. Additionally, the requirements at school are growing. In the international branch, where most students come from, three languages are taught. Thanks to the internship the participants could improve their English marks greatly, i.e. this project is essential in helping students on their way to a success-ful graduation. Therefore, especially under-performing students were addressed when the project was presented.\r\nAs the school has a high number of students with migration back-ground, this project makes an important contribution towards in-tegration because for the first time students experience what it means to be a 'foreigner'. That is why the project should have the following benefit. The internship is supposed to support the stu-dents in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 quickly finding a job and being integrated into the business world after graduating\r\n\u2022 learning important administration skills \r\n\u2022 improving language marks of low performance students or rein-forcing the knowledge of good students\r\n\u2022 feeling what it means to be foreign and dealing with cultural differences, which is an important experience in order to become open-minded towards other cultures and to contribute to a good integration at their school \r\n\u2022 experiencing the core values of the EU (free movement of per-sons, free choice of work) \r\n\r\nLast year the HAK/HAS (business college) Lustenau provided 29 students with the opportunity of attending an internship abroad - the year before there were only two students. (Unfortunately, on-ly two students grabbed this chance.?) Due to the project-evaluation of the last year we decided not to extend to Spain/France but to improve our current English partner-network. We organized a new group-offer for financially disadvantaged families and we tried to find a new partner in Malta (at the stu-dents\u2019 request). Furthermore we would like to offer an traineeship for a disabled student. The project contains the following central steps:\r\n\r\nConsequently, there are now 32 participants. In order to reach this goal, the following activities have been conducted:\r\n\r\n1. Interviews with students and partners in order to evaluate the previous project\r\n2. Revision of the organisation and implementation of the intern-ship-project\r\n3. Extension of the group offer and first-time internship-placement for disabeld students\r\n4. Systematic information and preparation of the students and parents\r\n5. Integration of the project into the course design and pedagogic concept of the school in order to increase its significance\r\n6. Improvement of the partner-contact through personal meetings and on-site support. \r\n7. Improvement of the involvement of English teachers\r\n8. Spreading information on the project to at least three feeder schools (BACK to SCHOOL)\r\n9. Detailed documentation and evaluation of the project man-agement\r\n\r\nThe following effects are intended:\r\n\u2022 increasing the employability of students\r\n\u2022 increasing the entrepreneurship-competence through enforce-ment of the students\u2019 independence and self-organisation\r\n\u2022 increasing integration ability\r\n\u2022 advancement of the project/internship-quality\r\n\u2022 increasing the school\u2019s public notice as an international school.", "http://www.optimaprogrammes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039031_2"]]}}}}
