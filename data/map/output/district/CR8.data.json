Different levels of learning abilities, different inclinations and interests, different emotional and affective states, different multicultural and linguistic complexities coexist within the same class, together with the presence of students with a varied spectrum of specific learning disorders or severe disability. \r\nThis context requires, by contrast, a new school which will configure itself as a humanized, highly inclusive and integral space, built on the importance of the single human being as a person, his peculiarity and potential, empathy, solidarity and collaboration. School must be able to become a training place for democracy, implementing mutual acceptance and enhancement.\r\nIt is therefore an essential priority to direct the educational practice towards full effectiveness, activating concrete operational mechanisms, improving the quality of the daily process of teaching - learning and creating conditions of effective equality and opportunities. \r\nDiversity (linguistic, of cultural models, intelligence or skill) is often perceived and evaluated in negative terms, as a weakness. The risk is that such diversity can be transformed into inequality of opportunity and results.\r\nRecognizing and giving value to diversity in the class becomes a matter of social justice and a way to ensure that every student has the right to study and the right to have access to effective opportunities in order to be able to choose and design their own future. It is therefore important to create the conditions for the realization of fair educational contexts, in which all students will have access to diverse learning environments, multiple resources, different points of view built on stimulating, flexible and innovative curriculum. Learning, understanding and problem solving are processes that need to take place in an environment of equality, in which each student will have the real chance to attain the best possible results.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to create an innovative and sustainable MODULE OF INCLUSION that will overcome the barriers and constraints of a static and traditional school system. This will result in building an innovative, multi-dimensional, multi-level and inclusive educational world that will be responsive to the needs of all and of each student, a reality without limits and with no spatial and pedagogical barriers. \r\nStudents will be the protagonists of the project, assisted by the whole school community, teachers and school helpers, families and local communities, in order to involve all stakeholders in a shared process of change. The diverse situation within our schools makes it necessary to focus on the students as a fundamental resource for the teacher in terms of learning potentials and cohesion of the group.\r\nThe methodological choice, therefore, that best responds to the idea of an inclusive and inter-cultural school is \"social mediation\".\r\nThe methodologies in social mediation, while providing moments of transmission, involve a change of perspective: from the traditional vertical teacher-student interaction to the horizontal student-student, where skills are actively built by the same students, rather than passive reception of information. \r\nIn this context, the use of methods of social mediation such as Cooperative Learning (Cooperative learning) or Peer Tutoring (peer mentoring) are particularly effective strategies to build on the relational, cognitive, intra-personal (strengthening of self-awareness and self-confidence) and interpersonal levels (development of trust in others, the ability to negotiate the information, to build an empathic relationship). It is understood that these positive trends are not \"spontaneous\" in students, but represent a goal where the mediation of the teacher is fundamental. Teachers must, therefore, build a strategy through their daily work that creates habits for effective cooperation, and explicitly, through feedback that induces in students a progressive degree of awareness of the progress that is made.", "http://www.tmore.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013858_1"], [2016, "Art Attack Across Europe-Making A Difference By Sharing Art", "Thomas More Catholic School", 64797.0, 4, 4, "Involving approximately 300 students of mixed abilities, diverse national, cultural ,social and religious backgrounds this project aims to engage young Europeans in artistic activities, enabling them to  learn about contemporary art in Europe,  to explore and exchange ideas and concepts and work together,sharing views, tastes and artworks , promoting intercultural dialogue and active citizenship, and  thus learning to appreciate cultural diversity in Europe and the common cultural wealth shared in Europe. The project  involves innovative methods such as peer learning, practical workshops, group work and group discussions,  using apps , the eTwinning site, designing screen savers or making videos. Activities include a range of learning acitivities such as Street Art workshops, painting, designing Tshirts , body painting, photography, dance and drama workshops. Other activities will be visiting art museums, going on guided street art tours, creating a piece of art together, making videos, planning and designing presentations and exhibitions, designing a logo for the project and creating and publically displaying a message from young Europeans to Europe. By engaging in and sharing art, we intend  to foster intellectual curiosity , tolerance , team spirit and common values. Promoting  creativity, entrepreneurship, language skills, communicative skills and teamwork  at a European level will help our students to acquire skills they will need to be able to compete both in our economic area of Europe and in our globalised world. Working in groups and during peer-learning they will become efficient users of English as a foreign language and will acquire other second language skills , such as French, German and Portuguese. During presentations and exhibitions they will learn presentational skills and while being involved during the organisation of the project and planning exhibitions our pupils will improve and learn management  skills. By discussing contemporary artworks in the individual countries, pupils and teachers alike will be able to learn about cultural differences and common values shared by all participants. This will lead to more cultural awareness and tolerance. By taking part in this project, it  will help both very talented and also weaker students to achieve their full potential and motivate them to engage themselves more in school work. As a school with a special focus on Art and Crafts on our curriculum the Modellschule Graz , but also our partner institutions which all have very strong Art Departments, will have long term benefits fom the project, with activities being able to be repeated with other students  in the future.

The institute has been participating in linguistic investment courses for several years thanks to the funds provided by the EU, thus expanding the possibilities and opportunities of our students. The majority of the students present difficulties in the linguistic abilities in their native language, becoming an obstacle to be able to correctly assimilate the learning contents.\r\nThe teaching of foreign languages is our top priority, therefore, we focus all curricula on the improvement of students' linguistic competence (language teaching, teaching and learning methods), innovation, independent learning and performance improvement. the students in the exams. We include in our project proposal an increase of the competences, abilities and sensitization on the part of the teachers, insisting on the informative background of the teaching, the development of didactic materials and the planning of their classes.

Attaining the goals that define elimination of malaria in different countries depends critically on provision of effective antimalarials and further that these antimalarials are used appropriately in individual patients. Drug resistance is a major threat to malaria control and has important global public health implications. Over the past decades the genetic bases for resistance to most of the antimalarial classes currently in use has become defined. For some drugs and combinations, these mutations are the most important predictors of treatment failure. This proposal will innovate new technologies to confirm malaria diagnosis and detect drug resistance in malaria parasites by analysis of mutations in nucleic acids, using nanowire technology, and will result in the development of a simple, rapid and affordable point-of-care handheld diagnostic device. The device will be useful at many levels in malarial control by:\n\n1. Optimising individual treatments for patients\n2. Assessing the epidemiology of drug resistance in malaria endemic areas\n3. Assessing population impacts of antimalarial interventions\n\nThe development programme capitalises on highly original and proprietary advances made by QuantuMDx in the field of point-of-care diagnostics.
