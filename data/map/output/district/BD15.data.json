These will be addressed to youth workers, teachers, volunteers, researchers, administrators and anyone working in the youth field or interested in these themes.Implementing multiple training events gives us the best opportunity to reach our project objectives, which are to:\u2013  promote, through intercultural methods, non-formal education in youth work focusing on the three topics of; Active Participation, the Environment & Sustainability and finally, Life Skills.\u2013  gain new practical knowledge and competences in NFE.\u2013  share our strengths and best practices in NFE.\u2013  connect, explore and have a better understanding of how NFE is used by different actors in different fields of education and in different cultures and countries.\u2013  develop new NFE methods on our three chosen topics.\u2013 create high-quality videos documenting all aspects of this multi-measures project, such as:> a launch video, made during the first meeting, with interviews of the coordinators and trainers, footage of us working and presenting thoughts about what is or what should be non-formal education in our opinion.> during each of the training courses we expect our participants to create 5 NFE methods and each of these will have a video made about it, which will cover its implementation, a live-action demonstration of the method and if needed animated graphics to further explain the details of the method.> a final documentary video capturing the entire multi-measures project, with clips from each of the events, interviews of new and returning participants, etc.These activities will take place in different countries, according to the abilities and availabilities of the members of the partnership.In January, a kick off meeting will be organized in France, hosting nine persons, all members of the partnership and trainers that will be involved in the training courses. In February we will launch our first training course in Italy, with the wide and so interesting subject of Non-Formal Education and Active Participation. In April, the Romanian partner will host the training course about the Environment & Sustainability. In June, we will implement the last training course in Spain, which will be about Life Skills. Each training course will last six days, and gather together thirty people in total.As the finale of this multi-measures project, we will organize a Seminar Event at the end of August to disseminate and share our results, creations and ideas we have built throughout the preceding months.In total, considering all the activities, we hope to gather around 150 participants around this project.All the meetings will be video recorded, with interviews of trainers and participants, filming the different tools and methods used and documenting the different sessions. For the majority of sessions, we will use non-formal education methods, as well as tools from project pedagogy, debating, brainstorming, self-assessment and evaluation to create a collaborative and nurturing atmosphere.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-3-FR02-KA105-010774_1"], [2015, "Professional Video, Positive Impact", "Impact Videos", 20915.0, 6, 6, "The project 'Professional Video, Positive Impact' is a training course financed by the European Commission through Erasmus+ which will take place in Bradford, United Kingdom.

The training course will take place on 18-27 August 2018 in Bucharest, Romania and will involve 24 participants (4 participants per each country and aged 18+) from the 6 countries participating: Bulgaria, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Spain and UK.\r\nThe project is designed for youth workers who will be selected from our partner organizations. We will not actually be looking for participants with experience in digital storytelling or technology. In fact, this training course will be more for youth workers with few or lack of experience in this field, who are directly involved in working with youth from disadvantaged backgrounds, rural areas, with limited opportunities or special needs, YWs who are interested in their professional development and willing to share their experience, to improve their knowledge and digital skills.\r\nContext: Young people living in rural and disadvantage area, with limited opportunities or special needs can barely enjoy the benefits of technology-assisted trainings on digital skills due to the existing gaps in infrastructure and equipment, software and platforms, and limited teaching staff and resources. Young citizens from all over the world need to be equipped with digital competences and complementary skillsets and capabilities if they want to leverage existing and emerging technologies for development, to reach personal goals in their personal or professional life, and to be prepared for the jobs of the future.\r\nAccording with the latest researches, we are currently facing a mismatch between the requirement for digital competencies and the lack of digital skills among youth people in emerging markets. \r\nTherefore, we need to prepare the young generation with adequate digital competencies to understand, adopt, creatively use new technologies and create new content for a sustainable development in a digital world. \r\nBriefly the main idea of the Let\u2019s digital storytell! is for participants to: \r\n 1. learn the fundamentals of the digital storytelling process and apply it as a modern educational method and that can be replicated when working with young people \r\n2. explore digital storytelling from the perspective of digital marketing, using it as an alternative to traditional videos for the promotion of NGOs, and to also use digital stories to shape and evolve organizational branding, increase visibility to reach more young people and in developing marketing campaigns \r\n3. and to ensure a strong foundation in 21st century skills (visual/global/digital literacy) by creating digital stories that required minimal experience and equipment (e.g. digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, basic camera etc.) but with a high impact towards the audience.\r\nThe main aim of Let\u2019s digital storytell! is to develop the digital storytelling competences of youth workers and young people. To accomplish our goal, we set the next objectives:\r\n^1 During the 4 months of the project, 24 PAX will improve their knowledge of creating a story, identifying specific needs of YP, teamwork, communication skills, planning, critical and logical thinking through digital storytelling.\r\n^2 During the 4 months of the project, 24 PAX will develop their digital competences, improve and practice their skills in digital storytelling, of using mobile applications and computer-based tools for editing images, text, audio narration, video clips, and music, and by creating 2-5 minutes short 6 digital stories.\r\n^3 After attending this project, 24 PAX will know how to apply digital storytelling in working with YP and in creating digital stories for promoting their NGO.\r\nThe training sessions were built around effective methods that will support the participants through their learning process being a mixture of non-formal education methods, learning-by-doing, group learning, experiential learning, digital storytelling activities, plus an interactive, inspirational and enjoyable study visit to National Museum of the Romanian Literature. During the 10 days of the TC there will also be many team building activities, reflection sessions, evaluations, follow-up and dissemination of the results events. Thus, our 24 trainees will be challenged to create 2-5 minutes short 6 digital stories and to do this, they will use all the knowledge and skills they have learned during previous training sessions.\r\nAlso, participants will prepare and host dissemination events, and will develop \u201cLet's DS\u201d booklet that will contain precious resources about digital storytelling, it will be freely available on issuu.com and published online via press releases, on the project Facebook page and website.\r\nFrom a long-term perspective, we expect that more youth workers and young people to adopt digital storytelling as a powerful educational method and as a resource to boost digital competences, and to see more digital stories used by NGOs in promoting their activities.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-RO01-KA105-048757_4"], [2017, "Professional Video Positive Impact 2", "Impact Videos", 13120.0, 6, 6, "The project 'Professional Video, Positive Impact' is a training course financed by the European Commission through Erasmus+ which will take place in Alicante, Spain.

They are highly motivated to embark on this new learning journey, and keen to make a lasting impact within the school. Given the priority that at least one language must now be taught at KS2, we are focussing on developing teaching practice in KS2 only. However, we have a longer term view to involved the whole school, and will carry out training for EYS/KS1 and those not directly involved in project i.e. TAs to develop their language skills and enhance their cultural understanding.Thus teaching and learning will be improved through participation in this project, and standards of language delivery will be enhanced through new experiences and learnings. Lessons will be planned, taught and assessed to a consistently high standard and French language will be embedded into every day routines, and not just spoken in designated lesson time. Use of new technologies will be integral to the teaching and learning of French, as well as the communication between link schools in France.There will be an enhanced awareness of the significance of languages spoken in our school, and local community. We will celebrate the multicultural diversity that is characteristic of our school, and use the project to raise awareness of the importance of French as a key international language.
