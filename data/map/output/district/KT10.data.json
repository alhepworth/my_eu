This will be delivered by the combined development of the joining processes itself, welding experiments, computational modelling, material and joint characterisation and testing, using laboratory tests and full-scale field testing in industrial or commercial test tracks. The project will offer a step change in the joint performance and reliability providing an extended in-service life for a range of rail materials, therefore resulting in a significant cost reduction in maintenance of the track, also freeing up more capacity for rail traffic.\n\nNew variants of the aluminothermic and orbital friction welding processes will be developed, which will both reduce the width of the heat affected zone and minimise the loss of mechanical properties in the weld zone. These innovations will enable the use of bainitic rail steels which will deliver an increased reliability, a longer lifetime of the rails and welds combined with a reduction of the maintenance cost.\n\nThe project addresses the specific call topics by:\n- Development and application of advanced joining technologies, able to join conventional and bainitic rail steels with a higher quality and reliability, to meet the more stringent infrastructure requirements imposed by increased speed and load, resulting in less maintenance and a longer track lifetime.\n- Reduction of maintenance cost and life cycle cost of the rail and welds, due to less repair welding associated with a higher weld quality and the longer track lifetime.\n- Increased availability of the track; less unforeseen maintenance.\n- Profit for users: less disruptions and a higher safety level. \n- Use of a more environmental friendly and energy efficient joining techniques.", 647868.0, 3473281.0, 6, 10, "WRIST", null, null, null, "h2020_193381_983486105"], [1296518400000, 1359590400000, "Long range inspection and condition monitoring of rails using guided waves", "Jackweld Limited", "The objective of MONITORAIL is to develop a cost effective long range ultrasonic inspection and also a wireless condition monitoring system in order to improve and better maintain the European railway system for better efficiency and safety. This will be carried out through the development of the Long Range Ultrasonic technology which has a certain number of advantages: sufficient inspection time, cost compared to the conventional ultrasonic testing, 100% inspection coverage (rail\u2019s head, web and the foot). This project will develop a guided wave LRUT system not only for rail inspection but also for real time monitoring of the rail and to create an intelligent railway infrastructure. Flexible sensors will be embedded in the railways and a collection data system will be developed and integrated on the existent systems. This will also extend the life of the materials through early repair of rail tracks. The rail track is a natural wave guide where waves could easily propagate for long distance and detect defects in different area such as the web the head and the foot. Moreover long lengths of rail track could be detected at once making this a cost efficient technique for continuous monitoring. The system will offers 100% coverage up to 50m from one single location. Multiple sensors will be used to cover long distance inspection. Significant technical issues need to be addressed and solved before this technology can be considered a viable and industrial solution. The prototype demonstrations to date have shown promising results but have been limited to static testing. Any loss of signal or momentary surface interference results in a signal that is similar to that of a defect, thus the potential of false positive indications is high, which could severely impact the efficiency of overall inspection.

During operation, the graphite and other carbonaceous materials like carbon brick, pyrocarbon and silicon carbide coatings are contaminated by fission products and neutron activation. These irradiated carbonaceous wastes are problematic due to their content of long-lived radioisotopes (e.g. Carbon14, Chlorine 36) and due to their large volumes. About 250000 t of i-carbon are existing, worldwide. Acceptable solutions have not yet been established to handle this kind of waste. This fact also represents a significant drawback for the market introduction of graphite-moderated reactors like Very/High-Temperature Reactors (V/HTR) as a promising Generation IV system candidate.  Graphite moderated reactors represent the very first generation of nuclear reactors and therefore need to be decommissioned ahead of other reactor types which evolved later. Presently, accelerated decommissioning of GCR and RBMK and subsequent disposal of i-graphite is the preferred option for not leaving this waste as a legacy for future generations. The CARBOWASTE project aims at an integrated waste management approach for this kind of radioactive wastes which are mainly characterized as Intermediate Level Waste (ILW), due to the varying content of long-lived radioisotopes. Methodologies and databases will be developed for assessing different technology options like direct disposal in adopted waste containers, treatment & purification before disposal or even recycling i-carbonaceous material for reuse in the nuclear field.
