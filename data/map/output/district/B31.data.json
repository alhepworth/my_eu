Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_11"], [2018, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION", "Bournville College of Further Education", 319905.0, 8, 38, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION represents the ideal continuation and expansion of the previous edition of WORKSTAR project. The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented. The commitment continues:\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of language training and certification courses in various languages (participation in the MOVE 5.0 projects financed by the ESF Veneto Region);\r\n- in the promotion of CLIL methodology and job shadowing activities abroad (ETwinning)\r\n- in the upgrading and improvement of hosting services\r\n- in the implementation of tools for the management of all phases of mobility\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of cultural exchanges and stays abroad also through the consolidation of European networks", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006482_36"], [2014, "Work Experience for Social and Health Care Assistant Students and PA Students, 2014-2016", "Bournville College of Further Education", 133061.0, 10, 23, "In the departemental order for the vocational educations in Denmark it is pointed out that the vocational educations have to provide the students with knowledge about international conditions as a basis for employment and education abroad.

The Colleges involved have cooperated in various projects since 2006. The total number of students in the colleges is over 5000, which explains the amount of grants applied for, as well as the number of receiving partners.\r\n\r\nThis project is is a continuum to projects Work, Skills and Costs , year 2010, and  Work, Skills and Costs 2, year 2012. The cooperation in the earlier projects has been impeccable. Nivala Vocational College is a new partner in this project.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to increase the the students\u2019 professional skills and cost awareness and to compare the living costs and labour expences in the host countries. In addition, the students will study how ergonomics, the principles of sustainable development, and health and safety regulations are realized in their training enterprises. The project also encourages the students to improve their vocational, social and language skills. The results are tables of eg. the cost of one employee to the employer, description of the working hours and holiday practices, or food, living and travelling expences in the host country. Ergonomic tasks are realized in picture reports, video clips etc. Reports will be used eg. in entrepreneurship studies and when preparing new students for training abroad. In the previous projects the objectives proved to be extremely beneficial for the participiants, so we will continue with the same goals and disseminate the good practices to the new partners.\r\n\r\nThe experts involved in the project will be chosen from different study fields, so that the impact will be as wide as possible. The exchanges will take place mainly during the students\u2019 on-the-job learning periods, so it is possible to monitor the students abroad. The participation of the enterprises is made easier by sending the participiant abroad together with a vocational teacher. Working abroad will help the teacher to get new ideas, and to find possibilities to develop their work methods and equipment, and thus also enable the school to respond to the needs of the working life and the students. A well-functioning cooperaton network is essential when realising this. This project will bring new know-how and expertise into the colleges involved. The length of each staff exchange will be 3 to 7 days, depending on individual needs.\r\n\r\nA common challenge in all fields is the rapid internationalisation, which sets new demands for the education, as well as the working skills of the students. Especially in the Raahe area the need for staff with good language skills and international abilities is increasing due to the nuclear power plant being built. Working with foreign people is increasing everywhere. Especially the entrepreneurs in the metal and electronics industry require that the students will aquire the skills needed for working abroad already during their education. In the restaurant business it is essential to have good language skills and to be able to understand foreign cultures. This will also help the students to be employed in their home region.\r\n\r\nThe length and content is tailored according to the student\u2019s individual needs. Based on previous experiences, the exchanges take place in September-November and March-April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome examples of the studies and host countries:\r\n\r\n- Metal engineering: TIG-welding, industrial maintenance in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain\r\n\r\n- Electrical engineering: industrial automation processes, smart home and control systems in Germany, Spain, Turkey\r\n\r\n- Vehicle engineering: common rail systems, hybrid technology in Germany, Spain\r\n\r\n- Construction, Heating plumbing and air conditioning: repair construction, smart technology in Spain, Poland\r\n\r\n- Hairdressing, catering: customer service skills, trends in the field in Italy, Great Britain, Portugal, Hungary\r\n\r\n- Laboratory students: environmental protection, clothing chemistry, water processing in Hungary, Portugal, Spain\r\n\r\n- The mobilities of the students with special needs will emphasize language skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach mobility will be validated with a Europass, and the placement abroad will be fully accredited for the student as a part of the studies.\r\n\r\nThe participating organisations will benefit from the network and the experiences of the partners.

The beneficiaries are mainly Directors, Administration Staff, teachers and trainers of the sending organisation.\r\n\r\nConsidering the recent institution of Musical Lyceums (2010-2011) and its new innovative training structure, it is necessary to compare the school and university systems in Europe in order to: \r\n\r\n\uf0d8 Acquire a major comprehension of ways and polices of education and training systems in  the musical sector among European Countries;\r\n\uf0d8 Create changes in order to balance European training paths;\r\n\uf0d8 International connection for Italian Schools and for the Italian education system; \r\n\uf0d8 Improve the quality of the work place and of the activities of the students;\r\n\uf0d8 Increase professional and career development of our teachers;\r\n\uf0d8 Increase the knowledge of foreign languages; \r\n\uf0d8 Promote major motivation and satisfaction with work related daily tasks. \r\n\r\nThe areas of improvement which mainly interest the net of partners are mainly:\r\n\uf0d8 Organisation in order to enhance quality; \r\n\uf0d8 Management competences; \r\n\uf0d8 Staff competencies; \r\n\uf0d8 Methods of teaching in Europe;\r\n\uf0d8 Language competences;\r\n\uf0d8 Organisation of training, teaching and learning; \r\n \uf0d8 Relationship with local communities.  \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives of Eugymus Project are: \r\n \r\n- Broaden one\u2019s knowledge and comprehension of policies and national/international procedures;\r\n- Foster the definition of a professional training in the musical sector, shared at the European level;\r\n- Define the common criteria for the definition of professionalism in order to select teaching staff;\r\n- Create changes in order to update and internationalize the Musical Lyceums;\r\n- Connection between formal and non-formal learning, professional training to prepare for the work place;\r\n- Strengthen the quality of teaching and of learning;\r\n- Promote a training path in order to create an European Curriculum for the European Musical Lyceum;\r\n- Create a Final Report of good praxis to spread through the portal and through all national and European institutions in the musical sector.\r\n\r\nThe Eugymus project develops those issues and problems that Musical Lyceums are facing nowadays and these are mainly: \r\n\r\n1. Finding suitable teaching staff; \r\n2. Planning and Organization of classes\u2019 timetables;\r\n3. Employment chances. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the sending organisation is to create a lasting partnership with other training providers having similar curricula and being compatible in terms of teaching and learning with the Musical Lyceums. \r\nThe project will help the school to put into practice the experience acquired by the participants, through benchmarking and through the exchange of good practises. \r\nReceiving partner are schools, public and private bodies of the following countries: Denmark, Germany, Hungary and the United Kingdom and their expertise will be of high value as they have developed already knowledge and skills in the musical training of other European students of the same age range of the students of the Liceo Marconi and they can support and advice the sending organisation with what relates to the 3 main area of interest: \r\n\r\n1) Management of Training\r\n2) Methods Use and implemented for training\r\n3) Selection and employment of qualified teaching staff and trainers. \r\n\r\nThe project will last one year and the main activities are: \r\n\r\n1.Preparatory Activity: \r\nThis is about the language and cultural preparation. Training activities will involve all staff: Directors, Administration Staff, teachers and trainers. \r\n\r\n2. Activity for Professional Development: \r\n\r\nJob shadowing/observe for 2 week time the colleagues working in foreign institutes/schools. \r\nThese will be the activities carried out: \r\n\r\n- Job Shadowing Activity;  \r\n- Exchange of professional experience with foreign colleagues; \r\n- Acquisition of new strategies of teaching, evaluation, organisation and management;\r\n- Meeting with local communities to exchange cultural ideas about the music sector, this will include meeting with in orchestras, choirs, theatres, Concerts, Musical bands. \r\n\r\n3.

In effect, its role is, above all, to deliver core training of a technical and professional nature, which is of particular importance for today's world of work (and already in place at the school thanks, above all, to the work placement training programme), transferable skills, life skills: group working, effective communication, cooperation.\r\nIn line with the aims of the national \"Garanzia Giovani\" programme, of increasing employment and employability for youngsters, the school's training program and the associated guidance activities for school leavers fulfil a critically important role, alongside the hard skills learned in the classroom. Indeed, through training and other experiences from interacting with the world of work, it is possible to conduct trials and to validate the development and acquisition of the skills needed to enter the workforce, by optimising the concept - as the European Union has called for on several occasions - of skills as applied knowledge, in action.\r\nFrom this point of view, the \"real world tasks\", which companies devise with the school's representatives and assign to the students, play a central role. In the real world tasks, which are tangible and challenging workplace scenarios, the school's representatives identify with representatives of the companies training links and synergies with the school curriculum, thereby creating the conditions for an effective validation of the training programme, measured in terms of knowledge acquired.\r\nTo this end, three of the key competences for citizenship proposed by the European Union are used as reference:\r\n\u2022 learning to learn: ability to organise one's own learning;\r\n\u2022 sense of initiative and entrepreneurship;\r\n\u2022 social and civic competences.\r\nIn short, training experience and guidance initiatives occupy an essential place within the school's education offer, underpinning a number of key aspects:\r\n\u2022 in relation to employability, analysis and management of performance in a pro-active and problem-solving approach, as part of a virtuous cycle with the skills acquired in the classroom;\r\n\u2022 as an opportunity for meta-reflection and self-assessment, highlighting overlaps between technical and professional knowledge and life skills linked to active citizenship;\r\n\u2022 in the personal pathway to actively seeking work.\r\nTo ensure that the school's guidance and work placement policies are sustainable, lasting and effective, we are applying for this project to grow the number of guidance teachers, the school's future career team, which, as part of a plan of work shadowing abroad, develops and refines the following professional competences, to be spent in the actions/steps/phases of guidance for school leavers:\r\n- analysis of the demand in terms of expectations and requests from students leaving the school;\r\n- definition of a skills assessment, using the tools made available by the AlmaDiploma programme and others which will be acquired as part of the experience of work shadowing abroad;\r\n- ensuring the transparency of the student's \"training record\" by building on experiences and skills acquired in non-formal, informal and formal contexts;\r\n- creating, to match demand and emerging skills, a personal career plan towards university or the workplace;\r\n- preparation, monitoring and final reporting of experiences from the work placements organised by the school in collaboration with the host companies; \r\n- career tracking for one or two years from finishing school;\r\n- longer-term: redefinition of the active pathways curriculum at the Martini school, using transferable skills profiles connected to the professional profiles of school leavers.\r\nThe bidders are the 15 teachers who are currently involved in the guidance activities, for both new admissions and leavers; they include various different key individuals in the school: staff, holding instrumental roles, responsible for activities relating to the development of the informal and non-formal student curriculum, vocational career plans, relationships with universities and with the world of work.\r\nThe teachers, using the active learning \"by doing\" methodology, will support colleagues who have proven experience in a European context and with this far-reaching and active approach they will instil the following in the school and the network of schools in the Rotaliana area, of which the Martini school is part: seminars, workshops, discussions and above all the spreading of best practice within the school, between colleagues who will be key to the growth of the project's results.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036010_1"]]}}, "2AP": {"nhs": {"data": [["RRJ", "Royal Orthopaedic Hospital", "nhs_RRJ05"]]}}, "2TS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1425081600000, "Cognitive Rehabilitation of Apraxia and Action Disorganisation Syndrome", "Headwise Ltd", "Neurological patients due to stroke may suffer from disrupted action due to cognitive deficits which prevent them from maintaining independent lives.

This policy framework is being implemented and is to a large extend operational. Concrete results and improvements are made compared to the previous years and these results are clearly visible. In 2017 is a central international information point is set up, the website GO Abroad! is made operational, a digital guideline is developed, an expertgroep and workinggroup (including all sectors) are operational and several workshops and promotional activities are carried out. This has led to a growing enthusiasm for international activities in the organisation. \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nInternationalisation fits in the overall policy of Gilde that everybody should be able to graduate as being \"internationally competent\".  Internships abroad are not the only way to realize this. It is also about integrating internationalisation in the study programs. For example via minors, language courses, guest speakers from abroad, excursions etc. (internationalisation @ home). For Gilde, it is an opportunity  to provide for students an added value on the labour market and to provide them more insight in other cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nFor the next coming year, Gilde Opleidingen has the objective to improve both the quality as the quantity of internships abroad. Both for students as for staff, at European level and at Euregional level. \r\nIn concrete terms, the following points of attention are defined:\r\n- strengthening the sectors in the proposal and collaboration;\r\n- further implementing internationalisation in the policy of Gilde;\r\n- attention for intercultural and language skills in the educational programs;\r\n- strengthening and optimizing the central information point of Gilde;\r\n- strengthening the communication and collaboration structure internally;\r\n- promoting internships abroad as an option for professionalisation for staff and teachers;\r\n- promoting working and learning across the borders with the Euregio (Germany, Belgium).  \r\n\r\nThe activities that are defined to realize the objectives are already put in place in 2017 and they will be continued in 2018.  Keywords are: SENSIBILISATION, COMMUNICATION  and SUPPORT. Collaboration will take place both at internal as external level. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nIn the call 2018, the following numbers of students and staff are included:\r\nstudents short term: 96\r\nstudents ErasmusPro: 85\r\nteachers and staff: 39 \r\n\r\nThe total number of participants is increased significantly compared to the previous years. One of the reasons is a growing enthousiasm of students and staff, due to promotional activities, active collaboration and a workshop for staff. It seems that there is a growing motivation for mobility and an improved trust in the coordination, the organisation and the realisation of mobility activities. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nBased on experiences of previous years, it is proven that an experience abroad is an added value for both students as for teachers and other staff. Not only in a professional way, but also in a personal way. By executing a part of the education in a context abroad, the complexity of the learning process increases considerably. This is something that we can never achieve within the safe environment of an educational institute. The students are better prepared for the labour market and are also less vulnerable on the labour market. For Gilde this is important towards the companies in the EUregio. Companies just across the border have a growing need for well trained and skilled people and Gilde can foresee in this need. \r\n\r\nThe experiences in this project will be evaluated (also via the particpant reports) and on the basis of the results of the students. This provides input for the preparation and the evaluation and for the improvement of the working processes. \r\n\r\nLONG TERM VISION:\r\nIn some of the VET programs it is almost a \"must\" to have international experiences. This is esepcially the case in the hospitality sector (tourism).\r\nHowever, as described earlier, an international experience offers more than only professional experiences. Therefore, an international experiences is relevant for everybody should be part of more VET programs at Gilde, so that everybody can leave the educational institute internationally competent.
