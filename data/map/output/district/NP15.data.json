At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced.

In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators.

During the period they strengthen also their personal skills and facilities, which thee need also more widely in the working life and in the society. When planning the periods and during the periods the students get rehearsal in problem solving skills and communication skills in a foreign language. The period develops flexibility and adaptability to work and live in another country and culture as well as the ability to accept the challenges. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the staff training periods abroad the teachers get the possibility to follow and observe the trainng in the partner VET organization and to get familiarized with the working places in their professional field and the life of work in the partner country. Thus the staff mobility periods serve the enlargement of the professional skills of the teachers. Through the staff mobility also the practices of the recognition of the on-the-job learning periods abroad and usage of learning outcomes approach are developed.

The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.   This is CollegesWales' first application for staff mobility funding and CollegesWales is the organising partner and 7 FE colleges with 8 partner organisations based in Wales.  CollegesWales will also be sending participants on this visit.  Detailed explanations as to how this project will be managed have been clearly specified within this application in the appropriate sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to gain an overview of the Finnish education system and the positioning/status of VET within that system\r\n\r\n- to have a detailed understanding of VET structure (proportion of work based learning/classroom learning, VET qualifications/levels)\r\n\r\n- to gain an understanding of quality assurance in the Finnish VET system (internal inspection processes/teacher observations and assessment of teaching & learning)\r\n\r\n- to observe innovative lessons in a Finnish VET school and to discuss and share examples of good practice from both countries\r\n\r\n- to understand how staff Continued Professional Development is organised in relation to improving teaching and learning\r\n\r\n- to explore Finnish standards of literacy and numeracy in comparison to those in Wales (PISA) and how this is embedded into the VET system/how is it assessed\r\n\r\n- to gain a better understanding of PIAAC to help formulate Wales' decision to take part in this in the future\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nThere are 18 participants involved in this staff mobility project:- 11 of the participants are from seven Further Education colleges and one participant is from a private training provider (all of these organisations are based in Wales) - these are the sending partners/partner organisations.  All of the participants are responsible for putting strategies in place to improve teaching and learning within their organisationsCollegesWales is the organising partner and is submitting this application on their behalf as well as sending 5 participants from CollegesWales' Improving Quality Group.  The European partner is Helsinki Vocational College who has provided CollegesWales with a letter of intent commiting themselves to organising an appropriate training programme for the participants in Finland.   The Helsinki Vocational College has worked for a number of years with Coleg Gwent in Wales on learner mobility programmes.  CollegesWales has  offered a reciprocal visit to Wales for Helsinki Vocational College staff in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities that will take place\r\n\r\nThe visit will last 5 days - 2 days travel and 3 days training - an outline of the proposed training programme is in Section G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\n\r\nParticipants will return to their partner organisations & report on the visit to the senior management team at the college - there may   be ideas that could be immediately put in practice and ideas that need to be considered in more detail or piloted before putting in to action but the main reason for implementing or piloting these ideas is that they will lead to an improvement in teaching and learning within that organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollegesWales' Teaching & Learning network will provide a national forum for discussing the training that took place in Finland and deciding on what aspects could be progressed within the network.  In addition, with the involvement of Welsh Government and Estyn representatives who are also members of the IQG, the longer term picture may see changes implemented at policy level to improve teaching & learning.", "http://www.coleggwent.ac.uk", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000496_3"], [2017, "Staff Mobility 2017", "Coleg Gwent", 2311.0, 2, 2, "Vocational Staff Training Mobility.\r\nThis will develop a new partnership looking at curriculum for children with additional needs across Europe. It will allow staff to deliver their curriculum in a broader international context.\r\nThe wider aim is to broaden the participants employment opportunities throughout the UK.  To encourage them to look at employment in other EU countries that are desiring English Speaking employees.  To learn the impact of social policy and to experience different approaches to the vocational area to additional learning needs.  The participants will be encouraged to develop their interpersonal soft skills and improve their professionalism during the placement in preparation for their future employment. These are opportunities that not all learners will have the opportunity to access during their life due to socio-economic factors. \r\nThe participants will develop a knowledge and understanding of vocational skills and approaches adopted by other European countries; it will encourage personal development and afford an opportunity to experience an culture.  It is anticipated that this experience will result in increased confidence and motivation for the participants and future recruits.  The success of this will be disseminated to other colleagues and departments with the hope of attracting future participants, broadening the local community and the College.  The potential for long term benefits will hopefully be the successful recruitment of learners to vocational education and their understanding of the EU opportunities for future employment.\r\nThe presentation of the Europass mobility will show that the students had a chance of a courageous adventure in order to enhance their success in their employability in future job markets.", "http://www.coleggwent.ac.uk", "Coleg Gwent", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035827_coordinator"]]}}}}
