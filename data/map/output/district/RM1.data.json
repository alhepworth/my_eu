The partner schools, which are in Germany, Portugal and Great Britain, want their students to work with the term \"European values\" and understand its theoretical and pragmatic dimensions.The pupils of all schools notice the consequences of these changes at their schools: in Germany > refugees who are at school; Portugal> economically deprived students who cannot take part in projects offered by the school due to the economic crisis; Great Britain > socially deprived students who have to learn at the school`s own \"educational farm\" what it means to accept rules, show respect, and attend lessons regularly. Against the background of these problems, which all students are aware of , the schools and the students will be encouraged to stand up for rights which are fundamental of a democratic society.The target group are students of about 15 years and teachers who represent social sciences, geography, history and foreign languages.The methodological approach is based on the questions all schools share: \"What are our values? What are our common values? How can we learn and teach values? How do we show our values? How can we improve? Why are common European (universal) values so important for a peaceful life in Europe?\" In order to discuss these theoretical questions and to learn about and experience solutions in real life, the innovative teaching/learning approach of \"International Service Learning\" was chosen to combine lessons and service learning in an international environment. All three schools will bring in their own point of view (refugees, economic crisis, inclusion) and will conduct their own project in a constant exchange with the partner schools. Essential parts of this approach are project learning and team work on an international level where the students will learn what it means to plan a project together, to take responsibility for each other and to achieve results which have a positive impact on society. The students will also come into contact with different types of organizations in their own country and abroad. During the meetings, they will not just visit them but also work with representatives, members, do interviews with them, etc. and hereby experience how theoretical contants, which they learned at school, are put into practice.Apart from that the \"tandem-method\" and methods of linguistic and cultural mediation will be used to prepare the students for theirmeetings abroad.The main product will be a film which shows the history of the European Union as a union of common values, the different projects connected with the organizations trying to give an answer to the question \"How do we show our values?\". This film will be presented in public and can be used in the local community and at school.At the end of the project, which will last two years, there will be a final conference in the UN style.All schools involved will collide all results and summarize them in a best-practice guideline which will be used a a common ground to develop a concept to integrate refugees and help economically and socially  deprived students. This guideline will be implemeted in the schools` curricula.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-023003_2"]]}}, "4HL": {"nhs": {"data": [["RF4", "Victoria Hospital (Romford)", "nhs_RF4VH"]]}}, "4YY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Transformer et innover notre p\u00e9dagogie pour rendre l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve acteur de sa r\u00e9ussite", "Bower Park Academy", 22107.0, 6, 6, "Initiated by teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e Renaudeau in Cholet (France), this project entitled 'Transform and innovate our teaching practices to turn students into active learners' aims at developing non-formal and innovative teaching methods in order to develop active learning among students. It will give the opportunity to the participants to go and observe the teaching practices existing in other European countries so as to integrate them in their own teaching practices. All the participants to this project share either an interest in developing our international partnerships for those who work as teachers of a foreign language, or an interest in renewing their practices in order to adapt them to the profile of our students. It will contribute to reducing educational inequalities, often based on the difficulties of students to master foreign languages and also a difficulty to conform to a constrained school environment. The skills we will have developed during our training or job shadowing sessions will be  reused and set up in collaborative teaching projects, with the creation of pilot classes with which we will develop different teaching approaches, like the cooperative class and practices based on advances in neurosciences, but also co-teaching with English-speaking teachers. The first training session on the subject of non-formal education will take place in Rome at the end of November 2018 and the following job shadowing sessions are due to take place between January 2019 and April 2020.  Our partners are 'Enjoy Italy' in Italy, 'Colegiul Tehnic Mihai' in Romania, 'Hermann Hesse Oberschule' in Germany, 'Bower Park Academy' in the United Kingdom and  'Gimnazia Brezice' in Slovenia.", "http://www.bowerpark.havering.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA101-046608_4"]]}}}}
