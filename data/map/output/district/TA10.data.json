By knowing more of our neighbours, applying more to learning from the digitized world in which we live and bringing learning alive for our rurally-based students, we intend to live up to our motto\u2019 Conemur\u2019 as we encourage students and staff to move from \u2018trying\u2019 to \u2018striving\u2019. \r\nKey teachers will take part in intensive training courses and schools visits, coming together with like-minded teachers from UK and overseas. They will focus on areas such as language and culture, visual narrative in teaching literacy, an IT enhanced classroom, efficient use of TA and support staff, learning from Finland's school system (which has consistently come at the top for the international rankings for education systems). On their return, they will be tasked with sharing and leading innovation for our mastery curriculum.  We want to bring the best to our students, so they\u2019ll leave us well equipped for life in modern Britain. We want teachers to feel ownership of their teaching and that they\u2019re building a foundation for widening their own experiences and practices as well as sharing with others.\r\nContext/ background of project:- \r\nHuish Episcopi Academy Improvement Plan identifies that to prepare our students for life in modern Britain, we need to sustain quality at all levels within the Academy. We set a priority of developing our team of educators to drive and lead on high performance in teaching and with high expectations of learning.

The school is recognized by school quality marks  from British Council\u2019s International school award, by Pearson\u2019s Global Learning Programme as an Expert centre / CPD hub school and SSAT\u2019s Lead Practitioner recognition, so we needed to identify a project that built on teacher expertise yet opened new opportunities for innovative training opportunities and collaboration to bring best of benefit to our students. Erasmus + has been identified by the school as providing an efficient and innovative source of staff training, where external funding will support the professional development of school staff (including non-teaching staff) in participation in structured intense, training events overseas with a professional visit to a school for observation of professional practice and an opportunity to make educational links for future partnership work.\r\nObjectives of project:-\r\n1.

Run teacher-led planning and curriculum sessions to create new international learning activities\r\nIn total  6 participants, ranging from Management posts to regular teaching staff and Teaching assistants will attend structured training courses in France, Spain, Finland. \r\nThe project methodology encourages participation, sharing of good practice and reflection of teaching methodologies applied in the classroom, language and methodology-specific classes, cultural sessions and cultural visits with examples\r\nof activities to use with pupils, a school visits for observation of practice and an opportunity to make educational links for\r\nfuture partnership work.\r\nImpact:\r\nenhanced teaching and learning\r\neffective use of ICT in teaching \r\ndeveloped strategies for employing effectively teaching assistants  and support staff\r\nmore innovative and creative teaching\r\nOur dissemination include:\r\nLSAs will carry out mini training to other LSAs\r\nVisual literacy workshops to raise performance in support to Special Needs and Pupil Premium students, especially with the use of effective questionning\r\nFrench and Spanish knowledge \r\nFinnish education will target curriculum development learning for 2017-2023 \r\nSEN enhance our provision to PPM and vulnerable students\r\nICT enhanced classroom literacy to help with development the geography curriculum, particularly in terms of map work, home learning opportunities  and cooperative learning within the classroom.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits /legacy of the project are:\r\n1.
