Partners identified successes of a transnational project in improving the quality of teaching and raising pupils\u2019 motivation, achievement and success. These partnerships had allowed our organisations to develop and reinforce networks, increase our capacity to operate at transnational level, share and confront ideas, practices and methods.  It was agreed the emphasis of an Erasmus+ project should be to work with and learn from each other to support the development and implementation of innovative teaching and learning practices in our schools.\r\nFollowing audits of our school priorities we agreed a project based on learning about and sharing innovative teaching and learning methodologies and approaches in language and literacy in our partner schools. This will include emergent native language and writing, oral competence, reading, teaching language to pupils from foreign countries, creative writing and teaching modern foreign languages. The project aims to share, disseminate and develop tools for assessment of such competences.\r\nThe primary objectives of the project are: to work with and learn from each other to improve language and literacy through the development and implementation of shared and innovative teaching, learning and assessment practices in our schools, improving the competences and skills of our teachers and leaders; to address under-achievement in literacy through a range of effective, innovative teaching methods; to learn about and understand the different approaches and methods used by the various partner countries or regions in the teaching of language and to support the development and effective use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the teaching and learning of language in our schools.\r\nOther objectives include creating a project that motivates and includes all pupils including those with special needs, language difficulties and from different cultures and backgrounds, providing opportunities for pupils to collaborate 'virtually' and in a 'face to face' context and to create resources that can be used throughout the school and after the length of the project.\r\nThere are eight schools in our partnership from five countries, six have had experience with successful European Comenius partnerships and have worked with the coordinating school previously. Two are new to European school partnerships - the infant school from the federation of the coordinating school, and a Swedish school where the school coordinator has had experience of a Comenius project in a previous school. All partner schools have been involved in the planning of the project and the identification of priorities.\r\nAt each stage of the project a range of teaching and learning methodologies will be introduced, demonstrated reviewed and analysed. Partners will be expected to try these approaches in their schools and feedback to the group what had been successful and how it might change the way they teach in their school. The project will be focused on what is taught and how it is taught and assessed. We will also be learning about and using a range of innovative ICT programs to support the teaching and learning of language. We will make full use of our eTwinning website for preparation, communication, and the activities and results of our activities.\r\nThe main results expected include that all partners will have shared, learned about, experienced and carried out a range of different or innovative learning and assessment practices in the various areas of language and literacy; that teaching staff in our school will have gained a greater understanding of how children develop language and literacy skills; the implementation of best practice using these new and innovative teaching practices in our schools, improving the competences and skills of our teachers and leaders; an increase in the levels of language and literacy throughout our schools with a reduction in disparities in learning outcomes affecting disadvantaged learners; and that schools will have improved their use and understanding of ICT embedding a range of innovative ideas and technologies as a medium to communicate and in the teaching and learning of language.\r\nAt the beginning and throughout the project we will be using the \u2018Impact+ Exercise tool\u2019 to ensure the maximum impact of our work. We plan that our project will have a lasting impact in our schools. The development of language and literacy is key for all subjects.  Staff across the schools will be able to see the benefits of delivering their subjects in innovative ways, using a greater range of effective ICT programs. \r\nWe will share our results of with groups of other schools and organisations and in a wide variety of ways including eTwinning, school websites, Facebook, Twitter as well as the Erasmus+ Project Results Platform", "http://www.ashprimaryschool.co.uk", "Hanham Abbots Junior School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036579_3"]]}}}}
