The 21st Century has offered special educators new and incredibly helpful insights from neuroscience and biochemistry for example, which now need to feed in to provision and school improvement planning.  This century has also brought us new technologies, particularly in relation to assistive and augmentative communication, allowing practitioners to address particular barriers to learning, and unlock potential. In addition, attitudes and values around special education (as well as to education itself) are changing.  Newer paradigms in our Post-Fordist global economy emphasise more personalised approaches, rather than a culture of uniformity which emphasises that all individuals must be offered the exact same thing.  At Swiss Cottage, when we talk about innovation and change for special education, we are also talking about a shift in understanding around notions of \"entitlement\", moving towards a belief that all children and young people have the right to have their individual needs met, rather than the \"right\" to do the same as everybody else, regardless of whether or not this is meaningful. Innovation, to reflect this rethinking represents a big and ambitious piece of work, leading to the development of new frameworks, systems, and processes, which can be supported through training and transnational networking.  As a National Teaching School therefore, we consider it our responsibility to nurture 'Change Agents' within the Special Education sector, internally, locally, and globally.  This requires us not only to \"change\", but also to \"engage\" , with models of best practice from other nations, international research, and comparative education approaches.

London has significant issues with youth unemployment (25% and 238000 long term), youth apathy, low skills and poor education. Many are at the margins of society and feel isolated & disengaged. Youth discontent has resulted in many social problems, and some social disorder (Work Foundation. -Youth Unemployment)\r\nItaly : The present the rate of unemployment in the 15 \u2013-24 age group in Italy is 32 %; it has increased by 2 % from the previous year. 20.5 % of the pool of unemployed people on the labour market come from those between the ages of 15-24.  Every third young person in this age group is unemployed. (Source Youth Unemployment NOW 2014 issue 1; Skills OCED Data ) There is a significant segregation in the population with respect to their possibilities on the labour market. The main determining factor is their level of education. \r\nSPAIN:The largest group of registered unemployed people are those with an elementary vocational education and high school and post-high school education. At the end of 2012 this group made up 28.3 % of the total unemployed, while those with high school and post-high school education were 27.3 %. Over 35% of 15-24 year olds are unemployed in Spain and this is an increasing trend. low education, low skills and poor engagement in training are major factors. \r\n\r\nThrough creating a strategy for how the Creative sector can tackle these chronic issues, through looking at self employment and enterprise, we will allow them to be more active in learning & will show young people to see & create a successful creative career. We will create a strategic partnership to look at how the Creative sector is Spain and Italy has helped tackle this problem, and how we can build on best practice in the UK.
