Specifically in each building only key sub-systems were considered individually. Such individual systems were made more effective by becoming pervasive into any building area (the reign of \u201cboxes\u201d and \u201ccontrollers\u201d). Importing parameters from other sub-systems allowed better regulations (Access or Occupancy management systems). Energy Usage Analysis tools are fairly new on the market. They provide the capability to analyse energy profiles of scattered buildings of large corporations. Energy usage analysis and planning on a district level is inexistent. Neither is Energy Usage Modelling leveraged in control schemes. This leaves an unexplored area for more effective building control schemes and suggests a potential of each smart building to contribute to District level energy optimization schemes, thanks to appropriate behavioural and stochastic models.\n\nIn parallel, efforts made many more renewable and cogeneration energy sources available as high capacity energy storage systems. Such systems now increasingly enter into the planning of large districts, but still timidly penetrate individual buildings. Thus, energy flows (electrical or thermal) can be managed through energy usage schemes, planned in time for significant savings.\n\nTo reach this aim, it is proposed to play in real time adaptive and predictive behavioural models of buildings and districts, exposed to weather conditions, human presence, energy-efficient materials and technologies. Such models will allow finding optimal supply/demand balancing. Building energy management systems will be turned in real-time configurable ones, bringing flexibility to the building. Thus, buildings will establish, in real-time, energy schemes with the district energy management and information system (DEMIS).

Most cases are due to gross mistakes rather than fundamental inadequacy of available technology and methods. The reasons are manifold. Highly simplified calculation methods are used far beyond their domain of validity. Assumed boundary conditions such as occupant behaviour are not in accordance with actual usage; gross malfunctions in control and HVAC systems are left undetected in the commissioning process, while thermal bridges and distribution system losses are left without attention. Moreover, metered and sub-metered data are not used efficiently in calculation tools and engineering based simulation models during the Measurement and Verification (M&V) phase.\nTRIBUTE aims at minimizing the gap between computed and measured energy performances through the improvement of the predictive capability of a state-of-the-art commercial BEPS. TRIBUTE will extend the use of this tool to the commissioning and operation stages of a building. For existing buildings, M&V techniques will be developed and deployed to connect the BEPS model in real time to the pivotal wireless sensing and control systems of a monitored building. This involves modelling building systems to a higher fidelity than done today, developing technology for on-line identification of building key parameters, and automatically adapting the on-line, real time BEPS to the actual building\u2019s state.\nIn addition, BHM and EFM application will compare measured data to the then improved predicted metrics and will enable detecting building deviations. Advanced data mining methods will help evaluate these deviations. Subsequent Energy Efficiency Diagnostic Rules and optimization methods will provide cost effective and corrective retrofit actions accordingly.\nThe methodology and tools will be evaluated in the context of three different building types and locations.", 114734.0, 7955232.0, 11, 18, "TRIBUTE", null, "http://www.zedfactory.com", null, "fp7_109670_953804008"]]}}, "9QL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1199145600000, 1293753600000, "Smartest Cars Video Project", "H3b Media Ltd", "The Smartest Cars Video Project proposes to produce a high quality video documentary to raise public awareness of eSafety systems via mass media broadcasting.
