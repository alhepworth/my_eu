Yield losses due to the parasitic affects of nematodes vary significantly for different crops, however, it is estimated that over \u20ac1 billion/year of crop yield is lost in the EU and the figure is speculated to between \u20ac10-20 billion/year world-wide.  There are a number of existing solutions to prevent the huge losses due to nematode infestations, including; chemical nematicides (soil fumigants), solar heating/steaming and robust crop rotation.  However, all of these solutions have significant problems such as very negative environmental impact, high-cost, geographically specific and they all kill nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Nemasys proposes to develop a unique blend of naturally occurring essential oils (EO) as an alternative, cost-effective, soil treatment, which will be delivered by a novel time-release capsule.

Compared to its global competitors the EU is under-investing in knowledge base, spending every year 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan in R&D \u2013 with major gaps in business R&D, venture capital investments. \r\n\r\n~ The EU market remains fragmented and insufficiently innovation-friendly. \r\n\r\n~ The demand for innovation exposes a critical gap: a lack of innovation skills, knowledge and training across most organizations. \r\n\r\n~ Underestimated relevance between innovation and VET. Traditionally innovation is seen as a result of R&D activities carried out by highly qualified staff and thus a domain of higher education rather than VET. Innovation cannot be limited to high tech industries \u2013 it also takes place in low-tech industries which account for a large share of employment in Europe. Firms in low-tech industries innovate through building on the practical knowledge within the firm which arises from \u201clearning by doing\u201d or \u201clearning by using and interacting\u201d, which is not a prerogative of a specific category of employees.
