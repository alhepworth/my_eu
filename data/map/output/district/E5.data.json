This will include the development and roll-out of a series of courses and resources for returned international volunteers that will promote active citizenship and social inclusion, utilising a blended learning approach.  Tailored resources and courses will additionally be developed to support volunteer sending agencies in their role as adult educators by strengthening their competencies to engage with a wide range of learners, using new technologies to support their work and help ensure better teaching outcomes and ensure quality standards in active citizenship and volunteering.\r\n\r\nWork with returned volunteers is a unique area of adult education. Adults who go overseas to volunteer come from a range of backgrounds and skills, and there is enormous potential to translate the skills and experiences they have as a result of volunteering internationally into lifelong learning and, in particular, transform such individuals to deepen their sense of identity as active global citizens. This project aims to develop curricula and methodologies to enable volunteers to recognise and further develop skills that were stimulated while overseas (e.g. critical thinking, multiple perspectives, community participation, strategies to address global injustice issues, etc.) and equip participants with support and competencies that will enable them to participate as active global citizens, not just in their short term role as international volunteers but throughout their lives.  The project will enable blended learning approaches, utilising in particular digital strategies such as webinars, online courses and communication to ensure that learning opportunities are brought to as wide a group as possible, including those living in geographically marginalised areas.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together partners from the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the UK, all of whom are very experienced in working with volunteers within the sphere of adult education.  It will directly involve just over 440 participants over its 3-year course, and a further estimated 10,000 people indirectly.  It will produce a comprehensive suite of research, training and education materials, and online learning opportunities that will be widely promoted through the partners' extensive networks nationally, throughout the EU and internationally, and the resources will remain publicly available at the end of the project\u2019s life cycle.  They will additionally be incorporated into the pedagogical framework of relevant organisations through training of facilitators, thereby ensuring their mainstreaming and sustainability.", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IE01-KA204-008627_3"], [2017, "BE PART \u2013 FEEL YOUR PART: Political participation approaches on local level for young people at risk of social exclusion", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", 200465.0, 6, 8, "To broaden and deepen the political and social participation of young people on local, regional, national and also European level is a huge challenge. Statistics show very clearly that the participation will and rate of young people in political decision making as well as societal discourse are both low. Studies show e.g. around the last elections for the European parliament that nearly 80% of young people asked stated, that they would never consider for their life to stand as a candidate for any political election. The divide between the democratic institutions in Europe, their representatives and political parties and Europe\u2019s young citizens seems to be growing. The fact that about 1/5 of young people would prefer an autocratic leader in Europe opens a considerable door and ground for fundamentalism and worrying developments. Moreover, research does also very clearly show two core issues: \r\na) the situation, pereception and participation rate in democratic and political processes is actually much worse with young people at risk of social exclusion, marginalisation and suffering from social or socio-economic disadvantages and \r\nb) political participation starts with proximity, first and foremost at the local level. The local or  regional level is where young people get a chance to see the direct impact of their involvement and participate in a small-scale democracy.\r\n\r\nThe activation and use of social environmental resources is an important support factor to tackle social exclusion and socio-economic disadvantages and if we want to reach a broader and deeper participation of young people at social risk in political and social processes we need to aim at: \r\n1) Identifying relevant social environmental resources of young people at risk\r\n2) Identify social environments and spaces of young people in the society (on local or municipal level)\r\n3) Find common interfaces between youth spaces / social environments and adult / political environments (e.g. also through the enlargement of social space and environments) \r\n4) Provide youth workers, young people and political decision makers with methodologies to support this identification and interfacing process \r\n5) Defining concrete local action projects in the common social environment interface to make the impact of political participation visible in proximity \r\n\r\nParticipants of the projects are young people at risk of social exclusion or marginalisation out of socio-economic or other disadvantages aged 14-19 years in the partner countries AT, DE, DK, IT, UK and PT. Together with young people the youth workers supporting young peoples' integration processes are one main target and participant group. Moreover local political decision makers will be directly involved in the project activities as important participants realising the proximity impact which is necessary to achieve democratic participation of young people. \r\n\r\nThe project will be developing 4 concrete intellectual outputs to achieve the set objectives: \r\n1) Research report about methods and instruments for social environment and space analysis including the experiences of 10 social environment analysis processes implemented with young people in each partner country. \r\n2) Training curriculum and materials for youth workers about how to implement social environment analysis and space description as well as how to set up, monitor and document local participation projects with young people. The training programme will be implemented in the course of a European learning and teaching activity with 3 youth workers from each partner country as well as be piloted on local level in each partner country with additional 10 youth workers \r\n3) Local participation projects: in each partner country min. 3 local participation projects of young people at risk of social exclusion or marginalisation will be planned and implemented. Youth workers will facilitate and moderate the implementation process, the experiences and results gained will be documented for all partner countries. \r\n4) Political action plan: opinions, needs and requirements for political action for improvement of democratic participation of young people at risk of social exclusion will be gathered in all partner countries and compiled into a political action plan for participation of young people at local, regional, national and European level. \r\n\r\nThe partnership of the project consists of 7 experienced organisations from AT, DE, IT,DK, UK and PT. Partners have all experiences with the topic and the target group of the project. They will provide their experiences and expertise for the devlopment of the single intellectual outputs. The partnership reflects well the different stakeholders and interest groups in the subject and as well a sound European geographical balance which will allow for a clear European added value in the ouptuts. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive dissemination and sustainability strategy will ensure the achievement of the short and long term impact in the project.", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-AT02-KA205-001985_1"], [2015, "European Volunteer Inclusion Program", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", 182398.0, 5, 5, "Our project is in direct line with the European priorities for the promotion of voluntary missions, and as a lever for the professional insertion of young jobseekers age 17 to 30 years in Europe. EuroVIP brings an answer to the insufficient formal recognition of the skills and knowledge acquired in informal and non-formal environments, through a tool that complements the existing methodologies. EuroVIP aims to strengthen the link between the economic and the associative world, by placing the company as the central actor in the professional insertion of volunteers searching for a job.  Our project, EuroVIP aspires to reinforce the link between the associative/voluntary with the economic and professional world by offering to the companies a central role and a strong responsibility in the professional insertion of the young volunteers and jobseekers. The objectives of our project are : 1. To favor the professional insertion and the employability of the youth by the recognition of their skills and knowledge acquired during their voluntary missions. The objective is to help them to valorize the skills and knowledge acquired in formal, informal and non-formal environments and to define their professional project for their job search.  2. To strengthen the capacities of the organizations working with volunteers by the provision of a tool that helps the organizations to  guide the professional and personal orientation  of volunteers, as well as to certify their formal, informal and non-formal knowledge and skills acquired all along the  lives of the volunteers, including the voluntary missions.  3. To promote to the private sector the voluntary missions and the skills and knowledge acquired by the young volunteers in their missions, and to favor their implication in the accompaniment of youth towards their first and/or a stable employment. 4. To create working synergies in the promotion of voluntary missions in Europe and the recognition of competences acquired by the young volunteers at the European Union level. The proposed action aims to establish a coordinated work in the co-construction of the tool, the cooperation and the exchange of good practices between all the implicated actors. To effectively perform this project, 5 partners (FACE, Pour la Solidarit\u00e9, VOLUM, Wisamar and Volunteering Matters) from 5 different countries (France, Belgium, Romania, Germany and England) shared the implementation of the following activities: - The adaptation of the ProfilPASS : the portfolio for the recognition and valorisation of competences of young volunteers.   -  The transfer of the ProfilPASS portfolio to the organisations working with volunteers. - The creation of a guide directed to the companies to allow the recognition and the adaptation of the volunteer\u2019s informal and non-formal skills and knowledge in their HR recruitment process. - The construction of a good practices guide, based on the experience of each partner organization and the project, for the effective professional insertion of young volunteers.  - The evaluation and dissemination of the project results through the organization of different national and European events, and a final European seminar.The project results are: - The profilPASS portfolio adapted to the need and specifities of the volontaries. The porfolio will be available in four European languages. - 180 young volunteers accompanied in their professional insertion- 30 mobilized companies engaged with voluntary missions and the professional insertion of the youth. The expected impact is a better acknowledgement and recognition of the voluntary missions in the recruitment process, the integration of this recognition methodology by the organizations working with volunteers, to improve the efficacy of the voluntary accompaniment tools, and finally, to enhance the attractiveness  of the voluntary missions for the youth.", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-FR02-KA205-010722_3"], [2017, "Volunteering Matters 2017 EVS Inform and Inspire Project", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", 173851.0, 6, 13, "The Volunteering Matters 2017 Inform and Inspire Project will bring together 13 organisations from the UK, Albania, France, Italy, Austria and Germany with many years experience of EVS projects.

There is no doubt that professional youth work is needed to provide conditions for development, participation and inclusion of young people in Europe which in times of crisis is even more needed than before. owever the challenge for professional youth work especially because of its cross-sectoral approach and also the fact that different support systems are in place and overlapping in relation to different forms of youth work and in particular when it comes to inclusion topics for young people with mental disorders and disabilities. Youth workers in residential youth care as well as crisis intervention centers providing support in situations where living at home with families is no longer possible or an option are confronted with complex situations where youth welfare as well as support for people with mental disabilities start to overlap, where  drug abuse, alcohol abues and delinquency appear, where young people in this centeres are partically still in the compulsory school age with school contacts and discussions, where unemployment topics as well as job loss and job search become relevant.In front of this it is not only the social pedagogical competences required from professional youth workers about youth culture, youth problems, learning and social embedding of young people, communication etc. it is much more also knowing about the interfaces to medical services (psychiatric support and disease pattersn), drug abuse support services, services for people with intellectual and multiple disabilities etc. that would help tackle these complex situations for the benefit of the young people in question. The INCREASE project provides an innovative contribution to the training offers for youth workers with an interdiscpinary character reflecting teh challenges of modern youth work in residential youth care and crisis intervention. The main aim and objective of the INCREASE Project is the development of an interdisciplinary further training programme which allows and enables youth workers to tackle the complex situations in daily work in this cross over perspective especially in residential youth care and crisis intervention where these situations and patterns become particularly evident and challenging for youth workers. The INCREASE project will therefore produce three distinct intellectual outputs: 1) Exploration study: during this introduction study the members of the target group as well as experts will be investigated about their concrete content needs and requirements in relation to the training programme developed. 240 members of the target group will participate in this study throughout the partner countries2) INCREASE Training programme: an 80 hours modular training programme will be elaborated by the partneship which will be setup on the principles of units of learning outcomes to make the use of the ECVET approach possible for the acccreditation and recognition of learning outcomes. The pilot training and testing of the training programme is also part of the intellectual output. 3) INCREASE green paper: the experiences of the whole partnership during the project implementation period will be collected and channelled into a policy recommendation paper which will be presentred at a final multiplier event in Austria. This paper should give concrete support and recommendations to policy makers for an improvemenr of an inclusive youth policy in Europe.

As a lot of these skills and work experiences are not only helpful in volunteering related activities, they are also useful in paid work (such as skills like time or project management, communication, PR work, and others) and therefore improve the employability of people volunteering. This way civic engagement can be seen as an important and powerful source of informal learning that constitutes a potential way into employment or to improve career prospects. \r\nBut usually these skills are acquired incidental, occasional or indirect, as most volunteer training are only related to specific objective of the volunteer position, and therefore are usually very specific. What are missing are more general trainings for skills development, to be more professional and efficient in volunteering. However, this is also a problem a lot of NGOs are facing: due to the financial crisis most NGOs get even less money than before, even if there services are needed even more and that their (economic) value is recognized. For this reason, in order to keep adding value to these fields, social organisations and institutions need to work more professional, efficient and effective, as resources are scare and tasks are much more complex and challenging. \r\nWith these facts in mind, the German partner organisation has already developed a training concept especially for volunteers and coordinators of volunteers. This training program aims at promoting professional skills and competences like for instance in the fields of team or project management. Although these skills should primarily help people to perform their voluntary work more economically and efficiently, training participants also benefit in terms of developing crucial employability competences and skills and acquire work references. (But of course professional volunteering, and being more professional as volunteers should never replace paid work!)\r\nSo this training is beneficiary on many levels: \r\na) for volunteers: it enables volunteers to work more effectively and task-orientated in their volunteer work and improves their employability, it offers disadvantaged people (e.g. unemployed, low skilled, and at the risk of social exclusion) a chance of not only participating actively in society, but gaining professional training and work experience for free. \r\nb) for NGOs: it supports the volunteer work within NGOs as it is a way of bridging resource shortages, but also attracting new volunteers, as NGOs offer additional, work related free trainings, and is an good approach of the changing character of volunteering: volunteers are much more likely to undertake shorter and more project-based activities.  It is capacity building of staff within the own organisation and is a successful way to the professionalisation of volunteering\r\nc) for employers: recognising the value of volunteering as pathway of gaining work related skills and expertise of (potential) staff\r\nd) for the general public: strengthening volunteering and therefore its value for society, increasing the participation of disadvantaged in society in a positive way and being important for social inclusion.\r\n\r\nAs the training program for volunteers and volunteer coordinators has been successfully implemented by the German partner and has proven its positive impact, a consortium of four volunteer organisations from Romania, Czech Republic, the UK and Germany has been set up, to develop this training further as a standardized training program for volunteering, pilot test it in different environments and with different target group across Europe. Altogether 80 volunteer coordinators, and 180 volunteers will be trained, and around 300 multipliers will be reached directly. \r\nThe main idea of this partnership is, to develop two training manuals \u201cProfessional volunteering\u201d: one as a train-the-trainer program for volunteer coordinators and the other one for training volunteers, which is useful for all kind of volunteering. Throughout dissemination activities by the four partners and their national and international networking connections partners will distribute the manuals across Europe, to support volunteering across Europe and enhance professional skills development of staff in NGOs and volunteers, especially volunteers, who are disadvantaged and with little or no access to formal trainings or work experience.", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA200-000676_3"], [2014, "European Voluntary Service for All", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", 161887.0, 6, 15, "The project EVS4ALL aims to take a first step in the implementation of a \u2018European Year of Volunteering for Everyone\u2019, as described in the manifesto \"We are Europe!

The mentors will receive training beforehand in order to get to know the hosting projects and to plan carefully the use of digital learning for the short term voluntary services during the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the activities. The results will lead to the creation of a practical guide about how to use digital learning to support the learning processes of the target group in volunteer activities.\r\nAs a second step, the individual experiences will be analysed and evaluated carefully by all partner organisations in order to draw conclusions and to design together new European volunteer activities which take into account the experiences and findings and which involve the foundations actively into the upcoming projects. The involvement of the third parties will be looked at individually based on each organisation\u2019s needs and possibilities.

In each participating country, the partner association will be in charge of setting up a national consortium, or \"working group\" which should bring together several representatives of the education sector: a primary and/ lower-secondary school; one or two teachers; one academic researcher expert on the issue of education for citizenship; one representative of a State or public-body in charge of education policies. The main task of this working group will be to conduct a national need analysis in the beginning of the project in order to assess the national needs and expectations regarding education for citizenship curricula, both in terms of content and methodological approaches. It will be done through a theoritical study and the distribution of a questionnaire to a large group of teachers and experts of teacher training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of the analysis will be put in common between all partners and help identify the common needs of the participating countries. It will then be useful to produce content useful for all of them, but at the same time adjustable according to specific national needs. Two main themes will be dealt with by the interactive learning module : civism and living together in harmony, on the one hand, and general interest and democratic participation on the other hand. The intellectual deliverables composing the module will all be translated in each of the six languages of the partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rationae of the project is the following: the issue of education for citizenship is dealt with in distinct ways within the EU, notably because of the cultural and historical specifics of each Member State. However, this diversity of approach does not necessarily impede common reflection. Everywhere in the EU, education for citizenship, understood in both aspects of living together in harmony and democratic participation, is undergoing similar evolutions. On the one hand, the growing decline in interest of young people for national and European politics is a trend shared by all. On the other hand, education for citizenship must be adjusted everywhere, in link with several factors such as European integration, migratory flows or even ageing population.\r\n\r\nWhen considering education for citizenship specifically as education for living together in harmony, we must underline that it is not an issue shared by Member States only: it is intrinsic to the European project itself.  The political and human horizon of the EU is to have 28 distinct peoples living together in harmony and to nurture the feeling of belonging to the same common destiny. \r\n\r\nSetting-up a European and cross-sectoral platform for cooperation and the exchange of good practices is a highly relevant means to face these common challenges. The resulting learning material would not be purely national, but enriched by other European perspectives. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of our project will then be disseminated throughout the EU thanks to the networks of two paneuropean associations: the DARE Network, with 46 members in 28 States, and the European Civic Forum, with 100 members.

The volunteers will have an intercultural experience, learn about the beneficiaries they will volunteer with, improve competences and gain new skills, knowledge and experience, have improved personal development, be more aware of European affairs and be better prepared for the world of work or study, preventing future youth unemployment. The Receiving Organisations will benefit from the added value that the volunteers will bring to their work including cultural diversity, different experiences and perspectives, new ideas, and new interests and skills, enabling them to diversify the activities they undertake with beneficiaries and communities. The Sending Organisations will meet their objectives of sending volunteers to a different country to have intercultural experiences. The beneficiaries will become more socially included and more active citizens through taking an active part in their communities and accessing social, leisure, educational and outdoor activities. CSV will meet our objectives to promote volunteering in an international context, promote and increase the cultural diversity of our volunteers and provide opportunities for cultural exchanges between our volunteers and our project partner organisations\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the project will leave a sustainable legacy to the volunteers, beneficiaries and communities, through the activities continuing after the project and being developed through other Erasmus+/EVS projects and volunteers in the future.", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012144_coordinator"], [2014, "D\u00e9veloppement d'un r\u00e9seau associatif des jeunes eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9ens en faveur des plus d\u00e9munis", "VOLUNTEERING MATTERS", 16673.0, 6, 8, "Secours populaire fran\u00e7ais (SPF) and its euro-Mediterranean partners organise a seminary which will gather 50 youth workers.
