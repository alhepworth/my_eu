Ireland has high numbers of Young People (YP) who leave school with no /few qualifications; these YP often drop out of education & training and are described as being NEET. (Not in Employment, Education or Training) They often have fewer opportunities & many have complex barriers that prevent them engaging with mainstream vocational education and training. In 2010 GEMS NI began to research & develop ideas to improve pathways to vocational educational and training for NEET YP. This wasn\u2019t about creating new VET programmes or delivery infrastructure, but creating the right conditions to make VET more attractive & accessible to YP who need additional support and a flexible menu of learning, life, leisure and work opportunities.  GEMS NI developed the Co-Ment  project - a flexible model which through one-to-one mentoring support assists a YP to develop their personal action plan around 4 \u2018Zones\u2019 Learning, Life, Leisure and Work with the young person banking time through activities in each Zone, supported by a personal mentor and an innovation resource to support their goals. Co-Ment is managed via an IPad \u2018app\u2019 with the mentor and YP completing action plan, reviews and Zone activities. Key to the model design is collaborative working between the range of organisations and agencies that need to share knowledge and resources to support a YP on their learning pathway with the YP\u2019s personal Mentor helping them to navigate their learning journey. The project, delivered by GEMS NI since 2012, has been highly successful in supporting disadvantaged & marginalized YP to engage in VET; improving their personal capacity for learning & work resulting in positive destinations - return to education, engagement in mainstream VET programmes and employment.  GEMS NI wanted to share the Co-Ment model, on a European platform.  The project aims to develop, transfer & implement the innovative Co-Ment model (designed by GEMS NI in 2010), in Italy, Netherlands, Austria & Ireland, customised to the needs of the partner country, to improve VET outcomes & lifelong learning pathways for NEET YP.\r\n\r\nThe EC-YP in VET partnership combines the experience & expertise of organisations committed to working together to develop attractive & inclusive VET for disadvantaged &marginalized YP: GEMS NI UK (Co-ordinator);Time Associates UK; Antares, Italy; Edumark, Netherlands Die Querdenker, Austria; Ballymun Job Centre, Ireland;\r\n\r\nThe project has 2 direct target groups \r\n\r\n1: 20 VET trainers/mentors who have a specialism and practical experience of delivering dedicated mentoring and careers advice to YP who are NEET\r\n\r\n2: 60 YP who are not in education, training or employment and are recognised as amongst the hardest to reach, hardest to help \r\n\r\nIn addition, 60 young NEET and at least 12 VET trainers will participate in the YP Forum and EC-YP Advisory Group respectively contributing to the product design, evaluation and project dissemination. \r\n\r\nEC-YP will be delivered through 8 work packages (WP), 3 core WP (Management, Quality and Evaluation and Dissemination and Exploitation) and five integrated product development WP (Needs Analysis, Product and App Development, Training of Mentors, and Pilot Testing) Each work package has an allocated partner lead mapped to skills and experience and all partner roles and responsibilities within a defined budget and time-frame.   \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\u2022 Project Management Structures (EC-YP Advisory Group, Quarterly Reporting, Basecamp, Dropbox, 8 transnational meetings, bi-monthly SKYPE meetings, & monthly partner contact\r\n\r\n\u2022 Quality Management and Evaluation Strategy and Plan (Quarterly Internal Monitoring reporting, bespoke methodologies mapped to project stages, YP Forum)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Dissemination Strategy & live plan, European, National, Regional and Local / 4 European multiplier events \r\n\r\n\u2022 Baseline Auditing and Needs Analysis\r\n\r\n\u2022 Product Development \u2013 collaborative mentoring model, app & web-based platform \r\n\r\n\u2022 Training for Mentors programme\r\n\r\n\u2022 15 month Pilot Testing phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY RESULTS & IMPACT\r\n\r\nA Quality Assured EC-YP Training for Mentors package, Collaborative Mentoring Model, App & web-based communications platform for use in partner countries UK, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands & Austria.

It aims to elucidate this framework to help disadvantaged young people not working and not studying, also thanks to ICT for learning. DAY PLOT is linked to at least three priorities of the Programme (inclusion, key competencies for VET, digital era).The target of the project is the group of professionals working with these disadvantaged young people such as: the Practitioners of School, University and/or Labour guidance; the Practitioners of Working market Agencies and of the Employment Centres; trainers and teachers of the VET sector. The final beneficiaries are the young people with disadvantage condition; in particularly NEETs and migrants looking for a VET opportunity or for employment. The main stakeholders are all the organisations involved in the inclusion  area (VET schools and institutes; Public Administrations dealing directly with the young and with education, labour and reception policies; trade unions; enterprises, etc.)The concrete aim of the project, articulated in 6 innovative IOs, is to build with and to offer to the direct target a set of useful tools to help the young people with disadvantage condition ageing from 18 to 29 years with specific training, education,  in order to facilitate their entrance in the more appropriate VET channel to strengthen their competencies and/or in the labour market.Throughout the project\u2019s life the target group will test innovative e.learning modules (ECVET version) on a MOOC platform used for the competence assessment and development, in order to enhance the training/employment chances for the disadvantaged young.At the beginning of the project a Report on the needs and best practices on the topic of the key competences development at EU level will be performed in order to support the following assessment and training activity.An original diagnosis tool kit based on innovative frameworks, including gamification and survey will allow  practitioners and teachers to map the key and professional skills of the young Neets/migrants and to assess their level, allowing also the practitioners to support the young people in writing a personal Europass CV.DAY PLOT has also other innovative IOs; a feasibility study for the platform which will be able to automatically match client-enterprise using a specific database with original solutions (high interactivity and competence tag); the Guide Line report which will help for a correct performance of all the new tools and a Report aimed to insert the DAY PLOT tools in the framework of VET and inclusion policies.The partners are all expert of EU project in this area (except P1) and have been already  engaged in one or more project topics.

This is an issue of strategic importance for humanity as evidenced by the program launched in late 2015 by the UN focused on 17 goals to achieve for 2030, adopted by the Commission Communication to the European Parliament (22.11.16) and the EU document (Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe) that postulates to create a sustainable European economy by the year 2050.\r\nWe believe that the world of education is a major player for implementing this process and therefore SUDEGO intends to develop some innovative tools enhancing the basic and higher skills on five of UN goals: 3) health and wellbeing; 5) gender equality; 7) access to clean energy 12) models of sustainable consumption and production; 15) Life on Land.\r\nThe proposal was formulated with the objective of complying with the I horizontal priority and the II school priority in the Programme; we involved 7 partners from 5 countries (3 IT, BG, ES, FI, UK), all of them with experience in the field of training and with strong links with the world of school and / or with stakeholders in the productive and social sectors. There are two newcomers to this type of project. There are two local education authorities.\r\nThe purpose of the project is to provide, through the work of a transnational team, a consistent set of information and a set of modules for teachers of secondary schools, designed to help them to develop themselves and to suggest for their students a mentality a proactive attitude oriented towards the goal of a sustainable Europe. One of the innovative aspects is the cross-sectoral nature of the project that aimed to recreate, in this case in favor of the school system, a synergy between education and the world of production, also to guide future educational and working choices of the students.\r\nSUDEGO will be organised into 5 IO to create innovative products and 3 activities targeted to a proper and effective management of the project (management, quality, dissemination and sustainability). The final results, which will be offered free of charge on the project website and platform and in the book to all interested users, will be 5:\r\n1) a report on the state of art and the best practices;\r\n2) 5 teaching modules aimed at high school grade I;\r\n3) 5 teaching modules aimed at high school grade II;\r\n4) a raport explaining the results of the testing of the products;\r\n5) a theoretical document intended to contextualize the project, accompanied by the guidelines and the \u201cvalue giving\u201d characteristics of the products that will be reported in SUDEGO Book.\r\nIn the realization of such products we will involve, on the side of partners' experts, teachers of the school system, stakeholders of enterprises and public administration and students of the two degrees.\r\nAs for the management of the project, it will be guaranteed by the Coordinator, assisted by the Project Board, to harmonize the commitments and actions to be taken during the process, ensuring proper communication to four targets (project partners, direct and indirect target groups, stakeholders and beneficiaries involved in the activities and the National Agency); 5 project meetings, one in each of the involved countries, will be organized.\r\nThe Quality System that will have a system coordinator and a Quality Board will involve all the partners on the basis of a Quality Plan which includes the hazards plan and the conflict resolution procedures. The evaluation will focus on the results and will be organized on the basis of peer review and the general consensus of the partners.\r\nFinally, for the dissemination and sustainability, are expected:\r\na) a mailing list (for the most part made up of potential users) not limited to the involved countries,\r\nb) the creation of a rich web page appealing and easy to use;\r\nc) the use of blogs and social networks, and connections to the School Education Gateway and eTwinning to trigger a multiplier effect;\r\nd) the organization of the 5 multiplier events, one in each country;\r\ne) the writing up of 4 newsletter;\r\nf) the electronic and paper version of the book contains the papers of O5;\r\ng) the involvement, with the second mailing list, of the local and regional decision makers of school system and all other organizations that deal with sustainable development in all EU countries.\r\nIn total at least 1,400 people will be contacted during the life of the project.

Eight partners from across six programme countries will adapt and develop the Net-Working for Quality Assurance model (developed in a previous Leonardo da Vinci TOI project - LLP/LdV/TOI/2012/IRL-502) so as to ensure its relevance across a wider VET journey (defined as including some/all of the following stages: decision to access VET, through employment services, through a guidance process, initial referral into VET, VET provision, transition to employment/ higher education, up-skilling in the workplace). \r\n\r\nContext/needs addressed: The previous NQA project identified that quality tends to exist within services/provision but can be significantly reduced during transition points in a clients VET journey. The Interagency approach aims to strengthen the links between stakeholders particularly in relation to shared goals and trust, and develop a culture of quality which will be aspired to by a range of stakeholders representing various stages of the VET journey. \r\nPreviously, NQA sought to influence the long term achievement of Bruges (2010) which advocates the progression of individual citizens through the creation and delivery of quality assured VET initiatives 'Given the role of VET in European Societies and economies, it is crucial to ensure the sustainability and excellence of vocational education and training' (Bruges Communique, 2010). However, NQA found that quality VET journeys involve many stakeholders and many stages and that the quality of this journey particularly for those most disadvantaged required a continuum of quality assurance underpinned or enabled by quality cultures. Quality assurance within VET provision is not sufficient, but requires the VET sector to cooperate with a range stakeholders from employment services, to employers and that 'a transparency and a common approach to quality assurance in VET' (Bruges, 2010) should be a longer term objective. NQCA seeks to do just this. \r\n\r\nNQCA will research VET journeys, identify VET case studies, research QA/quality culture/Interagency working and develop an NQCA model. It will further develop NQA as a quality label, design and test Master training and NQCA training, implement 91 interagency meetings , 6 transnational meetings and 7multiplier events. It will take a serious approach to Policy-Practice gaps, create a space for this dialogue and design a Toolkit for Policy Makers to support sustainability and recognition. NQCA will demonstrate the value created through use of a Social Impact Evaluation and disseminate widely the learning achieved. The partners will utilise a Implementation science methodology (IO3).\r\n\r\nTarget Groups: Learners (particulraly those disadvantaged in Education/Labour market), stakeholders involved in the VET journey (including employers), National stakeholders with a Quality agenda, European wide QA. \r\n\r\nCore partnership: 8 organisations representing 6 countries (Ireland, UK (Northern Irealnd and England), Finland, Germany, Hungary and Italy) and includes community based employment support services, learning/skills/entrepreneurial consortium, a Chamber of commerce, a large VET school, a national VET organisation, an EU wide social inclusion/labour market/and policy focused consortium, a large city based employment support service focused on employment & labour market policy, education policy and lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nMain results: NQCA model, NQA quality label, Implemented and tested pilot of interagency working (7 locations), Toolkit for Policy makers, Master training & NQCA training, Social Impact Evaluation.\r\n\r\nImpact: \r\n-Learner impact: quality will underpin their entire VET journey, placing the learner at the centre of VET provision. \r\n-Particiapting organisations:  development of interagency working and quality culture, enabling bottom up approaches to QA, creating geographical areas recognised by the NQA quality label\r\n-National organisations: improve channels of communications between the bottom up approach & the top down policy approach, to lessen the gap between policy and practice, and enable quality culture to exist within the full quality cycle. \r\n-The NQA evaluation identified that many partners/stakeholders were not aware of the need for a forum to discuss quality assurance and VET. NQCA aims to have this type of wide scale impact though the creation of such fora and interagency networks in order to support organisations to work on/understand quality in VET. \r\nNQCA seeks to have long term enduring impact on partners & stakeholders as it will affect values, beliefs and behaviours and is a model which is transferable to many situations, contexts and other sectors.

A european mobility experience represents, for youth :- acquire new competencies, - new languages, - enhance active european citizenship. In order to reach these results, the partnership proposes two activities.A first level of partnership, including 5 NGO  (France, Spain, Sweeden, Bulgaria, Northern-Irland), proposes 4 youth exchanges in France, Sweeden, Spain and Bulgaria.  More than 150 young people, aged from 13 to 25, with less opportunity, will take part to an international youth exchange with the thematic of \"Migrants in Europe\". The 5 groups leaders, in each exchange, are using methods coming from the non formal education, using video-reports ; debates, workshops, games, visits, participating in local public events  which will provide participants new skills, competencies and habilities. Video-reports they will have to do in the dedicated workshops will give them a tool to act and will sensibilize the population to the question of migrants in Europe. The activity \"I will change the world\" will help to develop their social, political and economical creativity. On the basis of their willing, youth-leaders will provide them information about all the european programs, linked to european citizenship,  which will help them to concretise their ideas after the exchange. A second level of partnership, including the same french and spanish partners and a second northern-irish, bulgarian and sweedish partner, works on EVS. French partner will host 4 young rural EVS coming from these partner's organisations and benefits from them.For the partner's organisations it is the opportunity to add a new offer for their youth which do not have easy access to mobility. It's also a new opportunity of local and transnational partnership. For volunteers it's an enriching personal, professional and linguistic experience. Volunteers will participate to the local and european social-educational activities developped by the host organisation using video-reports. They also will have to develop, among local population, desire to learn new foreign languages. They will have to produce a weekly radio chronicle dedicated to mobility, foreign languages, ERASMUS program in order to reach youth with less opportunity. For each activity, the partnership proposes a lot of activities dedicated to identify new skills and competencies acquired during the exchange/EVS. Youthpass, CV Europass, Language Passeport will be used and promoted. A public event will be organised to deliver these documents to participants. This project feets the strategy of internationalisation shared by the partners organisations. The inputs are : - for youth participants : new competencies, new horizons, reinforced european citizenship, new means to act ; - for youth leaders and organisations : new methods, internationalisation of teams, reinforced competencies ; - for other target-groups : sensibilisation of public opinion to the situation of migrants in Europe ; sensibilisation of  local politicals to an active youth participation ; sensibilisation of parents regarding the capacities of their children. After the project  : - Young volunteers should go on with their commitment once they will be back in their sending organisation and its local partners ;- youth participants of the exchange should go on with european mobility willing and learning new languages ; some of them should be abble to integrate new educational or professionnal course with a better self-estimated background ; - Migrants should be better host by the local communities ; - Partners organisations should be better considered by their institutionnal partnership and reinforce their transnational activities.", "http://www.brysongroup.org", null, "erasmus_2016-2-FR02-KA105-011854_4"], [2015, "SKY IS THE LIMIT 2016", "Bryson Charitable Group", 40600.0, 9, 9, "\u201eSKY IS THE LIMIT 2016\u201d is the European Voluntary Service project of several activities, which will be implemented in Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki already for the third time.

The coordinating organisation of the overall project is Masorti e.V.The tasks of the two volunteers in the hosting organisation Masorti e.V. consist in the assistance with the child care, nursing and housekeeping activities of the Masorti Kindergartens. The volunteers will be helping with the every-day life of one of the german-hebrew resp. german-english age-mixed groups of 15 children.By doing so, they will not only get an insight view in the pedagogical work, but will also get to know the jewish year with its holidays and festivities and will be an active part in designing it.The EVS activity in the Oranienburger Strasse Synagogue consists of assisting with the logistical preparation and implementation of services for Shabbat, the holidays and life-cycle events, taking care and welcoming international visitors (individuals and groups), organising Lehrhaus activities and other events (both religious and inter-religious) as well as the support of administrating tasks like the creation of publications.Both volunteers will be provided with time and support in order to design and implement their own project ideas according to their needs and abilities. In the project, they are supported by a coordinator and a mentor and are actively designing their own learning process by taking part in the \u201clearning meetings\u201d (with methods of non-formal education) and by keeping a learning diary. Additionally, they are taking part in German classes as well as the official EVS trainings.All participants have chosen their hosting projects by themselves according to their needs. The jewish ukrainian participant wishes to strengthen his jewish european identity by getting to know another form of jewish practice. The belgian volunteer with german roots wishes to voluntarily engage in a german NGO to experience german culture. For the northern irish participant it is important to gain practical work experience and to improve his German language skills. All are in the transition period from school to working life.During the EVS activity, the volunteers undergo an intercultural learning process and acquire knowledge, practical work experience and key competences that help to develop their personal and professional growth and their employability. By volunteering in jewish projects, they are actively involved in shaping jewish life in Europe and are fighting against anti-semitism and for cultural diversity and are strengthening their European citizenship.The hosting organisations benefit from the support, input and encounters with young european volunteers with a different religious, linguistic and cultural background.As a first result, there are long-lasting effects of this project on the volunteers themselves, who will be benefitting from the learning process on an individual and professional level for their entire lives.  As European volunteers, they are firstly representatives of the EU funding programme Erasmus+ Youth and the EVS and help to shape a positive image of Europe, secondly they are now multipliers and share this positive image with their communities. Additionally, after their EVS the volunteers will have a natural approach to the European jewish life of today and will therefore not only be able to pass this on but by sharing it, help to fight anti-semitism and prejudices and strengthen the positive awareness of cultural diversity.The participating organisations strengthen their networks and working methods and the European cooperation in the youth field. The responsible people in the projects develop their key competences by working with the volunteers as well.

The partners in each country will be responsible for the local organisation and development of two main types of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first type, project partners will involve local communities and staff from the local authorities in a series of workshops to discuss and share experiences and ideas about Community Participation in Planning This will constitute the base work for a second series of workshops and taskforce meetings with the objective of developing a local model for Community Participation in Planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the second type, the Higher Education partners will design and test new teaching modules of Community Participation in Planning. These activities will also be informed by the ongoing developments taking place the first type of activity, in order to infuse the teaching with the knowledge and experience collected there. The curricula and teaching materials developed here will be available after the project is finished to allow other organisations to adopt or adapt them to their own teaching or training activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities of Blended Mobility will bring together members of the local communities (including both adult and young people), staff from local authorities involved and Higher Education students from all of the participating countries to receive further training for capacity building, network and share the progress done at each country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning and experiences developed over the project will be reflected on a publication titled \"Community Participation in Planning: Learning and Skills Framework\". This will be a policy document with guidelines on the processes, resources, skills and methodologies applied to realise the link between Community Participation and the diverse dimensions of Planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the project, it is expected that:\r\n\r\n- participants from each of the local communities (Belfast, Aveiro and Milan) will have new skills and capacities to engage in processes of community participation in the planning and delivery of public services, as well as in spatial planning;\r\n\r\n- Staff from local authorities will have an upgraded set of skills and methodologies to be able to better communicate and engage local communities in processes of community participation;\r\n\r\n- Higher Education students involved in the project will have new skills, capacities and access to methodologies which will allow them to answer the challenges posed to the Planning practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims to have an impact on both the curriculum of Planning degrees and the practice of Community Participation in Planning at all geographic levels. More specifically, it is ambitioned that further Higher Education organisations in the U.K., Italy, Portugal and other E.U. countries will adopt or adapt some of the new teaching modules developed over the project.

to live collectively the work experience  that was never proposed to them during their previous experience.\r\n \r\nThus, as has been  the case  since 2001, our pupils of Vocational highschool  have had the chance   to benefit from a professional and personal  practice thanks to the  Erasmus + program,  in various countries or English-speaking regions of the European Community: Ireland, England, Wales.\r\n \r\nEach of these experiences has straightened and reinforced our motivation to apply, year after year, for the Erasmus + Program   because we are conscious of the increasing importance of an occupational integration of the pupils within the European community.\r\n \r\nBesides, the personal fulfillment from which they benefit in the aftermath to their experience remains the most visible impact when we meet them later, as  grown-ups, when they come back  to tell us their professionnal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nSo, in a systematic way, our teaching staff seeks , after each experience abroad, to know precisely the opinions and the impressions of our pupils.\r\nThrough the questionnaires which are handed to the pupils as well as to the tutors, we are able to correct, improve and  develop our future mobilities.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn the same way, we are eager to consider the remarks of the assessors of the National Agency, as mentioned in their report at the time when the grants are allocated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our will to widen the offer of training has led us to open the European Section to a new  section (Administrative Management), in 2013.\r\nIn 2014, fifteen pupils of these two classes had the opportunity to benefit from a mobility in the United Kingdom ( Gloucester) between March and April.\r\nWe plan for this mobility open to Spain and to benefit the students in our trade chain, and open up for them a European section marked \" Spanish\".\r\n \r\nAs in our previous mobilities, an intermediate partner in the host country is recommanded: the latter will, indeed, allow to facilitate the database for possible companies to employ our candidates and host families  in adequacy to the profile of the participants.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the stay abroad will include, according to our wishes, an accommodation in host families and an internship of 4 weeks in a company.\r\n\r\nOur participants arising from varied and mainly modest socio-cultural backgrounds, we noticed that the European mobility through the Erasmus +program, establishes, for these pupils whose school experience  is fragile, a real added value: concrete, recognized and source of appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the main objectives for our participants, they will be as followed:\r\n- To improve their level of English, their communicational skills as well as their linguistic experiences in a working environment as in everyday life and/or family life.\r\n- To open to other lifestyles and become integrated into a culture which is strange to theirs.\r\n\r\nWe have the ambition to think that this mobility will allow them to exceed the limits of the national systems and to thrive on  ways of lives  which are not familiar to them, that is why we encourage  the largest number to participate in this project and  put into practice their know-how, as well as their manners, abroad.\r\nBy this way , they also can apply for the European Mention as well as EUROPRO and EUROPASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two diplomas soon become assets for our participants but also for their furture employers. \r\n\r\nAlso, these experiences abroad proved in the past that they were an undeniable springboard between highschool and the higher education, so much so as the aquired self-confidence opens to unexplored perspectives .\r\n\r\nFinally, this project will also facilitate the adaptation to the requirements of the working world, what makes of this experience an asset.\r\n\r\nOur objectives aim to be, above all, realistic and operational, always in adequacy with the expectations and skills of our various partners.\r\n\r\nOur\"post-mobility\"work  allows us a systematic improvement, having determined the needs and possible breaches in our previous experiences.\r\n\r\nOur Highschool is recognized today to have led the European projects for more than ten years since we never fail to promote our mobilities and to mention their success.",

pupils the possibility of a unique experience as part of their education. This possibility began with training in Customer Service before we extended this first to include Administration  and later Commerce, before our 4th project in Commerce, oriented towards the English-speaking and today those who speak Spanish.\r\nIn the interval, when a teacher involved in Erasmus+ projects has left our School, the recruitment of a replacement has always been the opportunity for the staff to renew its commitment to this aspect of school-life, and for 2016/17 a Business/Commerce teacher has integrated the staff and will be accredited to teach the two disciplines in both French and English.\r\nWe have found this Erasmus+ experience particularly rewarding for pupils: it develops self-reliance, the students are more confident, and as a result they become more open to others: their environment is spontaneous, and they are constantly solicited. In today's disturbed national & international contexts which favour division and where students \"find their marks\" only with difficulty, activities in relation to Erasmus+ have taken on real meaning, given that knowledge of others leads to understanding. In the present case, prejudices are abandoned in this period of apprenticeship, which has a regulating effect on inequality and fraternity.\r\nWe are well aware of our students' need for a better understanding of the Europeans around them, and also the growing importance of professional opportunities for young people in this part of the world.\r\nSo the aims of those participating are on the one hand to improve their language skills and the ability to relate to others, and on the other hand to be open to other ways of life so as to be able to absorb cultures that are different from their own.\r\nMost of our young people come from differing, mainly modest sociocultural backgrounds, and the majority have had a fragile education by the time they join our High School; this translates into students who have incomplete apprenticeships and a lack of confidence in themselves.\r\nIn the academic year 2016/17, 13 students in their second year of study for their professional diploma \"Bac Pro ARCU / GA\" will profit from the Erasmus+ experience in Belfast, while 4 students taking our \"Bac Pro Commerce\" course will be staying in Seville for 4 weeks in March. These visits follow immersion periods in English and Spanish conducted by an outside training organisation, and in which they can prepare this important stay.\r\nAs in previous years, a partner in the corresponding country is chosen; the partner's local knowledge ideally allows us to list appropriate companies and families that correspond to the participants' profiles.\r\nAccording to our terms of reference, participants' visits include: accommodation in a host family ; work-experience lasting four weeks in a business (one student per department or business depending on the size of the company); and planned cultural visits.\r\nAt the end of their stay, students (and their foreign tutors) receive questionnaires to complete, and each Erasmus+ project is the subject of a written review from our partners which highlights the strong points and notes those which need improvement. Remarks made by the National Agency in their report are carefully analysed, and the whole is representative of the systematic reflexion given to projects before we modify, adjust and develop future ones.\r\nFor our students, this experience goes beyond simply crossing borders: it is a real challenge to be met, and our students take pride in this. The confidence they have acquired is reinvested in a growth phase that leads to success (often in the form of further, postgraduate education), giving value to their professional studies in high school and resulting in recognition by their peers. It is an experience that allows these students to count on a \"Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel\" diploma with European honours, namely EUROPRO and EUROPASS, two distinctions that are also synonymous with quality in the eyes of the businesses that they join later.\r\nErasmus+ project experience continues to prove that this is an undeniable bridge from professional to higher education due to the fact that the confidence acquired by these young people opens perspectives of a future that they thought to be out of reach. It also testifies to their adaptability when faced with the requirements of the world of employment.\r\nToday the St. Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise school is recognized for the seriousness of its commitments to European projects. This is a strongpoint that will be highlighted on our website, particularly on Open Days and in forums dealing with career opportunities. \r\nBoth of the latter add value to the notion of professional education as a means to success.\r\nOur students are the best ambassadors of this experience.", "http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036058_2"], [2016, "Sortir de nos fronti\u00e8res, s'ouvrir \u00e0 d'autres cultures, s'appuyer sur nos racines communes.", "Belfast City Council", 17144.0, 3, 5, "Our professional high school has been involved in the Erasmus + projects for more than ten years, and it is with great conviction, reinforced every year, that we bring our students to collectively live the work experience that was never proposed to them during their previous experience.Since 2001, our pupils of tertiary vocational training have had the chance to benefit from a professional practice thanks to the Leonardo and Erasmus + programs in various English-speaking countries or regions of the European Community: Ireland, England, Wales, and in Spain as to the Spanish-speaking countries (a new destination in 2015-2016), and this in compliance with our European Sections.All these experiences are particularly enriching for students because they help them to grow, and that is the reason why they straighten and reinforce our motivation to apply, year after year, for the Erasmus + .

A search of state of the art technologies indicated much progress in the development of technologies to assist patients but no system is available to significantly affect rehabilitative improvement to scale; with no solution integration with H&SC services. Therefore, Public Procurers cannot go to open tender to deploy effective technology to solve system failures. The MAGIC Consortium recognised Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) as the only way to stimulate the market to find a solution to our common problem. MAGIC is an essential & strategically critical programme for the Team to optimise a patient\u2019s recovery, to modernise H&SC systems to meet demand & to stimulate research, development & innovation.

Secondly, pursuing studies in your first option or entering the job market in your area and with working conditions that give you stability and the possibility to learn and progress.\r\n\r\nAt the level of the group, we seek greater visibility, recognition and appreciation of the public educational service provided by the group, in particular vocational training and a greater capacity to identify support and opportunities for students, extending the perspective to the European level. To these it necessarily corresponds an improvement and diversification of the formative offer, resulting from the learning with the European realities and the world of work with which we will contact.\r\n\r\nFor the target groups, the focus is mainly on the approximation of European education and training policies, on the visibility of the Erasmus + program, on raising awareness of European values, identity and space, on re-evaluating training, and on informal and non-formal learning, lifelong forms of social and cultural information flow.\r\n\r\nConsidering the characterization of the Municipality of Arouca and the region, in terms of schooling, occupation and economic sectors, it becomes clear how each more qualified young person benefits the business fabric. Each young person is a potential / future worker who brings more skills, ability to innovate and to think critically and know how about European techniques, networks and realities.\r\n\r\nFinally, our project and our vision of mobility will be a further national and European contribution to the mobility of young people, the quality of their training, certification, recognized and valued in an international context, for European prosperity.", "http://www.PreceptIT.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA102-035554_8"], [2015, "GELECE\u011e\u0130N \u0130\u00c7\u0130N 24 DAK\u0130KA", "LTA Solutions Ltd", 11174.0, 3, 3, "Our school Toki Ak\u015femseddin Secondary School has adopted the mission to raise the young who have strong characters, who aim to reach the success, who can be innovative, creative, leader, who have high skills of communication, who are appreciated by the community, who are well-behaved and civilized in all levels of Primary Education; within this scope, we would like to apply to some trainings in order to contribute to realization of our mission and vision.
