Even though the need\r\nfor transformation is massive, in Europe the practice of teaching is always the same.\r\nThe way curriculum describes learning is changed and reformed, improving the job relevance of vocational education, BUT it seems that this does NOT guarantee a corresponding didactic development improving the processes in learning. It is however important to develop pedagogics in order to support dual mode education. When innovation becomes the core part of the agenda \u201cdual mode\u201d becomes an important arena \u2013 This again calls for the development of new practices and learning environments constituting the knotworks between different learning arenas.\r\n\r\nThere is an urgent need to introduce new models of innovation and inclusion in VET and in all educational system, especially if they are connected with the achievement of the EU 2020 goals declared by the Europe 2020 flagship initiative \u201cAn Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u201d(ensure that people acquire the skills needed for further learning and the labour market through advanced and innovative VET) but also in 2015 Joint Report about ET2020 strategy, Opening Up Education policy, Riga conclusions about VET and Erasmus+ horizontal and VET-specific priorities.\r\n\r\nREASON FOR THE PROPOSAL\r\nThe elements the proposal is based on are:\r\n- introduce new models of innovation in VET system, and the only effective way is to move the focus on teachers and educators active in the VET system. They need to develop and change their way of teaching in order to change the student skills and increase drastically the students employability. \r\n- The selected methodologies/approaches are: Inclusive and Disruptive Learning, Work-Based Learning, Creative Problem Solving Methodology and TRIZ, Shared-Learning approaches (Co-working and FabLab).\r\n\r\nThe PROJECT PROPOSAL is about innovation in VET and would like to explore innovation in VET in Europe and create several guidelines (interactive, practical and easy-to-use tips) about the ways to introduce a revolution in a job-oriented VET system.\r\n\r\nOUTPUTS/RESULTS\r\nThe project aims to:\r\n\u2022 Explore and discover from across EU successful GOOD PRACTICE examples about innovation in Learning and teaching\r\n\u2022 Produce an EVIDENCE-GATHERING report starting from the emerging needs analysis done by a FOCUS GROUPS via INTERVIEWS (stakeholders form VET sectors, teachers, students but also enterprises recruiting form the VET sector) and aimed to let emerge the challenge and the disruption coming from the innovation in VET\r\n\u2022 Promote the development, testing and implementation of INNOVATIVE PRACTICES/METHODOLOGIES in VET thanks to 4 Intellectual Outputs focused on evidence-gathering, emerging needs analysis, methodologies and toolkit about: Inclusive and Disruptive Learning, Work-Based Learning, Creative Problem Solving Methodology and TRIZ, Shared-Learning approaches (Co-working and FabLab).\r\n\u2022 Stimulate a change in the Educational System coming from innovative and disruptive METHODOLOGIES and APPROACHES after a PILOT TESTING period\r\n\u2022 Transfer the knowledge about the METHODOLOGIES through a series of interactive REPORTS AND TOOLKITS describing the methodologies, explaining in detail how to implement them in VET, introducing challenges, tips and providing a suggested quality management system\r\n\u2022 Create a WEBSITE integrated with Blog, APPs and Social Networks containing a DATABASE OF MATERIALS TRANSLATED into all partners\u2019 National languages to promote and encourage extensive exploitation and dissemination\r\n\u2022 Disseminate the project outputs and results throughout EU with a database of OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES available through open licences\r\n\u2022 Arrange a series of MULTIPLIER EVENTS involving a large number of stakeholders to foster exploitation and dissemination of PROJECT Intellectual Outputs.\r\n\r\nIMPACT ENVISAGED\r\nThe partnership will bring together partners coming from several countries and their stakeholders, both academic and private, with the synergic power to reach a very large and diverse audience.\r\nThe double-route to follow in the project is:\r\n- Transfer innovative and disruptive methodologies/approaches for VET to any interested parties (VET sectors, teachers, students but also enterprises recruiting form the VET sector, formal education system, higher education system, adult learners, Erasmus + projects etc.)\r\n- Recognise and validate the knowledge within partner staff thanks to ECVET system and a Memorandum of Understanding to validate an \u201cEuropean Expert in INCLUSIVE AND DISRUPTIVE LEARNING\u201d profile.", "http://www.fablablondon.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA202-034250_2"]]}}, "8AY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1306886400000, 1401494400000, "Virtual Integrated Partnering (VIP) for SME service, technology and information providers in the European maritime sector", "Society of Maritime Industries Ltd", "EuroVIP aims to co-ordinate European maritime SMEs, associations, larger companies, and research institutions to promote the application of research results and innovative technologies in SMEs, by service, technology and information (STI) transfer in terms of operational and technical collaboration support.

Best use of Earth Observation (EO) and monitoring data is enabled by new EO open-access ecosystem data services (ECOPERNICUS).
