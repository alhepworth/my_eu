We would like this member of staff to have training in the Spanish language, opportunities for cultural immersion, training in effective techniques and strategies for teaching languages throughout the primary phase, and to have an excellent level of confidence with all aspects of primary language teaching. We would also like our MFL coordinator to be able to experience firsthand life in a Spanish school and see what the possibilities could be for the future of languages within our school. \r\n\r\nWe would like to establish cross curricular working, find new ideas and strategies for ways to reinforce literacy through language learning and increase the opportunities available to our youngest children. \r\n\r\nThrough the training we provide for our MFL coordinator, we would like to develop the role of our school within our local community. We intend to provide a well-structured series of professional development opportunities for all our staff and provide language learning and intercultural opportunities for our wider community. We hope to include parents, governors, volunteers and other members of our local community. We also want to offer training to other schools within our network and develop new strategies to improve transition from Key stage II key stage III ensuring that our children\u2019s learning is built upon. \r\n\r\nWe will build a strong and lasting international link with a Spanish school, develop our understanding of how ICT can be used to enhance language learning and increase the amount of intercultural activities and events we hold in our school involving parents and the local community.\r\n\r\nWe intend to achieve all of these aims through a project in our school that will involve the intensive training of our MFL coordinator over a series of three courses in Spain. These courses will be progressive, and each will build on the previous ones. \r\n\r\nThe completion of these activities will mean that our MFL coordinator is in an excellent position to be able to strongly lead the development of the subject in our school and will provide a programme of CPD for the rest of the staff in our school. \r\n\r\nThere will also be training opportunities provided for parents, governors, volunteers and the local community based upon the knowledge and skills gained on these courses.", "http://Www.dobcross.oldham.sch.uk", "Holy Trinity  C.

We now need to develop this link further. We want to take a whole school approach to developing languages in our school and increasing our links with our Spanish school. We would like this to involve the Head Teacher, MFL coordinator and other members of staff. We want to Spanish to become embedded in every aspect of our school life.\r\n\r\nWe need to improve staff knowledge. They need to develop their subject knowledge in order to be able to confidently teach Spanish across all year groups and achieve the new curriculum requirement for languages. We want all of our staff to feel confident in using Spanish in their classroom and to also have a solid knowledge of Spanish culture so that this can be used to develop the interest and motivation of pupils and broaden their intercultural understanding.\r\n\r\nAs a training school, we are keen that our own staff have the very best opportunities for professional development. We feel that there is a pressing need at the moment to focus on language skills due to recent curriculum changes. We want to introduce more innovative approaches to language learning and offer excellent primary languages training as in our training facility (The Sanctuary).\r\nWe want to focus on moving forward in our link with the Spanish school, involving more members of staff. Our long-term aim would be for our older children to take part in an exchange visit with the Spanish children.We want to encourage further cross curricular work and the embedding of Spanish into other subject areas and develop support networks further. Another priority for us is to extend community links. \r\n\r\nWe are aware that many children with SEN will achieve better in languages than in other subjects due to the nature of language teaching and learning. We want to look for ways to make the most of this opportunity to develop these children\u2019s self-esteem and lead them to do better in all subjects. We also want to develop a training program for non-teaching staff (including lunchtime organisers and support staff) to train them in using other languages on the playground and at lunchtime and improve transition into secondary school.\r\n\r\nSt Chad\u2019s is planning a two year project to lead us towards the achievement of all of the above targets and develop the teaching and learning of Spanish in our school. We would like this project to include several members of staff taking part in mobility activities to Spain. We would like them to be involved in training courses which will focus on intensive language learning, intercultural activities, methodology and teaching ideas, discussion of issues facing schools in the development of primary languages, opportunities to develop networks and the chance to further our link with our Spanish school.\r\n\r\nWe would like to involve seven members of staff in these visits. This will include the head teacher and MFL coordinator. We also would like to include the head of \u2018The Sanctuary\u2019, our training facility. In addition to this we would like to involve teaching and support staff in the visits.\r\n\r\nThis will give us a good cross-section of staff in the school and will help us to develop our whole school approach to languages. The involvement of the head will mean that the school is fully committed to developing this approach and that it will be embedded into our ethos and seen in every aspect of our school life.\r\n\r\nThe impact on our school of this project will be great. Spanish, a love of languages and an appreciation of other cultures will be embedded into every aspect of our school life. Our whole school approach will mean that Spanish becomes even more visible in our school.\r\n\r\nOur staff will have a huge boost in confidence as a result of this project, which will contribute towards a better learning experience for our pupils. Children will be more motivated and engaged and will enjoy their learning more. They will develop a love of languages at this early stage which will lead them to want to continue with languages furthering their school career.There will be a particular impact on children with special educational needs and low basic skills and all children will become more enthusiastic about language learning and want to find out more about Spanish culture and life. They will be able to focus on aspects of culture that a more relevant to them which will also impact on the interest and motivation.Our schools training programme (through \u2019The Sanctuary\u2019) will develop to include language training based on the skills acquired on these visits.
