In addition to that, the BBS Fredenberg, with a total of 2,300 students, offers technical training courses and a wide range of other instruction courses, including the areas of geriatric care, food and crafts and personal care.\r\nIn 1994 the first school partnership was established with the Industrial College in Staryj Oskol (Russia). In 1995 we established a partnership with a vocational school in Krakow and afterwards we formed partnerships with Swindon (GB) and Lappeenranta ( Suomi ).\r\nSince 2014 we have a successful co-operation  with both Tandem and the Foundation for German-Russian Youth Exchange.

In 2016 four apprentices from VW spent three weeks in the Bentley plant to get a hands-on experience into new areas of the production as well as the maintenance area. Further exchanges are planned from both sides.\r\n\r\nLooking as the aspects listed above it can be seen that the main aim of the Erasmus + project is the improvement of long life learning, so that the participants can increase their competences in the fields of creativity, flexibility and problem solving strategies, which will eventually lead to an increase in social and individual skills from the participants\u00b4 side.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this independent and multi perspective debate helps the participants of the programmes to actively adapt to their current working situations and conditions, so that the experience they gained abroad can be actively used to transfer their gained knowledge in their daily future working life. \r\n\r\nFurthermore another important aim of this project is an improvement of the participants\u00b4 foreign-language competence. \r\nA common goal of all involved partners is the adjustment of the vocational training in the European Qualifications Framework to provide comparable qualifications and thus to make an acceptance of foreign school leaving certificates easier in order to create more clearance for an occupational mobility.\r\n\r\nWe work with \"old\u201c as well as \"new\" project partners.

All projects aim at helping small VET schools which lack the means or the experience to put forward an individual mobility project to take part in an Erasmus + KA1 VET project. The Consortium is coordinated by the Department for Education of the Balearic Islands, being the following its main responsibilities: \r\n-Financial, administrative and contract management\r\n-Create contacts\r\n-Assessment, results analysis, widespread dissemination\r\n\r\n36 out of the 66 formal VET schools and 1 of the 2 art schools which offer Intermediate VET are an integral part of this Consortium. It is made up of 23 VET programmes belonging to 18 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their Intermediate VET \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual VET educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.
