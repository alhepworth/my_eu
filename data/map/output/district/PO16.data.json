This thinking has evolved in past recent years and is even more relevant today in the context of high unemployment rate and the evolving demands of employers in terms of professional skills and geographical mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecognition of professional competences and training experiences of learners is necessary so that the supply of employers and demand of learners can meet both on the French and European labour market.\r\n\r\nThis recognition should give a response to the difficult access of precarious individuals or with specific needs first to vocational training and then to the classical labour market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreation of job repositories (green spaces, cleaning and distribution/sales) according to the ECVET methodology, divided into Acquired Training Units, will lead to the consolidation of a common database. This new LeGaQual2Do database will be a memory tool of training experiences, of recognition of the acquired competences, of validation of acquired experiences, of skills\u2019 transfer and of professionnal mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVocational trainings and evaluation methods in the workplace will be adapted and proposed to low skilled people, as well as to technical supervisors and trainers. The LeGaQual2Do method (database, European Portfolio for the implementation of vocational trainings, educational tools and training programs) will be tested in each partner country, approximately 100 participants will benefit from that.\r\n\r\nThe experimental stage of the LeGaqual2Do project is essential as far as it will determine the final form of vocational training programs, educational tools and its transnational dimension (2-3 participants per training module will participate in transnational mobilities).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology of the project implementation will be based on the involvement of all partner countries in each activity, whereas the phases of dissemination and of project monitoring will be under the responsibility of the project coordinator, la R\u00e9gie des Ecrivains. Partner organizations from each of the five countries will collaborate on their side with a local training center and a local certification agency in order to optimize vocational trainings and skills\u2019 recognition of learners there. Afterwards, all these experiences will be shared in order to make adjustments in terms of conduct and evaluation of vocationl trainings and to proceed to the formalization of a common methodology.\r\n\r\nLa R\u00e9gie des Ecrivains, the project coordinator, will guarantee both internal communication between partners and the external one around dissemination and development of the LeGaQual2Do method at European level. Supervision and evaluation of the project activities and results will be based on the Quality Plan in conjunction with the Steering Committee and on an appropriate strategy of risk management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short term, the project will impact mainly adult learners and target groups with sp\u00e9cial needs who will benefit from vocational trainings in workplace, from improving their professional skills and from ther recognition, as well as from their increased mobility on the national and European labour market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potential benefits of the project in the long term will especially impact vocational training organisations and social enterprises which Professional positions will evolve and which will develop new learning methods and forms of evaluation.", "http://www.wsxenterprise.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA202-008515_4"], [2014, "ETHOS \u2013 Exploiting the organisational conflicts in business environment", "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 174902.0, 7, 9, "The ETHOS proposal is aimed to promote and improve new approaches and tools to manage and exploit \u2013 as resources for change -  interpersonal, social and organisational conflicts in business environment in order to support quality and innovation in vocational education by fostering the integration of learning with working life, promoting more conducive  learning environments at the workplace and work-placed training  as a basis for development of vocational skills relevant to the labour market needs.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, in fact, enterprises \u2013 and in particular SMEs - are experiencing a hard time because of the economic situation: the acquisition of skills for dealing with organisational conflicts by entrepreneurs and managers could be a means of repositioning and/or getting through the crisis for enterprises, as suggested by various European documents. For this reason, it is necessary to set up analytical and training tools, methodologies, approaches which promote and encourage the introduction of specific soft skills within corporate training plans. This will create in enterprises an environment and a climate favorable to development and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the ETHOS project was born from a LLP Grundtvig project called CONTEST - COmmunity experimeNts Through the Exploitation of Social Conflicts which, involving most ETHOS partners, was aimed to promote and improve new approaches and tools to manage and exploit \u2013 as resources for change -  interpersonal, social and cultural conflicts in order to enhance social cohesion in Europe and to strenghten European identity.\r\n\r\nFor the abovementioned reasons the ETHOS project intends to:\r\n\r\n- elaborate approches, methodologies and tools for improving in quality and innovation in vocational education;\r\n\r\n- elaborate approches, methodologies and tools forfostering the integration of learning with working life, promoting more learning conducive environments at the workplace, work-placed training as a basis for the development of vocational skills relevant to the labour market needs;\r\n\r\n- develop soft skills realted to conflicts exploitationamong entrepreneurs and managers to improve new innovation-driven role models and management approaches;\r\n\r\n- create within enterprises an environment and a climate which lead to social cohesion, development and innovation;\r\n\r\n- contribute to facilitate processes of repositioning and/or overcoming the crisis for enterprises;\r\n\r\n- promote networking between enterprises and VET provider; \r\n\r\n- elaborate a specific mapping system for the identification of the contextual factors which lead the conflicts in workplace, in order to provide qualitative and quantitative data for setting educational and development policies/strategies for SMEs and continuous education;\r\n\r\n- elaborate an innovative curriculum addressed to entrepreneurs and managers  and aimed at identifying, developing and enhancing workers' competences and skills for dealing with conflicts in workplace and change them in a resource for improvement and growth with reference to business enviroment; \r\n\r\n- realise six experimental training courses, one for each reference country of the project, to train entrepreneurs and managers; involvement of 60 participants in all;\r\n\r\n- realise business labs in order to let acquire workers specific competences and skills to argue well in workplace, exploiting social, cultural and organisational conflicts through the Socratic approach;\r\n\r\n- allow the acquisition by SMEs workers of skills and competences to facilitate the expression, the management and the exploitation of conflicts in workplace, through the Socratic approach;\r\n\r\n- set up a European network between enterprises, and between them, VET providers and organisations which work for the exploitation of conflicts, to promote and develop new approaches and tools to manage and exploit interpersonal, social and organisational conflicts in workplace;\r\n\r\n- implement awareness raising actions to encourage the introduction of soft skills  related to conflicts exploitation in corporate training plans through a process of consultation among enterprises, professional associations, policy makers, VET providers;\r\n\r\n- disseminate the project approaches and results including the main project stakeholders aiming at making the project outcomes known all over Europe;\r\n\r\n- exploit the project outcomes, in order to guarantee the sustainability and the transferability of the project results after the project end.\r\n\r\nThe partnership of the project is composed of different representatives of key actors in the fields of social cohesion and vocational education: organisations which deal with vocational learning, adult learning and advisory activities for enterprises; public institutions which play an active role in the definition of policies and keeps strong relations with institutional bodies and social partner organisations; organisations which work for the development of soft skills aimed at enhancing social cohesion.", "http://www.wsxenterprise.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SI01-KA202-000566_8"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 16137.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_67944"], [2017, "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 16137.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_67945"], [2016, "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 15832.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_69400"], [2016, "WSX ENTERPRISE LIMITED*WSX", 15020.0, "Information outlets (16.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_69858"]]}}, "8XG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1199145600000, 1298851200000, "Advanced Cleaning Devices for Production of Green Syngas", "Porvair Filtration Group Limited", "The transport sector represents a growing share of the total fossil fuel usage in the world. In order to fulfil the commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, the world usage of fossil oil in transport sectors must be reduced. One important approach to achieving this goal is to increase the share of renewable sources such as feedstocks in conversion routes. These biomass conversion routes involve a number of difficulties that should be attended to first by a suitable process configuration to avoid catalyst poisoning in production of syngas. Second, a major problem in the production of syngas-derived fuel from renewable sources is the presence of contaminates in the product gas from biomass gasifiers. These impurities that cause catalytic poisoning should be completely removed prior to the entry in catalytic systems that utilize in upgrading steps. With the evolution of these advanced uses of biomass derived syngas, it becomes necessary to develop progressively more stringent gas cleaning systems. Therefore, the project's key goal is development of a novel gas cleanup in order to reduce impurities from the gasifier\u2019s product gas to limits required for upgrading to syngas using as a feedstock in production of vehicle fuels. To accomplish this target that biomass conversion should preserve high energy efficiency in the subsequent synthesis steps and prevent catalytic poisoning, an alternative product route and more efficient gas cleaning systems are required. Nevertheless, biomass conversion processes offer many economical and environmental benefits, but it is clear that conversion technology should be able to compete with other conversion routes, for example via methane. Therefore, this RTD programme combines European expertise in the field of gasification, different proficiencies in cleaning technologies, high ranking catalyst expertise, catalyst company, and two research companies with R&D activities in the fields to expedite the development and commercialization of research outcomes.", 166113.0, 3465637.0, 7, 10, "GREENSYNGAS", null, "http://www.porvairfiltration.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-06/55231.jpg", "fp7_85766_999716727"], [1214870400000, 1341014400000, "ChIP and MIRA for clinical diagnosis", "Porvair Filtration Group Limited", "DIA-ChIP seeks to develop state-of-the-art molecular techniques for the routine high-throughput analysis of clinical samples for advanced molecular diagnosis and biomedical research. This will be achieved through a collaborative partnership between academic, SME and public health partners interacting through the IAPP, and the secondments and recruitments it supports. New molecular diagnostics in clinical pathology need to be robust, cost effective and offer significant advantages over existing techniques. With the move towards personalised medicine the specificity of diagnosis will need to be enhanced significantly, yet in the short to medium term will need to be compatible with current gold standards of analysis. In this project the focus will be on the most important cancer affecting the female European population \u2013 Breast Cancer. The ability to analyse archived clinical material is currently limited to immuno-histochemistry and quantification the native biomolecules (DNA, RNA, protein). The advent of functional characterisation of these molecules i.e. DNA-protein interactions and DNA status will provide information to enhance diagnostic histopathology. Application to archival material will provide access to a hugely valuable resource and will contribute significantly to scientific understanding of disease processes by allowing the examination of large patient cohorts, and by facilitating direct comparison to model systems. Also by examining patient samples in concert with model human cell culture systems, alternatives to animal model systems will be developed.  DIA-ChIP features the creation of a strategic partnership between 4 groups that is critical in realising the project.

It will not only focus the participants\u2019 attention on water-related issues (e.g. the importance of water in a healthy lifestyle, industry, technology and transportation, water protection) and enable them to broaden their knowledge on these subjects, but it will also help them develop their reading, mathematical, language and ICT skills through their work in the project. By carrying out the project, the project will attempt to reach the aims of Europe 2020 concerning raising the level of reading, science, ICT and math competencies. The project will involve more than two thousand participants, 442 of whom will participate in transnational teaching and learning activities.The theme of water is so broad and diversified that it will enable us to incorporate it into the main parts of the school curriculum. In each partner school there is a need to improve the school curriculum by making students more active in the learning process through more student autonomy and problem-solving tasks. The improved curriculums will include brain-friendly lessons and 'flipped' classroom. Using these methods, students will work on the theme of water in Mathematics, Sciences, ICT, English and other European languages, students will be encouraged to take a cross-curricular approach in noticing the problem, analyzing a possible solution and coming up with their own conclusions through innovations. This way, they will increase their level of competencies, be motivated to study, develop their interdisciplinary skills and raise their awareness of active participation in pursuing their education and future career. It will enable them to become competitive on the job market since there are more and more companies dealing with the issue of water in every European country. Also, teachers will be able to develop their teaching skills by incorporating innovative teaching approach (neurodidactics). They will also improve their language and ICT skills through working together and visiting partner schools, as well as sharing their experiences and good practices. This will encourage life-long learning. 'Water Equals Hundreds of Opportunities' project will also enable people from different European countries to realize what water-related problems other nations have, and how their local and national governments\u2019 decisions concerning water can affect their own country or region. As a result, students\u2019 and local communities\u2019 awareness will be raised and the feeling of facing the same problems and necessity of cooperation among different European nations will be created.
