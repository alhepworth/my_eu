Shakespeare\u2019s plays have enthralled audiences for over 400 years whether as the popular entertainment of their day or the shared culture of modern times performed in dozens of languages and across the world. 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death and the project uses \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cThe Tempest\u201d as a focus for an intercultural and multilingual learning project designed by Germany, Sweden, Slovenia and the UK.The fundamental goal of the project \u201cCulture Shake\u201d (CUSHA) is to develop intellectual outputs for intercultural communication in multilingual educational settings as an open access online resource. The topics integration of refugees, inclusion and ICT \u2013 new digital competences \u2013 are dealt with reaching these goals in the intellectual outputs. Furthermore the project is student-centred as pupils generate multilingual and intercultural teaching material on Shakespeare for their peers. In the strategic framework for European cooperation in education \u201cET 2020\u201d linguistic competence is seen as one of the key competences to promote mobility within Europe. There is a lack of teaching material bridging the gap between theory and practice in the field of linguistic and cultural diversity. Latest theories of intercultural learning or transcultural approaches have not been considered for teaching in schools yet. Therefore the CUSHA is innovative in bridging gaps between theory and practice as well as joining multilingual didactics in the teaching material that is to be designed as open source material online. Concepts for the development of peer teaching material, multilingual cultural sensitive school exchanges, multilingual online dictionaries or multilingual theatre methods are designed and in a next step also hands on activities for the classroom based on these concepts are provided. All the above mentioned concepts are created for inclusive schooling as well as integrating refugees e.g. from world classes into regular classes.With regard to \u201cET 2020\u201d and the \u201cEuropean Language Action Plan\u201d an essential aim is to raise awareness of everyone\u00b4s inward plurilingualism in contact with other plurilingual speakers to foster language learning for a mobile Europe, which is promoted by CUSHA.CUSHA\u2019s objectives:\u2022 promote foreign language learning, cultural awareness\u2022 promote multilingualism and the use of mother tongues\u2022 enhance digital learning\u2022 develop the European dimension in education particularly through the multilingual focus\u2022 use the transnational expertise of the project members\u2022 encourage the best use of results, innovative products and processes\u2022 produce sustainable development of cooperation between the partner countries and institutions in the field of educationThe project is to develop innovative teaching methods based on cultural theories, theatre pedagogy and multilingual didactics. Approaches socializing into a national culture frame are to be shaken. Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cThe Tempest\u201d are chosen as the key tool in the project. Shakespeare not only touches different aspects of intercultural contexts but also enriches an understanding of literature and performance. Multilingual approaches in the classroom match Shakespeare\u2019s multilingual settings. To accomplish this there are four institutions involved with complementing expertise and background. The University of Education Karlsruhe (PH), Germany, as coordinator contributes with theoretical background. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) at Stratford, U.K., as culture centre applying culture to everyday life builds as institution a bridge between theory and practice. Primorska University (UP), Slovenia, provides IT expertise. The two schools, i.e. the Friedrich-W\u00f6hler Gymnasium (FWG), Germany, and the English School Gothenburg (ESG), Sweden, support the project with their practical experiences. 15 pupils, secondary level, of each school and four accompanying teachers take part in the learning activities. They are joined by one lecturer from the PH, the SBT and UP. Thus the intellectual outputs can be tested. There are three learning activities producing \u201cPeer Teaching Material\u201d: pupils meet on eTwinning and then face-to-face to work in the SBT archives and upload the findings in a multilingual online dictionary. The intellectual outputs are hosted at the PH website and the SBT website, ensuring the maximum reach to language teachers from different nations.

Of  these wind is increasingly becoming cost competitive and the cost of wind turbines are dropping as volumes increase. This proposal deals with distributed energy production by small to medium wind turbines in the 10kW-100kW range, used immediately close to the point of power production\nWind energy conversion is a long standing process that has been employed for hundreds of years, but it is complicated and difficult to capture the maximum possible amount of power at any given point in time. The amount of power output from a WECS depends upon the accuracy with which the peak power points are tracked by the MPPT controller of the WECS control system regardless of the generator type.\nFor any wind turbine the maximum point of the power curve occurs at a particular rotor speed for a given wind speed. Even a small variation from this rotor speed will cause a significant decrease in the power extracted from the wind. Rotor speed, for a given wind speed, is dependent upon generator loading as well as the fluctuation in the wind speed. Power extraction strategies assess the wind conditions and then introduce control actions to adjust the turbine\u2019s rotational speed so that it will operate at the turbine\u2019s highest aerodynamic efficiency. Conversion strategies that have not been optimised can lead to significant wasted wind energy.\nThere have been many attempts to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms but these have not been successfully translated from academic studies to reliable working industrial implementations in our power range.

Complementary to rapid growth in the NGV market, the addressable market is projected to be 133,000 units in Europe and globally by 2020.\nSteps required to prepare the technology for exploitation on this level include: value engineering; a robust EU supply chain; detailed knowledge of EU target markets and drivers/barriers, country-specific critical failure factors and mains gas infrastructure; initial exploitation strategy for maximum market penetration; EU certification of product/installation procedure; strategy to form critical mass market growth complementary to NGVs. \nThe proposed Phase 1 feasibility study seeks to address these requirements by delivery of priority matrix and roadmap for EU exploitation; roadmap for EU-wide certification; IP roadmap; system and component specifications including make/buy decisions for mass production; detailed project plan and scope for main project; installation specification; detailed market forecasts and return-on-investment capability as a function of NGV uptake.", 37036.0, 52909.0, 1, 1, "NGV - PRA", null, null, null, "h2020_198929_941013685"]]}}, "8RP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1401580800000, 1464652800000, "Rail inspection by Flexible Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer", "Rail Alliance Limited", "Railway maintenance is a costly activity that can be improved by faster inspection of assets. If the speed of inspection of the railhead can be increased the potential cost savings are significant. Current NDT solutions implement hand held devices that effectively scan at walking pace. EMAT devices have been utilised to demonstrate that a non-contact solution that can be mounted to a vehicle is feasible. Technical development is therefore required to increase the scanning area and increase the speed of processing to inspect the entire railhead. RIFLEX will develop a system that can inspect the entire contour of the railhead using a multiple, flexible EMAT transducers that conform to the shape of the railhead.

CITI-SENSE will develop, test, demonstrate and validate a community-based environmental monitoring and information system using innovative and novel Earth Observation applications.\nTo achieve this, the project will: (i) raise environmental awareness in citizens, (ii) raise user participation in societal environmental decisions and (iii) provide feedback on the impact that citizens had in decisions. It will address the call\u2019s request for effective participation by citizens in environmental stewardship, based on broad stakeholder and user involvement in support of both community and policy priorities. The project aims to learn from citizen experience and perception and enable citizenship co-participation in community decision making and co-operative planning.\nThe concept of CITI-SENSE rests on three pillars: technological platforms for distributed monitoring; information and communication technologies; and societal involvement. Three pilot case studies will focus on a range of services related to environmental issues of societal concern: combined environmental exposure and health associated with air quality; noise and development of public spaces, and indoor air at schools. Attention will be given to representativeness of citizen participation. The case studies will be designed in collaboration with citizens\u2019 groups and decision makers. They will be based on distributed data collection using innovative static, portable and personal devices (low-cost reliable microsensor packs) that communicate with a data repositories through mobile phones or other devices.
