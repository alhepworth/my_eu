Those industries (performing, visual arts, broadcast media, digital games, design, creative marketing, PR, fashion, cultural heritage) which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property  and which is a powerful tool to activate new learning processes (mainly non formal) for EU citizens and community.\r\n\r\nAnalysis made on the sector pointed out the potential contribution of CCIs to the economy and society first (KEA 2006) in terms of wealth and jobs (UNCTAD 2008/2011), then on the positive spillover effects on employment other non-creative sectors (KEA 2009). \r\n\r\nThe project \u201cBreak in the Desk\u201d wants to train creative and artists in order to stimulate their entrepreneurial spirit making them able to activate new business and projects creating economic value from their performances and activities.

However, data show that the rate of intra-EU labour mobility is still quite low, although significant numbers of European workers state their willingness to work in another European country.  The discrepancy between the high propensity to mobility and actual low mobility rates is in part attributable to an insufficient provision of services and qualified professionals in support of transnational mobility.\r\nThe purpose of project AMICO is to facilitate labour mobility among European countries. To this end, it articulates an entire process for:\r\n1. enhancing the professionalization of job counsellors, especially in relation to international job placement,  designing an innovative curriculum for \u201cJob Mobility Counsellors\u201d;\r\n2. strengthening matching skills at international level, with a set of tailored tools;\r\n3. improving the provision of services in support of intra-EU labour mobility, designing processes and procedures for their implementation and management\r\nThe project addresses: Universities that can benefit from the curriculum, including it in their educational offer. Young graduates or students interested in a career as job counsellors, who can find in AMICO an innovative training opportunity. Employment services that could take advantage from a set of tools to expand and enhance the services offered by their organisations as well as on an increased offer of duly trained people. ICT job-seekers and enterprises that can find in the Mobility Welcome Service and in the Mobility Job Counsellors an important support in all issues related to labour mobility and international hiring.  \r\nThe audience of indirect beneficiaries also includes: ICT enterprises that develop innovative services and/or products and that have difficulties in recruiting qualified human resources according to their needs. Public and private employment services, which want to re-qualify their staff in relation to the management and the promotion of mobility. Labour unions and association of enterprises that want to activate services for enterprises and workers in support of training/job mobility.\r\nThe tangible outputs of AMICO can be summarised in 5 products, realised through synergies among enterprises, universities and employment services:\r\n1. Mobility Job  Counsellor Curriculum, consisting in a handbook containing the curriculum\u2019s structure and objectives as well as all the didactic materials for its delivery;\r\n2. Toolkit for the Validation and Quality Assurance of the Mobility Job  Counsellor Curriculum, which will allow the transnational transferability of the curriculum, defining shared recognition and validation tools and quality assurance procedures;\r\n3. Transnational Job Placement Toolkit, which includes i) tools for assessing business needs, and ii) tools for evaluating job-seekers skills in relation to the ICT sector. Both are designed in a way to be internationally comparable;\r\n4. Mobility Welcome Service Handbook, providing practical guidelines to install the service;\r\n5.

One teacher (IT teacher)of our school unit was selected according to his advanced skills, willingness, team spirit and diligence.

The strengthening of student's Creativity and Critical Thinking with the help of digital tools will engage him in the learning procedure and will also improve his learning outcomes. Teacher will acquire the ability to manage the special needs of the students and create a supportive system and methods for them.  2)  The acquisition of information and knowledge regarding the educational system of Finland, which is considered to be among the best in the world. The participant will be informed and gain first hand experience of the good practices employed by the Finnish educational model. He will be informed and trained in the transition to digital learning with the use of innovative methods and tools as it is practiced in the schools in Finland. He will have a direct, first hand experience of how work is organized in schools and what the up-to-date learning premises might look like as well as gain insight to school curriculum and new methods  of in-service training.Both the above training activities will aid and support the European orientation of our school through the contacts and relationships that will be developed among the participant teacher and his foreign colleagues.The above training project will be realized with the use of a variety of pedagogical methods.The aim of the above training plan is to develop and enhance the educational work of the school unit.
