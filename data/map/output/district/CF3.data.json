This project aims to provide participating schools with the training and support needed to effect changes to curriculum delivery.We intend to put young people at the heart of this project giving them the opportunity to work with teachers and contributing to the success of the outputs.  Participating teachers will receive comprehensive training on how they can embed creativity across the curriculum and how by improving their own skills in delivering creativity they can raise standards across all subjects but especially in literacy, numeracy and digital competences.   As part of our dissemination and sustainability plans we will train participating teachers to coach others in order to embed creativity across the curriculum in their own setting but also teachers from a wider group of schools, locally, nationally and internationally.  Creative Arts (overarching description of any activity such as drama, music, graphic arts, performing arts, film, visual arts etc.) is increasingly being recognized as an effective tool for working with young people and to give them a means to express themselves openly. Creative Arts is an effective tool to empower all  students including those with behavioural or mental health problems through creativity.  It is a form of expression that improves and enhances physical and emotional wellbeing through reconciling emotional conflicts and fostering self awareness.  In today's society the perception of the success is parallel to academic success.We will include young people from a wide range of ability and socio-economic background.  This projects meets the European Prog. objectives of promoting equity and inclusion by facilitating access to education for learners from a range of ability and those from disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities compared to their peers.Some participating pupils are disadvantaged because of:-disability.  That is participants with special needs people with mental, physical, sensory or other disabilities-educational difficulties. This includes young people with learning difficulties, at risk of early school-leaving, low qualification and/or poor school performance- socio-economic disadvantage.  To include young people with a low standards of living, low family income, dependence on social welfare etc.The pupils will take part in a series of activities throughout the project allowing them the opportunity to express themselves through creativity and to identify skills that they believe make a creative teacher.

Many students also feel that while they are prepared for taking part in examinations they do not  have the skills to take responsibility for their own learning and become lifelong learners and that some lessons do not prepare them for post school experiences. Education & Training 2020 identifies that at school level there are still too many students that leave school early and/or do not have the competencies required for 21st century future employment. While overall standards of teaching in many schools is good there are still too many instances where the quality of teaching falls below the expected requirements. OECD International Summit (2011) states that quality of teaching is imperative to improved pupil outcomes; the challenge is to equip all not some teachers for effective learning in the 21st century.The project\u2019s OVERALL AIM is to strengthening the quality of leadership, pedagogy, communities and policy in school education. We have identified the OECD publication (2010) \u2018The Nature of Learning\u2019 which supports our ideas to create a \u2018Culture of Learning\u2019  (CoL) in schools to support high quality teaching & learning by developing processes to meet the needs of learners.Through working with the multi-stakeholder partnership (schools/universities/LA) of this project we will identify these processes and develop an interactive CoL tool/matrix and guidance (O1/O2) for schools and stakeholder to use to identify where their strengths are and what needs to be improved to create an effective CoL. Our MAIN OBJECTIVE is to strengthen the competencies and learning of all students by organisation of the process of learning in school in the way that helps them to learn effectively through strengthening teachers\u2019 professionalism. Specific Objectives are student centered:1 Learners at the centre 2 The social nature of learning3 Emotions as integral to learning4 Recognizing individual differences5 Stretching of all students6 Assessment for learning7 Building horizontal connectednessThrough identifying these processes for developing a school environment that supports CoL we will then work on the areas that contribute to the CoL tool/matrix (O1/O2)through the following activities:O3-O4 \u2013 study the impact of project on students\u2019 wellbeing through a 3 year annual survey and reports identifying strengths and areas for development05-06- strengthen the professionalism of teaching profession with action research challenges built into short study visits and case studies produced after these visits.07 a self-evaluation tool kit for teachers to reflect on and improve/adapt their practice08- More innovative teaching and assessment resources to reflect needs of 21st century learning \u2013 with digital learning  and competence core requirement.09 \u2013 website to host interactive CoL tool O1 and resources and tools developedO10 \u2013 instructional blogs/videos produced by practitioners to support innovative teaching &  learningWe will use a Professional Learning Community methodology with partners; it is a participatory approach based on identifying the problems, seeking solutions from research, testing solutions in context and evaluating impact.   CoL project will focus on the teaching profession at classroom and leadership level and their inter-relationship with their community (pupils and parents) LAs, universities and policy makers in creating the \u2018CoL'.Our participants are:7 Schools 300+ Senior leaders and teaching staff in the schoolsOver 3000+ potential Students in 7 schools1 LA  Education Directorate University Wales Trinity St David \u2013 education faculty 2 lead staffUniversity Latvia Faculty of Education \u2013 4 lead staffJagiellonian University Poland -Education Dept.- 2 lead staff 12 multiplier events will target 300+ additional participantsThe results/impact of the project :Identified conditions for 21st century skills and culture of learningIMPROVED PROCESSES and SYSTEM CHANGE  increasing participation of students in effective learningImproved quality of lessons and subsequent learningIncreased professionalism of teaching profession \u2013 including synergy with New deal for teachers WalesNew resources tailored to 21st century skills, specifically supporting Successful Futures, Wales; Improving literacy skills in Iceland, promoting STEM subjects for Latvia/Wales and involving students in their learning for PolandImproved outcomes for students \u2013 supporting ET2020 targets", "http://www.greenwayprimary.com/", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024318_9"]]}}}}
