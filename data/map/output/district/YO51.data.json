The Individual Research Projects of 14 ESRs provide knowledge exchange across three research clusters \n(i) Cardiac tissue function and cardiac support\n(ii) Cardiovascular haemodynamics - pathology and intervention\n(iii) Image-based diagnosis and imaging quality assurance. \nThe work will be directed by the needs of industrial and clinical Beneficiaries and Partners, providing a truly multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral environment for the ESRs. This will combine the expertise of nine core Beneficiaries (5 academic, 4 industrial) and 10 Partners (5 clinical, 4 industrial, 1 academic) to provide scientific support, secondments and training. \nVPH-CaSE will foster the development of ESRs within a collaborative environment. The recruited researchers will find themselves in an enviable position to leverage the expertise of a strategic sector of the European medical devices/simulation industry and engage with the issues faced by clinical experts in the domain of cardiac medicine and cardiovascular support. Their postgraduate studies will be informed by a translational bias that delivers a competitive skill-set, equipping them to address the challenges presented by a career at the cutting edge of technological innovation in healthcare delivery. The inclusion of a technology translation SME within the consortium is designed to promote the delivery of novel, tangible research outputs, providing benefits to a breadth of European sectors (eg. biomedical, clinical, VPH).

The objectives and methodology of the proposed collaborative project are: 1. To develop evidence-based guidelines on use of CBCT in dentistry, including referral criteria, quality assurance guidelines and optimisation strategies. Guideline development will use systematic review and established methodology, involving stakeholder input. 2. To determine the level of patient dose in dental CBCT, paying special attention to paediatric dosimetry, and personnel dose. 3. To perform diagnostic accuracy studies for CBCT for key clinical applications in dentistry by use of in vitro and clinical studies. 4. To develop a quality assurance programme, including a tool/tools for quality assurance work (including a marketable quality assurance phantom) and to define exposure protocols for specific clinical applications.  5. To measure cost-effectiveness of important clinical uses of CBCT compared with traditional methods. 6.

The HTL Hallein and it's partner schools will provide work placements abroad. These internships should give the students the opportunity to learn for their future careers and also to do a lot for their individual development. Managing their everyday life abroad is a new experience for most of the students . Organizing living, food, public transport, etc. is a great challenge for them.In the summer holiday 2016, 10 students of the HTL Hallein will do their interships abroad. Therefore the HTL Hallein established partnerships with different schools in England and the Netherlands. Every partner has to organize the internships for the students coming from abroad. HTL Hallein looks for companies which can provide internships in the greater area of Salzburg. In June/July and September/October students from Sheffield and Drachten will come to Hallein and teachers of the HTL Hallein will support these students during their stay here in Hallein. The cooperation between the schools from Sheffield, Drachten and Hallein was established in the last years during different Comeniusprojects. The partnerships have become very stable in the meantime. We organize the projects and keep in touch mostly by e-mail. During the last years we have got the possibility to hold conversations face to face a few times. During these meetings it was possible to discuss all the problems and fix up the strategies for the future.On the basis of these internships the students should learn to cope with the problems that arise from living abroad and can realize the chances of going abroad. The employees of the different companies are forced to use English for communication.  Most of them need not  speak English at work or at home. During the internships the students have to communicate in English. So they will lose the inhibition of speaking English and get in contact with foreign people.The first days abroad the students will be integrated into the everyday life at school. So they should become acquainted to schools abroad. After that first phase they will work for 3 to 4 weeks at different companies. During their interships the students should frequently report about their expierences and jobs. At the end of the interships the students will write summaries and will be able to have presentations at school and for the local press.In the future the HTL Hallein will try to organize longer stays abroad for our students. They should attend schools abroad for minimum of 6 months. But untill now we have not built up the basic conditions. Also, students have a lot of concerns about going abroad for a longer period of time. We therefore have to built up an organisation and have to make much more of experiences to send students abroad.", "http://www.untha.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016574_3"]]}}, "9NS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1220227200000, 1298851200000, "Development of an affordable heat treatment process for wood", "Critical Processes Ltd", "Recent developments of large scale heat treatment processes that use a variety of indirect heat sources are now available, as are traditional preservation treatments which involve certain hazardous chemicals. While these technologies offer some attraction to large scale enterprises, the ability of SMEs to afford this technology makes them an impractical solution. Furthermore these new heat treatment methods affect the chemical and physical structure of the timber, making it more brittle and reducing its physical strength while chemical preservation means that timber can only be used in external applications. We propose the development of a cost effective 2 stage system, firstly, the heat treatment process which will preserve the timber will use a novel microwave based technology to directly heat the timber. Secondly the development of a natural oil formulation to be applied directly to the hot timber within the heating chamber which will restore the natural mechanical and physical properties and maximise the opportunities.

To achieve this, the BACCHUS consortium has assembled 12 leading Research & Technological centres and 16 SMEs (with ca 30% of the EC requested contribution allocated to the SMEs). BACCHUS thus contains SMEs directly involved in developing food products and pursuing health claims, experts in health claims legislation and the EFSA review process, and academic and industry partners who provide high quality food and health research that can underpin health claims. Existing SME-developed products that have clear potential for obtaining favourable opinions for health claims have been selected as test cases for study. These have been aligned with a series of work-packages each of which addresses key aspects of the EFSA health claim evaluation process (legislation and dossiers; product/bioactive characterisation; habitual intakes; bioavailability; mechanisms and biomarkers; clinical trials evidence of health benefit) that will deliver tools, processes and high quality original science. Scientific results and best practice guidelines will be made publically available and thus support future claims for industry. The scope and completeness of the existing bioactive database (eBASIS) that includes both compositional and biological effects data will be extended and developed as a sustainable tool with various training materials. All outcomes will be disseminated broadly by direct engagement with SMEs via an existing European SME association, with stakeholders via seminars, newsletters and press releases, as well as through traditional scientific routes (high quality publications, and conference presentations).", 33899.0, 6079481.0, 11, 28, "BACCHUS", "http://www.bacchus-fp7.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/157182.jpg", "fp7_104530_992434064"]]}}}}
