Many of our students at our vocational educations have rarely been abroad and have not realized the benefits of active EU citizenship and what our EU membership means. A goal in our project is to change this. \r\nOur project has the title \"Europe in our hands - for the development of professional and administrative competence, communication and integration in different cultures\"\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are also to increase the international perspective. The school's exchanges contribute to increasing competence, which also means that we can contribute to raising competence among our stakeholders and supervisors outside the school. International Mobility helps to boost business development towards active EU citizenship.\r\nOur primary goals are based on our internationalization strategy / action plan that aims to meet and work with people from different cultures in different contexts as far as possible and participate in reality-based learning to increase their desire to learn and to develop their skills, develop their vocational skills and strengthening their language skills in order to become employable throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the project are staff as well as students on the Business and Commerce Programme  HA and the Handicraft Programme HV and teachers and at the Riksgymnasiet for deaf and hearing impaired RG, a total of 55 people, of which almost half are students. We have a somewhat larger staff participation based on the fact that we start up international practice in several places and we want to get into the country's vocational education through job shadowing that can help strengthen our students and the conditions for their mobility. Job shadowing in England is based on the fact that the school successfully integrates deaf students with hearing in, for example, hairdressing practice. Therefore, principals also participates in this job shadow to see the organizational conditions there. The students have workplace-based learning, vocational practice on selected companies we think are suitable for this purpose. Through the project, all participants will increase their qualifications for developing their communicative, linguistic and social skills while at the same time increasing their professional and working skills for a future life as EU citizens. It is also much easier to develop the EU's key competencies in such a project than just being at school.\r\n\r\nWe have routines for preparing supervisors, teachers and students with caregivers for mobility, and there are developed communication channels for preparation, implementation, follow-up and dissemination of the project's experiences. We will also\r\nto use eTwinning to create contact with schools in our mobility areas as preparation. In order for all the mobility to work fully, there is a competent internalization group consisting of principal, school ambassador, internationalization coordinator. Competent staff handle operational issues regarding administration and finance. We select our partners carefully and then visit them on site. \r\nThese will be constantly evolving so we have regular follow-up with our partners to ensure that everything works well. We see our partnerships as long-term and recurring, which also guarantees quality in case of long-term cooperation. We also continuously monitor the students' work through our learning platform, through student blogs and instagrams, and through phone calls or Skype.\r\n\r\nThere are many longterm, educational benefits with the project\u00b4s international collaborations, opportunities to compare their school's activities with other schools, as well as discuss with teachers from other countries how they work to reach the EU's future competencies and goals in School 2020 for the students. By doing this, teachers can take on other teachers' experiences and develop their teaching and contribute to active school development.", "http://www.walsallcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038936_6"]]}}, "9PS": {"nhs": {"data": [["RBK", "Manor Hospital", "nhs_RBK02"]]}}, "9XH": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYK", "Dorothy Pattison Hospital", "nhs_RYK10"]]}}}}
