This will put Europe as a leader on the world market for segments in industrial water treatment which will create new high skilled jobs in Europe. \nWith extended collaboration between technology providers including innovative SME\u2019s, world-wide active companies in the chemical and steel industries and research organizations, this project also contributes to the aims of the SPIRE SRA, the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on 'Water' and to the aims of the Commission\u2019s Roadmap on Resource efficiency, supporting effective implementation of European directives and policies in the water management area.\nINSPIREWATER addresses non-technical barriers as well as technical, as innovation needs both components and demonstrates them in the steel and chemical industry. A flexible system for water management in industries that can be integrated to existing systems is worked out and demonstrated to facilitate implementation of technical innovations.  Technical innovations in the area of selected membrane technologies, strong field magnetic particle separator, and a catalyst to prevent biofouling are demonstrated, including valorisation of waste heat. This will increase process water efficiency as well as resource, water and energy savings in the process industry.\nThe development and demonstration work is combined with a strong emphasis on exploitation and dissemination. Specific exploitation strategies are developed for the different solutions in INSPIREWATER. Dissemination targets different target groups: Stakeholders in different process industry also beyond the involved ones, e.g. Pulp and paper, but also policy makers based on the findings of the project.", 574117.0, 6649579.0, 6, 11, "INSPIREWater", null, null, null, "h2020_205618_996837088"]]}}, "8JX": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "INNOVOMANTEX LTD*", 13677.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_69109"], [2017, "CAROLINE MACREADY CONSULTING LTD*", 13084.0, "Progress \u2014 Supporting the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Union employment and social policy and working conditions legislation (04.03.02.01)", "fts_2017_69476"], [2016, "CAROLINE MACREADY CONSULTING LTD*", 12178.0, "Progress \u2014 Supporting the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Union employment and social policy and working conditions legislation (04.03.02.01)", "fts_2016_71750"], [2017, "INNOVOMANTEX LTD*", 3419.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_71630"]]}}, "9AE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1370044800000, 1469923200000, "Suicide Bomber Counteraction and Prevention", "Cerberus Black Ltd", "SUBCOP sets out to develop technologies and procedures that can be applied by the Police Security Forces when responding to a suspected PBIED (Person Borne Improvised Explosive Device).

SuBCoP is insensitive to how the alert is raised, should it be based on detection of explosives or explosive devices, informants\u2019 reporting, or other intelligence sources. It is however sensitive to the fact that the alert only gives cause for suspecting the presence of a PBIED, and that this suspicion can be of lower or higher confidence.

The core objective of SUBCOP is to consider\n\n\u2022\tthe available technological tools for less than lethal PBIED intervention,\n\u2022\tthe novel procedures for their application, and\n\u2022\tthe development of new less than lethal capabilities\n\nThese together will fit to the highly set requirements; to avoid injuries on the suspect yet control the situation to such an extent that no harm will come to innocent bystanders or first responders, should the suspicion of a PBIED presence be accurate.

These trusted networks, built horizontally and vertically, will fully integrate shippers, LSPs and intermodal operators as equal partners. To reach a high level of sustainability, we will not only bundle freight volumes, but shift them off the road to intermodal rail and waterway. NEXTRUST will build these trusted networks ideally bottom up, with like-minded partners, adding multiple layers of transport flows that have been de-coupled and then re-connected more effectively along the supply chain. We will develop C-ITS cloud based smart visibility software to support the re-engineering of the networks, improving real-time utilization of transport assets. NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions. The action engages major shippers as partners (Beiersdorf, Borealis, Colruyt, Delhaize, KC, Mondelez, Panasonic, Philips, Unilever) owning freight volumes well over 1.000.000 annual truck movements across Europe, plus SME shippers and LSPs with a track record in ICT innovation. The pilot cases cover the entire scope of the call and cover a broad cross section of entire supply chain (from raw material to end-consumers) for multiple industries. The creation and validation of trusted collaborative networks will be market oriented and implemented at an accelerated rate for high impact. We expect our pilot cases to reduce deliveries by 20%-40% and with modal shift to reduce GHG emissions by 40%-70%. Load factors will increase by 50%-60% given our emphasis on back-load/modal shift initiatives.
