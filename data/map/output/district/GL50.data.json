High level modelling allows an architectural independent description of the application and for this reason it is prone to customization for different architectural templates.  In ToucHMore, customization will be performed in an automated way through automated generation of parallel code for multicore tiles and the required mechanisms to manage reconfigurable DSPs/accelerators.In addition, the ToucHMore tool-chain customization environment will focus on energy efficiency and robustness of the generated code, where the uncertainties due to fabrications of transistors in nanometer technologies will be hidden, thus mitigating their impact in terms of energy and performance.

The other advantage of Open Badges is their portability and visibility in an electronic world - they can be shared across various online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Certificate Supplement was designed to make vocational education and training qualifications more transparent both within, but particularly between, European member states. Whilst widely issued in some member states, it is less well known in others. The reasons for this vary and are dependant on each national context. \r\n\r\nIn its standard form, the Certificate Supplement is a generic document, specific to the individual, but in some member states, the Certificate Supplement is an individualised supplement - essentially an enhanced transcript - that provides a record of what a student actually achieved.\r\n\r\nESCO is a multilingual taxonomy for skills, competences, qualifications, and occupations and provides a common language for recording skills / learning outcomes required for particular occupations and qualifications. \r\n\r\nWhat these tools have in common is that they were designed to support the transition between learning (formal / non-formal / informal) and the world of work.\r\n\r\nABECS will seek to combine the best attributes of electronic transcripts, the Certificate Supplements and ESCO and incorporate them in a modern, portable, verified, shareable, visible, electcronic package - an Open Badge.

In recent years these have culminated in the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) (2005-2014) and the Global Action Programme on ESD (2014-2019), each of which have had varying degrees of influence on national education systems. In reality, \u2018mainstream\u2019 education continues to pay little heed to sustainable development for a variety of reasons but two of the principle roadblocks are (1) the lack of clarity among educators on what ESD actually requires in terms of educator competences and (2) an apparent inability to measure ESD outcomes. An initial Erasmus+ funded project \u2018A Rounder Sense of Purpose\u2019 (RSP, 2015-18) has made a significant contribution in addressing these concerns having developed and tested a robust framework of competences for educators \u2013 of any discipline \u2013 who wish to educate for sustainable development. This has been translated into qualifications in various settings and has been disseminated through national and international conferences. \r\n\r\nSince RSP was first conceived, however, a significant international development has taken place in the form of the United Nations Agenda 2030 (UN General Assembly 2015) and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In light of this and the specific SDG Target 4.7 (education for sustainable development) we have identified the need to build on the achievements of our first project while addressing the globally agreed imperative to \u201censure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development\u201d (UN 2015). To this end we propose the project \u2018A Rounder Sense of Purpose: Phase Two\u2019 (RSP II). \r\n\r\nThe objectives of RSP II will be to:\r\n- Develop and implement the RSP framework for different phases of education aligning it with the SDGs and the related UNESCO learning objectives (UNESCO 2017); in this way the project also intends to contribute to the on-going international effort to draft indicators for SDG Target 4.7;\r\n- draw upon and contribute to research to tackle deep-rooted issues around motivation, conceptual understanding and assessment that were identified but could not be addressed fully in Phase I;\r\n- provide a tangible and accessible legacy in the form of a book giving a narrative account of the theory and practice behind the RSP framework.\r\n\r\nTeacher education remains a core focus because of its multiplier effect but a systemic understanding of the situation leads us to demonstrate the potential of the RSP framework elsewhere and to hone it further in order to enhance its transferability. Target audiences (and approximate numbers) therefore include: \r\n- University lecturers (80) \r\n- Pre-service (student) teachers (800)\r\n- Teachers and principals (500)\r\n- Other educators, e.g. inspectors, local authority and enterprises (100) \r\n- Academics/ experts (500)\r\n- Policy makers e.g. through Government policy forums (80)\r\nThese numbers relate to face-to-face contact through workshops and in-depth training programmes. We also envisage reaching approximately 1,000 teachers though workshops and conferences. At the EU level we expect some 100,000 citizens (based on current traffic levels) to access our websites and publications.\r\n\r\nThe project activities and the methodology used to carry them are indivisible because this is essentially an action research project. The emphasis is on action in the production of Output 1 while further research (Output 2) into issues that arose during the first phase of this project can best be achieved in the context of practical engagement with the programme with students (all educators in their own right) participating actively in the programme development process even as they are receiving it. Dissemination and the sustainability of impact are core concerns of RSP II, hence the focus on sharing our research outcomes as an outcome in itself. The publication of a book that shares the story of the entire process is proposed as our Output 3.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to achieve a broad and deep engagement with the RSP competence framework by working through influential partner organisations in each participating country (and beyond) to develop and disseminate the framework. In this way we aim to move out of the \u2018green ghetto\u2019 of like-minded organisations and individuals and into the mainstream of educational discourse in our respective countries as well as internationally. Our partnership also has very strong links with United Nations agencies such as UNESCO and UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe) and we will take every opportunity to share our outputs through these agencies so that globally governments become aware that qualifications can be developed anywhere using this competence framework. In this way education for sustainable development will no longer be an esoteric concept with little practical meaning for teachers working at the classroom level.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048121_coordinator"], [2018, "FireFront: A method for measuring and training firefighter sensemaking across multiple training platforms", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 316719.0, 6, 7, "The FireFront project is aimed at improving the training of firefighters, particularly with regard to their understanding and awareness of the fireground, an understanding that is safety-critical.

Championing a socially and environmentally sustainable form of development has implications for both what is taught in our schools and the way it is conducted. This highlights the 'bottleneck' of there not being enough teachers who have the competence to teach education for sustainable development (ESD). \r\n\r\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has developed a framework of educator competences for ESD. This, however, remains a theoretical tool that has not been (i) translated into concrete, measurable actions or (ii) tested against other pressing economic priorities. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to bring together six committed institutions, to achieve the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To develop a practical accreditation model that teacher educators can use in any European context so that pre-service educators can demonstrate their competence in ESD through a widely-recognised model of accreditation\r\n\r\n2. To develop and disseminate a \u2018tools and guidelines\u2019 document to help teacher educators implement the accreditation model in a variety of contexts and give pre-service educators the opportunity to demonstrate their competence in a concrete, measurable manner \r\n\r\n3. To enhance mainstream educator training programmes with a wider set of competences that will more accurately reflect the role of formal education in supporting smart, sustainable and inclusive economic development. This will, inter alia, increase the capacity of participating institutions to:\r\na. Recognise and validate a broader range of competences among student educators including generic and transferable skills \r\nb. Embrace a wider range of social and environmental concerns within their programmes\r\nc. Work in an inter-disciplinary manner\r\nd. Recruit students who are attracted by the institution\u2019s participative approaches  \r\ne. Develop strategies to enhance organisational learning \r\nf. Work internationally using digital media on a regular basis\r\n\r\n4. To conduct a thorough, formative and summative external evaluation of the project\r\n\r\n5. To conduct research into the impact of engagement with the competence framework on pre-service teachers.\r\n\r\nBy working closely with practitioners in a range of different contexts, the project aims to facilitate the engagement of 50 teacher educators and over 400 pre-service teachers in the practical application of the ESD competences. The accreditation model will provide other institutions with a straightforward means of assessing and certificating student achievement in ESD \u2013 a useful addition to any educator preparation programme. The 'tools and guidelines' publication will ensure that those who wish to use the accreditation model are supported in their efforts to integrate sustainable development into their mainstream programmes.\r\n\r\nThese outputs will be developed through the practical implementation of prototype models, closely monitored through regular discussion with partners in which challenges and triumphs are shared openly, and through periodic transnational meetings to finalise outputs and map out next steps. The outputs will be disseminated via the project website but also through a series of national launch event during the final months of the project.\r\n\r\nParticipating pre-service educators will learn to recognise the way in which their own values can be reflected in their teaching and be better able to integrate ESD into different aspects of their teaching whatever their subject specialism. Teacher educators will better understand the principles and rationale behind ESD and become advocates for this process in their work. The project will enhance existing educator training programmes with a wider set of competences that will reflect more accurately the role of formal education in supporting smart, sustainable and inclusive economic development. By being able to provide accredited learning alongside any programme of educator preparation, the project will provide a readily accessible solution to the problem of teachers and other educators being ill-equipped to prepare their students for a sustainable economy.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA203-013720_coordinator"], [2015, "Emotional Education for Early School Leaving Prevention", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 294298.0, 6, 7, "EUMOSCHOOL strongly relates to ET 2020 key benchmarks for education which includes the headline target to reduce the rate of early school leaving (ESL) to less than 10% by 2020. Council Recommendation on policies to reduce ESL (June 2011) + Country specific recommendations identify ESL as policy priority area for specific Member States + the urgency to take immediate action.\r\n\r\nESL is closely intertwined with other educational + social issues and early intervention should also focus on emotional dimensions to ESL such as mental health, bullying, school climate, family support outreach, substance abuse prevention, fear of failure/success (ET2020 Working Group on School Policy Dec 2014) . EUMOSCHOOL recognises Member States should promote holistic collaborative practices among teachers as a powerful tool to change + introduce new practices in the school systems (Rethinking Education 2012).  Furthermore, teachers should have sufficient opportunities to acquire a broad spectrum of teaching practices which correspond to the latest pedagogical research (TALIS 2013)\r\n\r\nThus, the most relevant priorities + topics addressed by EUMOSCHOOL are to support schools to tackle early school leaving (ESL) and disadvantage as well as to address all students from the lowest to the highest end of academic spectrum and strengthen the profile of the teaching professions. This will be done through the development of new innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses.\r\n\r\nTo address these priorities, EUMOSCHOOL is based on the adaptation at EU level of the Italian methodology \u201cDidattica delle Emozioni\u201d\u00a9(Didactic of Emotions, DoE), developed from 16 years\u2019 experience + investigation into emotional education. The methodology has been successfully tested on 3000 teachers, students, parents/tutors in order to improve the wellbeing & transversal key competencies of pupils thus reducing ESL whilst upgrading professional competencies of teachers & pedagogical staff. EUMOSCHOOL will aim to spread the adapted methodology to a wide range of students, teachers, staff + schools through piloting and adoption of emotional education into school curricula.\r\n\r\nThe 4 specific objectives are to:\r\n-Contribute to effective ESL strategies through the integration of emotional education intervention methodology in school curricula for all students impacting on the reduction of early school leaving\r\n-Through emotional education foster development and assessment of transversal skills and competences among students to favour wellness and diminish emotional discomfort risks\r\n-Increase professional skills of teachers in the field by equipping them with an accessible ESL intervention methodology utilised through OERs combined with practical techniques and assessment tools, and adapted for classroom learning at any level\r\n-Support holistic collaborative approaches to teaching through networking and events to promote dialogue with stakeholders in school education across Europe and foster the exchange of good practices to address and support children and young people at risk of ESL and disadvantage\r\n\r\nThis project is based on the partnership of 7 diverse organisations from 6 EU countries introducing new ideas in education: 1 private school (ASIST-DOGA), 4 NGOs (CSC, ETC + CILSDGC + VM), 1 Foundation (ROGERS) & 1 University (UOG) with extensive experience of working in schools and in the delivery of projects addressing school education, disadvantage, research & development of innovative training methodologies to tackle ESL. \r\n\r\nTarget groups are:\r\n-Direct TG: 750 pupils aged 6 to 16 (125 pupils in each partner country except UK) \r\n-Direct TG: 30 teachers (6 teachers in each partner country except UK)\r\n-DTG3: 30 schools/600 teachers/30 headmasters/30 policy makers, 450+ stakeholders from across all partner countries which will be engaged with specifically in the development of Policy Recommendations led by UOG to ensure evidence base results are transferred to policy actions and mainstreamed at institutional level.\r\n\r\n3 phases:\r\n1.Preparation: Research: teachers, school & contexts needs + literature review on emotional education; DoE will be adapted into accessible ICT-based learning tools + creation of Community of Practice;\r\n2.

Not only humans play, play-like activities have already been found in insects and  all mammals play as juveniles. Play researchers believe that play is the basic form of learning for life and as playwork theory states all \u201csocial, physical, intellectual, creative and emotional\u201d (SPICE) aspects are developed through play, especially through freely chosen, intrinsically motivated and self-controlled play. However today play is at risk. Children of today \u2013 especially in urban areas- have much less access to play, have less play time and less freedom as control is exerted by risk averse parents/ adults.\r\n\r\nThe leverage point of the system of factors influencing play in society, is clearly the schools. They are where all the children can be found, and spend most of their time. Therefore schools shall be formulated to provide more play spaces and opportunities: to become more play-friendly.\r\n\r\nThat is why, based on UK experience, we would like to develop a Play-friendly Quality Criteria / Label for Central Europe.

Further to this, as many as 9 out of 10 young offenders leave school early, having dropped out in the 6 months or more prior to being incarcerated. This has economic implications, as it costs over \u00a3200,000 per year to place a young person in a secure children\u2019s home. Furthermore, this group of people are more likely to become entrenched in the system and become adult offenders. Young offenders are also likely to be marginalised and socially excluded when back in the community, particularly as they are likely to have less training or educational opportunities. This makes employment opportunities more limited. Thus, re-engaging young offenders whilst in custody presents a unique opportunity for resettlement into the community and education on release.\r\n\r\nHowever, research has shown that educators in prisons tend to have less qualifications than teachers in mainstream schools. There is also a higher staff turnover and training, which is specific to addressing the multiple needs of young offenders, is limited. Therefore, the aim of this project is to enhance educators\u2019 capability to re-engage young offenders with education and learning whilst in secure custodial settings in 4 partner countries in the EU. This involves training education staff in secure custodial settings to use \u2018authentic inquiry\u2019 as an intervention to enrich educators\u2019 repertoires in learning design.\r\n\r\nAuthentic inquiry is an intervention designed to build personally relevant knowledge which is useful in education. The personally relevant topic is identified by the learner, enabling greater opportunity to connect with the learning process. This is done by taking the learners\u2019 interest through their own narratives and stories (personal) and navigating this towards the production of an \u2018artefact\u2019 such as a piece of art, poster or other product that has some external educational value (public). In so doing, there is a connecting of the personal to the public. This intervention has been shown to be effective in re-engaging disengaged learners in both the UK and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported by a digital infrastructure which facilitates learners\u2019 journeys (both education staff and young offenders).  The digital infrastructure and its associated tools, enable users to assess progress along their journey, and areas of focus for them as learners. The infrastructure includes a repository for online educational resources and a community of practice for both learners and educators (trainers and education staff).\r\n\r\nEducation staff in secure custodial settings are the main target group of the project. The long term impact of this training could reach hundreds of young offenders (aged 10-17) through the staff training. The project has the potential to reach at least 100 young offenders in the secure settings that are part of this project as the ultimate beneficiary group of the project.

This will happen through the collaboration between the schools.\r\n\r\nThe students\u2019 co-creation and co-driving will not only be practiced in connection with the content and activities, but also and innovatively in connection with the implementation.\r\n\r\nThe project will create and openly share guidelines, documentation and knowledge produced through the intensive experimentation, and with a special focus on the substantial co-driving and co-creation from the students.\r\n\r\nThe results will be produced taking the student teams (12 to 15 year old) through the phases of innovation engagement, from an opening trying out phase to more complex engagement:\r\n\r\nPhase 1 \u2013 LOCAL (Community driven)\r\nPhase 2 \u2013 SHARING (Youth-driven)\r\nPhase 3 \u2013 COLLABORATIVE (Community-driven+)\r\nPhase 4 \u2013 MAX CO-CREATIVE (Project-driven)\r\n\r\nEach phase will build on the project\u2019s innovation mechanics, taking the students through the full circle of innovation engagement from simple curiosity to co-creation.\r\n\r\nAll activities will work through real-life local societal challenges and in close collaboration with small eco-systems of community resources. The activities and processes will be worked, shared and discussed involving the students as they will be the centre, the co-drivers and co-creators of planning, activities and results.\r\n\r\nKey outcomes:\r\n\r\n-iCAP resource centre   \r\n-iCAP learning: building innovation interest and capacity in secondary schools\r\n-I am an innovator \u2013 what R U? \u2013 video\r\n-Supporting EU young innovators \u2013 in practice!

The aim of the project is to bring together a strategic partnership with five Partners: University of Gloucestershire, UK; ESSCA School of Management, France (and Hungary); Politechnico di Milano, Italy; Dublin Institute of Technology, Ireland; and Alexander Technological Educational Institute, Greece, along with an active Advisory Group with representatives from Partner countries to create a high quality VET fashion supply chain visibility resource for the benefit of those engaged in the fashion sector in Europe. \r\n\r\nSC Vis objectives: \r\n\r\n- Create a VET resource incl. a web based digital tool and training materials that address an established knowledge gap and provide an accessible resource for career orientated learners, and those that are least likely to take part in learning opportunities \r\n\r\n- Create resources beyond the lifetime of the project that will be translated into English, French, Italian and Greek languages (reflecting countries that contribute to European fashion supply chains) and to support greater access to high quality resources for native speaking workers \r\n\r\nThe SC Vis VET resource includes four modules that cover the scope of supply chain visibility and all the components involved in the sourcing and delivery processes. The four modules are connected to create the integrated supply chain from raw material supplier such as wool or cotton through to fully assembled garment, the information flows within the supply channels and the movement activities to point of sale. Content of the modules: \r\n\r\n- Supplier and Customer Actors Integration \u2013 assesses long-term relationships through sharing of responsibilities, common planning, dedicated investments and joint relationship initiatives\r\n\r\n- Information Technology Integration \u2013 assesses how high visibility can be achieved through extensive sharing of useful and meaningful information with common data definitions and consistency in stored data established across a focal firm\u2019s supply chain \r\n\r\n- Materials Integration \u2013 investigates the standardisation of material flow procedures and the use of common initiatives by supply chain actors in order to optimise the material flow\r\n\r\n- Internal Actors Integration \u2013 assesses the coordination through cross-functional teams as the indicator of internal company integration.

These stories focus on \u2018food\u2019, \u2018family\u2019 and \u2018festival\u2019 and act as a platform for diversity awareness and digital upskilling. Teachers will be trained in the use of digital media for storytelling and pupils will conduct and lead on their collection and editing.The MYSTY Project is driven by the principle that innovative teaching resources form part of broader pedagogic strategies that can actively help tackle issues of diversity. It facilitates actions that address issues of diversity common across the EU as highlighted in the Paris Declaration, 2015. The importance of enhancing social, civic and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy as well as fostering the education of disadvantaged children and young people were at the heart of the Paris Declaration and MYSTY\u2019s aim and objectives are closely aligned with many of the recommendations made in the declaration.With a network of teachers, media and education academics, and technicians, the main objective is to create an online resource called the MYSTY Digital Storytelling Toolbox. In order to achieve this overall objective, there are three sub-objectives:Obj1: Develop Curriculum Integration Methodologies to support school use of the ToolboxObj2: Create a Pupil Guide for Digital Storytelling to facilitate the creation of digital storiesObj3: Produce a Collection of Themed Digital Stories for use in school and community settingsMYSTY seeks to bring the participating organisations together to develop and share practice, in order to produce resources that other schools can use. This will enable teachers across the EU to develop a shared understanding of the key issues, which will help them in their practice.

Past work by the team has shown that under pressure, professional training and competence per se does not fully protect Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) personnel from the risk of losing Situation Awareness and so making  errors. These errors are due to decision-making tendencies or \"biases\" due to either of two patterns: either \"tunnelling down\" on aspects of the situation and overlooking others, or alternately attempting to deal with too much information at once. The former pattern will cause \"miss\" errors whereby key information may not be taken on board, and the latter  pattern will cause \"false alarms\" where irrelevant or even incorrect information may be used to make decisions. Even with the highest levels of training and skill, individuals can still make such errors. These are due to natural limitations of the human brain  under pressure.  Such tendencies are addressed in training for  many other situations where human decision-making is under pressure (e.g, aircraft , military, medical contexts) but have yet to be noticeably incorporated in VET for Fire services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives: The main objective of the project is to develop an online interactive software tool that enables Fire Service personnel to engage in realistic simulations of fire service operations and receive immediate feedback about their Situation Awareness and type of decision bias (whether they \"tunnel down\" or \"broaden out\") followed by guidance for improvement and self-monitoring of Situation Awareness and bias. This will provide  the  personnel with immediate insights into their own decision-making patterns and tendencies and provide means by which to self-monitor these tendencies under pressure on the actual fireground. The broad objective is to add value to their  training by increasing their awareness of possible decision-making tendencies that could produce errors and cause risk during their fireground operations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants: Participants will be  Fire and Rescue Service personnel from the EU partner FRS centres. This will involve both firefighters and commanders (managers). Optimally 20 people per EU partner centre will be involved in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities:  The project will involve the following sequence of activities: (1.) initial visit by UK partners to all EU Fire Service partner sites to demonstrate and explain the basic approach and collect information on local requirements for further development  (2)  subsequent development of the tool for each of the EU sites by researchers and then by the UK partners  with a technician to enhance the user-interface; (3.) second visit by UK team to support the initial trials of the tool in each EU partner site ; (4.) ongoing trials to be conducted by EU partners who will then send feedback and outputs to UK teams for coordination and final revision; (5.) refinement of the tool  by the U.K. team;  (6.) EU partners to send representatives to a workshop in UK to review the final version; (7.) uploading the final version to the online site (8.)with  dissemination contiguous with (5) to (7).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology: The  method will involve trials at each of the EU partner sites of interactive computer-based fireground exercises with locally relevant content. A range of exercises will be trialled, but each will present a series of images and video material representing the exercise interspersed with \"probe\" questions to be answered \"true/false\" (eg., \"there was a gas cylinder at the building entrance\"). A quantitative method in the software will  produce a Situation Awareness score and a Bias tendency score (tunnel bias vs. broaden bias). This will be followed by qualitative feedback  and further  training activities implemented in the software specific to the individual's  results. This will be followed up by interviews for the participants in the trials to reflect on the results and  provide feedback on the perceived value of the method and suggest ways to  develop it . This feedback will be passed on to the UK teams for further refinement of the tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvisaged impact/results: The impact is that the EU Fire Services community will have a valuable, accessible and innovative tool that provides improved understanding of an individual's Situation Awareness and Decision-making bias tendencies and provides guidance on ways to self-check and improve on these critical aspects of foreground operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-term potential benefits: For the individual FRS personnel who employ this tool,  this will ultimately enable them to perform at a higher level under pressure on the actual fireground and hence reduce decision-making error, thereby improving safety for Fire and Rescue services and for the wider community that they serve.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001637_coordinator"], [2014, "A European University-Business Alliance aiming to foster the entrepreneurial spirit of ICT students", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 181445.0, 5, 7, "\u201cOne becomes an entrepreneur not by birth but by education as well as by experience\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContext/background: Our project, ICT ENTREPRENEUR, aims to develop an innovative entrepreneurship programme for ICT students/graduates across Europe, offering these young people an insight of the working environment, helping them in developing their transversal skills and providing a new professional path to them. Our decision to focus only on ICT students/graduates stems from the fact that ICT is the single most important driver of innovation, competitiveness and growth for national economies around the world. Digital  enterprises are characterised by a high intensity of utilisation of novel digital technologies (particularly social, big data, mobile and cloud solutions). They create the jobs and growth opportunities of the future, improve people's lives and build better societies. These companies reshape traditional industries and transform the business environment, from fashion to automotive, from transport and logistics to energy distribution. They develop and bring faster to market innovative products and services that it was impossible to think about before. A report presented in Brussels in February 2014 argues that by  2018 the European app sector could employ 4.8 million people and contribute \u20ac63 billion to the EU economy. Thus we need to invest and align our efforts on a European level towards this direction. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the huge potential of ICT and all the forms of innovation and entrepreneurship that it enables, still remains to be taped upon by European entrepreneurs. Thus our project aims to develop an entrepreneurship programme specifically for young people with an ICT background. This programme will be developed following extensive research on the topic, focusing particularly on the current needs of ICT students and the existing entrepreneurship programmes offered across Europe in order to identify the limitations, gaps and weaknesses of existing programmes. \r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\n\r\n-Enhance scientific entrepreneurship levels within EU Universities, decreasing over the long-term youth unemployment and boosting job creation and growth \r\n\r\n-ICT ENTREPRENEUR will enhance ICT entrepreneurship levels in the EU, inspire potential entrepreneurs, encourage new and innovative businesses to offer the products and services of the future in the market.\r\n\r\n-Spark and support new business ideas within digital technologies and boost their successful commercialisation to the market through the ICT Business Competition event;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: 7 expert organisations from 5 EU countries, including 2 North EU countries that will transfer their experience and best practice to 3 South EU countries. 100 ICT students/graduates (20 in each country) will take part in our pilot testing programmes and the transnational job shadowing activities. The top 5 participants from each country will take part in the final ICT Entrepreneurship Academy and Business Competition event, that will be organised in Cyprus, giving them the opportunity to interact with each other, exchange experiences and ideas, understand important multicultural issues and present their business ideas in front of a panel of investors/business angels. More than 35 mentors (successful entrepreneurs and businesspeople) will be involved in our pilot testing programme. It is expected that through our dissemination activities and our media campaign (including traditional and new media) more than 500,000 people will be informed about our project at EU level. \r\n\r\nMain activities/methodology: \r\n\r\n1) State of the art and needs analysis: By identifying the strengths, weaknesses, gaps and best practices of existing entrepreneurship programmes, a unique and top quality programme will emerge.\r\n\r\n2) Prepare the first version of the ICT ENTREPRENEUR programme.\r\n\r\n3) This will be pilot tested in  5 EU countries (CY, DE,  PT, ES,  UK)\r\n\r\n4) All participants will give feedback about the quality of the training programme, through the use of two questionnaires.

As a result of such strategic, policy and professional direction for equality, inclusion and diversity to be a clear focus of practice, there is a need for educators, trainers and practitioners to continue exploring effective ways to develop and enhance their knowledge, skills and experience in order to meet the challenges that such a drive for these agendas reveals.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide a means for youth work educators, trainers and practitioners to develop both products and processes that will support further the development of youth work practice that is inclusive, diverse and which promotes equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are to produce a network of partners and thus a community of practice across the partners involved in the project in order to develop knowledge and skills related to develop quality youth work practice.

Part of this resource will be links to existing resources, a new university based module, trainer resources and captured learner journeys to inspire continual professional development\r\n\r\nThe approach will be participative involving partners and relevant practitioners and organisations in order to define the issues, develop a rationale and suitable resources that will further support them.\r\n\r\nThe results will be a community of practice which will have developed a toolbox of resources to support youth work that is inclusive, diverse and equal. The impact will be an increase in confidence of youth workers to tackle situations which are challenging, and further understanding the importance of practicing in such a way and will extensively use the resources to support their work. Furthermore, the fact that educator and trainers will have resources aims to ensure that more youth workers and equipped with the knowledge and skills that they require. Supported by the learning journeys continual professional practice will be stressed so that ultimately the quality of youth work will rise.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the case studies and directories developed, it is expected that this will support further youth work mobility and the sharing of good practice.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting resources will demonstrate that it is possible for projects to develop across the EU and will further encourage understanding of EU citizenship, the Erasmus plus programme and develop further applications for funding across the nations. \r\n\r\nThe long term benefit is that the aspiration that the EU has to create an inclusive, diverse society based on equality of opportunity will be developed further as their will be greater networks, resources and training to help make such goals an achievable reality.", "http://www.glos.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA205-014061_coordinator"], [2015, "Stimulating ESD Competences of Teachers through 3 level module: Me, my country, our world /Our Common ESD Book", "UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE LBG", 149858.0, 4, 5, "One of the ways for changing our unsustainable lifesytles to sustainable is education.

The rate of early school leaving (ESL) is higher amongst boys than girls in all EU member states [except Bulgaria]; males are more likely to leave education with at most lower secondary education, yet on educational support to prevent ESL there are \u201ca shortage of initiatives specifically targeted at boys\u201d (EU, 2010). \r\n\r\nMentoring is a well-established, non-formal method of improving academic attainment. On addressing youth unemployment, EC recommendations include enhancing support for non-formal education workers including mentor roles (EC, 2014); strengths-based mentoring is also used in sport to develop key athletic strengths. \r\n\r\nSports personnel work with young males on health improvement and social concerns in schools and non-formal education settings. There is also evidence of sports coaches working  with boys as mentors in a small number of schools (Eaude, T. 2008; Gulati & King, 2009; Beattie et al, 2014). However, whilst sports personnel are well placed to work with young males, personnel lack knowledge and skills required to work effectively in supportive education, health, and social contexts (Parnell et al, 2013).  \r\n\r\nAim and objective:\r\n\r\nSSaMs aim is to assist in reducing  male ESL. Our objective is to develop a Higher Education Institute (HEI) course to enhance the knowledge and skills of undergraduate sports students to enable them to provide mentoring support in future vocational settings for young males who are underachieving at school and so motivate them to stay at school and improve their educational attainment/outcomes.  The course will also instruct students on support for young men's mental and emotional health as an issue affecting educational performance.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this SSaMs will develop the following intellectual outputs:\r\n\r\nIntellectual Output 1: SSaMs learning materials\r\nIntellectual Output 2: SSaMs train the trainer materials\r\nIntellectual Output 3: Project and pilot evaluation report\r\n\r\nThese outputs enable:\r\n\r\n1. Identification of the context of male ESL in each partner state for a needs analysis to inform SSaMs materials development;\r\n2. Liaison with partner HEIs/NGO to develop and pilot SSaMs learning materials;\r\n3. Liaison with partner HEIs/NGO to develop SSaMs train the trainer materials;\r\n4. Production of a project and pilot evaluation report to inform HEIs and stakeholders;\r\n5. Dissemination and exploitation activities that promote SSaMs.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nThe SSaMs project consists of 6 partners from Northern (UK, Republic of Ireland), Eastern (Czech Republic), and Southern (Greece, Italy, Spain) Europe. These include 5 Higher Education Institutions and a non-government organisation (Italy) working with young people. \r\n\r\nMain activities:\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s activities are broken down into four main activities, three of which are intellectual outputs (O#).

It is critical to the development of physical literacy and civic engagement, academic achievement and good physical and mental health (UNESCO, 2015). Despite the UNESCO Charter for Physical Education and Sport, Article 4\u2019s recommendation that personnel professionally responsible for physical education and sport should be appropriately qualified, a high proportion of primary P.E. in Europe is taught by generalist rather than specialist P.E. teachers (Onofre et al., 2012). There is a clear need to support generalist teachers to develop their professional skills and practices in order to improve the quality of P.E.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Schools experience a number of challenges in providing high quality P.E. including finance and staff training;\r\n\u2022 Many primary teachers are predominantly generalists rather than specialists and not trained specifically in the delivery of P.E.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is to develop an online Continuing Professional Development (CPD) package for primary P.E. teachers across the EU. The EQuiPPE will provide teachers with knowledge, information and materials that increase confidence and improve practice. Via input from the partners, teachers, and wider networks of relevant policy makers and professionals the project will ensure that the package reflects the needs and preferences of teachers with respect to CPD for P.E. This will impact the policy areas of teacher education and development, teaching methods and curricular content. T\r\n\r\nObjectives \r\nTo address the project aim the EQuiPPE project has the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To identify examples of good practice from each partner country concerning the use of CPD and teacher education with respect to the provision of primary P.E;\r\n2. To liaise with academics, national and European teacher education networks to identify and develop a competency framework for high quality P.E;\r\n3. To collaborate with local school networks to ensure appropriateness and acceptability of the package;\r\n4. To engage in dissemination and exploitation activities that promote the practical utility of the CPD package;\r\n5. To develop the following intellectual outputs:\r\n1.

This \u201cI can do it\u201d attitude motivates us to keep trying even when things are difficult. If we keep trying, our efforts are more likely to pay off and we feel a sense of accomplishment. \r\nWe start to develop confidence in our ability to make things happen very early in life. When babies cry and their parents respond, they begin to learn they have some control over their environment. They develop a sense of security and learn to trust that their parents will take care of their needs. As they grow, this security and trust allows children to feel safe enough to explore their environment. \r\n\r\nResilience makes a big difference in people\u2019s lives. People who respond to hardships with resilience are: \r\n\u2022 healthier and live longer \r\n\u2022 happier in their relationships \r\n\u2022 more successful in school and work \r\n\u2022 less likely to get depressed\r\n\r\nWe are born with the capacity for resilience. But resilience is not something we have or don\u2019t have. We work on it throughout our lives. And we need to start as early as possible.

These will be made accessible to a range of sporting organisations to help coach educators deliver the workshop and grass-root coaches enhance their knowledge to confidently implement injury prevention strategies with youth performers. The desired impact at both a national and European level is an increased awareness of injury prevention programmes for youth sport performers and adoption/use of the workshop and website materials by coach educators and by grass-root coaches themselves.

They are disconnected and/or marginalized from nature, society, politics and economics. At the same time, it is the young generation who will have to address and adapt to the unfolding consequences in the future. What they need is empowerment and inspiration to craft meaningful responses. A better vision on our own personal and professional journey \u2013 where we are coming from and where we are headed, as well as accepting and claiming responseAbility for our own and societal development is called for.More than ever before it\u2019s necessary that the current generation of young people is able to improve the society of tomorrow. The greatest contribution they can make is to find and develop their own individual response based on their passions, talents and potential. A pre-condition for this is to re-connect to our concerns about the world, and the emotions and feelings that arise when we do so. Change makers need to ground their actions in acceptance, gratitude, hope and compassion in order develop responses that are powerful, appropriate and resourceful. With this training course we create a space for building that responseAbility through reflection on our concerns and passions as well as becoming more conscious of our personal learning process. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of who we are and what we can do for others is an empowering process which can lead to positive changes for the future of society.Moreover it is necessary that youth workers know how they can support young people in facing their own challenges and thereby continue to grow as a person.
