The aim is to promote the job mobility of the vocational full-time students. The students come from the surrounding rural districts of the Emsland, Steinfurt and Osnabr\u00fcck and have deep roots in their home. With this project they are given the chance to gain first work experience at a foreign work place and to improve foreign language as well as intercultural skills in order to prepare them for the challenges of a changing regional, national and European job market. \r\nThis project is built on the experiences of the former HuebEurope I Project, which has been running successfully within the EU programme Leonardo Mobility for two years. \r\nThe project is supported by the EU office of the regional government of M\u00fcnster. \r\nThe project is applied for a total number of 44 participants. It will be carried out in two flows, each with 20-24 participants, who will be sent off for two weeks after the Easter holidays of the years 2016 and 2017. \r\nThe target group of this project are the vocational full-time students specialising in Business, Administration and Foreign Languages. \r\nThe project consists of two actions: \r\nThe main action is the offer of a two-week work experience in different British companies and institutions (e.g. primary schools, grammar school, residential home for the elderly) in the county of Kent. Participants are accommodated in British host families. The H\u00fcberts\u00b4sche Schule organises travel and accommodation of the participants.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Malta, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Poland and Turkey. An internship of eleven weeks including the corresponding exam held and certified by a German-French board of examiners will be offered by the grammar schools Lyc\u00e9e St. Louis in St. Etienne and Lyc\u00e9e Ren\u00e9-Cassin in Strasbourg.\r\nWith that the students are given the opportunity to get their practical skills certified and, thus, obtain a more favourable starting position on the labour market. For already two years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.\r\nAll details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries.\r\nThe participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development.", "http://www-studio-solution.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000471_13"], [2017, "Let's do it", "internship-uk.com ltd", 62027.0, 3, 3, "Secondary school of economics and commerce is applying for two years project entitled \"Let's Do It\".
