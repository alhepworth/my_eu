We recently introduced a separate class for students who do not yet speak much German but are expected to reach Grammar school level. Most of them are refugees, some are children of foreign university teachers who spend a short time in Tuebingen. \r\nEach year, several students have to leave the school due to failure to meet academic standards. Teaching classes can be very challenging as we often do not set students tasks at different levels of difficulty according to their ability.\r\nThis is why we launched our first Erasmus+-KA1 last year, involving job-shadowing at St. John's School in Bishop Auckland in North-East England. The aim was to learn more about inner differentiation. We were overwhelmed by the professional approach to  streaming in the classroom that was not only well-developed but also practised in every class we saw. Although we had already profited from the inspiration and the practical material we received, we agreed that we wanted to observe these features in more detail. At the same time, there was another thing that struck us: How do the teachers manage to get the students to start work immediately and to behave so well? This is something we want to find out and learn to do ourselves. This is why we have applied for another KA1 to build on the first one: We want to job-shadow again in England in two groups of five teachers, with a larger interval in between in order to properly evaluate and build on the first experience. Out goal is to learn from a European partner school and profit from their knowledge and experience.\r\nTo provide our efforts with a scientific basis, we have already started cooperation with the Tuebingen School of Education, a newly-founded university department.\r\nIn addition to the first KA1, we have now included  a second partner, Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, in Oleiros in North-West Spain. We met teachers from that school in England because they job-shadowed at the same time. The discussions we had with them on various points of education and school systems made us keen to go to Spain to seek inspiration from the methods and structures that apply there. We could thus gain a different view on our system and identify improvements to implement in our curriculum.\r\nFurthermore, this offers an opportunity to involve the department of Spanish in our school,  in addition to the department of English. We are planning to visit Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, with six colleagues, in a third phase of the process, re-evaluating what we have learned by then.\r\nAs teachers in Germany always teach two or three different subjects, many other departments will be involved, such as history , biology, German and RE. \r\nWe also make sure that teachers who do not teach either English or Spanish are able to participate.\r\nIn addition, we are  planning to take courses that support our focus. One of the purposes is to accomodate colleagues who prefer structured courses over job-shadowing or who are afraid of language difficulties.\r\nOur school is familiar with different methods of teaching, including cooperative forms, job-shadowing with a tandem partner and feedback. Therefore, we expect our staff to use their new knowledge and experience in their own work in the classroom and to share with colleagues as widely as possible.\r\nUltimately, we expect inner differentiation / streaming to be used across the entire school with a positive impact on the learning atmosphere.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035365_1"], [2016, "Entwicklung der fachspezifischen Binnendifferenzierung am Carlo-Schmid-Gymnasium mittels Best Practice / Job Shadowing im europ\u00e4ischen Kontext", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", 15840.0, 2, 2, "In Germany, we have a tripartite school system, splitting up students into two or three different academic levels after four years of primary school, the highest being a grammar school.Our school is a grammar school in a university city with a high rate of grammar school students: About 70 % attend grammar school after primary school, a part of them not according to their abilities but according to their parents' wishes and social pressure in German society.Our project is based on our experience with classes in which we teach more and more students with mixed abilities. That makes it more difficult to do justice to each of the students in his / her particular academic and social situation. As a consequence there is an increasing number of students who fail grammar school. Additionally, classroom management has become a hard task, as we try to struggle with different approaches to under- and overachievers. When visiting our partner school in Bishop Auckland, England, on a project, we were impressed by learning that teachers there have successfully used differentiation techniques in classrooms for many years. So the idea was born to profit from the rich experience in England by job-shadowing our colleagues - learning from experienced European partners instead of starting all over again and making unnecessary mistakes.As we have two bilingual classes in each year in which certain subjects are taught in English (e.g. history, geography, biology) we have chosen those subjects as a first group for our job-shadowing. The second group will concentrate on languages, expecting to profit richly from ideas how to stimulate different abilities. The third group will look at mathematics, a subject in which the gap between different abilities and the possibility of failure are particularly obvious.We are planning to go to England twice with groups of 4 colleagues each to be able to compare and to develop and learn from the first experience. We have practised \"open doors\" in our schol for many years now, inviting colleagues into our classes to learn from each other; and we have developed a system of feedback culture by the students which helps us to improve continually. Furthermore, a large group of colleagues is trained to use cooperative learning in classrooms. That means that we have both the structure and the motivation to implement in our curriculum what we will learn.Our aim is to be able to develop more measures for all students, including those with special needs and with migration experience. We aim at sharing our experience with other schools in our region and further, learning from European partners and including other countries too in the future.We are also planning to take courses that support our focus and in order to be able to include more colleagues in our project.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA101-022683_1"], [2016, "Narrowing the gap between higher and lower achievers", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", 7136.0, 2, 2, "Our project is driven by one thing, to improve our ability as educators to help our disadvantaged students who are not progressing as well as our more socioeconomically better off counterparts.
