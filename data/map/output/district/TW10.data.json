Information material and documentation to ensure the smooth-running of the respective mobility programmes have been prepared which offer both participants and our project partners an orientation and a structural framework for their work.  A compulsory one-year course (three hours per week) prepares students for their long-term mobility placements.  Four members of staff will be responsible for preparing students taking part in the short-term mobility programme as part of their normal lessons.  Teaching staff receive informational material about the educational systems of their destination countries to support their own research trips.\r\nThe implementation of all mobility projects is based on intensive co-operation between the BSBJ and our project partners outside Germany.  Professional guidance is jointly organized. A great emphasis is placed on specialized discussions and exchanges at a professional level about the development of the curriculum and course material. The results of the project will be followed up though workshop days, conferences, discussions and exchanges in lessons themselves. \r\nWe expect students and members of staff participating in the project to develop their competences, particularly in the area of intercultural learning, to develop their reflective skills, and to enhance their constructive approaches to solving conflicts.  The ability to change perspectives and to empathise with others from different cultural backgrounds is a fundamental competence for early years educators and social assistants.  Students, no less than teachers, will extend their repertoire of conceptual and methodological skills through the experience of the mobility programmes and extend their development on more personal levels too.

Thus, the school\u2019s Europe-strategy reaches beyond the school\u2019s boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the teaching staff follows a certain standard, which can be adjusted as agreed upon with partner organisations on-site.\r\nIt applies for a 5-day stay (+2 days of travel) at the cooperating school and includes visiting class, communication about subject/topics of their own field, sustainable development, social aspects of everyday surroundings in school, etc. as well as getting in touch with partners of occupational education concerning sojourn of students or teachers in the host country in the future, e.g. visitation of companies etc.\r\n\r\nThe learner\u2019s mobility applies: Partnering companies enable an insight on and participation in diverse and relevant procedures. An example is the business \u201cHofzuckerb\u00e4ckerei Heiner\u201d in Vienna, which allows apprentices in a four-week internship to get in touch with the production of Austrian confection of pastry, dessert, and Viennese coffee specialties. Similar insights on regional and national special features (e.g. the Finnish educational system) will be offered to other participants as well.\r\n\r\nOverall the application applies to 62 participants (31students, 31teacher and school staff). Students are apprentices in the dual system, students of the vocational school, and students in of social pedagogy. In the selection process vital characteristics are personal attitude, expertise, and school performance.\r\nThe teaching staff is composed of teachers, who represent a broad spectrum of occupational (e.g. production technology, consultation and sale, etc.) and non-occupational (English, German, etc.) subjects. Of course the selection of participants follows a standardized set of criteria as well.\r\nThe trainers and School staff are involved for the first time in our international exchange within the framework Erasmus+. \r\nA coaching team, containing of subject teachers, a class teacher and instructors, supervises every outgoing mobility for students. During the period abroad these team members are contact persons and advisors for the students. The accompanied internships are guaranteed by \u201cblended monitoring\u201d. Timely and effective exchange can be ensured. \r\nThe work group at Elly-Heuss-Knapp and Mildred-Scheel-Berufskolleg evaluates individual mobilities as well as the whole project and will discuss its result with apprenticing companies, the principals (school management), teaching staff, school staff and single education sectors. The evaluation takes place according to a quality circle.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the evaluation results with all the parties involved, recommended standards will be realized with regard to the school`s Europe strategy goals.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003754_14"], [2015, "Die F\u00f6rderung  sozialer Kompetenzen bei Kindern bis 6 Jahren in verschiedenen europ\u00e4ischen Bildungseinrichtungen", "The Russell Primary School", 51133.0, 4, 14, "The project with the theme \"The promotion of social skills and competences in children up to the age of six within diverse European settings for education and care\" is an integral part of the course leading to the state certified qualification as educator (staatlich anerkannte Erzieherin/staatlich anerkannter Erzieher) and includes a five-week work placement in a setting in either the UK, France or Finland. The Mathilde-Weber Vocational College in T\u00fcbingen promotes the said project and has been engaged in annually implementing occupational mobility since 2003. The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part. Participants are involved in all aspects of  procedure within the partner setting and take on responsibility for their own  personal activities and for tasks within the group.\r\n\r\nThe project is planned to comprise 46 participants who in September/October 2015 or September/October 2016 will travel abroad as members of two separate groups. At the time in question, they will be in their third year of training  and will have gained practical experience during work placements and will have a grounding in  professional skills which will be enhanced by the occupational mobility project.     \r\nInter-cultural experience gained during work placement abroad also promotes an improvement in the quality of early years care and education. Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period. During the \u2018Education in Europe\u2019 lesson, they deal with various aspects of cultural diversity, prejudice and the experience of foreignness. They research other European countries and their corresponding educational systems and also address the curricculum for children under six in diverse countries. In further lessons, they learn songs, games and finger rhymes in other languages and experience picture books from the country to which they will travel. They study the importance of social skills to successful life within the community , receive encouragement in and exercises for observing individual social skills and develop ideas and methods with which to further social competence. In addition, they are prepared for the placement abroad through conversation sessions held in the relevant language.  \r\n\r\nEvery participant is visited in their work placement setting by a member of staff from the Mathilde-Weber College. In addition, an assessment is made in the group of participants in which the participant is working with the teacher in attendance. It is a matter of principle that regular contact is sustained between student and college during the entire work placement. Upon return, experience made is assessed and evaluated in a number of ways. ( questionnaires, discussion groups, in-lesson conversation, documentation). The results are then presented to other college classes, members of staff in early childhood settings and at external information events, both locally and regionally.    \r\nIncreased personal competence  such as independence, trust in onesself and self confidence is expected as a result . Furthermore, openness, tolerance, the ability to reflect and deliberate and flexibility, all of which will have a positive effect on further studies and future work placement. It is expected that concrete experience is made and a solid understanding gained in professional and methodical areas of practice. Long term, impulses originating in the experience made whilst on work practice abroad will result in later working life in an hightened sensitivity towards children and families with a history of migration.

The reason for this is that the number of children aged 0-6 in day-care centers with a migrant or refugee background is steadily increasing and we hope that the professionalism in dealing with multinational children's groups like it has been normal for a long  time in German kindergartens in Europe, our students will be taught a variety of methods of inclusion, language support and everyday pedagogical design, which are becoming increasingly important for their professional practice.\r\nThis internationalization of parts of the training also serves to sharpen our school profile and secure the location.\r\nGoals of the project are:\r\n-Advancement of professionalism in the field of early childhood education, educational activities in multinational children's groups, inclusion, language development concepts and German as a foreign language.\r\n-Improving multilingualism and intercultural competence.\r\n- Building social capital and a Europe-friendly attitude.\r\n-Increasing mobility, flexibility and autonomous living arrangements as well as living and working abroad.\r\n- Building international cooperation and professional exchange\r\n-Continuing development of pedagogical concepts and promoting comparability and recognition of education and qualifications.\r\nWe are sending eleven students with different cultural backgrounds who have completed the academic part of the educator training and then complete the probationary year in whole or in part in institutions for child and youth welfare / education in other European countries. Our students complete the recognition year in kindergartens in Turkey, Poland, Great Britain and Spain. They are usually working as second force in children's groups of 0-6 years with about 15-20 children of different nationalities and needs and are visited once by a teacher for teaching and training purposes. At the same time, the visit also serves the job-shadowing, the professional exchange and mutual further education as well as getting to know the facilities and the typical culture of the country.\r\nThe methodology of our project procedure begins with information, selection and consultation of the participants.

The internships are an integral part of the education.  Internships abroad require financial support in order to give as many students as possible this opportunity.The students work in a broad spectrum of companies, from planning agencies, design companies, and forestry schools, to gardens for vegetables and flowers.  They thereby not only test the knowledge they amassed while at school, but they also learn the first steps in beginning a career, which may not be widespread in Austria, such as specialized perennial nurseries, planning agencies, that also execute plans, nursery facilities, etc.  By working abroad in a country with a foreign language, the students can deepen their understanding of the English language.  This should also awaken an interest to think outside the national border, when the students choose a future place of work or study.  In the first phase of the project, a total of 20 students will be placed in 6 European countries:  8 in Great Britain, two in Ireland, two in Italy, two in Sweden, one in Portugal and 6 in Germany.  12 students specialize in the market gardening program, while the other 8 focus on garden and landscape design.  That is more than half of the entire student population in that class year.In the second phase of the project, we expect an even larger number of students, because the internship program can be promoted right from the beginning.With our advice and support, the students look for internships themselves.  We provide the students with the appropriate information and insurance.  All the participants can contact us, the advisors, at any time via email or cellphone.  The interns are required to keep a journal for the duration of their internship.  This is necessary for the positive completion of the internship.The internships can be considered a success if the students integrate their work abroad into their plans for the future as a matter of course.In the long-term, we are working on building an informal network of companies and institutions, which will share our commitment to the internship education of the students and offer young people the chance to broaden their horizons.", "http://www.belderbos.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016488_1"]]}}, "7JF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RKL", "Cassel Hospital", "nhs_RKL48"]]}}}}
