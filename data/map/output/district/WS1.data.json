We have a top priority: gaining an international and European exposure. Some of us have sent students and apprentices abroad for a couple of years and managed to build a reliable network of workplaces and strong partnerships (UK, Finland, Spain, Germany). Experienced and willing to make mobility accessible to a greater number of students, we want to encourage the expansion of the other members thanks to our network thus allowing more young people from modest backgrounds to go on work experience placements.\r\nOur mobility actions are aimed at vocational baccalaureate students and apprentices in Commerce, Customer Services, Sales, Logistics and vocational baccalaureate students in Business & Administration, Beauty & Care, Clothing Design and Metal Work. All the students are part of our European classes. They wish to gain professional and cultural skills in a foreign environment and raise their language level. Mobility experiences are real life experiences and assets to complete their training, adapt to the demands of the labour market and continue their studies.\r\nWe have planned to send 90 students and 30 apprentices, aged 17 to 20, over the next two years. We will send different groups of selected students together according to their lines and types of training. The baccalaureate students will stay for 4 weeks whereas the apprentices for 2 weeks owing to the legal obligations binding them to their employers in France. We will inform, advise and prepare them to live a comfortable work experience abroad. Our challenge will be to mix and gather the different types of students during linguistic, cultural and professional preparation sessions by pooling the teaching staff of our colleges (teachers, language assistants and civic service voluntary workers). Our aim is to create a feeling of cohesion and help each young learner fit actively in the \u201cCitoyen d\u2019Europe\u201d path we will especially set up for them.\r\nOur students will be placed either in companies or benefit from adapted professional stays within the frame of our partnerships.

They will also accompany them on their trips and will pay on-the-spot visits to assess the students\u2019 progress along with their different partners. We will use and complete both national evaluation documents (official grids based on vocational baccalaureate frameworks) and the Europass assessment forms to validate the different skills acquired. The students will be encouraged to take specific oral examinations to highlight their personal, linguistic and professional involvement (baccalaureate with the \u201cEuropean Section\u201d distinction or EuroMobipro).

One of the priorities of the EU is the free movement of people which often involves students and adults of working age with dependents.  The project aims to build an  game infused e-learning tool which will allow  young people from across Europe to learn more about the different child protections systems in existence across the EU to help find early routes for help if they are experiencing a problem with  neglect and abuse.

It is well known that this is a key issue that leads young people back into the spiral of offending.  Experience indicates that whilst many businesses offer opportunities to the very vulnerable, it is often difficult for them to sustain the offer.  This is because the issues facing the young people affect most, if not all, of their behaviour. Employers often do not know how to deal with what is perceived as poor behaviour and the default is to make them redundant. Employers need proper training to equip them for appropriate action to address issues with vulnerable young people. Where such transitions are made and apprenticeships are successful, we need to be explicit about what works and what does not. There is patchy and often anecdotal evidence but little substantial evidence-based work. The common theme emerging from existing work and experience is the need for social support: just getting someone a placement without an eye on the social support for a range of other issues is thought not to work by many professionals in the field. A web of support is therefore increasingly regarded as essential for helping the most vulnerable young people become constructive members of society.  There are indications that there is a need for common but multifaceted approach to supporting vulnerable young people through vocational education, training and apprenticeships. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe key objectives are: 1) to explore the experiences of young people; 2) to identify the needs of employers; 3) to identify the needs of schools and VET trainers; 3) to map good practice; 4) to bring together practitioners; 5) to provide a model of evidence based social support requirements; 6) to share good practice beyond the immediate partnership.\r\n\r\nTarget group.\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are VET providers, including both trainers/colleges and employers that provide apprenticeships and work placements for young people. In particular, there will be a focus on organisations that wish to give particular attention to vulnerable young people. This includes private companies; public bodies; social enterprises that aim to improve the lives of the vulnerable; NGOs that provide VET for their clients; schools that provide VET; prisons that provide VET to young offenders; local authorities who are often responsible for co-ordinating and providing VET.\r\n\r\nThe indirect beneficiaries of the project are the most vulnerable young people in society. We are using a broad age range from 16 to 25 in order to capture different definitions of \u2018young people\u2019 that are used across Europe.  Vulnerabilities relate to a wide range of often inter-related issues such as histories of violence and abuse, problematic drug and alcohol use, serious undiagnosed mental health issues, problematic family relationships, experience of offending and prison. This group includes young people from different ethnic origins, such as Roma; and includes young people who are migrants. Some of the most vulnerable young people are women who at particular risk of domestic violence, sexual abuse and sex work.\r\n\r\nExpected impact\r\nUltimately, the key impact will be on the lives of the most vulnerable young people in our society.  Successful apprenticeships enhance the lives, confidence, social and cultural capital of those young people and can help turn broken lives around, with attendant benefits for future generations.  For the VET providers, and in particular, employers, this project will raise awareness of the needs of these young people and also signpost them to appropriate support.", "http://www.aviditytraining.co.uk", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013612_6"]]}}, "2AN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1264982400000, 1351641600000, "MyUI: Mainstreaming Accessibility through Synergistic User Modelling and Adaptability", "Clevercherry.com Ltd", "MyUI will foster the mainstreaming of accessible and highly individualized ICT products \u2013 a major issue for e-Inclusion.

On the other hand, we also work more and more directly with company, selected especially for a mobility project or having already welcomed our participants within their structures.\r\nOur partners' network is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, etc.) and a plurality of sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or with one of his local partners), and if possible the accommodation and the language courses (if the project is done outside the countries where the official language is English, French, Italian, German or Spanish). Also, the partner has to provide a quality tutoring and an evaluation at the end of the project. The diversity of the partners allows us to answer to the majority of the requests  of the candidates. Indeed, we are able to provide internships as well as in companies as in associations, in a large scale of professional sectors.", "http://www.europe2uktraining.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014688_5"]]}}, "2LT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1519862400000, 1567209600000, "Development of ECO-friendly protection procedures for LANDing gear aluminium alloys", "L.V.H. Coatings Ltd", "The need of using high performance lightweight materials is pushing the aerospace industry to incorporate aluminium alloys in many parts of the aircraft. But all aircraft components, and especially those of landing gears, need to be able to withstand friction and corrosive environments while continuing to operate at optimum levels. \nNowadays most landing gear parts made of aluminium alloys are protected against corrosion by surface anodising and multilayer painting. The treatment is usually carried out on Cr(VI) based compounds. To date, there is not any Cr-free accepted protecting treatment for Al 7000 series alloys that fulfils the aeronautics requirements, so, it is necessary to develop an environmentally and Cr-free acceptable alternative process.\nThe main objective of ECOLAND project is to face the research of a suitable REACH compliant anaphoretic electrocoating treatment (including both the optimal pretreatment method and anaphoretic electrocoating application conditions) that can replace the currently used anodising \\ painting treatment for protection of Al 7000 series alloys in aeronautic applications. This anaphoretic electrocoating will allow a reduction of emissions, saving of coat and improvement of corrosion protection.\nThe following improvements will be aimed from the ECOLAND Cr-free project:\n\u2022 The lifetime of the anaphoretic electrocoating system shall be 25 % longer than the lifetime of traditional.\n\u2022 It is expected a minimum of around 30% cost and 45% energy consumption reduction in manufacturing compared to currently available systems.\n\u2022 Thanks to the new coating systems more complex geometry parts could be coated and so landing gears might be designed lighter than currently ones. \n\u2022 The production time to be shortened in a 55%.\n\u2022 A decrease of the risk of mechanical failure due to the reduction of the alloy exposure time to acids.\n\u2022 VOCs emissions will be reduced in a 50%.", 40797.0, 320310.0, 2, 3, "ECOLAND", null, null, null, "h2020_213591_911735205"]]}}}}
