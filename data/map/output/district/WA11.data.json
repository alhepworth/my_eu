It has 23 teachers and about 200 pupils. It is a school which has been working as a Learning Community since 2011 and, thus, it is open to the whole community (families, volunteers and other agents), through several activities which have been proved to lead to success, such as: Interactive Groups, Reading Discussion Groups (Tertulias Literarias Dial\u00f3gicas), Classroom Assemblies, Learning Contracts\u2026 From all these, there are two of them which are strongly connected to the project tthat we are applying for: Interactive Groups (pupils carry out simultaneous activities coordinated by volunteers \u2013relatives or other members of the community- through dialogue and mutual help) and Reading Discussion Groups (debate through dialogue among equals about classical works, in order to arise pupils\u2019 interest towards reading in Spanish and English).\r\n\r\nThe school has Bilingual Section in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th levels of Primary and a bilingual programme in Pre-Primary is carried out through routines and the Doman psychomotricity method, term projects about different classical works of the Anglo-Saxon literature, etc. The school\u2019s aim is to have Bilingual Section in every level and, gradually, become a whole Bilingual School. \r\n\r\nWe should also bare in mind the huge diversity within our pupils: we have families with many different sociocultural profiles. Some of them have a low sociocultural level, with very little possibilities and, in some cases, low involvement in their children\u2019s education. Learning foreign languages is not a priority for them, and we consider that the fact of developing Erasmus+ projects is the key to make these pupils find the meaning for learning English, thus increasing their motivation and engagement. Besides, taking into account the results of the internal and external assessment procedures in our region is also fundamental. The Management Team considers that, as a possible response to this need, taking part in Erasmus+ projects can be an agent of change, and this transformation process is one of the key aspects dealt with in our school institutional documents: Educative Project, School Year Planning, Management  Regulations, among others.\r\n\r\nIn this KA101 we intend to do these mobility activities: \r\n\r\n- 3 different courses on idiomatic competence of the participants, which will help them acquire the needed qualification for getting Bilingual Section in all levels of the school and, gradually, become a whole Bilingual School. This fact will make the school get a better reputation in the area and, thus, the number of enrolled pupils per year.\r\n- 3 courses on bilingual methodology for teachers who already have the qualification but, however, need training on methodology for improving their teaching skills, which will ensure pupils' benefit, thus increasing their motivation and results.\r\n- 2 job shadowing actions, which involve observing the partner school in Haydock (UK), with whom our pupils have carried out several collaborative activities through eTwinning last year. Our aim is that the involved teachers acquire new skills and knowledge on school management, creation of new materials, classroom organization, etc., apart from keeping up with the development of cooperative activities between schools and reaching our internalisation.\r\n\r\nThere will be direct consequences in our school, due to the fact that the training that teachers will receive will be subsequently transmitted to the rest of the teachers. This will bring direct benefits in the pupils. Since the three members of the School Management Team are part of this Erasmus+ Team, there will be a guarantee that this project will have an impact on the school\u2019s everyday routines, ensuring its permanence and sustainability in the future. Furthermore, in September 2018 we will form a Work Group, institutionalized through the Center of Teachers and Resources of M\u00e9rida, in order to ensure the rigor and the permanence of the suggested activities and iniciatives. This way, the dissemination will take place before the project starts (present stage: communication to the rest of the teachers and the families, design of activities, etc), during the project (daily work with pupils, mobility of the participant teachers, social media and blog update, follow-up of the newly created Erasmus+ Google Site\u2026) and after the project (social networks, school\u2019s blog and Google Site, appearing in the region\u2019s social media, activities as a host school with our partner school, permanent contact with them concerning the future creation of a KA2, etc).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it will be a global transformation process in which our doors will remain open to Europe.", "http://www.grangevalley.st-helens.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-047004_1"]]}}, "7LD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1293840000000, 1356912000000, "SEA Kinetic Energy Recovery System", "GreenUrban Technologies Limited", "SEAKERS originates from a joint initiative of top level SMEs and players of the marine yachting sector, aiming at introducing a high impact potential innovation, which it is expected to provide a valuable market and economic return; the SMEPs partnered together in order to develop a research and industrial action plan.

There are several topics: the disabled, minorities and social dialogue . There is a big difference in the care and welfare in the various European lands. Our first youth exchange showed that the differences within Europe are great in the field of taking care for minorities in a country. ( theme of the exchange was anti - discrimination) .
