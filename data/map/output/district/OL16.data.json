Over the past 6 years the school has taught French and Spanish at an elementary level and has been involved in several British Council funded programmes including headteacher job shadowing, language immersion courses, Comenius project and eTwinning. Broadfield was also successful in achieving The International School Award in 2012.\r\n\r\nAs a school with a very diverse intake, languages and heritage form a key part of our school ethos and mission statement. We value and respect the differences and similarities that our school community has and we celebrate the diversity. Within this context we feel that language teaching is very important and that pupils need to have a good understanding of their place within Europe and the whole world.\r\n\r\nOnce we had taken the decision that French was to be our chosen language for meeting the requirements of the new national curriculum we identified the support and training we needed to ensure that staff had the skills to deliver an effective and exciting curriculum. It is fundamental to our ongoing success that pupils receive excellent teaching and learning opportunities and that staff have the ability to provide that. The objectives of the project therefore are summarised as ensuring that the staff improve their French language skills and knowledge of the French culture, that pupils receive good teaching and attain well, that all pupils have access to an inspiring curriculum, that improved competence leads to other opportunities in terms of further study and career prospects and that pupils and staff have confidence in their abilities and feel proud of their place in society.\r\n\r\nSix members of staff will train in France over a two year period and will cascade their learning across the school and with other professionals. Participants will include teachers and support staff as it is envisaged that all staff will have a role to play in encouraging good language models and ensuring pupils make good progress.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of outcomes will take place within and beyond school reaching a wide audience of pupils, parents, teachers and education personnel. The actual number of participants including pupils and adults will range from 500 to 1000.\r\n\r\nThe activities involved in the project will include staff Inset within the school to provide all staff with ideas and ways forward in teaching French. There will also be additional input for the six participants to prepare them for their course in France.  The course in France will provide the participants with challenging language classes according to ability and will introduce them to the cultural traditions of French life. There will also be the opportunity to make initial links with a French school. Following the course each participant will be expected to present the outcomes of their course including ideas for methodology and resources for language teaching. They will work with other staff in developing effective practice and will engage with professionals beyond the school to support their development too. \r\n\r\nThroughout the project opportunities to reflect and evaluate progress will be built in. It is important to keep on track and not to lose focus. Regular team meetings will analyse and discuss impact and share their findings with the other stakeholders.\r\nAs a result of the project it is envisaged that staff will be highly skilled in delivering good quality French lessons where pupils will make at least good progress and will achieve expectations.  The profile of modern foreign language teaching and learning will be raised not just within the school but with partner schools and the local authority and further via our website. There will be an improved understanding of French culture and the establishment of new links with schools in France. Hopefully out of that new eTwinning projects will emerge and e-Pals will be set up.\r\n\r\nFor the pupils the impact will be great. Ultimately the project is about them and ensuring that we are providing the best possible experiences for them in language learning. They will be motivated, confident and skilled speakers of French and will be able to continue with further higher level study at secondary school and beyond. In the future their prospects in terms of careers and employability will be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nFor the staff, their skills and competence in teaching and learning in French will grow and develop as their confidence increases. Success will breed success and many future pupils will benefit from the professional development they have taken part in during this project.", "http://www.broadfield.rochdale.sch.uk", "Broadfield Community Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012977_coordinator"]]}}, "2AU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1484524800000, 1579046400000, "Advanced mechatronics devices for a novel turboprop Electric starter-generator and health monitoring system", "Nema Limited", "The ACHIEVE Consortium will bring together their world-leading expertise in the design and manufacturing of electrical machines for aircraft Advanced Generation Systems (AGS), integrated Power Electronics (PE), advanced control systems and intelligent thermal management, to develop an innovative advanced mechatronic device for electrical power management system of Turboprop.  \nThe ACHIEVE Consortium will combine their world-leading expertise in the technical areas of PE, AGS and their control, as well as in modelling and simulation for aerospace applications.

European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas.

As a partnership, we are all committed (through a number of effective strategies) to meeting the specific needs of every child in our organisations, regardless of social background, ethnicity, learning disabilities etc. and therefore including and motivating every student to perform to the very best of their ability and to enjoy the activities. During transnational project meetings, we will share strategies for inclusion, used in our individual schools, through demonstrations and explanations. This work will be collated, throughout the duration of the project, to form a collaborative policy document that can be integrated into each of our schools' SEND' policy document.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to educate all participants in terms of developing intercultural knowledge and understanding through planned activities on themes including: architecture, music, dance, drama, stories, myths/legends, and art/design/technology. All outputs (in each of these areas of study) will be shared, presented to partners during project management & implementation meetings, collated, discussed, evaluated and finally produced as one collaborative product, for example, in the form of a DVD, CD, eBook/Magazine or  Tutorial, Virtual Tour or Documentary. Pupils will take ownership of the project activities, through which we specifically aim to raise the profile of digital competences and foreign language learning in each of our schools. Most of our outputs will be digital so we have put in place training sessions to develop competences and confidence in this area for both staff and pupils.

Again, pupils will take ownership of this aspect of the project by creating tutorials in their own languages (i.e. their content and presentation), according to identified needs and to their relevance to the project content. Tutorials will be uploaded on eTwinning, thus providing a teaching and learning platform for their partners in other countries. \r\nSome of our outputs, such as the art/technology based on the theme of architecture and our myths& legends ebook, will be annotated in our five different languages to enable pupils to see easily and compare languages (in terms of similarities and differences), that are set out alongside each other.
