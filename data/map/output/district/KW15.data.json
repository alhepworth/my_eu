The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines.

The choice of priorities (HORIZONTAL: Improve achievement in relevant and high-level basic and transversal competences in a lifelong learning perspective and SECTORAL: School education - Strengthening the profile of the teaching professions) started with the need analysis in the participating schools. The involved teachers, although working in different cultural backgrounds, agreed that there are particular needs which are similiar in all of them. Improving competences of both teachers and students for the needs of the 21st century include an attempt to jointly address the following challenges: applying a more personalised approach to teaching/learning, providing better quality teaching, responding to cultural diversity, preparing young people to be responsible EU citizens with fundamental values such as equity, sustainable development, peace, tolerance and diversity in mind, integration of ICT into the teaching/learning process. The main topics addressed by the project are: EU citizenship and awareness, new technologies as well as new innovative educational methods.

The project will improve the research network of the academic partners and provide routes for commercialisation of their research.

This will support the production of hydrogen using an AREVA H2Gen electrolyser, the first to be deployed in the UK, which will be powered by Orbital Marine Power's next generation 2 MW floating tidal energy converter, the Orbital O2 2MW.\nThe cost of pre-commercial demonstration for ocean energy is high and investors are reluctant to invest until the technology has been proven in the sea at scale. ITEG sets out to drive down these costs through the development of an integrated hydrogen production solution.\nHero image: Orbital Marine Power's SR2000 testing at EMEC's Fall of Warness test site (Credit Orbital Marine Power)", 1483228800000, 1609372800000, 2188946.0, "nweurope_31_9"], ["Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd (Subpartner of PP1 - GBER Art. 25)", "FORESEA - Funding Ocean Renewable Energy through Strategic European Action", "This project will help North West Europe (NWE) SME\u2019s test ocean energy (OE) technology in real sea environments and prove power can be economically generated from the ocean.\n\nLocated in the peripheral regions of Northern Scotland, Western Ireland, Western France and Western Holland, the partners in this project represent the areas of highest ocean energy resource in Europe. The development of a world leading OE industry in these regions represents a fantastic opportunity to stimulate economic development in these more peripheral, economically disadvantaged areas that are not able to rely on the variety of industry found in the traditional 'motor regions' of NWE.  Combating climate change and securing energy supply are also major issues for Europe and OE represents a substantial and as yet largely untapped asset which will help reduce GHG emissions by bringing highly productive renewable technologies closer to market.\n\nThe cost of pre-commercial testing and demonstration for OE is high and investors are reluctant to invest until the technology has been proven in the sea at scale.  The NWE area possesses world leading OE testing infrastructure and this project will connect sites in the Netherlands (tidal), UK (tidal and wave), France (wave and floating wind) and Ireland (floating wind and wave) to create a network which will place NWE at the heart of this emerging industry.\n\nTo date most EU R&D for OE has focused on technology, not testing. The FORESEA coordinated test sites will encourage longer term testing and technology de-risking.  FORESEA will result in a minimum of 26 OE technology pre-commercial demonstrations, over 60,000hrs of operation, work with over 60 SME's, sustaining 60+ jobs and helping to secure \u20ac30M investment into OE companies. FORESEA will also enhance the expertise and infrastructure in NWE and put in place a NWE OE Roadmap so ensure the long term impact of this project.", 1456358400000, 1576195200000, 107170.0, "nweurope_23_6"]]}}}}
