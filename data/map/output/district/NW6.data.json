The activities are to a great extent either a continuation of former or current projects or significantly inspired by those. 1) Learners mobility activities:Tietgen Business (HG2-students)Our former Tietgen HG (now Tietgen Business) has been arranging mobility projects with great success for 8 years. Anne Melbourne has been our contact in the UK for all these years. The cooperation has been excellent which is why we wish to continue the project. The project will consist of 20 HG2 students and take place in Spring, 2017. The students will be carefully chosen from different classes. The programme last for 4 weeks of which 3 weeks will be with accompanying teachers. These teachers will stay with the students for one week each.  Tietgen Handelsgymnasium (HHX-students)Inspired by extremely successful student mobility projects at our former Tietgen HG (now Tietgen Business), we wish to initiate as similar possibility in our HHX-department. The project will involve all our 3rd year students enrolled in our program \u2018Culture and Language (with Spanish)\u2019. This study programme includes Spanish A, Marketing A and Culture B. They have been learning Spanish for a bit over 2 years when they leave for Spain on their 3rd year. Therefore, they should have a basic understanding of the language they are going to be communication in for three weeks. The fact that Culture B is also a part of the programme is a big advantage as the students also have learned a lot about cultural differences and have a good theoretical cultural understanding. And this project will make them experience the Spanish culture and hopefully contribute to gaining a hands-on experience with cultural differences. The three week stay will consist of a one week long work placement in a local business. The local businesses will be selected by our local partner Debla in Malaga. The first two weeks of the stay will be a mix of language classes and activities involving using the Spanish language and learning about Spanish culture, the way of doing business and other relevant topics. As we wish to send 38 students from two different classes, there will be a bit of difference regarding their Spanish level. Therefore, the language teaching will take this into account as the students will be divided into groups according to level. When selecting work placements for the students, the abilities of each student will also be considered to ensure that the students do their internship in a firm where the language skills required match their skills. The students will be accompanied by teachers. Two teacher will travel with the students to Malaga and be replaced by two other teachers half way through the programme, who will travel with the students back to Denmark. 2) Staff mobility activities:In line with our current KA1 project (DAICOT) we wish to continue developing our network of partner schools with which we can arrange staff exchanges. We have chosen to bring in two partners schools that we have known for a while and collaborated on other projects/activities, but which are both new partners to us in the KA1 context. These partners are carefully selected from among a number of interesting and interested partners, which all had some relevant input to contribute with. Our two new KA1 partners we selected because of our good knowledge of the institutions, which have both been visited by Tietgen staff at previous occasions (on exchanges, study trips, project meetings etc.) and because the two institutions have very much in common with Tietgen in many ways (e.g. the subjects taught). As our current KA1 project is still running till May 2017, we are only applying for a few extra staff exchanges in this application in order to make sure that we do not ask for more than we expect to use. We have made clear agreements with all partners. In order to demonstrate how the tasks are divided among partners, we have attached a MoU of one of the staff mobility partnerships and one of the learners mobility partnerships. The details varies a bit, but it should give an idea of how we work.

The contents of the programme is currently being developed, but all topics will have an international approach, and the companies which students will be working with and visiting during the programme will all have English as their corporate language.\r\n\r\nStudents who are admitted to this programme are committed to participate in two study trips:\r\n1. a three week Erasmus+ study and training trip to London during the first term, and \r\n2. a four week study trip to an overseas destination during the third term. \r\nTherefore, AABC applies for 30 mobilities for the academic year 2017-2018 and another 30 for the academic year 2018-2019, i.e., a total of 60 mobilities. EUX Business International will be developed in cooperation with Intuition London (IL), a partner AABC has cooperated with for a great many years and who knows the vocational education and training programme very well, is familiar with the type of student at AABC, just as IL knows the staff at AABC who have enjoyed a close cooperation with the managing director at IL, Anne Melbourne, over the years.\r\n\r\nBefore the most recent reforms within vocational education and training, AABC offered carefully selected students the opportunity to attend a combined training and study trip to London during their third term. Due to new requirements in terms of curriculum, AABC and IL had to develop a new programme, which did not leave room for training as an intense focus on the academic goals was required. \r\n\r\nAs a consequence and based on AABC\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the European 2020 strategy, we wish to resuscitate the former programme with the amendments and adjustments required as we are dealing with students at their first term and students who are extremely young.\r\n\r\nThe students will be:\r\n\u2022 spending half the time in London training, and \r\n\u2022 the other half in college learning English and Marketing. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the study and training trip is:\r\n\u2022 to make students realise the value of looking for an apprenticeship immediately after the first two years of college and thereby finish the education before moving on to further education,\r\n\u2022 to inform students about and encourage them to look for apprenticeships abroad immediately after the first two years of college. \r\n\r\nUnlike former students, this group will not have been submitted to a long recruitment and screening procedure; they are going because they chose this particular programme. Furthermore, the students are young (15-16 years). Therefore, AABC has an important task convincing the students and their parents that students will be looked after 24/7. \r\n\r\nHence, accompanying staff will be at the students disposal at all times, and during the three weeks, students will be accompanied by two members of staff.  This is a unique opportunity for students and staff to get to know each other early in the programme and in a context outside college. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we apply for three accompanying staff mobilities, each will be staying one week, and another three staff mobilities who will participate in one-week courses to develop their competences, but who will also assist their colleague in the evenings and weekends planning cultural activities. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying staff will participate in all lessons at college and visit students when training in companies.  This will develop their oral proficiency and develop their intercultural competences, which they can implement in their lessons when returning to Denmark and thereby contribute to the international perspective of the programme. \r\nStaff participating in training courses will focus on:\r\n\u2022 English,\r\n\u2022 International trade,\r\n\u2022 International economics.\r\n\r\nAABC goals in terms of developing staff are ambitious.

The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth.

The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market. The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship. We are convinced that the implementation of this project and its further repetition will clearly increase the chances of our pupils to succeed in the labour market while also attracting other potential candidates to study at our school.", "http://www.adolphusacademy.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SK01-KA102-045975_6"], [2017, "Te\u00f3ria v praxi", "Adolphus Group Ltd", 28988.0, 2, 9, "The applicant of project is The Secondary School of Business in Vranov nad Top\u013eou, one of the most successful and most famous educational institutions in the field of vocational training in the region. Currently, 228 students attend the school. The four-year study programme provides education in economics, such as accounting, business administration and applied informatics. It also provides training in foreign languages (English, German and Russian). Most of our students are interested in the English language. The added value of studying at our school is emphasis on the necessity of connecting theory with practice through training companies in which students have the opportunity to test their knowledge and skills practically in a simulated foreign business environment. \r\nFurthermore, students in grades 3 and 4 must undergo mandatory vocational practice in agreed workplaces. Here opens up space for our identification of the need to deepen linking theory with practice so that we produce not only theoretical professionals for the labor market, but especially experienced and highly flexible professionals with active communication in English.\r\nTherefore, we defined the project objective: To increase the applicability of our students in the labor market through the implementation of foreign professional mobility by the improvement of professional and language competences of pupils.\r\nThe situation regarding employment after graduation is steadily worse, and finding a job is a difficult process, so we decided to respond to the situation and increase the chances of our students for employment by supplementing our educational process of implementation of international mobility, the content of which would be passing job training in foreign companies.\r\nIt concerns the implementation of foreign mobility, which will take place in England, in London, for a period of two weeks, 10 working days, 14 days along with the journey and weekends and involves a total of 15 students from the 4th grades of school. They will be accompanied by two English language teachers, active in our school. The selection of these 15 students will take place according to the results of professional language tests.\r\nThrough cooperation with the educational institution ADC College, which in this project plays the role of facilitator, our students, based on test results, will be placed in companies operating in Business Administration - Companies of ADC College, AS Accountancy, Adolphus Group, Age UK Westminster, Avalon School, Big Choice Group, Century 21 Chiswick, Central School of English. All listed companies are in a contractual relationship with ADC College and respect the evaluation within ECVET.\r\n To ensure the quality of the project, its implementation will take place under the supervision of the project team composed of a project manager, a project coordinator and a financial manager.\r\nTaking part in foreign mobility, students will gain insight into the functioning of the labor market in England, business opportunities, rights and obligations of economic operators, the principles of operation of the real estate business, they will get information about career opportunities and support of young people in employment, about social policy and social system in England, about the operation and its conditions as well as the system of financing charities, brief overview of the subsidy policies, they will acquire information about the methods of teaching English language, the importance of marketing, whether in personal life or in the working business environment.\r\nThe impact of the project on participants:\r\nIncrease and improvement of key competences of students:\r\n- learn to evaluate their own work independently, find reserves,\r\n- learn to convert weaknesses to strengths and threats into opportunities.\r\nIncrease and improvement of professional competences:\r\n- obtain an overall view on the issue of the private sector market functioning\r\n- obtain information about the social system in England and its use by socially disadvantaged citizens\r\n- obtain information about the operation of the third sector in the marketplace - (nonprofits, charities)\r\n- acquisition and improvement of technical skills (ICT skills, working with feeds, databases)\r\n- improve communication skills in English\r\nContribution of the project: to increase the quality of vocational education and training students for the labor market to withstand the competitive environment and to demonstrate the knowledge and experience which other applicants miss, possibly to show their greater sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, which would be supported by the experience acquired in the foreign market.

It will be held in a place made for residency next to Lyon in Haute-Loire. It can be defined by three main axes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all the \"collaborative experience\": The main goal of the workshop is to share our experiences of filmmaking as a collaborative research and decision process, where everyone's word is listened and considered in a positive way. Opening new horizons for audiovisual creation, we decided to mix a large panel of arts and skills. Eventhough, the audiovisual creation is the central object of the project, it must be intended in a much broader meaning: the technical quality of the film made by participants aren\u2019t as important as the experience itself. Filmmaking becomes a mutual responsibility, emulating connexions between people, connexions between ideas, and as such a great tool for collective experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreation is thus the final product of the workshop. Since the participants come with a great panel of different backgrounds, the staff will leave the maximum total freedom about the content of the works. We expect that each artists will infuse the final result with his/her own personnality and desires. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the project is about sharing. Sharing the same space and the same process, despite our the cultural differences, we will be trussed in a common involvement of respecting some human values and endeavouring to understand eachother needs, in terms of both aspects: living and creating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project can see with three times : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- In the first time, we'll present the programme, the aims of the workshop and develop a collective dynamic. There will time for the presentations of the associations, the countries, the participants and their artistic fields. A collaborative experience is at first a human incounter, and the expression of a commun interest and desire.  Our Project is build on this idea, thus we will leave the proper time for the youth workers to get to know themselves and think of the type of collaborative experience they wil leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - In the a second time, participants will have the times to bring their own theorical and pratical contributions about audiovisual creation. As a preparation, we ask them to write a short presentation about their activity as youth workers and artistic work. It's an efficient way to know each other and rich personal experience.During the first three days, we'll have short trainings with camera, sound gears, editing system, and the tools and competences we'll have with them. We won't provide a full technical training and to bring up the issues oaf audiovisual creation and its encounter with other arts and practices, as well as its great potential as a tool for youth workers. The game of the reel is a good example : spreading a wool reed between the participants as they speak and discuss about their activity and the projects they will build together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The third part of the workshop will be the making of the audiovisual creations. We plan a time for the presentation of the main themes of Erasmus +. We'll leave some to the participants to think about it and then have a discussion about them and how to work with it through the audiovisual projects. Groups will be freely made, with a staff referent for each one. The main idea is to get the participants responsible, and leave the confront with issues of collaboratives experience, although we'll provide a methodological and technical support. It will brings out a real diversity of creations, in terms of meanings and forms. We will also organize a public presentation of the works for the inhabitants of the village nearby, screen the creations with our traveling theater or put in the public space the installations and works made by the participants.

In an immigration society youth organisations ought to be facilitators of inclusion. As such they need to be credible institutions who base their anti-racist work on a truly anti-racist structure, an anti-racist culture and an anti-racist understanding of all members of the NGO. \r\n\r\nIn this context the aim of  this partnership project is to strengthen the role and profile of  youth NGO's in combating racism and facilitating dialogue and inclusion while also adapting their structures to become more accessible and sensitive to the needs and situation of migrants, refugees and PoCs.  Both the administrative and educational staff and co-workers of youth NGOs will be involved in the project. They will share experiences and put together their strengths in changing their organizations into truly anti-racist organizations AND in developing innovative concepts and strategies for empowering young people of color, refugees and migrants by involving them in international youth work activities. \r\n\r\nThe partnership is composed of 7 youth NGOs from Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Slovakia and UK working at national and international level. It also includes a Hungarian organisation specialized in and working at European level on anti-racism training and a a nonprofit consultancy with working experience in the civil society sector in Germany and internationally for more than 18 years. \r\n\r\nThe main innovative element is that the project activities inter-relate the field of anti-racism training and the concept of anti-racism oriented change management of youth NGOs. The main project  activities consist in 6 transnational meetings which will take place in 6 different programme countries from September 2017 to March 2020.  Besides planning the project implementation these meetings will include thematic workshops. 3 workshops will enable youth workers trainers and multipliers to reflect about their own role and way of working, gain method knowledge in anti-racism youth work as well as develop innovative methods and youth activities in this field. Another 3 workshops will allow staff, decision makers and coworkers of  youth NGOs to reflect about tools and methods which can make their organisation more sensitive to racism, more inclusive and more active in combatting racism, nationalism and radicalization of young people.  \r\n\r\nAs underpinning learning measures the partnership will simultaneously implement two Key Action 1 projects. One will focus on the training of youth workers in anti-racism training and one will focus on providing administrative and decision-making staff and stakeholders of youth NGOs to learn about change management. \r\n\r\nTo sustain the results of the project and to enhance the visibility of this project,  two intellectual outputs will be generated, one on change management tools and methods and one on anti-racism training methods in the context of anti-racism. The results of the project will be promoted in 9 multiplying events which will be organized by the partners in each of the participating countries. \r\n\r\nThe partnership expects that the project will inspire other European youth NGO's to take similar steps and to make use of the strategies, methods and tools generated, adapting them to their own organizational and societal context.

As a consequence, xenophobic attitudes, discrimination against people with different identities and open racism have become a sad reality in schools and other places where young people of diverse backgrounds interact. Given this situation the partners in this project are convinced that European youth NGOs have to play a more active role in detecting and combatting intolerant, discriminatory and racist behavior in their own organization and the environments they are working in and look for answers to the following questions: How can we make a difference given the current challenge of increasing racism and discrimination against people of diverse background? What kind of changes are needed at structural and operational level to support organizations taking clear positions and displaying coherent behavior? How can we start reflective processes and pursue respective change in our organizations? Which processes lead to success? \r\n\r\nAgainst this background and in support of the Paris declaration of EU Education Ministers 3 years ago, the overarching aim of the project \"Be the change\" is to ensure that young people acquire social, civic and intercultural competences by promoting democratic values and fundamental rights, social inclusion and non-discrimination, as well as active citizenship.

On the other hand the increasingly rapid development of new digital communication tools and internet contents poses challenges to organisations and youth workers (many of whom still grew up  with less exposure to the digital world). The challenge is to stay authentic when using social media to reach out to or communicate with young people. According to the analysis of a majority of partner organisations of ICJA e.V. there is a big need to improve the training of youth workers in the field Social Media and to develop joint communication strategies. Against this background the project \u201cYouth and Social Media as agents of Peace\u201d was developed to increase the social media competence of 20 youth workers from 11 different EU countries and the neighboring partner country Russian Federation. In accordance with Priority E of the European Union Work Plan for Youth for 2016-2018, a resolution  passed by the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council on 23-24 November 2015, the participating youth workers  shall be trained to recognize the opportunities and challenges of new communication trends of young people and elaborate new and appealing communication strategies to involve more young people in non formal education and voluntary service programmes, to foster their active citizenship and contribute to unfold their potential and talents in order to maximize the impact of youth work at European level. The training will take place from 01.-05. November 2016 in Berlin.  18 staff and volunteer youth workers of non-profit youth and voluntary service organizations from 10 EU and one neighboring partner country ( Russian Federation) will analyze the variety of functions and best practice in making use of social media and will be trained in three competence areas: 1) Getting to know and applying social media 2) Conditions for successful use of social media and 3) Elaborating and implementing tailor-made social media strategies in the field of international voluntary service, youth exchange and peace and democracy education.  At the end of the training the participants will be able to develop efficient communication strategies making use of social media and to implement these within their organisations\u2019 youth activities. They will not only pursue the aim to disseminate their programme offers but will be able to combine these efforts with the aim to cater to the educational and information needs of young people and to foster their active citizenship. They will be able to use networks and communication channels which are appealing for the programme particants and motivate them to engage in voluntary action for societal changes. By connecting the people dealing with communication in the participating organizations and developing joint social media strategies the project will have a longterm impact on the participating youth workers and their capacity to work together to achieve higher visibility of their youth work activities at European level.
