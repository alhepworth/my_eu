There is lack of mentoring and training schemes as well as investment readiness support corresponding to the specific features of social enterprises. \r\n\r\nTarget group\r\nTherefore, BASET addresses the learning needs of educators for their continuing professional development in social entrepreneurship. The educators include professional teachers, coaches, consultants, mentors, lecturers, SME experts, investors, professionals providing services to entrepreneurs and companies, and staff in business support organizations, training organizations and financial institutions. They will be upskilled on how to train and inspire social entrepreneurs to innovate, use curriculum templates, access business networks and will be acquainted with good practices and know-how on how to carry out mentoring across the innovation life cycle, how to use new teaching methods based on gamification and visualization.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe main objective of the project is to foster social entrepreneurship in Europe through elaborating, testing and providing a set of learning & training instruments to educators. All instruments will be tested whereas a group of educators will be trained to offer a set of resources such as training in entrepreneurial skills, mentoring focused on designing business models and business plans, networking within the broader social entrepreneurship ecosystem and access to grants or seed capital.\r\n\r\nPartner organizations\r\nThe partnership includes five participants from four countries: KISMC - not for profit in Bulgaria focusing on developing competences for adults in innovation management, creativity and entrepreneurship; CEED \u2013 an experienced business support organization in the entrepreneurship development in Bulgaria; IDEC - a consultancy with an accredited lifelong learning centre in Greece organizing in-service training courses for teachers and trainers, informal learning and vocational training; Caban Capital - a fund manager in the UK providing opportunities for investors to invest in entrepreneurs through services each business requires to be successful; and Creative District - a Brussels-based organization supporting initiatives in the creative and cultural industries for societal impact through providing innovation spaces for guidance and support of entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe following activities are planned: management plan and preparatory work; project execution; monitoring and reporting; evaluation of the results and quality assurance; executing and monitoring the dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nMethodology \r\nThe methodology concentrates on a collaborative cooperation based on the commonly accepted rules, preliminary defined tasks and critical milestones, strict reporting and effective control through an on-line project management platform. The activities planned in the project follow the classical training cycle for adults: Identify needs; Design programme; Deliver training; Evaluate results.\r\n\r\nResults and impact\r\nThe project outcome is a clarified learning model for training educators to contribute to the success of social entrepreneurs. The model consists of three main outputs: 1. Social Entrepreneurship Development Model - a very practical and easy-to-use handbook for educators and hands-on guidance that helps entrepreneurs carry out their social missions more effectively; 2. Train the Trainers Toolkit - providing educators with background knowledge and technical assistance to social entrepreneurs on-line; 3. Train the Investors Handbook equipping investors - mentors with practical knowledge and model of working with social entrepreneurs at risk. Other expected results: international conference on social entrepreneurship, two short term (5 days) testing courses - one on train the educators (trainers, mentors) and one on train the investors (financial mentors), fifty trained educators and investors, five project meetings open to the target group.\r\n\r\nSustainability\r\nThe methods and the achieved results will contribute to the understanding of the process of social enterprise management through the eyes of the educators in Europe who are involved in the entrepreneurship development and will be able to advance to specificity of the social entrepreneurship in a long term scale. With the outcome of the project the educators will be armed with a set of resources that will make the process of training, mentoring and networking for social entrepreneurs sustainable while facilitating their access to effective services and capital.

It asks why indigeneity has accumulated immense symbolic and ideological capital in Western societies when indigenous cultures are among the most disenfranchised in modern times, often still struggling for social justice after centuries of colonisation. Specifically, I ask what indigeneity has come to mean in particular places and at key moments, and what kind of cultural, political, ethical and aesthetic issues are negotiated within its canvass. To address these questions, I will examine performance as a vital mode of cultural representation and a dynamic social practice. Performance is interpreted broadly to include not only the performing arts (theatre, film and dance) but also mixed-media work, site-based heritage projects, applied theatre in health education, Olympic pageantry, festival enactments, political protest and cultural displays within tourism ventures.   The recent, rapid development of indigenous performance globally, its enthusiastic reception in national and international contexts, and its local significance and value will be studied in depth. I am especially interested in how evolving concepts of indigeneity may contribute to broader understanding of heritage, belonging, social cohesion and mobility in multicultural societies and how cultural values, knowledges and practices are transmitted, through performance, across place and time. The research will be thoroughly interdisciplinary, engaging with current scholarship in history, postcolonial studies, cultural geography, anthropology, environmental studies and performance theory.

This influential approach has neglected another important dimension of the body, namely the interoceptive body, that is, the body as perceived from within, as for example when one feels her racing heart.  In psychology, research on interoception has focused mainly on its role in emotion. INtheSELF, however, goes beyond this approach, aiming instead to show how interoception and interoceptive awareness serve the unity and stability of the self, analogous to the role of interoception in maintaining physiological homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we go beyond the division between interoception and exteroception to consider their integration in self-awareness. INtheSELF will develop novel, pioneering methods for the study of causal relationships between interoceptive and exteroceptive awareness (WP1), allowing us to test how these two sources of information about the self interact to reflect the balance between stability and adaptation (WP2); how their inter-relation is built in parallel to the development of self-awareness in early childhood and adolescence (WP3); and the role that their interaction has for social relatedness (WP4). INtheSELF provides an alternative to existing psychological theories of the self insofar it goes beyond the apparent antagonism between the awareness of the self from the outside and from within, to consider their dynamic integration.

Instead, this research understands statehood as a result of the relationship between functions and symbols, and will read it through an innovative new methodology, namely a study of state architecture.\n\nThe study will focus on state buildings in Africa. African statehood, uncertain and often ambiguous, in many cases profoundly shaped by colonial heritages and post-colonial relationships, is reflected in classical-colonial, modernist-nationalist and post-modern or vernacular styles of architecture. African state buildings reveal the complex interplay of ideas, activities and relationships that together constitute an often uncomfortable statehood. They symbolise the state, embodying and projecting ideas of it through their aesthetics; they enable its concrete functions and processes; and they reveal what citizens think about the state in the ways they describe and negotiate them.\n \nThe study is comparative, multi-layered and interdisciplinary.

C. difficile is resistant to a wide range of antibiotics with hypervirulent and multiple drug resistant strains now emerging. Vaccines are under development, but all are injectable and as such will elicit only a systemic immune response whereas growing scientific evidence suggests that to effectively prevent infection mucosal immunity is critical. Further, full protection to CDI (primary infection and recurrence) requires anti-toxin antibody responses as well as decolonisation of C. difficile spores. Our approach will be to use a novel mucosal vaccine delivery system based on the use of inactivated Bacillus subtilis spores that express two different recombinant C. difficile antigens on their surface, a toxoid antigen and a unique spore colonisation factor. In vivo proof of concept studies has provided compelling evidence for their use in a robust oral vaccine to CDI.

The question of how our sense of self is maintained or changed across time is a key topic in psychology. Our self must possess sufficient plasticity, that is, adaptive processes of re-organization, to ensure assimilation of changes and a sense of continuity over time. To study the plasticity of the self, we will investigate how the experience of a changing body updates or alters our sense of self, in two parallel projects.\n\nFirst, we will study what is currently considered to be the most radical change in one\u2019s body, the case of face-transplantation. In face-transplantation, the acquisition of a new face is a medical fact, while the experience of a new identity is an unexplored psychological outcome. We will investigate the plasticity and continuity of the self caused by face-transplantation by testing self-identification in individuals before and after the operation, using experimental psychology and functional neuroimgaing methods. Second, we ask how our own body-image affects the way we perceive other people. We will address this second question by investigating how changes in body-representation, caused by experimental manipulations of bodily illusions, can consequently affect social cognition processes, using experimental and social psychology methods.The question of the plasticity of the self is timely, because the modern self, due to societal, technological and medical advances, seems to be exposed to new, often radical, possibilities of change.

Theodosius was the last ruler to reign over a united empire. At his death the realm was divided into two halves, and by the end of Gregory the Great\u2019s papacy (d. 604), a mosaic of independent kingdoms had replaced the western part of the empire. Yet despite the political division, during this period western clerics built a supra-regional ecclesiastical structure with substantial levels of hierarchy and cohesion.\n\nUp to the 1950s historians have largely conceived of these ecclesiastical institutions as organizations with widely accepted power. More recent scholarship, however, has revealed the social origin and fallibility of clerical authority. Nonetheless, this move away from the study of institutions has left unanswered the fundamental questions of how a \u2018universal\u2019 church was built at a time of political fragmentation, and how the transition from informal mutual aid to more formal hierarchical structures of law- and policy-making came about.\n\nWith innovative methods of social inquiry we can offer new answers to these historiographical questions. Our project (CONNEC) will use social network analysis and new institutional theory to trace four processes: how clerical networks adapted to the new secular contexts, how these interactions shaped the development of ecclesiastical law, how clerics constructed and disseminated discourses that supported different structures of the church, and how networks fostered compliance and a sense of accountability among clerics.

I propose to track information flow through a natural group using brain gene expression profiles, to understand how dances elicit learning in the bee brain. Secondly, although bee foraging ranges are vast and diverse, social learning takes place in one centralized location (the hive). The social sciences now offer powerful new tools to analyze social networks, and I will use a cutting-edge network-based modelling approach to understand how the importance of social learning mechanisms shifts with ecology.

The research program and the associated structured training in computational biology will provide a strong basis for the fellow to become a leader in this filed and answer important questions, such as the systematic comparison of RB networks among organisms in plant and animal kingdoms, to enrich our knowledge on plant RB regulatory components in less studied organisms, such as crop plants, how the RB network has evolved and became modified for species specific outputs, compare growth-regulatory networks among crop plants, and identify ways to modify the network for optimum growth performance, how environmental factors, such as drought, limiting nutrients, pathogens impinge on growth through modulating network properties e.g. through RBR phosphorylation.", 252234.0, 252234.0, 1, 1, "RBnet", null, "http://www.rhul.ac.uk", null, "fp7_108016_999861451"], [1238544000000, 1380499200000, "EUROPEAN MICROKELVIN COLLABORATION", "Royal Holloway and Bedford New College", "'It is an unfortunate truth that the current electronics is facing a brick wall in a decade or so when Moore's law has finally run its course and no further miniaturization is possible. We need something new. Coherent electron circuitry may provide that entirely new alternative. In nanocircuits the electrons can behave coherently over the circuit dimension and thus follow the rules of wave motion rather than Ohm's law. To achieve coherence, however, electron scattering lengths must be larger than the sample size. That demands high purity to limit impurity scattering, but even limiting thermal scattering, by working at millikelvin temperature, we are still confined to circuits on the nanoscale. This provides the motivation for this application: there is an implicit imperative in nanoscience that there are enormous advantages to be gained at much lower temperatures. Despite the clear demand, nanoscience in general is inhibited from advancing beyond the millikelvin regime by a lack of appropriate expertise and facilities. However, in Europe we already have the greatest concentration of microkelvin infrastructure and espertise in the world, developed by our quantum-fluids community.

The magnitude of solar forcing on the current climate is still uncertain. This project aims to test the existence of quasic-periodic decadal to centennial natural climate variability modulated by grand solar minima during the Late Holocene, which resulted in abrupt climate changes in Europe on time-scale of a few years and has the potential to trigger comparable changes in the future. Describing the timing and the abruptness of the climate response to shifts in the solar activity requires very accurate climate reconstructions and dating, in particular where absolute ages are hampered by the presence of 14C plateaux. This research project will focus on the precise comparison of Late Holocene palaeoclimate records from annually resolved (varved) archives across Europe, with the core goal of estimating the velocity of the climate response to grand solar minima and possible seasonal effects. The project\u2019s novelty lies in the synchronization of very accurate varve chronologies from two European lakes, Diss Mere (England) and Meerfelder Maar (Germany), using tephra layers as synchronous markers. Tephrochronology and varve counting will thus be integrated as a multidisciplinary dating method to minimize the uncertainty derived from individual chronologies (varve counting error). Tephra (volcanic ash) from explosive eruption and atmospheric cosmogenic isotopes s are deposited over large areas synchronously and are reliably correlated to known eruptions. Varved sediments provide accurate chronologies and also store climatic signals at seasonal resolution.

The asphalt industry is one of the largest consumers of energy and raw materials, and highest contributor to the emission of greenhouses gases. Developing novel technologies to integrate waste and recycled materials into the production cycle of asphalt mixtures is a solution that improves both sustainability and cost-efficiency of the asphalt pavement industry reducing the CO2 footprint of these pavements and the environmental impact and associated costs related to the waste generation and disposal.
