Histology is a complex process requiring several steps for the tissue sample preparation. The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination). Microtomy is a labour-intensive procedure carried out by highly-skilled clinical/scientific staff. A skilled operator can perform up to 80 samples a day, but will cost well over \u20ac100,000 p.a. The MicroLean project proposes a low-cost automation of the microtomy process by a contactless manipulation of the samples.

The project will analyse existing freight urban flows, identify synergies and winning logistics sharing and collaboration strategies and will assess them in three ways: through comparative analysis based on actual market data, through simulation experimentation and via pilot execution in four different countries: Germany, UK, Italy and Greece. U-TURN will further contribute to the adoption of these strategies through managerial assessment, quantifiable benefits and the provision of tools, including a 'smart' transport matching tool, a collaboration platform, a simulation tool and economic assessment model.\nThe project aims to exploit the opportunities that currently exist for consolidation of transportation flows from food manufacturers to the various point-of-sales located in urban areas, as well as from local food producers and online retailers directly to consumers, and the high industrial interest behind this topic.'", 214939.0, 2250618.0, 6, 10, "U-TURN", null, null, null, "h2020_193351_937284229"]]}}, "3RN": {"creative": {"data": [[1456790400000, 1582934400000, "IN BLOOD", "SPLENDY INTERACTIVE LTD", 129393.0, 1, 1, "IN BLOOD is a Crime Thriller, Live Action Video Game.
