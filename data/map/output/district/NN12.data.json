The well-known power scaling advantages, from increased core size & higher non-linear thresholds, offer a tenfold increase in 'raw power' compared with current 1-micron technology. Simultaneously, a host of applications specific to this almost unexplored region of the eye-safe spectrum become possible, including: industrial processing, free-space communications & medical procedures. Undoubtedly more will arise as currently exotic wavelengths become readily available. To date, the lack of suitable components has blocked R&D in this field. However, several recent disruptive component developments have changed the landscape: 1) Ho-doped silica fibre technology has advanced, providing a solid base for development; 2) All-fibre component technology offers integrated functionality; 3) Better isolator materials and new designs offer realistic potential for effective 2-micron devices; 4) New modulator materials & designs allow Q-switches, filters & switches; 5) Carbon nanotube composites offer effective sub-ps modelockers; 6) 790nm diode technology is ripe for development, for optimum direct pumping of Tm.
