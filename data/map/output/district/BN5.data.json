The project focuses on sports coaching and tourism as these are two areas where there is a proven need for a more skilled European workforce, and for which the town of Lebrija is rich with work experience opportunities. Additional factors such as increased linguistic competences, the cultural experience of living in another country, and the personal benefits to be gained by successfully undertaking a period of work experience abroad, make this project an overwhelmingly positive opportunity for our students.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe main project objectives are as follows:\r\n1) Supporting participants to develop vocational skills and gain relevant work experience\r\n2) Tourism skills: helping our tourism students gain an understanding of the sector in Spain and wider Europe\r\n3) Sports coaching skills: helping our sports students gain an understanding of European coaching methods in sports\r\n4) Improving the participation of young women in sports coaching and providing significant added value to our disadvantaged students\r\n5) Empowering and improving participants\u2019 confidence by positive interaction with others\r\n6) Deeper cultural understanding of Europe and European projects\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nThe primary target group for the AIM project is young people aged 18-24 from Brighton & Hove who are interested in careers in either sports coaching or tourism and have taken \u2013 or are taking \u2013 either our Level 1 Award in the Principles of Coaching Sport or our Level 2 Certificate in Travel and Tourism Destinations. Additionally, we will place special emphasis on recruiting young women, particularly in the area of sports coaching. We expect that many participants will not have lived, worked or travelled abroad before. \r\nThe project will last one year and involve 28 participants in total; 7 participants at a time over the course of 4 flows. Each flow will alternate between Sports Coaching and Travel & Tourism and there will be an equal division between each sector (2 flows of each). \r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nThe main project activities will include:\r\nRecruitment: CoCo will distribute information about the project to current and past learners, who will then undergo an application process involving an application form, an interview with a CoCo member of staff and then a confirmation from the host employer. \r\nPreparation: The participant, tutor and host employer will sign a Learning Agreement specifying the main learning outcomes to be worked towards during the mobility. CoCo will organise group meetings with the other participants ahead of departure. 10 hours of language training will be given to students. \r\nPlacement: Six weeks of work experience including weekly progress meetings with host employer and a member of 3Si. Cultural activities will involve visits to nearby towns and cities and trips to places relevant to the students\u2019 interests e.g the Sevilla FC stadium for the sports coaching students. Participants receive weekly Spanish classes.\r\nFollow-up and Evaluation: Participants write case studies, attend exit interviews and fill in a final monitoring report to provide us with feedback. We encourage them to stay active on our social media pages so that we can track their professional progress.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe project provides a robust framework of support for our participants, many of whom will be from disadvantaged backgrounds. We believe that for young adults who have not lived or worked abroad before, six weeks is a manageable period of time for them to gain valuable skills, increase their cultural awareness and benefit from a renewed sense of confidence in their ability to face challenges and succeed. By combining a theoretical course with practical work experience, our participants will hone a whole range of both hard and soft skills.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\nOur aim is that each participant will be the beneficiary of an invaluable experience which will have positive impacts on their personal and professional lives. Based on discussions with potential participants as part of our research, we expect at least 65% to go onto further education or employment after their placement in Lebrija.\r\nWe also believe that the programme will bring added value to the other partners involved, particularly in the areas of staff training, capacity building and quality management. \r\n\r\nLong-term Benefits:\r\nWe will share the results of the AIM project with national and international partners as a means of encouraging efforts to integrate our target groups (in particular, disadvantaged groups and young women) into the European workforce. Feedback from the project will enable us to improve the services and support we offer as a training provider and develop more projects in the future.", "http://www.community-coach.co.uk", "COMMUNITY COACH LTD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047233_coordinator"], [2018, "Best Practices in European Sports Coaching", "COMMUNITY COACH LTD", 102399.0, 5, 5, "The key elements of the BPESC project are as follows: \r\n\r\nContext/Background of Project\r\nThe BPESC project aims to take the existing 1st4Sport Level 1 Award in the Principles of Coaching Sport and create a new qualification which incorporates an emphasis on sports coaching on a European level, with an additional unit called \u2018Best Practices in European Sports Coaching.\u2019 The new unit will have clear Learning Outcomes in line with ECVET principles.\r\n\r\nObjectives/Results of your Project\r\nThe three principal objectives/results we want to achieve by the end of this project are as follows:\r\no Level 1 Award in the Principles of Coaching Sport (Europe) qualification \r\no Positive change in the personal and professional development of both participants and staff\r\no Renewed attitudes towards sports coaching in Europe\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nOur project is primarily aimed at non/low-qualified young people, all of whom have an interest in sports or sports coaching. We will also focus on recruiting women due to disparities between the number of women and men engaged in all levels of sports and sports coaching.\r\nThe project will encompass a series of five pilot courses (10 students per course) in each of the five partner countries, resulting in a total number of fifty participants. \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nIntellectual Outputs: The project will involve the production of three Intellectual Outputs which are as follows: 1. Transnational Level Review and Guide for European Sports Coaches; 2. Development of Best Practices in European Sports Coaching unit; 3. EuroCoach Platform\r\nTransnational Project Meetings: The project will also include five Transnational Project Meetings, with each of the project partners hosting one meeting throughout the course of the project\r\nPilot Course: We will pilot the new qualification on a total of 50 participants and the course will run in each of the partner countries in October 2019. \r\nMultiplier Events: Each of the project partners will host a Multiplier Event in December 2019 which will be an opportunity for the staff involved with BPESC to showcase the activities, results and outcomes of the project to a range of local, regional and national stakeholders who have an interest in sports or sports coaching.  Each ME will aim to achieve attendance of at least 50 participants; 40 who are from the host country, and 10 attendees who are from abroad.\r\n\r\nMethodology: \r\nOur methodology to achieve this ultimate aim is transnational, multi-disciplinary, and essentially European in its aims.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThe whole structure of the project will be designed to optimise the positive impacts on all those involved. Learners, partner organisations, target groups and stakeholders will benefit from a variety of impacts which will be specific to their type and level of involvement with the project. Key impacts will include:\r\nLearners \u2013 development of key skills specific to sports coaching and an array of soft skills including teamwork, communication and time management. These will improve learners\u2019 sense of confidence and increase their employability holistically.\r\nPartners \u2013 Increased awareness of sports coaching; exchange of knowledge and best practice on an equal and mutually beneficial basis; establishment as a training provider recognised by Europe-wide systems by the adoption of EU tools and ECVET principles; continued professional development of staff including foreign language competencies.\r\n Target groups \u2013 increased opportunities for marginalised groups to undertake a VET qualification, thus increasing their professional prospects and easing entry into employment. Remedying the gender disparities within sports coaching\r\nStakeholders \u2013 our aim is that sports coaching networks will take our findings on board and make positive changes to their practices, alleviating barriers that exist within the industry for disadvantaged groups. \r\n\r\nPotential longer-term benefits\r\n Sustainability has been built into the \u2018Best Practices in European Sports Coaching\u2019 project proposal in order to ensure the potential for the continuation and development of activities, outcomes and impact after Erasmus+ funding has ended. Community Coach and its partners aim to produce this sustainability primarily through a) the delivery of the resulting qualification b) its development and recognition in the UK and Europe c) ongoing dissemination by the partnership through networking and the project\u2019s EuroCoach Platform.", "http://www.community-coach.co.uk", "COMMUNITY COACH LTD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048238_coordinator"]]}}}}
