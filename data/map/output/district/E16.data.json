Software protection is therefore utterly important; it can be a maker and breaker in domains like multi-screen mobile TV, software licensing, and credentials and sensitive data stored on mobile devices. However, current software protection techniques are incredibly hard to deploy. Moreover, they cost too much and limit innovation. Therefore many stakeholders in mobile devices need more trustworthy, cheaper software security solutions and more value for the money they spend on security.In this project, three market leaders in security ICT solutions and four academic institutions join forces to protect the assets of service, software and content providers. From their perspective, mobile devices and their users, which can engage in so-called Man-At-The-End (MATE) attacks, are not trustworthy.Our goal is to establish trustworthy software execution on untrusted mobile platforms that have a persistent or occasional network connection to a trusted entity at their disposal. With the ASPIRE solutions, we want mobile software security to become (1) trustworthy by leveraging on the available network connection and developing a layered security approach of strong protections; (2) measurable by developing practical metrics based on validated attack and protection models; (3) cheaper by integrating support for the protections into an industrial-strength ASPIRE Framework; (4) more valuable by enabling shorter time-to-markets; and (5) more productive by being more widely applicable.To provide software protection that is equally strong as the existing hardware-based protection, we will develop software protection techniques along five mutually strengthening lines of defense: data hiding, algorithm hiding, anti-tampering, remote attestation, and renewability. We will integrate compiler support for all lines of defense into the framework to enable service, software and content providers to automatically protect the assets in their mobile apps with the most appropriate local and network-based protection techniques. A decision support system will assist non-security-expert software developers to tune the tool chain for their assets and protection needs. This decision support system will reduce their time-to-market and lower their market entry ticket price. Research into appropriate models and metrics, as well in a protection evaluation methodology will support the system's design and development.We will demonstrate and validate the developed technology on three real-world use cases from the industrial partners in the mentioned domains, and in a public challenge.

In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized.

In Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, peace and war exist in parallel and contemporary peace support operations simultaneously involve combat operations and building peace. Hence, the goal of establishing just and durable peace is a fundamental challenge to contemporary peacemakers and academics alike. In order to shed new theoretical and conceptual light on the problematique of building just and durable peace and to offer policy-relevant advice, the team JAD-PbP has identified three critical challenges, which constitute the core of the proposal. The first challenge focuses on the quest for justice in contemporary peace processes, which has become increasingly apparent as several violent conflicts and wars are distinguished by gross human rights violation and ethnic cleansing. The second challenge concerns the quest for durable peace. Several contemporary conflicts tend to resist negotiated settlement. Yet, the ones that do reach a peace agreement still have a poor track record on implementation. The third challenge relates to the quest for effective strategies, particularly concerning the involvement of international actors in peacebuilding.

The epicentre of the \u2018diabetes epidemic\u2019 is in South Asia and this is reflected in the migrant populations in Europe. Current prevention strategies are focused on adult life and target over-nutrition in high-risk adults. However, for many population groups across the globe, these strategies ignore many key principles that underlie the increasing global prevalence of these diseases.  A substantial portion of the South Asian people, living in their home countries experience nutrition deprivation, while after migration to Europe, may encounter nutritional abundance resulting in imbalance during their lifecourse. These conditions are of particular importance during foetal and early developmental stages where environmental insults may interact with genetic risk to induce \u2018foetal programming\u2019 of adult metabolic disease.

Research suggests a profound effect of mobile ICT on pedagogy and on learners. For learners with special educational needs (SEN) mobile ICT allows for an even wider individualisation of learning materials and adaptation to personal learning styles. Inclusion for people with SEN in education is a primary goal in Europe. Analyses conclude that what is good practice and provision for learners with SEN is good for all learners.\r\n\r\nYet, educational organizations are not yet ready to adopt mobile ICT and to realise the potentials of this technologies for broadening inclusion. To become more inclusive and to adapt teaching and learning structures and approaches correspondingly, deciders, managers and teachers of educational institutions need new competences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives: IncluEdu aims to create an innovative, European-wide, modularised further education programme for, and network of, education providers by exploiting the huge potentials of tablet computers for wider inclusion of learners with SEN. The aim is that these organisations gain the necessary competences to successfully introduce mobile ICT such as tablets to support inclusion within their offers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities and results: The Strategic Partnership will develop, test and implement outcomes relevant to stimulate a wider uptake of ICT in teaching and learning to increase the level of inclusion of a wide array of educational organisations, with a particular focus on compulsory education.

The important role of education in promoting more entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviours has become widely recognised. The benefits of entrepreneurship education are not limited to boosting start-ups, innovative ventures and new jobs. Entrepreneurship is a competence for all, helping young people to be more creative and self-confident in whatever they undertake (\u201cEntrepreneurship in higher education, especially in non-business studies\u201d (EC: 2008). \r\nAs we have witnessed an overall failure of free flow of capital, which had been advertised as a source of global prosperity and growth, we believe that not only economical and political powers are moving to the rescue. In fact, in civil society where we find the liveliest collection of dynamic and diverse social innovation projects. As a rule, the majority of these initiatives and projects are independent of the public initiative, and are part of a movement of new civic attitudes toward co-responsibility and the resolution of common problems. The opportunity lies on being aware of these changes, empowering these different groups and people, connecting them, and providing a fertile environment in which to develop and create a lively community of social innovation (SIS: 2011). \r\nThe 2006 EU Conference on \"Entrepreneurship Education in Europe: Fostering Entrepreneurial Mindsets through Education and Learning\" detailed a wide range of possible actions that could be taken by different stakeholders, with the development of entrepreneurship education strategy being at the heart of any set of initiatives.

One of the guidelines indicates to \"promote social inclusion and combat poverty.\"\r\nIn order to combat social exclusion, empower a citizen\u2019s position and promote economic activity social security systems, learning for a lifetime and inclusion policies should be reinforced in order to widen the opportunities people have at different stages of their lives and to protect them from the risk of exclusion most of all among groups at the highest risk of the social exclusion, such as single parents, minorities, people with disabilities, children and young people, elderly, legal migrants and the homeless. Preventing families from the social exclusion requires modern services to be provided by the properly trained staff within the local environment.  The necessity for decision making and actions taking requires from the specialists an accurate knowledge and abilities that allow them to recognize citizens\u2019 needs in social activities. Constant vocational development is required in the effective actions taking.  Manifestations of changes in the social life require from the aid institutions an active approach towards education, knowledge gaining, educational methods development, ways of information flow activation as well as gaining and straightening of their didactic competencies. Currently in Poland, although families\u2019 support services \u201cFamily\u2019s assistant\u201d have been introduced there is still a lack of developed work tools and methods of operation that in a significant way constitutes an obstacle in the professional support provided to the families.The main objective of the project is to enforce the level of the social integration of families at risk of social exclusion by the dissemination of methods used within the \u201cFamily\u2019s assistant\u201d project in public assistance institutions. Detailed goals of the project include: \r\n1. Enhancement of professional competencies of social workers in the field of the use of modern methods of working with families at the risk of social exclusion. \r\n2. Preparation of a new, adequate to the modern forms, form of the environmental support, addressed to families at risk of social exclusion, by adapting the methods and techniques used in the process of helping to the conditions and practices used in the public assistance institutions. \r\nThe project is addressed to the representatives of institutions that support individuals and families socially excluded or at risk of social exclusion. Realization of the goals will be possible through a partnership with four organizations in four different EU member countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Austria and UK) - experienced in the effective combating of unemployment and social exclusion as well as in the use of modern methods of education.  Accomplishment of the goals will occur as a consequence of the creation of the following intellectual work results: \r\n1. Online platform \u201cIntegration through education\u201d \u2013 interactive educational tool addressed to the target group of the project and others interested. Prepared workshops and individual conversations scenarios will be placed on the platform. These will use different informal methods focused especially at: motivating family members to cooperate and solve problems independently; counselling; planning of individual paths towards social and occupational integration; talents discovering and development; case management. \r\n2.

Entrepreneurial competency and skills can be acquired or built only through hands-on, real life learning experiences.\u201d \r\nCommission, Entrepreneurship Education: A Guide for Educators, 2013\r\n\r\nNEET youth is becoming one of the most important challenges to the European societies and increasingly will be. \r\nDrop-out and early school leaving will increase, as schools are falling more and more behind the cultures of 21st century youth.\r\n\r\nMost NEET prevention measures are based on the unfortunate assumption that potential NEETs are not able to learn, to work intellectually or to develop educational or labour market relevant competences. This is why most of these settings are based on a practical and manual work. \r\n\r\nIronically this means that NEET prevention can result in learning prevention. \r\n\r\nPotential NEET youth and NEET youth are indeed able to develop strong intellectual and learning capacity, given the proper opportunities and learning settings.\r\n\r\nIt is an important element in the open the doors to community didactics to break through this inertia of depressed mentality in NEET prevention environments \u2013 including all levels of those environments \u2013 by inviting different kinds of players from other sectors, and with different mentalities, to join and engage in the projects and activities created with and for the youth groups.\r\n\r\nTo create new capacity in NEET preventions to support the learning of 21st century competences among the young people, Open the Doors needs to address and work with the professional staff in these settings, mostly teachers, social educators and youth educators.\r\n\r\nThe educational professionals are the gatekeepers of innovative didactics, allowing potential NEETs to re-engage in learning and initiative-taking.\r\nTherefore Open the Doors is missioned to create new didactics for NEET prevention THROUGH building 21st century didactic capacity among the professionals.\r\n\r\nIN CONCISE FORM THE PROJECT WILL BUILD 21ST CENTURY NEET PREVENTION CAPACITY AMONG NEET PREVENTION EDUCATORS THROUGH ENGAGING THEM IN CONCRETE PROJECTS WITH THE YOUNG TEAMS AND THE COMMUNITY, BASED ON THE PROJECT\u2019S 5 FUTURE-ORIENTED METHODOLOGIES: REAL-LIFE LEARNING, LEARNING IN MIXED REALITIES, WORKING WITH COMMUNITY, ENTREPRENEURIAL INITIATIVE-TAKING AND USING CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe capacity building of the educators will result from the interaction between such practical experimentation and the collective reflections systematically included in the project.\r\n\r\nThe DOCUMENTATION of project\u2019s extensive capacity building among participating educators will generate NEW KNOWLEDGE, on which the project\u2019s final outcomes will be based \u2013 offering rich didactic guidance to a wider audience of NEET prevention educators across Europe.\r\n\r\nIn summary the objectives pursued by Open the Doors therefore are:\r\n\r\n- To create new capacity in NEET preventions by working with the professional staff in the prevention provisions, mostly teachers, social educators and youth workers\r\n- To innovate in the didactics of NEET prevention by applying the 21st century entrepreneurial learning, linking the youth interest with the community needs and creating practical learning processes\r\n- To build capacity among NEET to re-engage in learning, community and work\r\n- To link this new experience to the education institutions responsible for training the new generations of teachers and youth workers\r\n- To upgrade the recognition of the NEET prevention institutions\r\n- To produce experienced based documentation to share among education institutions in order to unify the criteria in NEED prevention\r\n\r\nOpen the Doors builds on and offers 3 major pillars of innovation:\r\n\r\n- Teachers\u2019 competence development through the dialectics of practical real-life experimentation and systematic collective reflection and documentation\r\n\r\n- Developing and producing future-oriented 21st century re-engagement didactics for potential NEET youth, reversing the traditional practical and manual learning pitfalls\r\n\r\n- Creating open virtual guidance for wider European audiences directly based on knowledge generated by the project practice and co-created by the participating educators and youth teams\r\n\r\nNEET prevention settings and NEET prevention educators thus need to open the doors to dramatically new and future-oriented didactics based on:\r\n\r\nREAL-LIFE LEARNING\r\n21ST CENTURY LEARNING METHODS IN MIXED REALITIES \r\nWORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY \r\nENTREPRENEURIAL MIND-SETTING AND INITIATIVE-TAKING\r\nCREATIVE TECHNOLOGY \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s NEET prevention didactics innovation will materialize into the following key results:\r\n\r\nGuidelines for 21st century NEET prevention\r\n\r\nAre you a NEET prevention worker?\r\n\r\nEuropean NEET Prevention Guidance Service\r\n\r\nWhat NEET prevention NEED\r\n\r\nFunding NEET prevention facilities?\r\n\r\nThe Open the Doors hand-out collection\r\n\r\nAre NEETs not able to learn?

The project will look to innovate responses that can be deployed and/or adapted across Europe within a non-formal curriculum. In the process of the development of such non-formal youth work curriculum, the project will initiate training in non-managerial supervision.  This will energize the generation of a dialogical ethos (the examination, analysis and sharing of practice) that can provide the scaffold on which a learning organization can be established. \r\n\r\nThe project will undertake research into outcomes, including looking at the impact of referral routes.  Research will also investigate learner destinations/progression. The project will look to address the requirements of the youth pass in order that they can be met via non-formal means. The above should make it apparent that the target groups are young people categorized as NEET but also those who are involved in their journey to full and active participation in society.\r\n\r\nThere are various target groups that will be involved in this project but the main are the young people over the age of 16 which are not participating in an educational programme, training or work. The other target group is the trainers providing vocational training to the young people and also the youth workers that are providing life skills within the respective programmes. \r\nOverall the project will establish the necessary considerations and means to sustain continuous learning within teaching and learning organizations.  It will look to identify and establish innovative ways that will allow organizations to maintain ongoing dialogue and learning in order to adapt and change according to contextual demands and the needs of changing client groups.", "http://www.ymca.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-MT01-KA205-026913_2"], [2014, "Developing Detached Youth Work Practice", "YMCA George Williams Company", 114745.0, 4, 4, "Project is a partnership between Agenzija Zghazagh in Malta, Asociatia Centrul pentru Dezvoltare Comunitara Durabila in Romania, Stichting JONG Rotterdam in the Netherlands and YMCA George Williams College in the UK.

Our main objectives reflect the needs for youth workers development: explore new trends, approaches and methods in youth work, setting up goals of work with young people reflecting their real needs, ways to increase impact, tools to measure and record evidence of concrete outcomes, learn to use the various approaches in informal learning.During the project lifetime 10 participants will meet on 3 day study visit to YMCA George Williams College London (UK) to observe and learn from a well developed higher education institution (tertiary level) focused on theoretical and practical youth work studies, with strong background in informal education development (founder of one of the most relevant sites www.infed.org) to get inspiration for youth workers development in own countries - meet the staff and students, observe and discuss their work on site.Later, 32 participants will meet on a week-long seminar Community work(s) in Slovakia will be led by experienced facilitators with many years of experience and great theoretical background from UK, Slovakia and Romania. Participants will actively learn about the community in wider context, explore new, innovative approaches, methods tried by other participants with different experience, analyse situation of own work and community by provided tools and set up plan of action for further use in own country, design actions to increase impact of youth work in own community by methods of formal and informal learning.All participants will contribute to common outcome: a booklet for youth and community leaders on approaches and measuring of impact for further use by wider public.As a response to the need to raise proficiency of youth workers, we plan to create further cooperation with YMCA G.

Today\u2019s world is marked by widespread focus on economic development, technological advancement and global integration. Yet, we still witness widespread unemployment, especially among young people who are left outside the prosperity loop and who find it more and more difficult to access ever-changing labor markets.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of unemployment is even more sever among youth with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas, where there is a  lack of education and opportunity. Employability and being able to make your decent living is directly related to life fulfillment and personal independence. Young people in the vicious cycle of unemployment suffer from frustration, depression, low self-esteem and even aggression and cynicism.\r\n\r\nWe believe that long term solution of this problem lies not in externalities of macro-economics or policy but in hearts and minds of young people. A renewed mindset is needed for young people to understand that even in the most difficult situations they have more control over their lives than they think and through entrepreneurial spirit, procactivity, creativity and strategic approach they can spot values, seize opportunities, assess and take calculated risks and grow. Instead of seeking a job, they can create one for themselves.\r\n\r\nOverall aims & Objectives:\r\nThe main aim of this two-stage Youth Exchange is to create a platform and a process where 42 young people experience empowerment themselves and are equipped to empower others in their communities through exchange of ideas, stories, attitudes, techniques and tools that promote entrepreneurial spirit and skills of young people in general and young people with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas in particular.\r\n\r\nOne journey: 2 stages!\r\nThe first stage will take place in Bulgaria, where participants will explore the subject, its challenges and opportunities. In between the first and the second stage participants will do research and observation in their local communities to find useful insights and opportunities for value creation, entrepreneurship and employability. The second stage of the exchange project, which will take place in Hungary will gather insights, learning, inspirations and experience of participants from their local communities and translate them into concrete business ideas and quality youth projects to be carried out under Erasmus + Programme.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the first exchange:\r\n- Explore the concept of unemployment and achieve a common understanding of youth employability.\r\n- Analyze the current situation of young people today, especially the youth with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas and understand their hopes, dreams fears and barriers for their personal development.\r\n- Exploring obstacles and barriers to youth employability and ways to overcome them.\r\n- Identify innovative tools and best practices and methods which can be transferred to working reality\r\n- Form teams from participants to do research and observation in their local communities after they return in order to find useful insights and opportunities for value creation, entrepreneurship and employability.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the second exchange:\r\n\r\n- Gather insights, learning, inspirations and experience of participants from their local communities and translate them into concrete project ideas.\r\n- Equip participants with knowledge and skills in the field of project management in order to enable them to develop quality youth projects.\r\n- Identify existing resources for the young entrepreneurs and share know how on social enterprises to link youth with business and entrepreneurship.\r\n- Promote Erasmus + Programme and explain how young people can be involved in it.\r\n- Develop concrete business ideas and entrepreneurial initiatives.\r\n- Develop concrete projects to be applied under Erasmus + Programme.\r\n- Develop and publish an online catalogue of business ideas.\r\n\r\nThe project activities are based on non-formal learning methods and principles, inter-cultural dialogue and communication in including group discussions, interactive presentations, participants' lead workshops, team work, etc. Youthpass tool will be used throughout the project to help young people reflect regularly on their personal learning journeys and become more aware of their own learning The methodology of the project will stimulate active participation and sense of initiative and involvement of the learners.", null, "CHAMPIONS FACTORY LTD", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-037068_coordinator"], [2017, "Cultural Inclusion Sports Club", "Youth Action International LTD", 29970.0, 5, 5, "Cultural Inclusion Sports Club is a multi-activity project designed to show how important the role of sport plays in the lives of young people\u2019s life: it teaches persistence, courage, ability of losing and winning, team work.
