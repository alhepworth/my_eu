The TACMON technology is innovative in that it applies electrostatic MEMS actuator technologies with a micro hydraulic amplitude transmission to realize a large matrix of tactile dots using cost-effective bath-processing technologies. There are 7.4 million visually impaired people in the European Union. High unemployment amongst the disabled is a serious social and economic problem for the EU, as continued exclusion from productive activity requires increasing state-funded support for social programs. There is a need for effective assistive technology to facilitate employment of the visually impaired and for industry to better be able to meet anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the EU is investing heavily in e-learning to modernize education and training, but locking out the visually impaired since information and communication technologies are heavily oriented to visual user interfaces. The EU must quickly address the needs of sector SMEs that provide technological solutions for the disabled, as there is a continuous competitive threat from both foreign companies and large enterprises. TACMON offers SMEs an innovative technology targeting an interactive graphical tactile display and user interface for the visually impaired to access electronic information. TACMON technology can contribute to the creation of new business opportunities in software for learning, leisure, communicating via Internet, among many others for the disabled community. The TACMON product responds to important market demands in industry, education and other sectors that lack appropriate inclusive technology adaptable to meet the needs of their visually impaired clients.", 248988.0, 3369029.0, 11, 20, "TACMON", "http://www.tacmon.eu/new/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58175.jpg", "fp7_94826_988363944"]]}}, "8HH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "STC Internationale Stage 2016", "Hapag-Lloyd (UK) Ltd", 117600.0, 5, 7, "In the period of 2016-2018 the STC-Group expects a group of enthusiastic students and employees to go abroad and do an international internship.

There is a tendency amongst the students in our schools towards preconceived notions with regards to society\u2019s expectations of the roles of men and women today, both in the work place, home and within the school system. We share a concern about the ongoing unhealthy nature of relationships between the sexes and the impact this has on an individual\u2019s self esteem, and consequently on their choice of further education and career. As a group we strongly feel that gender issues should be addressed at school level in order to promote and foster change in the future work place.

This will involve lectures, workshops and student led campaigns to raise awareness of the above issues.  Our resources come from varous experts in the field, our subject teachers and the European Institute of Gender Equality. The key goal is to raise attainment across all partner schools. The key expected result is increased knowledge and awareness amongst all participants of how gender, education and opportunity in the world of work are closely linked.

We will hand out this booklet (which may interest new expats in the UK for example) in the area of London (Greater London) thanks to our partner companies. For a wider broadcast, it will also be available on our school website (e-book).\r\n\r\nOur vocational school is located in a rural area, in a fragile economic and social environment with a suffering labour market. The learners we are welcoming are generally not mobile and unaware of the European dimension. That is the reason why our project is relevant because it will develop mobility among beneficiaries, mainly thanks to the work placements in England. It is also relevant because it will increase their 'employability' as they will be able to highlight the great added value of their training on the world of work : (language and professional skills, culture and european awareness).\r\n\r\n2 - NUMBER AND PROFILE OF BENEFICIARIES :\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries are students in our vocational institute : St Pierre FOURIER Vocational School in Gray (Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, France). They are preparing a Technical A-Level in Services (French acronym : ARCU) or a Technical A-Level in Commerce. All the beneficiaries of the mobility are in the second of a two-year course. They are between 16 and 20 years old. Altogether 11 participants will be selected in our European Department to go on a 4-week work placement in England (Greater London)\r\n\r\n3 - ACTIVITIES :\r\n\r\nThe first school year is a year of reflection and collection of the information. First of all it must allow the beneficiaries to discover the structure of British companies operating in the field of Services or in the field of Commerce. It must also allow them to have a better understanding of the differences with French companies. Then, they will be able to investigate our British partners (companies and host families) during 4 weeks in order to collect the information required to create our bilingual booklet. \r\n\r\nDuring the second year, participants will produce and print the bilingual booklet. Then, they will be able to hand it out / broadcast it during a second 4-week mobility period. \r\n\r\n4 - PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS :\r\n\r\nOur project is directed by a team composed of three teachers, in charge of managing, developing and following up of the project. Every member of the team will be responsible for a sub-section and will have to achieve goals according to a pre-established program. To ensure the follow up of the project, the members of the team will organize a working meeting at least once a month. \r\n\r\nDenis Mouchot, a teacher of English : coordinator, Head of the project management, in charge of the relationship with our British partners, in charge of technical prospecting tools, in charge of the language and cultural training of our beneficiaries, in charge of settling the students in England (week 1 of each mobility period) and assessing them (week 4 of each mobility period).\r\n\r\nCatherine Bouju, a teacher of vocational subjects, deputy coordinator of the project management, in charge of vocational training in English of our beneficiaries (DNL-non language subjects), in charge of assessing the students with the teacher of English (week 4 of each mobility period).

It is also relevant\r\nbecause it will increase their 'employability' as they will be able to highlight the great added value of their training on the world of\r\nwork (language and professional skills, culture and european awareness).\r\n\r\n2 - NUMBER AND PROFILE OF BENEFICIARIES :\r\nThe beneficiaries are students in our vocational institute : St Pierre FOURIER Vocational School in Gray (Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, France). They\r\nare preparing a Technical A-Level in Services (French acronym : ARCU) or a Technical A-Level in Commerce. All the beneficiaries of\r\nthe mobility are in the second of a two-year course. They are between 16 and 20 years old. Altogether 10 participants will be\r\nselected in our European Department to go on a 4-week work placement in England (Greater London)\r\n\r\n3 - ACTIVITIES :\r\nThe first school year is a year of reflection and collection of the information. First of all it must allow the beneficiaries to discover the\r\nstructure of British companies operating in the field of Services or in the field of Commerce. It must also allow them to have a better\r\nunderstanding of the differences with French companies. Then, they will be able to investigate our British partners (companies and\r\nhost families) during 4 weeks in order to collect the information required to create our bilingual blog.\r\nDuring the second year, participants will produce and put online the bilingual blog. Then, they will be able to promote  it\r\nduring a second 4-week mobility period.\r\n\r\n4 - PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS :\r\nOur project is directed by a team composed of three teachers, in charge of managing, developing and following up of the project.\r\nEvery member of the team will be responsible for a sub-section and will have to achieve goals according to a pre-established\r\nprogram. To ensure the follow up of the project, the members of the team will organize a working meeting at least once a month.\r\nDenis Mouchot, a teacher of English : coordinator, Head of the project management, in charge of the relationship with our British\r\npartners, in charge of technical prospecting tools, in charge of the language and cultural training of our beneficiaries, in charge of\r\nsettling the students in England (week 1 of each mobility period) and assessing them (week 4 of each mobility period).\r\nCatherine Bouju, a teacher of vocational subjects, deputy coordinator of the project management, in charge of vocational training in\r\nEnglish of our beneficiaries (DNL-non language subjects), in charge monitoring the students (weeks 2 and 3 of\r\neach mobility period).\r\nCharline Fournier, a teacher of English : in charge of translating any documents required for our project.\r\n\r\n5 - RESULTS AND IMPACTS :\r\n\r\n5.1 Expected results are clearly defined :\r\n- a survey on the legislative framework regarding the creation of businesses\r\n- the production of a bilingual blog : 'Starting one's own business in the United Kingdom'\r\n- publishing this blog\r\n- promoting this blog", "http://www.barkingabbeyschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036778_1"]]}}, "9LX": {"nhs": {"data": [["RAT", "Barking Community Hospital", "nhs_RATAP"]]}}}}
