Moreover, one of the key priorities for HE is the\r\nreinforcement of the \u201cKnowledge Triangle\u201d, through the support of innovation, entrepreneurship and university-business\r\ncooperation. This specifically applies to those traditional sectors, such as the environmental related sectors, where changes in\r\neducation and training are required to equip the future workforce with the new skills for the new demands generated by the\r\nchanging patterns of economic growth as a result of climate change  (e.g.: water sources, tourism impact).\r\nNevertheless, the European Security and implicit Environment Security is a key driver of sustainable growth with a significant contribution to Europe\u2018s overall economic health, competitiveness, creativity, innovation, employment and growth. Staff qualifications along youth unemployment remain one of the crucial points in Europe. To boost the recruitment of highly prepared staff requires initiatives addressing training to make the sector attractive and capable of\r\ntransforming both the academic knowledge and high-level basic and transversal competences required to be useful and applicable.\r\nFor these reasons, this Strategic Partnership proposes the creation of a flexible learning pathway in line with the needs of learners\r\nand companies in meeting environmental targets and securing sustainable conditions for EU citizens . It will provide a joint study modules program between Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training that will CAPITALISE COMPANIES WITH PREPARED YOUTH, providing enterprises innovation, expertise and added value.\r\nENSEC arises from a Strategic Partnership composed of seven entities from regions that are highly influenced by climate change and tourism impact : Four universities, three SMES /technical research and Training centres and one chamber of commerce-Social partner representatives. With the aim to DEVELOP AN INTERNATIONAL MASTER DEGREE Modules Programme FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY, which will offer an adapted curriculum to equip the young generation with the specific, basic and transversal competences currently required in the related industries. This international Master Degree modules will provide students with opportunities to gain additional skills by studying and training abroad.\r\nThis initiative will comprise of the following activities:\r\n-Surveys, comparative analysis and evidence-gathering, studies of real life cases in order to have a real idea of the needs of skills and\r\ncompetences in the European Environmental Studies.\r\n- Development of a joint modules curriculum with the integration of different learning modes (distance, face to face, etc) and innovative approaches.\r\n- The creation of learning and training materials together with methods, pedagogical approaches and tools.\r\n- Capacity buildings and networking activities.\r\nAs a final result of these activities this Strategic Partnership will develop a Study Report on current skills needs on the European\r\nEnvironmental studies offer, a Joint Modules Curriculum together with a learning content and an e-Learning platform that will be\r\nfreely and widely distributed. 4 Multiplier Events are planned at the end of the project.\r\nENSEC will trigger modernisation and reinforce education aligned to the needs and opportunities offered by traditional\r\nindustries. It will provide, assess, and look for the recognition of basic skills needed in the environmental related sectors. ENSEC\r\nwill also address transversal skills, such as entrepreneurship, foreign languages and digital competences.\r\nHE students and staff, and also everyone involved in the development of this initiative will have the chance of increasing their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, their competences in foreign languages and, of course, increasing their skills and capabilities for\r\nemployability in a industrial sector which is the main key driver in many European regions.\r\n----\r\n(1) Data from Eurostat SBS Eurostat, (sbs_na_ind_r2).", "http://www.projects-abroad.co.uk/", "BUCKINGHAMSHIRE NEW UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036521_6"], [2014, "Gain Global Awareness", "Projects Abroad Europe Ltd", 174125.0, 6, 12, "his project aims at enhancing quality regarding the students\u00b4 ability to get a job in the future.

At our institution, students specializing in fields such as health and fitness management, management and international guest care as well as languages and economy are required to spend twelve weeks abroad between their third and fourth year while students who specialize in event management and cultural studies must spend in total eight weeks abroad between their second and fifth year.  These work placements should be completed in as many different organizations as possible.\r\n\r\nThe education provided at HLW Schroedinger includes general knowledge, foreign languages and economics (matriculation standard).  The different branches of our vocational college focus on providing the students with an educational system that combines both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in equal measure.

All this will, ultimately, contribute to enrich the human capital.\r\nThe 2018 internationalization plan is developed as follows:\r\n\r\nA) Mobility actions that, along with the project, will involve other 300 students altogether, in\r\n-4-week internships in FR, financed by PON 2017-ASL, for 15 students from Vittorio Veneto Institute;\r\n-4- week, self/co-financed internships for 10 students of the Cerletti in the wine-growing areas of Novo Mesto (SL) and Krems (AT);\r\n-Participation of the Institute Beltrame as sending school of the project  2017-1-IT01-KA102-005892, for 12 mobilities of 1 and 3 months in Malta and ES;\r\n-Alternance school-work abroad, for 1 week in Berlin, (self-financed) for some fourth classes of the Institute F. Da Collo;\r\n-2- week study/professional holidays, school trips, participation in competitions or international events as planned by the institutes\r\n-Bilateral exchanges: new partnership with Rybinsk (RU) for 36 students and 5 teachers.  Continuation of the two class-exchanges with Rheinfelden and Hannover, that have been active for some years;\r\n-Preparatory  visit to Stockholm for  a new exchange experience.\r\n\r\nB) Enhancement of language competence: \r\nin 2017, B1 certifications went beyond the estimated 10% also thanks to the FSE-POR Move 4.0 financed for Certification. C1 certifications have increased in number. More courses to prepare for certifications have been activated: at the moment, there are more than 200 applicants and this increase is coherent  with the estimated annual rate of increase. There will also be an increase of 30  certifications for German thanks to the approval of the project FSE-POR Move 5.0 already financed.\r\nThe financial support granted by the FSE-POR DGR N. 1539/2017 \u2018Internazionalizzazione della Pubblica Amministrazione\u2019 will give, to 12 teachers and 1 Principal, the opportunity to get prepared for the certification in 2018, thanks to a 40- hour course in Italy and a 30-hour course in the UK.\r\nIn addition to this, self-financed courses for teachers have been activated; a 20% increase in the number of certifications is expected.\r\nAll the activities related to the consolidated training offer will go on regularly: drama, cineforum, lectorate, school trips, classes held by mother tongue experts.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006427_2"], [2016, "EUROEXP 2016", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 240106.0, 5, 9, "Most of the 90 learners\u2019 mobilities -of 5 weeks each- expected for this ERASMUS+ Call, will be carried out at the end of August 2016; the remaining ones will be realised within May 2017. The participants will have finished, or will be next to finish the fourth year of study. Abroad, the program includes a week of preparation and 4 full-time internship in company. Although mobility is recognised as school-work alternance to all intents and purposes, its duration cannot fully overlap school lessons.  For this reason it can take place with only partial overlapping at the beginning or at the end of the school year, as in the past.  The participants come from different schools where they study technical subjects (Agriculture; Computer Sciences), Economics (Administration, in a Marketing framework; Tourism) and Vocational subjects (Wine and Food and Hospitality services, Rural Development Services). The foreign partners and destinations for this first year of the project with the Erasmus+ Charter have been identified on the basis of past experience, taking into account participants\u2019 needs, the educational opportunities they can offer and their relevance for the project subjects: UK (Reading, Cardiff, Plymouth), France (Nice), Spain (Valencia), and Austria (Vienna).  These are destinations where the management and promotion of tourism and the valorisation of resources are supported by digital technology (typical agricultural products or their transformation, but also cultural and landscape resources). Mobility will be very important for the young participants in an economic context where exports of quality products are particularly significant and at the same time the foreign tourist trade has a relevant market share.  It will assist learning in new contexts different from those of a school laboratory or local enterprise for the development of language skills and to experiment work environments that employ different technologies and job organizations and have different missions.  The experience will make it possible to develop both specific professional and transversal competences: the business environments will stimulate reflection, curiosity and a desire to learn; to promote and increase adaptability and flexibility, autonomy and the ability to work in a team.  Experience in an unknown international context will also be a wonderful opportunity to develop relationship skills, intercultural open-mindedness and personal responsibility, all characteristics necessary to work in the local economy.As at the end of the fourth form many participants are still minors, schools consider it necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher who will act as facilitator and take care of the participants and their safety.All institutes will take part in STAFF mobility.  The six participants involved will be five teachers of CLIL subjects in the English language (computer sciences, wine and food, maths and physics, etc.) and the administrative assistant of the Cerletti Institute dealing with the project.  Mobility will take place in the first two weeks of September, as per the plan and method indicated in the project (language training and job shadowing), only in the UK for this first year.The mobility come within the international development plan of the individual schools in the consortium which in school year 2016-17 will not only participate in staff mobility but will also extend their initiatives to promoting language certification for levels B1 to C1 in the different languages studied in the schools, increasing the number by at least 10%, and applying B1 certification to the third form so as to give participants in the future 2017 mobility an advantage.  All the schools also intend to take part in the FSE and PON regional competitions for language studies abroad for the purpose of achieving certification.The schools will extend their initiatives of hospitality, referral and exchange of both students and teachers (partnerships in Key Action 2 projects in progress, bilateral relationships with schools, invitations to visiting professors and intercultural activities).  In the framework of alternating school-work, the institutes wish to provide a broader horizon in terms of links to the world of work through category associations and internationalised businesses, with lectures in the original language by experts in subjects relating to internationalisation and pertinent to the different studies.

This implementation is carried out through a)  the CLIL team, officially established last year, and whose members are teachers of the Staff mobility of the previous years,  b) school work groups, c) the CLIL network of 5 High Schools located in the area, born as an initiative of the CLIL Team.\r\n\r\nThe results reached so far have led the schools to  increase the participation of the teachers to international activities, therefore  the schools aim at improving the teachers'  language competence by promoting and organizing English courses  to get the staff  ready for B1 and B2 certifications. \r\nThe international activities of the consortium, for which a good competence in  English is needed, are the following: staff mobility, CLIL teaching, cultural exchanges, school trips with visits to foreign companies, support during study holidays abroad, and Erasmus + mobility, tutoring in international competitions (Robocup Junior), guided tours to the Museum  of textile machinery at IT Marzotto, activities to support groups of foreign students of the mechanical, IT and fashion sectors  during their work-training period in Italy (in case the projects submitted  in the countries of origin CZ, BG, PL will be approved).\r\n\r\nThe consortium aims at implementing  B1-B2-C1  language certifications of the students too. In 2017 the number of certifications grew by more than 13% thanks both to European Social funds  and to grants given by Pasini institute to 31 students in order to  cover half the cost of the certification exam. \r\nThe schools will increase the number of language courses for the preparation to the exams; 120 students, who will be interested in the Erasmus + project next year, are going to study holidays in the summer 2018 thanks to the project Move 5.0 that has already be financed by Regione Veneto with ESF.\r\nOther actions to reinforce the competence in foreign languages will keep going on,  these actions include lessons with mother tongue teachers (English, French and German), Cineforum, summer study holidays, school trips in foreign countries,  Smarter English (a full week of language lessons held by mother tongue teachers who, during the week, will be hosted by some students' families). \r\nIn order to foster the interest in the French language, studied  by a few students only,  Pasini institute will take part  in a National  Language Competition.\r\nThe schools will enhance international relationships even through E-twinning,  that will be implemented by 50%,  schools exchange projects for teachers, and new exchange projects with Chester and Malta. \r\nThey  will also keep promoting Intercultura   exchange programs, although it is quite difficult to monitor the results of this type of mobility.\r\nThe schools in Schio will continue exchange programs with Landshut. De Pretto High School will organize the annual exchange professional program for 15 students with Staatliche Fachoberschule. Despite English is the language used in the work place, all the schools aim at improving German learning too as DE is one of the most important trade partner for our local companies, for this reason German courses, addressed to both students and teachers, have already been organized.\r\nThe schools will also improve collaboration with local partners by organizing conferences in English held by Federmanager and by a EU official on international issues (Industry 4.0; Brexit and the implications for European Trading), for students of the 4th and 5th year of study, other conferences will be held for students of the third year on work-linked training issues. On \u201cCities for Life\u201d Day in collaboration with Saint Egidio Community, the schools organize a conference in English to debate on death penalty.\r\nAll the projects arise from the shared vision of the importance of multiculturalism and from the wish to enhance the feeling of belonging to Europe which will also lead to the participation of 40 students to the annual competition called EuroMaster organized by the Center for European Relationships and the  city hall of Schio.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006432_6"], [2017, "EUROEXP 2017", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 212094.0, 7, 10, "The Consortium will organize the 95 5-week Learner mobilities  in the summer of 2018 as the ones  remaining from the current Project will be carried out in 2017. \r\nThe mobility organization and management will follow the established Project procedure. Participants are students at the end of their 4th year from the chosen educational fields and 6th year students of the enotechnical sector. The inclusion of this latter student profile (approved by the MIUR since school year 2015/16) in the Project  fits in with the goal of the Cerletti Institute to internationalize the professions taught there. \r\nForeign partnership has been confirmed in order to continue and reinforce the educational alliance that has developed over time. \r\nFurthermore, International vision has been increased, according to the  Project strategy, thanks to two new partners: Czech Republic (Prague) and Slovenia (Maribor); these countries are wine competitors and are particularly interesting for the educational and training opportunities they can offer in this field. \r\nThe other destinations are confirmed: United Kingdom (Reading, Cardiff, Plumpton, Brighton), France (Cannes), Spain (Valencia), Austria (Wien). Some accompanying staff will be required as many participants are under age at the end of the fourth year.\r\nThe 6 staff mobilities  will be partially realized in 2017 (4 teachers) and completed in 2018.This planning has taken into consideration  the fact that the staff mobility has been fully and successfully realized in the current project and, thanks to the interest  and expectations aroused, it has had a positive impact  on the sending institutions.\r\nThis is the reason why the schools want to make the most of the results achieved that are: implementation or increase of CLIL modules; development of language education; increased number of   certifications for teachers (5 more certifications according to the number of teachers enrolled at certification courses). In addition, next year the number of staff applications will be more than double the places available thanks to the promoting activities carried out by each individual institution.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the Consortium plan of international development is the increase of other kinds of mobility: the schools are applying for MOVE 4.0 Call (DGR Veneto n.1866/2016) in order to organize study holidays with compulsory B1 certification. If financed, 90 3rd year students will be involved and they are prospective candidates for Erasmus + mobility in 2018. The school will organize, as usual, self-financed study holidays (50 participants) and school trips focused on linguistic, cultural and professional learning. An increase of 1-2 groups for each school is foreseen. This number is only apparently low as these activities are often an alternative to exchanges, that are the most important mobilities in the schools of the Consortium. More in detail, the institute Cerletti aims at increasing the following actions: mutual cooperation with foreign vocational institutions; training in internationalized firms (two exchanges in FR, 2 in DE, 1 in CZ); continuation of the project VITEA 2015-FR01-KA202-015381 regarding high vocational training for the profile of Certified Trimmer integrated in the ECVET system. In 2016 this Project involved 32 students, 18 teachers, 2 French ECVET experts and 8 European schools. Furthermore, next year the Institute Cerletti is planning to start two new exchanges: one institution in Krems (AT) following the Vinea Project and one institution in Novo Mesto (SL). \r\nThe Institute F. Da Collo, in addition to the exchange with a school of Isernhagen (DE, 40 students), will go on with the organization of an exchange with the French  \u201cLycee de la Vallee du Cailly\u201d (Rouen,  4th year students). An additional mobility, if financed, is the school-work experience abroad (MOVE Call for ASL DGR 1914/29-11-16 POR-FSE).\r\nThe Consortium will increase the number of the B1, B2, and C1 certifications for the students (120 at the moment) in the languages studied. Other activities focused on international development and implementation are: increased  international volunteering cooperation (EduCHANGE from 3 to 7 volunteers, IIs V. Veneto); participation in international contests (Young Business talents; European Wine Championship; food and hotel management contests; organizations of themed meetings in foreign languages for the European Festival 2017; school period abroad as Exchange students (5 inbound and 5/6 outbound IIs F.

All these actions are based on the awareness of the importance of pursuing the value of multiculturalism, of belonging to Europe, of responsible participation. The five-week 95 mobility projects for learners will take place in summer 2018, as scheduled in the project,  Poland, the Check Republic, Estonia will be confirmed as destination countries as the job internships offered have a great high- tech value. The UK, Germany, Spain and France will also be confirmed, as they offer  some excellent job internships in companies providing  indirect services to businesses. \r\nAlthough the students who study French are not so many, France will be confirmed as a destination  country in order to cherish the interest in the country shown by the students in  the last two years. \r\nSome of  the 6 two-week scholarships for the staff will be done in 2017, to continue the positive experience of  the first year. Thanks to the experience done by the staff in September 2016, an interschool  CLIL Team has been created at ITCG Pasini. \r\nThe leading school, Pasini, has created a CLIL project that includes the other schools of the consortium and a local Liceo Scientifico (a High School for Science and Maths). The project was one of the two winners (D.D. Miur 1433-22/12/16-Azione A2) in a competition promoted by the Italian Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR d.m.663/2016-art.29). It aims at creating innovative E-CLIL learning laboratories with the use of ICT. \r\nThis very important result has a great impact on the whole mobility project and it encourages the schools to promote the mobility of the staff and to foster the activities of language training for teachers (with an increase of + 20% of language certifications next year). \r\nThe language certifications (B1-B2-C1) of the students will increase too (+ 13%), this result will be reached thanks to promotion inside the schools, an increase of the number of language courses, school grants  for the certification exams (whose total amount has been so far  paid for by the students\u2019 families), the participation to the call of the Regione Veneto MOVE 4.0 POR-FSE for language studies abroad which  aims at making the students get the language certification. \r\nIn order to reinforce and improve language skills, the schools will promote activities with mother tongue teachers (115 hours), one language assistant of the project EduChange will be involved, language study holidays during the summer and school trips abroad will be organized, the project Smarter English will be implemented (a week of full immersion in the English language with activities held by mother tongue teachers for about 150 students). \r\nThe internationalization strategy  will be pursued with activities organized with local and foreign partners, through actions taken by each school:  Exchange Program with two German VET Schools (Marzotto e De Pretto with about 25 incoming students and 25 outcoming students); short training periods for 10 Polish students (at Marzotto and Chilesotti)  Erasmus+ VET coming from the foreign partner who is a host partner in this project too; in case the projects, submitted in the different countries, will be approved some mechatronics students coming from (BG and CZ ) will do a short period of training at De Pretto, and others  of  a textile course from Brno-CZ will do the same at Marzotto. The activities to promote Intercultura will continue; three students have already left for the USA where they will be staying for a year, however no prevision of this type of mobility is possible.

Internationalization is a beacon for Tradium, and it is included in the strategic, tactical and operational levels. In 2012, Tradium was recognized with the international prize for our international engagement.  After the changes following OK13 and EUD reform in 2015, we have been concerned about the development within international activities, for example, mobility projects (timewise, resources as well as structural). Luckily, our experience is that many of our departments have made a priority to implement mobility projects. Within our vocational education, it is now typical that our EUX students in the beginning of their education and training, as well as our school internship students have had the opportunity to use the mobility grants to travel to one of our partner schools. After the restructuring of the vocational educations, it has been assessed that the options of mobility projects has been more constricted. With the agreement of OK13 the costs have been more considerably higher than before. Our upper secondary education continues to make mobility grants a priority.  We are applying for mobility grants altogether for 132 students, 22 accompaying persons and 19 staff. Our total mobility activity will continue to be high, albeit at a lower level than before. A large majority of our mobility\u2019s are planned for implementation for the school year 2016/2017. The mobility grants we are applying for regarding school year 2017/2018 are for the educations that thru the years have completed mobility exchanges and/or where we have a partnership with another school (MoU).Our mobility grants from 2014 are at the moment nearly used up (1 student grant left, and 2 grants for staff) These 3 mobility grants are expected to be completed in spring 2016.From mobility project 2015 at the moment there are 75 mobility grants planned (out of 164), and 9 (out of 26) mobility grants for staff are under planning.All previous mobility grants have been used up 100% except for one project from 2013, where we with a mistake hadn\u2019t requested the transfer of mobility grants from accompanying person to mobility of students (but just did it in reality) this resulted in a non-approval of that part of our mobility project.  We are applying for accompanying persons because a great part of our students are relatively young (under 18 yrs. old), and for many of these students this is the first time meeting professionals from the business community. The staff comes from all parts of the school, and the people in charge of education in the businesses. Implementation of mobility grants will happen in connection with the attached MoU/LoI. There will be greater focus on learning outcomes of our students, for example by incorporating Learning Agreements describing a specific students learning outcomes assessed by the partner school. We will continue to use Europass Mobility documents to recognize the competences the participants have gained on the mobility.  Affects for students:This project will help increase the student\u2019s language, international and intercultural competences. Especially vocational educational students have had a limited global outlook, which has made it hard for them to interact in an international environment. With this project, it will make it easier to compete with other students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX participants, there is the need for a practical approach to the otherwise theoretical education. The internship part of their mobility adds this dimension. Afterwards it is expected that most of these students will have a better chance for employment in a globalized work place. These students can also be a model for other students and inspire them to participate in a mobility project in another country. Expected effect on staff/institution:\u2022 Staff/leaders gain language, international and intellectual competences so that our institution can give our students better support in regards to their own mobility. \u2022 Our staff will receive a specific pedagogical and/or skills advancement in their field. \u2022 Teachers will gain new inspiration for their teaching methods and pedagogical methods and tools. \u2022 Leaders/executives will gain new competences around the building up of education systems and inspiration on how to tackle future challenges (EUDs attractiveness, counseling, absence, working together with the labour market, rationalization, digitalization and more).The results of these mobility projects at a minimum will be evaluated and discussed in their respective departments, for example in relation to teacher meetings. The results will be discussed in other areas outside of the respective departments for example in relation to experience group meetings, together with other schools, press activity, Facebook, and/or blogs.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA102-022089_8"], [2018, "EUX-Business, prepare for the future", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 192463.0, 2, 5, "The consortium has worked strategically with internationalization for many years. The cooperation shows that the mobility projects assist the students in determining their choice of education as well as retaining them at college and ensuring they exploit their full learning potential. The strategic goal of the consortium for the period 2015-2020 is to increase the coherence between the topics English and cross-cultural understanding in our international activities.\r\n\r\nVocational Education and Training Programme (EUX):\r\nAn important part of the project is to increase the activities, and consequently EUX-Business apply for 45 mobilities for the period 2018-2019 and another 45 mobilities for 2019-2020. During the past two years, we have developed a programme together with Intuition London and City College Brighton where the curriculum has been transferred into a British context focusing on the topics Cross-cultural Studies and Marketing. The programme meets the learning objectives for the two topics as defined by the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the students will be working with practical assignments and cases, just as they will be cooperating with students from Barnet & Southgate College and Brighton City College respectively. In addition to this, they will be doing one week of training in local companies. The progression of the programme will be accelerated through the shift between theory and practical assignments in a foreign context and a foreign language.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the mobility project is to encourage students to train abroad, for instance via the Training Abroad Programme. The Europe 2020 Strategy dictates, \u201cbefore 2020 an average of at least 6 per cent of the 18 to 34 years\u2019 olds who have completed the basic VET programme must have studies or trained (including outplacements) at least two weeks or less if documented by a Europass\u201d. The mobility is placed during the students\u2019 second year to ensure that they can prepare, integrate and process the competences acquired abroad are projected in their future studies, exams, and search for apprenticeship positions as well as encouraging lifelong learning and mobility.\r\nAt the moment, the consortium is not planning to take on incoming mobility. The implementation of the new VET reforms is extremely time consuming and the consortium is under the impression that it will cause great difficulties finding British students who match the theoretical levels of the EUX, and we must ensure the quality of the mobility projects before taking on incoming mobility.\r\n\r\nThe Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX):\r\nAfter many years of experience from VET in acquiring language skills and cross-cultural understanding, AABC now wishes to extend the Erasmus+ programme to include the HHX. Consequently, we apply for two flows of 25 students for three-week mobilities in Brighton in cooperation with Greater Brighton Metropolitan College (GBMC); 25 mobilities for the period 2018 to 2019 and 25 mobilities for the period 2019 to 2020. These students, all of great academic potential, have chosen the Global Marketing Programme at AABC where topics such as Marketing and International Economics are taught in English. At GBMC,  theory will be supported by at least one week of training in relevant, local companies, thus increasing the students\u2019 language skills, cross-cultural understanding and insight. The practical and real-life work experiences constitute the core of the academic progression during the mobility as well as after where it will be included in classes back in Denmark. \r\n \r\nThe mobility projects at EUX-Business and HHX increase the focus on internationalisation among faculty at the colleges and when students return to college with a new and larger perspective, faculty competences must be developed too. Therefore, we wish to extend the period the accompanying teachers usually stay in London and Brighton to cover the entire period of the mobilities, i.e., teachers staying end to end, one week at the time, rather than a couple of days as in previous years. Faculty will be there to support our students, and will also participate in classes, and visit students when they are training in companies. This will boost the language skills of our faculty and develop their cross-cultural competences, which they can implement in classes upon their return to Denmark, thus contributing to emphasizing the international perspective of our programmes.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA116-046933_1"], [2016, "CPH WEST/KTS - a merge of mobilities", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 144547.0, 6, 10, "The central project goal needs to be considered as a part of the school\u2019s internationalization strategy.

This opportunity provides a chance for many students to develop their personal competencies as well and, perhaps, to get the motivation to go abroad for even longer periods later in their educations. CPH WEST as an institution will create a clear international profile that will make a difference.  Also, the school\u2019s high prioritization of internationalizing students helps to strengthen their professional profiles, as well as their personal and intercultural competencies.   For the second time, we include ECVET in our mobility project.This involves the prepared \u201dMemorandum of Understanding\u201d, which is signed by our partners and us and is attached to this application.We have also attached our \u201dLearning Agreement\u201d form, which we will use to formalize the commitment of our partner, the student and us in connection with the forthcoming mobility initiatives.Learning Outcome will be agreed upon in advance in each circumstance and attached to the \u201cLearning Agreement\u201d document.Which competencies students will obtain in the course of each mobility initiative will be drawn up in a \u201cTranscript of Records\u201d and attached to the student\u2019s EuroPass Mobility certificate.This application covers:   54   VET student work programs   14   HG student work programs 100  HG-EUX student language and work programs   24   HHX and HTX student language and work programs  15    accompanying teachersWe expect programs to run during the entire project period, as we also expect to incorporate programs in different European countries. The needs and wishes of individual students are considered in determining destinations. Most often, students  have a good idea of where they can be challenged appropriately and obtain relevant professional inspiration.  This project is expected to strengthen the school\u2019s international work. The participation of more people in training abroad will set greater focus on internationalization in general. The level of professional language abilities will also increase. Students will be expected to have a more international profile and use their newly obtained knowledge in their educations.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA102-022068_3"], [2016, "Preparing for the futur", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 125029.0, 2, 4, "Our colleges have worked strategically with internationalisation for many years. The cooperation shows that the mobility projects assist the students in determining their choice of education as well as retaining them at college. The strategic goal of the consortium for 2015-2020 is to increase the international activities, and we are applying for 35 student mobilities in 2016-2017 and 50 in 2017-2018. However, as a result of recent reforms of VET, the quality has to meet the new learning objectives defined by the Ministry. We are developing a programme together with Intuition London (copy enclosed) where the Danish curriculum is transferred to a British context focusing on Cross-cultural Studies and Marketing. Apart from the curriculum, students will be working on practical assignments, cases and cooperating with British students from Barnet & Southgate College and Brighton City College respectively, just as they will be doing one week of training in companies in London or Brighton. An important part of the mobility project is to encourage students\u2019 to train abroad, for instance through the Work Placement Abroad Programmme. The Europe 2020 strategy dictates that \u2018before 2020 an average of at least 6 per cent of the 18 to 34 years\u2019 olds who have completed the basic VET programme  must have studied or trained (including outplacements) at least two weeks or less if documented by a Europas\u2019. The mobility is placed during the students\u2019 second year to ensure that they can prepare, integrate and process the competences achieved during the mobility project in their further studies and training.  Experience shows that the competences acquired abroad are projected in their future studies, exams and search for apprenticeships as well as encourages lifelong learning and mobility. At the moment, the consortium is not planning to take on incoming mobility. The implementation of the new VET reforms is extremely time consuming and the consortium does not wish to put any further work pressure on the colleges.  We need to ensure that quality of the mobility projects before taking on incoming mobility.  The mobility projects increase the focus on internationalisation within the colleges and when students return to college with a new and larger perspective, staff competences must be developed too. Therefore, we wish to send 2 teachers 2 weeks at the time, one after the other, to the destinations, rather than just a couple of days as in previous years. The teachers will support our students during the entire stay, but will also participate in classes and visit students during the work training. This way, the teachers will develop their English profiency and gain new cross-cultural competences which they can implement in their classes upon their return and thereby assist in raising the bar of international perspective of vocational education.With regard to internationalization, Aarhus Business College and Tietgen cooperate strategically with Aalborg Handelsskole (AH), including curriculum, couse contents and preperation of students. As AH still has not have a Charter, AH applies for mobility funding on their own.Due to the increased focus on staff competences we are applying for 8 staff mobilities, 6 at the Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) and 2 at the main course of VET. At HHX, many students wish to improve the possibility of being admitted into one of the international profiles at a Danish University or to a University abroad. To meet this demand, HHX has developed a new profile Global Marketing where Marketing and Cross-cultural Studies are being taught in English. Year 2013 graduate this summer and next year, HHX will be boasting six classes of this very popular profile. Therefore, teachers\u2019 linguistic skills and proficiency, cultural insight and understanding of the labour market in a European and global context are vital.  Teachers in Marketing and Cross-cultural Studies often hold an MA in Economics, European Studies, History of Ideas etc. and are familiar with the English terminology, but their proficiency is lacking.  The purpose of offering this group of teachers English courses is the ensure that they gain the English proficiency required to teach at the level defined by the Ministry. The Main Course of VET has signed a contract with the Danish transport company DSV that wished to offer their European trainees the same education within Shipping as their Danish trainees. The teachers all have a background within shipping and they too are familiar with the English terminology within their field, but need to improve their English proficiency.", "http://www.gbmc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022148_2"], [2017, "Forlagt undervisning til fremme af sproglige og interkulturelle kompetencer.", "Greater Brighton Metropolitan College", 66804.0, 2, 2, "We would like to apply for Erasmus+ fundings again this year, as we have experienced the huge impact this project has had on many of our former students. \r\nMany of our students have never been abroad, and it's a fantastic possibility for them to learn about the British and reflect to themselves and Denmark.

Learning outside the school expands through internationalization to \u201cthe classroom beyond the borders of our country\u201d. Hersleb has in its strategic plan goals about increased activity within internationalization. The goal for the project is both to recruit students for health- and youth studies, reputation management and to give the students an edge in the competition for jobs. The project will create academic motivation and increase the width in educational training. The students must compete to participate after decided criteria, and this will have a positive effect regarding less absence and reduce the risk of quitting school. They will develop independency and maturity through taking choices and mastering new situations. They will experience respect for other countries\u2019 vocational training and see forces about their own education. The meeting between participants in the project creates new networks where leaders, teachers and students get new insight and professional input. Friendship between students across the country borders and meeting with other cultures involves increasing tolerance and equality. It prevents racism and prejudice. Many of the school\u2019s students are minority speakers, and the students have a lot of experience from different languages and cultures, and this is a resource in the international cooperation. Internationalization gives the health- and youth studies more attention and status. Hersleb high school has good experiences with exchange within health- and youth studies including Finland, Spain (Erasmus+) and Germany (Do it!). The academic dividend for the participants has been great both professionally and socially, something the rest of the organization benefits from. Further, internationalization has created new friendships and good cohesion between colleagues which still is safeguarded. The school\u2019s management represented by the headmaster has the main responsibility for the project application, and the department manager for the health- and youth studies is the contact. The department manager has had the main responsibility for internationalization through several years and has participated at many courses directed by SIU. In addition, the operations of the projects are organized by experienced coordinators. The school has built a network which gives the projects a quality assurance and makes them predictable.
