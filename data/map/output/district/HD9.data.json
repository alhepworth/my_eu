Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_38"], [2015, "Sustainable Student and Staff Mobility", "No Repeat Consultancy LTD", 166986.0, 16, 36, "International contacts of Savo Consortium for Education are very important to students, the staff and the region. Needs for internationalisation in the North Savo region and its companies are recognised. Consortium\u2019s strategic actions for 2015-2016 comprise extended work-based learning and developing international skills needed in the working life.  \r\nThe primary objective of the project Sustainable Student and Staff Mobility (SUMO) is to increase the number of students and staff mobilities, as well as assure the quality of mobilities by following the principles of ECVET. The crosscutting theme of the project is to increase competence for sustainable development among students and teachers. Furthermore, this project aims to enhance understanding of working life among educational staff and support their occupational competencies. \r\nSavo Consortium for Education (Savo Vocational College) is one of the largest providers of vocational secondary education in Finland (approx. 5700 students, teacher and support service staff approx. 950). The beneficiaries of the project comprise 210 students in initial vocational education and 46 vocational teachers. During the project, 202 students carry out a 2-10 week on-the-job training period and 8 students participate in a 3-week study period abroad. \r\nInternational coordinators, liaison teachers and vocational teachers inform students of the project and take care of the selection and preparation of students. Cross-sectoral and sectoral vocational preparation, support for sustainability assignment and cultural preparation of 1-3 competence points is provided. Students learn languages by themselves, by attending to language lessons at summer school, by taking part in online language preparation offered by Commission, by choosing courses from core subjects or studying in the target country. \r\nProject members have had a long and successful cooperation over the years. Partners' obligations and liabilities are recorded in the Memorandum of Understanding agreements. Details concerning on-the-job-learning periods are recorded in the Learning Agreements. Workplace instructor will support, give feedback, and assess the student. Student will keep a learning diary and receive feedback on the learning process from his tutoring teacher. A feedback discussion will be held after period abroad. Coordinator will check that student has taken care of all obligations. Knowledge, skills and competencies will be recognised and recorded.\r\nStaff mobility periods are mainly job shadowing. Staff members selected to mobility periods usually work as on-the-job learning tutors for leaving and incoming students. During mobility period they support students abroad, find new partners and negotiate on cooperation. Content of Staff training period can also be organised by of networks.\r\nProject and its results will be disseminated internally, locally, to networks and externally using e.g. local newspapers, Internet, and Facebook. Students will tell about their experiences to their peers in social media.\r\nThe project will have remarkable results and impacts. Students learn new professional skills, communication skills, critical thinking and new things about the culture and language of the target country. They become more independent, gain self-confidence and courage. An on-the-job-learning period abroad may contribute to a workplace. An international co-operation supports also lifelong learning of teachers participating in the project, leads to new international contacts and increases collegial collaboration. The project increases teachers\u2019 international skills, increases their enthusiasm towards the development of their own field of expertise and has a positive impact on their professional growth. In addition, the project improves the co-operation of vocational schools and companies in Europe and meets the demand of enterprises of Northern Savo, Finland for technical staff able to work in an international working environment. The project supports the integration of mobility in the qualifications and increases the attractiveness of vocational education. With the student and staff mobilities, good practices related to the provision of education, student assessment and recognition and validation of learning outcomes become more known in organizations, which improves remarkably the quality of the on-the-job-learning periods abroad, the transparency of the exams, and the quality of vocational education as a whole.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008764_18"], [2016, "Coaching Professionals for the Future", "No Repeat Consultancy LTD", 130664.0, 16, 25, "International co-operation plays a strong role in Savo consortium's operations. International contacts of Savo Consortium are essential for students, staff as well as for the companies of the whole Savo region. The key goals during the consortium's latest strategy period  include developing internationally valid skills for working life and adding possibilities for learning at work.   Coaching Professionals for the Future, PROFF, is a student and staff mobility project for all study fields of Savo consortium. Its goals lie in the consortium's operational plan for international issues. The PROFF goals are  1) to provide students and staff with high-quality mobility periods by improved pre-coaching and on-site guidance  2) to improve ways of assessing and validating both informal learning and life-long learning skills gained via mobilities 3) to enhance staff's internationally valid skills and knowledge of working life and develop on-site guidance methods  Except for increasing quality, PROFF aims to add volume of study and on-the-job learning periods of students and volume of staff's work periods.The quality of student mobilities is improved by new pre-coaching material and methods for living abroad and by building an equal consortium-wide system. PROFF coaching seeks to  provide students with essential basic knowledge of host country's culture and vital language skills to manage successfully their daily and working life situations as well as with field-specific skills.     PROFF offers mobility periods for 313 students which cover 2-10 weeks of studies or on-the-job learning in 16 countries. Students are in the basic vocational education of various fields at Savo vocational college. In general, mobility periods are taken part of in the final phase of the education. Each mobility period has its own contents and goals according to student's needs. For students with special needs PROFF offers shorter options of 2 weeks.  The students benefit from personal support of an attending teacher or a work tutor or optionally of practical nurse students during their mobility periods. PROFF's work placement periods range from 4 to 10 weeks and school-based study periods from 3 to 4 weeks. Consortium's partner schools offer international study modules that were created in various partner projects such as Automobility, EMEU, Transmobility, one2one. On-the job learning is included in these study modules.    PROFF is applying 49 staff mobilities for improving Savo consortium staff's international competences. The project develops pre-coaching of staff and methods for benefitting from new skills and competences gained abroad. PROFF targets to add knowledge and awareness concerning ECVET system including assessment and validation through all the study fields of the vocational college.   A staff mobility period comprises of a working period which adds to person's own professional or field-specific competences or of a shorter visit period at the on-the-job learning place of students for instruction or evaluation (job-shadowing). During these periods participants concentrate on assessing life-long learning skills  and the periods range from 3 -5 days' job shadowing periods to 1 or 2 weeks' working periods.   PROFF enables vocational students to gain professional, cultural and communicative skills giving strong sense of independence, self-reliance and braveness. Mobility periods upgrade and update students' skills and competences when starting a career or seeking a further educational path. PROFF fortifies staff readiness for international challenges, inspires to develop their professional field and increases international contacts and collegial co-operation. Best practices to provide education, evaluate students, to assess and validate learning outcomes can be profited by more and more organizations in the future.

Aventus believes that for the next few years it is of great importance to cooperate with European partners by using ECVET instruments to create more clarity about the learning outcomes of international work placements and to get to a fitting assessment system for them. In order to do this Aventus is an active member of both formal and informal networks that are based on  \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d. Aventus aims at exchanging expertise, experiences and best practices as to assessment and validation of professional tasks during international work placements of students, innovations and tested recipes to complicated educational issues together with its partners within these networks.

The effect for the students will be that the professional as well as the personal learning goals like \u201cself reliance\u201d and the status as a Europan Citizen, in which cultural differences are recognized and accepted. The effect for the entire partnership is that in determining a fitting international work placement the current curriculum, the job profiles and the connection to the European labour market will be reviewed. Both Aventus and the participating students will be stimulated to invest into flexibility of the work force, so that European citizenship also gets a wider European labour perspective. In designing the \u201cProfessional Orientation\u201d international work placements the main focus will be on determining how the connection between current curriculum and foreign language learning can be made. The effect for the corporate world lies in extending their own European network by participating in the EUROEX project and reciprocal projects of Aventus\u2019 European partners and getting to know new, sometimes innovative approaches.
