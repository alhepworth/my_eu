First and foremost, businesses set up by re-starters grow faster than first timers in terms of turnover and jobs created (Stam, Audretsch, Meijaard 2006; Enterprise Europe Network), and approximately one fifth of all successful business people failed first time round.  Secondly, most of the time, business failure is not due to the incompetence of the entrepreneurs.  Thirdly, there is a lot of evidence to show that Europeans as a whole are relatively risk-averse, especially compared to countries such as the USA. In Germany e.g. only 1-2% of new companies per year are founded by second chance entrepreneurs (see KfW-Gr\u00fcndungsmonitor 2013) and the World Bank recently critiqued Poland for its failure to understand the value of second chance entrepreneurs as manifested in its particularly onerous liquidiation procedures (Devictor, 2013).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEU Enterprise and Employment strategy already contains numerous references to second chance policies. However, until now this concept is almost completely absent from VET provision. Research shows that second chance entrepreneurs have different support and information needs than first time entrepreneurs (Melle-Wigt 2006, Kay 2004, Siegel 2006) but HEI & VET providers continue to offer a uniform service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHence, the principal innovative contribution of this project will be to kickstart the development of a comprehensive and integrated international approach to second chance entrepreneurs by constructing tailormade training and support for them and mainstreaming it across relevant stakeholders at regional level.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to do so we will firstly create three Regional \u201cSecond Chance Entrepreneurs Alliances\u201d.  This new strategy involves bringing together stakeholders in enterprise education and economic development - such as Universities and Colleges, VET providers, Enterprise Development Agencies, Local Governments, Banks, and Chambers of Commerce - to jointly contribute to sustainable cultural and institutional change towards business failure.  This will be achieved in a \u201ctop down\u201d strategy via dialogue, exchange of best practice and construction of a common agenda for action. This type of Alliance has never been used before in Europe and once stakeholders are aware of the changes needed, they will be in a position to work together, pooling resources to make effective and cost effective improvements in services.   We will systematize the process and lessons learned in the form of a SEAL Toolkit, which will be published and actively promoted as a means of replicating the Alliances in other regions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a first concrete outcome of the collaboration espoused by the Alliance, we will then develop, test, publish and promote a dynamic \u201cValue of Failure Enterprise\u201d training course directly targeted at graduates and second chance entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the content of the course itself will be innovative: \r\n\r\n- It closes the gaps between information needs and existing support infrastructures\r\n\r\n- It is based on innovative pedagogic strategies and learning approaches such as the flipped classroom model, improved learner integration and the story-based learning approach. \r\n\r\n- It is based on the principle of collaboration for mutual advantage \r\n\r\n- It promotes innovation through fostering the chance of successful re-starts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOF is delivered by a cross-sectoral partnership led by University Szczecin (Poland), known for its commitment to collaboration as a means to pursuing excellence.

Therefore professionals working with these groups constantly seek for new knowledge, skills and approaches to be able to empower them in a most effective way.  The StoryTeller project therefore proposes a traditional but still very innovative psycho-social approach of STORYTELLING, that has proven to be highly beneficial in empowering a wide variety of final beneficiaries, contributing to their social inclusion and active citizenship. However, through implementation of the previous RSRC project and preliminary analysis, undertaken by partners, a lack of formal educational modules in the area of storytelling in Europe, as well as lack of professional VET curricula has been recognised. Thus this project proposes a development of a professional freely available (on-line) VET training for the continuing education (C-VET) in 6 partner languages, and initiation of its certification by National VET certification bodies in all partner countries aiming at enhancing access to training and qualifications across Europe.PARTICIPANTSThe project involves 7 partners from 6 EU countries.

It aims to initiate growth of newly skilled professional storytellers, that will be able to empower as many disadvantaged people as possible through their every day practice, and thus promote their social inclusion.Project activities will be implemented through 7 Work Packages (WPs), resulting in 5 Intelectual Outputs (O1-5), 13 Multiplier Events (E1-13), and 1 Teaching/Training activity (C1):>O1: Compendium of storytelling trainings and certifications initiatives>O2: StoryTeller C-VET Curriculum>O3: StoryTeller Universal Methodology>O4:On-line Interactive StoryTeller Platform>O5: Business & Provision Plan with a map of National VET Accreditation Bodies, Systems and possibilities, 5 National Accreditation Procedures Initiated, Recommendations for decision makers>E1-12: National Multiplier Seminars (2 per country, >240 participants)>E13: Final International Conference (Austria, >55 participants)>C1: Train-the-Trainer event (UK, app. 20 trainees, 3 trainers, 5 disadvantaged)> National Pilot project experiences in 5 \u00bbless-equipped\u00ab partner countriesIMPACTThe project is expected to have a multifaceted impact:1.)

Communities are in transition, and not only through migration. Citizens are obliged to become more self-sufficient. These are changes and challenges not easily accepted and dealt with. \r\n\r\nSuccessful initiatives depend on factors such as trust, sharing emotions, recognising and accepting differences. If cohesion and progress are the objectives, then storytelling delivers the tools and also creates engagement and compassion. Stories of shared values, shared plans and more equality provide the best examples for all that. The most successful story expressing this is democracy.\r\n\r\nResearch by the IMF has shown that collaboration and more equality are favourable to economic growth. A longitudinal research by anthropologist Bruce Gibb revealed the importance of a balance between efficiency and resilience, hierarchy and equality and the sharing of stories for sustainable communities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project\r\n\r\nWith the project \u2018Raising Strong and resilient Communities\u2019 the consortium wants to develop a set of educational tools that can be used in adult education (with a focus on non-formal adult education) focussing on active citizenship and participation. These tools are based on existing and the further expansion of developed approaches, theories and methods of storytelling. \r\n\r\nThese tools are a teacher/ trainer manual, structured courses for adult educators, and a collection of videos/ audio recordings to showcase best practices and function as instruction videos.\r\n\r\nThe tools will be developed around the development of competences of cooperation and communication in differing communities, between various \u2018divides\u2019, such as intergenerational, intercultural, etc in order for learners to actively engage in local community work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovative aspect of this project is that it aims at training and facilitating community educators to work with concrete narrative methods (e.g. Participatory Narrative Inquiry, Participatory Learning in Action, Community & network Mapping), guidelines and courses to help communities coping with present AND imagined and feasible FUTURE situations. \r\n\r\nOn an individual basis that means changing the attitude, the negative discourse of the individual and the lingering in (dominating) stories of the past. \r\n\r\nThe project will thus support planning a future for communities with concrete actions taken for future-proofing, inspired and carried by a community story that will lead to participation, collaboration, and in the end to a positive change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partnership\r\n\r\nSVF has experience with supporting development and education of diverse communities (rural, urban, young adults) and the implementation of storytelling. \r\n\r\nStorybag  has a background in communication, marketing strategy, design, writing and a broad knowledge and experience of all facets of storytelling (research, workshops and training). \r\n\r\nIn Dialogue has a vast experience in developing methods and tools, training and courses, out of theoretical concepts, towards specific target groups in the field of narrative coaching. \r\n\r\nOzara has a long experience in training, education and employment support of disabled groups (social inclusion, self-esteem) and a strong analytical background. \r\n\r\nCzechDesk serves NGOs and volunteer networks (e.g. rural areas who need to connect with the digital age) and is experienced in developing handbooks and training.\r\n\r\nP6 (Fundacia Centrul Soros) is involved in the support and education / training of communities in remote rural areas with a need for language education and development of tourism.\r\n\r\nCeres has a long history of working with community and volunteer groups, a strong affinity with (heritage) storytelling and offers experience and skills in digital media. \r\n\r\nAccoglieRete) is an enthusiastic organisation concentrating on the education and training of tutors for volunteers working with young migrants to help them integrate. \r\n\r\nCluturex) is involved in the support of regional tourism, the creation of heritage awareness and the importance of stories and taking it further with educational and training materials. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact of this project\r\n\r\nWe will have trained non formal (adult) educators, volunteers and others involved in community collaboration, communication and well-being through a process that enables them to acquire new skills of listening, understanding and support communities in the 'reconstruction' of their past, present and future.

The number of young people in employment has fallen by three times more than that for adults and with 7.5 million young Europeans between 15 and 24 not employed, not in education and not in training (NEETs), the trend looks set to continue.\r\n\r\nYouth Organisations have been long identified as having a pivotal role in reversing this trend.
