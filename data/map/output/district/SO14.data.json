This movement, regarding the construction of high-rise timber buildings is transnational and is being implemented in the EU and worldwide, for example in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the USA. However, education in high-rise timber construction is still very limited, especially in Europe. \r\nMost HEIs in the EU, that have technical degrees in design, construction and materials for high-rise buildings have curricular implementing the studies of concrete and steel, being prefabricated or manufactured on site. Normally education in construction from timber focuses on 1 to 2 storey timber buildings (one family houses, etc.). However, architects and engineering companies already working on high-rise timber buildings of up to 16 stories high. Thus there is an urgent need to educate students with innovative applied skills needed in this area at the undergraduate degree level.\r\nThe wider objective of this project is to develop a trans-disciplinary and transnational course/ elective element in the EU HEIs in the design, construction and management of sustainable high-rise timber buildings in order to enhance the quality and relevance of students\u2019 knowledge and skills for future labour market needs. \r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n1) To strategically research at which level sustainable design, construction and management of high-rise timber buildings are to be planned and implemented in the partner countries.\r\n2) To educate all participants (students, teachers, entrepreneurs) in the field of the sustainability and the emerging global problems.  \r\n3) To develop and implement the new strategic trans-disciplinary module/elective element, which meets the needs of the HEIs and market representatives, fulfills the future challenges of sustainable design and construction of high-rise timber buildings.\r\n4) To improve competencies of students and teachers in problem solving and team work, innovative thinking, motivation, awareness of cross-professional project input and project management by using project-based learning approach.\r\n5) To ensure open awareness of the project results to local, national, EU level and international target groups.\r\nWorking in international in multidisciplinary groups, participants will increase their knowledge, motivation and obtain a wider view of today\u2019s rapidly growing environmental problems, facing our planet for example green-house gas emissions, carbon and ecological foot printing calculations, as a background to explain why the use of sustainable timber in high-rise buildings and constructions is important for the future world-wide construction industry.\r\nTeaching staff of universities will enhance competences on innovative module development and teaching strategies, by taking part in intensive trainings, workshops, development of intellectual outputs. They will learn about most challenging issues on design, construction and management of high-rise timber buildings and will use their knowledge and skills for future activities.\r\nNew module will be jointly developed by academic staff and business enterprises.

The industry is regulated by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN specialised agency for maritime affairs. IMO is aware that over 80% of the reported accidents and incidents at sea and in ports are due to human errors (IMO, 2012, Horner, 2014) and over 30% of these accidents are due to linguistic and communications mistakes (Ziarati, 2006, Trekner, 2010). \r\nSince its inception the IMO has recognized the importance of human resources for the development of the maritime industry. Following the adoption of the revised International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) in 2010 a number of IMO member states suggested that IMO should develop model training courses to assist with the implementation of the Convention and in achieving a more rapid transfer of information and skills regarding new developments in maritime industry and technology. In addition, there was a consensus that a comprehensive set of short model courses in the various fields of maritime training would supplement the instruction provided by maritime academies. Model courses would also allow administrators and technical specialists already employed in maritime administrations, ports and shipping companies to improve their knowledge and skills in certain specialised fields. It interesting that IMO has adopted different set of language requirements for different types and rank of seafarers and has referred to EU MarTEL standards but as added three new categories to MarTEL seafarer classification namely, Electro-Technical Officers, GMDSS radio operators and for personnel providing direct service to passengers in passenger spaces on passenger ships\r\nLanguage and communication are fundamental elements of the shipping sector, especially with Maritime English being the language of the sea.  The IMO approved the newly revised Model Course 3.17 for Maritime English in January 2015. This will lead to adaptations and updates of existing academic programmes requiring alignment with the IMO-approved revisions. In devising the course IMO has made references to  EU funded projects such as MarTEL, MarTEL Plus, MarEng and MarEngPlus as well as SeaTALK.\r\nIMO states that (http://www.marifuture.org/Reports/Development-Papers/IMO_New_Model_Course_Maritime_English.pdf) because educational systems and the cultural backgrounds of trainees in maritime subjects vary considerably from country to country, the model course material has been designed to identify the basic entry requirements and there are no mechanisms for controlling the variation of the output from such courses. To remove the acknowledged variation this proposal aims to develop a new set of assessment standards for the IMO\u2019s revised Model Course 3.17 for Maritime English and include the three new categories of seafarers into the existing standards.  The project will use the results of recent EU-funded projects to produce a combined learning and assessment package with clear sign posts to existing materials available Europe-wide.\r\nThe project will develop an e-learning and e-assessment package for up-skilling seafarers and one that will grow in importance as e-learning becomes more widely implemented now that the IMO has recognised its validity in the recent IMO 2010 STCW amendments. \r\nThe new assessment standards will not only be in-line with the newly revised model course 3.17 Maritime English, but be linked with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).\r\nSetting common standards for assessment with training programmes directly linked to the CEFR, ECVET compliant, will ensure students and seafarers can learn and work throughout Europe, through the application of common content and assessment. This will help seafarers to be mobile, and have a greater access to job opportunities and career progression across Europe and the world. A number of studies (OECD, 2010, European Commission, 2011 and  BIMCO, 2005, 2010), have demonstrated there is an imbalance of seafarers in different EU countries. With the language of the sea being English, this imbalance could be addressed through the development of a new set of assessment standards for Maritime English.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA202-002518_6"], [2016, "Avoiding Collisions at Sea Plus", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", 264989.0, 6, 8, "The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREGs) are a set of rules to avoid collisions at sea. However a study undertaken by Acar et al (2011) showed that almost 50% of seafarers disregard/ignore the COLREGs at sea. This is supported by recent MARS and MAIB case law (UK accident agencies), which indicate that many of the principles of collision avoidance are improperly applied, particularly relating to the more complex rules or complex real-life situations (Ziarati et al, 2015 - http://www.marifuture.org/Reports/Development-Papers/ADP_11_2015_MARIFUTURE.pdf). Collisions remain a major source of accidents at sea resulting in serious injuries and loss of life and property. EMSA'a 2014 Accident Review found that between 2011-2013 in the category of 'accidents with a ship' collisions were the second leading cause of accidents resulting in serious injuries.  It was accepted that there will be no changes to the COLREGs in the short-medium future when the International Maritime Lecturers Association made its position supporting the COLREGs clear in its June 2014 Newsletter. where it stated that \"COLREG specific\" accidents can be attributed to \"the unsatisfactory results of maritime training\".Seeing the severity of this issue, along with the target of zero collisions in the EU's R&D framework (Horizon 2014) research has been carried out during the ACTS project (2013-15) to identify training needs, resulting the ACTS+ project aims:1.

Background of project  - A global approach for the development of energy efficiency systems including an effective emission control is led by the IMO on account of the continued rapid growth of the world trade in the maritime transport.  (IMO2012).  According to GL (2012), IMO has mandated certain measures related to energy efficiency in international shipping as listed below: Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) which mandates energy efficiency standards for new ships; Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) to provide a tool for measuring the ship\u2019s fuel efficiency in operation and monitor the effect of any variations e.g. more frequent propeller cleaning or improved voyage planning or introduction of technical measures such as a new propeller or waste heat recovery systems; and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), a management tool for ship owners. These three standards came into force on January 1, 2013 within a new chapter of MARPOL Annex VI. Complex technologies will be involved in building a ship efficiency system by the marine suppliers since as stated earlier the life expectancy of vessels is estimated to be around 30 to 40 years and also of the mandatory regulations to be met as set by IMO (Oceana 2013).\r\n\r\nWhat? Objectives - Currently there is no standard for the proposed role of the Energy Manager as proposed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). This project proposes the development of an energy managers job specification and a training programme for it specifically for the shipping industry to be able to continually improve its energy management on board ships with the view to save energy, reduce pollution and to improve the overall quality of energy management.  The intention is also to encourage shipping companies to seek ISO 50000 certification.  The expectation is to develop a specification and a training programme for the newly established ship energy managers helping to develop tailor-made arrangements for more efficient use of energy on board ships and their interactions with ports in line with the Energy Management System of ISO 50000.  This would allow setting targets and objectives, with a requirement to monitor use of energy and to assess how well the proposed arrangements are effective on pilot basis. Maritime is a transnational sector and it is important to bring in partners which have knowledge of ship types, ship propulsion, ship navigation, energy production, electrical and mechanical parts and circuitry, safety issues, national certification, accreditation and validation of learning materials, pedagogical aspects of learning and last but by no means least online application.\r\n\r\nWho? Number and profile of participants \u2013 the partnership is composed on an organisation (C4FF) with unique knowledge of energy production and engine emissions, the project manager has considerable experience of job specification and training programme development and their validation and recognition internationally.  C4FF is supported in the UK by one of the two major universities (SSU) with considerable experience of developing and offering high quality maritime programmes and as a university is an awarding body in itself. The university will work closely with professional bodies and relevant training boards and licensing authorities to ensure the specification and its associated training programme will receive the recognition intended.  C4FF and SSU are supported by four Maritime Education and Training (MET) providers (SUAS in Finland (North); BAU in Turkey (South); MUS in Poland (East) and UPC in Spain (West) covering the periphery of the Europe to ensure multiplier activities reach as many as countries in Europe as possible. The partnership is complemented by a shipping company (Makroshipping) and a port (Rauma) to make sure the specification and training programme takes all practical aspects into consideration. SPIN in Slovenia has been invited into the partnership to support C4FF in the development of a novel online e-learning platform similar to the one developed by SPIN and C4FF in previous EU funded projects such as EGMDSS and MarTEL (www.egmdss.com and www.martel.pro): many of the projects by the partnership has been selected as Best in Europe by the EU.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013733_coordinator"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", 141611.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046864_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Southampton Solent University", 124318.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", "Southampton Solent University", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000100_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", 88368.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035521_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", 80554.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.solent.ac.uk ", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023926_coordinator"], [2018, "\" \u0160ATY D\u011aLAJ\u00cd \u010cLOV\u011aKA, ALE KDO D\u011aL\u00c1 \u0160ATY ?! \"", "SOUTHAMPTON SOLENT UNIVERSITY", 76001.0, 9, 10, "Clothes make the man, but how to make clothes?\r\nThe title expresses the contents of all the courses of study at our school \u2013 with more than sixty years\u2019 history and unique type of education connecting art with traditional clothes\u2019 making, presentation and marketing. \r\nThe aim of our educational activities is to teach the students how to understand clothes, to design and produce them, to set them in their historical, social and cultural context, and to know their financial or other values.\r\n We were driven by the necessity for optimization and innovation of all the courses of study with regard to the state of the clothes production, demand at job market and its perspectives up to 2025.\r\nWe also considered the call priorities which we included into the artistic assignment of the work activities when working with the sources of inspiration, and we also implemented them to the practical realization of the designs including their presentation.\r\nAnother motive was the long-term and meaningful collaboration with our partners.
