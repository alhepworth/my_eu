In the UK, all the Habitat Directive Annex I sand dune habitats are in \u2018Unfavourable\u2019 conservation status due to such stabilisation, which leads to the loss or decline of those species which depend upon bare sand and early successional sand dune stages. Wales accounts for 11 % (8 101 ha) of the total UK sand dune resource, including rare and threatened dune habitats. The re-introduction of dynamic processes is therefore vital for the conservation of the full range of sand dune habitats.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6689", null, "life_38"]]}}}}
