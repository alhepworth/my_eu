Thus they acquire additional skills and competences they urgently need for their future jobs and professional life. The training in new glass technologies also renders a means to avoid later unemployment and to enhance the chance to find a job internationally. The quality of the training is improved by new teaching and learning methods.Dissemination of results: The produced glass objects will be presented to the public and the press by the students during the days of the open door at the vocational college  Rheinbach and in English during the International Youth Glass Award  in Rheinbach where young people from Europe meet and compete with their glass objects.II.

The partner organization is the foundation Fundaci\u00f3 BCN Formaci\u00f3 Professional in Barcelona, who serves as service agency for the institutions of the education sector in all questions concerning vocational education. Furthermore, media companies and the two vocational colleges of design and media from Barcelona function as partners EMAV and Massana.Aims/Needs: Apprentices of the creative professional field at the vocational college in Rheinbach and at the two vocational colleges in Barcelona  get with the eight weeks long practical training in a company in Spain the opportunity to improve their skills in the second language. Additionally, they meliorate their career opportunities on the employment market.  The same is true for the Spanish trainees. For all participants the mobility project offers an opportunity for intercultural learning.  With the project the cooperation between the chambers of commerce and the educational institutions as well as the companies in both regions of K\u00f6ln/Bonn and Barcelona is sustainably fortified.

Besides the improvement of language structures the project also covers the registers of media language with special emphasis on TV productions and advertising campaigns. Considering the project - as far as the participants are concerned - as a module of foreign language teaching at our technical college will most probably lead to and show students' individual progress during their English lessons at at their school. Research among alumni may unveil, if former project participants will have found easier access to workplaces in European contexts. Professional teachers will be qualified as bilingual teachers in the topics of graphic design and media design.Dissemination of results/Communication with the public: All the trainees' learning projects and learning progress on a professional content level as well as a language level will be communicated mutifold, e.g. via the regional press, the website and Facebook page of the vocational college Rheinbach, at the days of the open doors in the vocational college and at joint informative events with the chamber of commerce Bonn/Rhein-Sieg and regional companies for the target group of students and trainees.

The present project has two main goals. Firstly, to provide students in years 9 to 12 or taking part in higher vocational training the opportunity to get acquainted with the European system of running small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Great Britain and Germany, and as a result, gain insight into the business practices of developed EU member countries, and after graduation be able to use their experience in the course of their career. It is important that our students apply and strengthen their knowledge acquired in the classroom in practice as well. To underline this goal, the evaluation of the students' internship achievements is taken into consideration when assessing their academic performance. It is our intention that the participants apply their knowledge in a foreign language environment. The second aim of the project is to enable teachers of Economics to experience and study the economy, enterprises and culture of an economically developed EU member state. Also, they could enhance their professional, linguistic and methodological repertoire and share their experiences and the acquired good practices with colleagues in our school or in other institutions. As a consequence our teachers and the school can gain a competitive edge.\r\nThe implementation of this project integrates well into our internationalisation strategy. It contributes to securing the future employability of our students by providing work placement opportunities in two leading EU countries. The project also aids reaching our strategic goal of providing our students with practical experience in addition to their theoretical education. We put the main emphasis on this when we created the work programme for this project cycle. Our goal was to harmonise the different work experience activities as much as possible with the content and aims of the vocational curriculum. The project contributes to developing the quality of the human resources at our school by providing opportunities for professional language skills development and broadening the practical experience of our economics teachers in the framework of the further training course in the UK. All these actions of the project contribute to fostering internationalisation in our institution.\r\nConcerning our mid-term goals, the project aids the strengthening of talents development, the enhancement of school marketing, the development of linguistic skills, the development of international partner network and the growing effectiveness of communication within the institution. By doing so, the positive image of our school strengthens. The project increases the chances of our students entering tertiary education as both their vocational and professional linguistic skills develop due to participation in the project. As a positive development, the academic performance of our business administration classes enhanced recently, resulting in better chances of participating in the project. This could support the prevention of early school dropout that is mostly characteristic in these classes.\r\nAmong our short-term, innovative development goals, the present project supports the development of the peer mentor system, the dissemination processes, our career path monitoring efforts and the field of community building. We plan to develop the peer mentoring system by requiring students participating in the project to carry out mentoring tasks after the mobility. This could take the form of supporting students with more modest foreign language skills or preparing the participating students for the next mobility. We intend to develop the platforms of our dissemination activity. In addition to the blog that served our goals so well, we wish to create a separate website that hosts the reports and good practices acquired during the project. We plan to develop our career path survey to make the gathering of data more effective. The findings of evaluating the results of the survey will be utilised in developing our internationalisation strategy and in enhancing the quality of our mobility projects. Before embarking on our new project, we plan to organise an Erasmus+ event for our previous and hopeful participants, in order to provide an occasion for informal exchange of experiences and community building.\r\nOne of our main development area is utilising the ErasmusPro opportunity as a new element. In the framework of the programme we plan long term work placements (4 months).

This is mainly for the teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe projects offer the 92 students (VET, Commerce, Trade, Hospitality, Marketing & Events, Tourism and recreation) an orientation on the international labourmarket and intensive training oriented language learning. The student acquires a better vision of his future labour, knows where his occupation stands on the international labour market and enhances his English/Spanish language skills.\r\nThe practical work experience offers  the possibility of gaining an impression at various compagnies. The students become prepared for their definitive entrance in the business comminity, because they run fewer risks of shortly drowning in the multitude of new information and impressions. The fear of 'the jump at the deep end' that the students inevitably need to make will be removed. \r\nThe practical work experience, in a foreign county, will give the training a completely new dimension.
