Communication is fundamental in learning, acceptance by peers and meaningful participation in the home and community. Assessing communicative skills in children with MDVI is a challenge. A  range of subskills need to be assessed, such as receptive, expressive skills, sensory and motor skills related to communication, collaboration with families is required, conducting structured and unstructured observations are important and also their is a need to request evaluations by specialists. The accurate assessment of communication will enable teachers to set realistic goals, develop appropriate learning exercises and address the educational needs of children with MDVI. PrECIVIM  bridges assessment and intervention and underlines the need of assessment of communication skills for the development of individualized educational  approaches, the use of appropriate educational material and play activities to promote the communication skills of students with MDVI. \r\nHence, the proposed project aims to address the following objectives:\r\n\u2022 to develop a screening inventory of the communicative profile of MDVI students,\r\n\u2022 to create communicative, learning, and social opportunities for students with MDVI,\r\n\u2022 to promote the collaboration between universities, schools and associations of individuals with visual impairments and multiple disabilities.\r\n\u2022 to point out the best practices and guidelines for the development of effective communication regarding students with MDVI enhancing their acceptance and promoting their inclusion from a broader social context.\r\nThe above objectives were identified through an up-to-date literature review.

People with mental health problems represent a social group on which society has plenty of misconceptions and little information. Prejudice, stereotypical representations, and fear originated by lack of information and experience with this vulnerable group are the result of insufficient interest on the part of the public, often resulting in discrimination against them. Taking in consideration the fact that only in the last few years we managed to slightly raise public awareness on this subject, and that prejudice and discrimination both by public and professionals, are very present and strong, mostly due to the lack of information and education on the subject, organization of education is of crucial importance in this phase of de-institutionalisation of mental health system. Only in the last 2 years some interest came from the EU, some small steps were taken toward improvement of situation, through the process of de-institutionalisation, reform in psychiatric system that includes transition from strictly institutional and medical treatment toward community initiatives, development of community services and centers for mental health, global change of attitudes toward psychiatric care users, change of practices and old fashion methods rooted in Serbian system of mental health.

All activities will be targeted. That means all activities will be organized and structured according to our objectives. Moreover we will focus on the participants' motivation and interest during the training period. As soon as the project will be approved by the NA we will search and ask for the participants' learning and practical experiences and needs for self-improvement and so we will plan our daily agenda of NFL accordingly. We also planned not so strict in implementation and timeline activities because we aim to flexibility during learning process and in methods and approaches.", "http://www.lovelifegeneration.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-MT01-KA105-000106_4"], [2017, "Labels Down", "LoveLife Generation", 14265.0, 5, 5, "\u201cLabels are for cans, not people.\u201d \u2013  Anthony Rapp\r\n\r\nOne of our biggest challenges in the 21st century is to learn how to deal with our differences and to live together as a society. That is the reason we had the idea of this international youth project, which could help us move forward towards this goal. With our youth exchange called \u201cLabels Down\u201d, we would like to help to achieve a common goal with those youngsters who are willing to examine their attitudes and learn how society works in our everyday life. Our goal is to encourage these young people to learn to realize and respect differences because that is a more efficient way of learning from each other.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how stereotypes can influence our social relationships. Our aim is to expand their knowledge in the area of social minorities, gender roles and LGBT topics, as well. Through this project, our participants will get a chance to increase their entrepreneurship and sense of initiative in these fields and in human rights. Furthermore, some activities will work with the topic of sexual education and mental health.\r\n\r\nDuring the week, our participants will be responsible for creating interactive school workshops and raise awareness to topics such as responsibilities and opportunities in the EU, gender equality, multiculturalism and healthy and conscious sex life, prevention, LGBT+ people, etc. This way, the local youngsters can get a lot of information, new views and new perspectives about these issues. We believe that the youth is the key to making difference, so thanks to these school projects also the local youth can get a hint of a tolerant, accepting and open-minded life-style and way of thinking. \r\n\r\nLabels Down is an exchange with what we would like to influence our participants and other people around us to open up and realize how much depends on them. We would like to make sure that everyone knows about their possibilities and that they will try to take advantage of them. We would also like to emphasize that judging people on their skills and values is the right way. This is the only way of working together on a successful future and preventing violent radicalisation of young people as well.\r\n\r\nOur project will take place in G\u00e1nt, Hungary between 22 and 30 May 2017.  Our target group is European youngsters between the age of 18-25 from Italy, Portugal (Madeira), Romania, the United Kingdom and Hungary.  We would like to provide a chance for them to widen their horizons and to think about their role in the society. Through their own and each other\u2019s experiences, they will be able to feel more responsible, be an active, tolerant citizen of Europe and join together to promote and celebrate diversity.", "http://www.lovelifegeneration.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA105-035870_1"], [2015, "We get the future", "LoveLife Generation", 10879.0, 5, 5, "\"We get the future\" is a youth exchange prepared to deal with the issues of citizenship. Our target group consists of 13-14 years old youths who are willing to learn about the European Union, their fundamental rights, their possibilities and about cooperation in general. We would like to tackle the issues of awareness, justice, integrity, inclusion and other social issues. We would like to educate the European youths about their position in life and we aim to give them some ideas about how to get along with other people and move forward from their current situation. We would like to encourage the participants to open up towards others and take advantage of all the programmes that are designed to help them become European citizens. Our main goal is to make the participants believe that the future is theirs, to make them realize that they are the ones who matter the most. Our main activities include creative planning sessions, mini projects, campaign-like situational games, as well as many exercises that help with self-reflection and group work. Intercultural evenings, city games and treasure hunts will ensure that each and every one of us will be provided with cultural component, too. \u201eWe get the future\u201d will not only be held by experienced youth workers and volunteers but we will also visit a youth centre, talk about Erasmus+ and invite other people who are experienced in other key actions. With this project we would like to emphasize that we will not only receive the future but we will also understand what it will bring. This youth exchange will take place in G\u00e1nt, Hungary between the 20th and 27th of February, 2016 and will also be the result of a newly established partnership between public institutions (schools) and NGOs. Nowadays it is a really important topic, that how can we work smoothly together in order to provide complex education for children, for our future. So we will prepare, execute and evaluate the project together, and in the meantime we will get new experiences, new knowledge. By inviting Czech, British and Slovenian youth we would like to make sure that different point-of-views will be considered throughout all the activities.

We recognised the importance of real outcomes and transferable life skills and began to look into a more project based and cross curricular approach to facilitating learning.  We wanted our students to be independent and responsible learners who are less reliant on their teachers as providers of knowledge and have the skills to research, problem solve, persevere and collaborate.  With this in mind, we embarked on our first real project combining art, maths, English and computing with the overarching theme of Identity.  The project not only aimed to deliver the curriculum in these areas but to enhance enjoyment and engagement, to add meaning, to build skills and to provide an additional purpose.  The result of the students' work was a public exhibition, organised by students, which also acted as a fundraiser for our link school in Pakistan.  The project required huge commitment from the staff who volunteered to take part but the resulting passion, enjoyment and collaboration made it all worth it.  In addition, and more importantly, the students' focus and enjoyment was greatly heightened.  In fact, it created a real buzz around school.\r\n\r\nWe have also been driving forward our global identity within school and have successfully raised the profile through many means including: assemblies, partnership curriculum projects, Google Community with Dominica, our international clock wall and tutor time activities.\r\n\r\nWe have recently successfully achieved our re-accrediation for the International School Award. \r\n\r\nOur GREEN vision and international ethos has already formed part of our School Improvement Plan (SIP) and we are now ready to take this to the next level.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind along with current curriculum changes and our ever changing world, we want to ensure that our students receive the best possible learning experience.  This experience should not only ensure maximum progress, but also build skills that will be paramount for success in life beyond school.  A further impact of this being on a staff body who are challenged and passionate and provided a constant opportunity to develop their skills and explore new and innovative ways of facilitating learning.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Headteacher and the Teaching & Learning Leader also visited local schools and the Innovation Centre where they started to learn more about how new models of delivering the curriculum may look.  However, this does mean some quite significant changes and the need for seeing this in action in different ways is vital.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing a more inspiring and exciting curriculum to our students and to acting as a pioneer school in this area.  We want to learn from colleagues in countries where the education is already forward thinking with a project based and real life approach as we know that their expertise is incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nOur aims and areas or improvements are clear to us, although we also understand that we muct be adaptable throughout this process and be open to a shift in these.  As outlined above we wish to: implement a cross curricular and project based curriculum, ensure MFL is at the heart of learning, enable teachers to take on a more facilitative role, support staff development, build our GREEN skills and values in staff and students, ensure that exciting and effective softwares enhance the learning experience.\r\n\r\nThere are key activities in order for this project to be effective: job shadowing/school visits and targeted training courses in identified areas.\r\nFor this project to be successful and to have sustained impact, our in school work will be well planned and thoroughly monitored.  Staff taking place will be carefully and fairly selected, they will be well prepped for the project and will be expected to create a report for sharing.\r\nAs a school, we will facilitate vital professional conversations and training in order to move us forward.\r\n\r\nOur new KS3 curriculum will form the bais for our new School Improvement Plan (SIP) which spans a three year period.  As part of our performance management system, all staff members will be required to dedicate one of their three targets to our new curriculum.  Discussions and training will also take place during a variety of our 35 identified CPD sessions throughout the academic years.\r\n\r\nIt is important that change like this is approached with maximum knowledge, expertise, support and collaboration and that all stakeholders are involved in all communications and consultations at all times.  We are incredibly excited by this project and by researching, designing and implementing a brand new KS3 curriculum.  Rare is the opportunity for collaboration and change at this level.  We are committed to ensuring that these changes are carefully planned, thought through and monitored to ensure maximum impact and sustainable, meaningful change.", "http://www.wsfg.waltham.sch.uk", "Walthamstow School for Girls", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036036_coordinator"]]}}}}
