With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.\n\nThe strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.\n\nThis project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.
