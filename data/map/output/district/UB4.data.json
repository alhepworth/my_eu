Heinz Company Limited", "Plastics used in packaging are seen everywhere in developed societies. Demand of long life rigid packing with high barrier properties grows up quickly (around 200.000 Tn are produced annually in Europe). Barrier packages are employed to preserve foodstuffs from environmental agents, so to control the package permeability to gases (O2,N2,CO2) is very important. Furthermore, mechanical and food thermal treatment resistance (pasteurization and retort processes) and food contact grade are also relevant requirements. Due to the nature of plastic materials, only one plastic can not achieve all the demanded requisites, so these packages are made of combining no less than three materials in five layers; a water barrier polymer (outer layers) cheap and with good mechanical properties (PP,HIPS), an oxygen barrier polymer with high cost (EVOH,PVDC,PA) and an adhesive to join both. They are manufactured by a two-step process: Coextrusion to produce a cast multilayer sheet and Thermoforming to process the sheet into shapes. This production technology has the following problems: Co-extrusion: a) Synthetic polymers (mainly EVOH) used as inner layer are very expensive and chemically incompatible with the other layers preventing post-used packages recycling. b) Scrap production reaches at least 10%. Thermoforming: a) High scrap production (up to 40%) due to trims, especially in oval and round forms, and processing problems b) Design limitations: neither complex forms nor uniform thickness, and no high depth of draw ratio are allowed. In order to solve the above problems COBAPACK approach will consist on: a)Using destructurized starch from rich protein plants(a by-product with low cost soluble in water), to replace the synthetic high barrier materials allowing the separation of the different multilayer materials thus recycling 100% the final package b)Using co-injection process, one-step process with minimum scrap losses, savings in energy comsumption and broad design flexibility", 54721.0, 1155571.0, 5, 10, "COBAPACK", "http://www.cobapack.eu", "http://www.heinz.co.uk", null, "fp7_107790_998007393"], [1291161600000, 1354233600000, "Ultrasonic detection and removal of fouling inside industrial and domestic pipes", "H.J.

Fouling shortens the plant life, increases the need for periodic cleaning and pipe replacement. It also causes contamination of the end products which is especially serious when the fouling involves bacterial biofilms and the products are intended for direct human consumption. In addition pipe blockages, deformation, rupture or corrosion cause by a build up of fouling can lead to major incidents such as explosions involving with threats to human life and plant destruction involving loss of product and jobs. In domestic pipes fouling causes taps and valves to seize up and leaks to occur which leads to expensive plumbing costs in replacement parts, high labour costs, expensive repairs from flood damage and disruption to domestic life. ULTRACLEANPIPE offers a novel solution to the general problem of identifying and then removing fouling in industrial plant as well as domestic plumbing. The system prototype will be designed for application to small bore pipes that arise in the food processing and pharmaceuticals production industry as well as in plumbing systems. This focus is taken because (i) small bore pipes are obviously much more prone to than large ones and (ii) contamination of products intended for human consumption is a problem of the highest order.
