The objective is to develop European links in order to share good practice in the use of ICT to develop literacy and numeracy through including the whole community with a thematic approach 'Work and Leisure.'  Skills will be developed across the curriculum with a multilingual and intergenerational approach. Having undertaken a variety of activities the end results will show increasing progress in children's standards across a range of skills. Apart from increasing basic skills the wider community of each partner school will have an increased awareness of the importance of healthy living and the use of modern technology to enhance long life learning.  The project will offer training opportunities for staff, pupils and stakeholders. We will be using the expertise that we know exist between the partner schools to address staff development requirements.  Additionally, we have agreed upon developing community cohesion by addressing intergeneration events, activities and incorporating local expertise e.g. craftsmen, local entrepreneurs. The collaboration between local entrepreneurs and pupils will influence and offer opportunities for future employment and transferable skills. By participating in such events and training the whole community will benefit. Their innovation of the use of i pads and online learning inspired us to further develop our use of ICT emerging into the 21st century. All schools have some innovative ideas that we can all learn from and transfer back to our respective schools.Activities will be arranged to ensure that all age groups will have opportunities to participate in the partnership such as preparing the presentations of their own region to be shared.  This also includes a a number of teachers who are eager to develop an expertise in a certain area.  Before commencing any project a baseline assessment will be undertaken, and evaluations at the beginning, middle and end will take place.  The co-ordinator of each school will be responsible for the implementation of these assessments and evaluations with the project co-ordinator overseeing the whole process.  Also, children and parents will undertake questionnaires in response to activities and the other stakeholders, depending on the nature of the task, will have opportunities to evaluate for example, intergenerational activities.All project results will be disseminated via schools' websites, hwb+ (a Welsh national online learning platform), newsletters, open events, local media and e twinning.Our projects have sustainable values and results.  Our healthy living project will have a direct impact on the pupils', staff and local communities' lifestyles,  with the aim of them continuing with these healthy ways. Children will acquire other skills such as  ICT and numeracy skills which they will be able to  apply in other cross-curricular activities.  Teachers will also develop their skills to be included in their future lesson plans. Also, linguistic knowledge will support the pupils in secondary or higher education. A significant number of participants will benefit.  Between the five schools over 2,000 staff and pupils will benefit.  In addition to this number,  five contrasting communities will benefit from our innovative partnership in particular via our intergenerational activities.", "http://www.peniel.amdro.org.uk", "Ysgol Y Dderwen", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024463_4"]]}}, "8DN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Together for a green Europe", "Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Myrddin", 149065.0, 4, 6, "This project was founded from the wish of encouraging pupils to engage with the themes of citizenship, democracy and environmental issues in everyday life and European context. The project provides pupils with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of their roles as European citizens and to a greater understanding of their democratic and environmental responsibilities. Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship is a cross curricular focus in all schools involved in this project. \r\n\r\nThe project serves three different levels: International, national and local. \r\n\r\nInternational: Understanding how the political agenda and process in the EU institutions affects the european, national and local environment. \r\nNational: Learn about the political environmental agenda in each of the participating countries, and the potentials of using the environment in a sustainable matter. \r\nLocal: Focus on what individuals can do in their local community to act in an environmental responsible manner.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project will be, that each school involved in the project, develops an environmental strategy for the school. \r\n\r\nThe knowledge the students gain throughout this project is used for evolving the environmental strategy at their own school.\r\n\r\nThis strategy will be shared with the local community by students in many different ways. They will for example host presentations at school, do a campaign in the surrounding area and deliver the strategy to the local politicians at the city council. Getting the local media involved during mobilities and when the strategy is done will also be a part of the project. \r\n\r\nAs teachers our focus will be on Project-based Learning which is a student-centred and meaning-oriented pedagogical method which will ensure that democratic practice are carried out throughout our project.", "http://www.bromyrddin.sirgar.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA201-000690_5"]]}}}}
