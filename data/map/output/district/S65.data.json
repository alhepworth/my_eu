This process will enable students to become creative social thinkers, develop entrepreneurial mindsets, and become social change makers into a world where inequality, poverty and social exclusion are still quite evident. The NEMESIS model builds on a combination of innovative pedagogies and learning models, open technologies and participatory relations and processes. It also creates bridges between the learning communities and real world social innovation experiences by creating a European wide community of social innovation practitioners eager to interact with students, facilitating interdisciplinary and intergenerational learning. To foster its potential to scale and be adopted by educational institutions around Europe, the project develops a Social Innovation Open Learning Platform to grant access to the specific educational model and resources to all with emphasis on those from disadvantaged environments. This platform also facilitates the creation of a Community of Practice of teachers, school leaders and relevant stakeholders willing to break silos, engage in dialogue, drive organizational change and experience the value of the NEMESIS educational model. NEMESIS will be piloted in Greece, Spain, UK, France and Portugal engaging stakeholders into co-creation of educational resources, collective learning through the development of projects and digital storytelling as well as into online learning and knowledge sharing communities of peers. In that way, the project builds a contemporary educational model that will act as a catalyst in innovative skills based education in Europe that is expected to improve current teaching and learning practices and drive students\u2019 passion for sustainable social change.", 22912.0, 1953311.0, 7, 14, "NEMESIS", null, null, null, "h2020_212137_914938048"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "WILLOW TREE ACADEMY", 22897.0, "Fostering inclusive, innovative and reflective European societies (08.02.03.06)", "fts_2017_15761"]]}}}}
