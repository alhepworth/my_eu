Five countries will be working with students and teachers of various abilities, internationally acclaimed dancers, school kids, some suffering from various forms of disabilities (mild, moderate or more serious, mental or physical), others in search of a new lease of life when school no longer appeals to them, all carrying a formidable artistic project together: the creation of a dance performance and the video documenting of the project. \r\nParticipants to the two shows will add up to 70 but the project, through the diversity of actions that will unfold and the multiplying events that are planned, will concern hundreds more. Besides, participants will be numerous in all partner structures. On top of mobilities, a lot of actions will be organized, starting with the attendance to cultural events and dissemination actions around these events. The main goal is to discover and acquire new experiences collectively, discover others, take them into account however different they may seem at first, discovering new countries and cultures, new school systems, discovering art and culture (the opera, the hip  hop scene, musicals), new technologies and all in all a whole range of means of expression. \r\nAll partners will have specific tasks assigned and each will designate a coordinator and a person in charge of the accounts. The French partner will be piloting the whole project.\r\nBBEDC does indeed focus on youngsters who for most of the participants in the project, feel different and even denigrated but the high quality of the partners and stakeholders involved in the project will be an incredible boost of confidence for them since they will be brought to create valuable and lasting pieces of art. Whether it be the video documentary part of the project or the two choreographies students will set up, the fact that they will be working with artists such as Peter Mika, Conor O'Kane, Lazylegz or Redouane Ait Chitt and the video company Art2Business in Warsaw will guarantee the creative, aesthetic but also demanding aspect of BBEDC.\r\nBBEDC will awaken students to the fact that they have a voice, they can be heard if they feel the need to be heard. It will also show them the importance of mingling with other cultures to enrichen their experiences and widen their scopes of action. It will create a chain of people who will necessarily greatly benefit from this new network and hopefully arouse artistic vocations. The artistic project should last beyond the 3-year period, since schools, rich of all the newly acquired skills, will be able to carry on with the breakdancing activities and video classes. The boundaries that will disappear during the project will remain so, schools will make sure that collaborative work persists beyond the BBEDC project, students will continue working on common creations, disregarding the fact that disability may be a liability. Teachers will have learned how to work collectively, sharing projects with colleagues teaching different subjects and different class profiles. A school community must be inclusive of everyone and achievement should be measured by new standards taking into consideration the input any given individual can bring to a project. The coaching dance teachers will have received from Lazylegz will also enable them, to open their classes and schools to pupils with disabilities, they will know how to include them in their programs and this will create a whole new dynamic in our communities. As for the more specialised participants, the dancers in the Spanish and Dutch companies, they will come out enrichened by this new human and artistic venture and will have grown confident they can themselves be in charge of projects including a great diversity of participants. Furthermore, the emphasis put on the discovering of European cultures by BBEDC and the great progress made as far as linguistic skills are concerned, will make all participants keen European travellers and standard bearers.", "http://www.lawnmowerstheatre.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA201-037169_1"]]}}, "1HH": {"esif": {"data": [[1475280000000, 1546128000000, "High-rise Energy Infrastructure for Gateshead Housing Tenants - HEIGHTs", "Gateshead Council", "The project will install new district heating and power networks to high-rise social housing, and nearby public buildings, taking heat/power from low to zero carbon sources, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nTaking into consideration the wider", "ERDF", 4668850.0, 10533727.0, "erdf_england_377"], [1449619200000, 1543536000000, "Northern Centre for Emerging Technologies", "Gateshead Council", "The Northern Centre for Emerging Technologies project will bring forward specialist workspace and testing facilities (including access to appropriate development kit) to support the development and commercialisation of emerging technologies, creating new", "ERDF", 3240880.0, 8054113.0, "erdf_england_379"], [1493596800000, 1656547200000, "Gateshead - Goes Local", "Gateshead Council", "Gateshead Goes Local (GGL) will provide a mechanism for grass roots community economic development to stimulate employment and enterprises in urban Gateshead.

The mobility will gather 28 partners from the following countries: Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Romania, Macedonia, Slovakia, Turkey, Italy, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Greece, the Netherlands and Poland. CONTEXT:As keen advocates of the previous Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning Programmes as well as the current Erasmus+ Programme, we strongly believe that mobilising and involving young people in transnational projects is one of the effective tools in dealing with the possible consequence of unemployment. Though majority of the projects offered around Europe and worldwide do not create jobs themselves, precious learning gained when attending or helping to organise an activity leads to invaluable experiences. We have already seen the outcomes of that with hundreds of young people boosting their self-esteem, becoming more motivated to overcome challenges, developing resilience and even setting up their own entrepreneurial ventures (e.g. projects, start-ups, etc.).   How to ensure, however, that the projects offered to young people, particularly those unemployed ones, are truly meaningful and empowering? How to turn them into valuable lessons with learning and development (both personal and professional) in focus? And finally, how to activate those who have already lost their hopes and are reluctant to make any further steps towards the future? These and many other questions sparked up the discussion between partners and led to the following application being presented. AIM AND OBJECTIVES:The proposed Contact Making Event (with elements of a training course) is aimed at bringing together stakeholders interested in developing networks and joint future projects with the view to addressing issues of youth unemployment. We wish to achieve that by means of:- gathering 28 youth workers and project coordinators from around Europe to better understand short and long term  implications of youth unemployment - exchanging best practices in the fields of youth empowerment and supporting the development of employability skills through engagement in youth projects- developing capacities to prepare and implement high-quality, sustainable youth projects with long lasting impact at the local and international level - facilitating networking between partner promoters and development of strategies for the future joint projects aimed at unemployed young people- promoting the use of the local and international funds (e.g. Erasmus+) in supporting young people\u2019s development and combating the consequences of youth unemployment- developing ideas and strategies for the future joint projects to be carried out by the partner promoters.WORKING METHODOLOGY: CME will be based on the principles and practices of non-formal education, taking into account the needs of youth NGOs and their target groups, their motivations / expectations and previous experiences. In order to implement an effective and quality mobility, a diversity of working methods will be used, including: interactive presentations,group work, simulation exercises and role plays that involve participants directly and emotionally, multimedia use for visualisation, discussions in form of e.g. World Cafe, games and energisers, daily feedback, etc.      IMPACT:It is expect that Contact Making Event will lead to:- new, intentional friendships and professional networks developed- competences gained in the field of youth empowerment and combating youth unemployment- better knowledge of and hence preparedness to run future Erasmus+ projects- greater capacities developed to initiate and successfully implement high quality local and international projects- new and innovative youth work methods learnt - we hope that the tools and ideas taken from the workshops implemented during the CME will empower participants themselves to act as multipliers and promoters of non-formal education as a way to acquire precious life and employability skills- renewed motivation to carry on with various activates at the local and/or international level - we expect that participants themselves will be the drivers and main promoters of joint project ideas developed with fellow participants during the CME.

The main aim of this youth exchange is to promote dialogue among youth with different religions and to prepare youth leaders to deal with religious issues with a focus to empower youth through inter-religious awareness and dialogue while embracing and learning about EU Values. The idea of the project originated from religious and national intolerance, lack of dialogue and understanding between youth of different religions. Through education and meeting with different people from different religions personal opinions of participants as well as opinions of other young people with whom the participants are in contact with will change in a positive way. With this project we will foster positive lines of communication between youth on inter-cultural and inter-religious topics and give a positive and fact based learning environment on these sensitive topics. Furthermore, these activities are designed to be inter-personal and challenge stereotypes and provide a safe space for participants to share their feelings, experiences and hopes for the future. \r\nThe whole program of the youth exchange will be implemented using the methods of non-formal education, using an interactive and participative approach, method is also based on learning by experience.
