Our experiment sharing is not going to stay between our partnership because intellectual outputs will be created and broadcast.\r\nThis project gather together seven partners from Spain (main coordinator), France, Poland, Italy, Germany, Cyprus and United Kingdom. Four of them have been working previously together on a common project.\r\n\r\nWe have designed the three years project around teachers training, transnational mobilities and learning workshop and teacher\u2019s seminars.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the project (2015/2016), there will be one course per term. Each school will send at least two teachers who will have to develop a seminar in their own school about what they learnt. The courses are held in UK, Cyprus and France, and are related to problem based learning, entrepreneurship and developing creative thinking. \r\n\r\nDuring the second (2016/2017) and third (2017/2018) years of the project we will develop six tasks in total, working on skills closely linked to employability (creativity, problem solving, creative thinking, communication, well being, respect, team, workorganisation, health). There will be seven transnational meetings in which pupils travelling from all the schools will work on common activities in collaboration with pupils from foreign schools, showing what they have learned with the developed task. Moreover, apart from using these meetings to evaluate and organize the next steps of the project, the hosting teachers will develop a seminar about how to we work a specific key competence.\r\n\r\nThrough the tasks, pupils will create a pupet using different elements of the traditional dresses of the other countries,;build typical buildings using LEGO, organizing their work to plan how to do it; write a story in collaboration with the other countries and read it to other students; cook a traditional dish of every country and create an exposiction expressing their emotions after listening to traditional songs of all the countries, among others.\r\n\r\nAssessment and dissemination are two or our main concerns while doing the project. All the people involved, meaning parents, teachers and pupils, will evaluate and disseminate what has been done through different media.\r\n\r\nConcerning the impact, we can envisage the results in two ways. First, the concrete and immediate ones, throughout the two final products we\u2019re going to create (a website with all the resources and a book compelling all the key competences seminars) and, for students and teachers, the use of English in a meaningful way. Then, the invisibles and long terms ones, throughout the improvement of our students\u2019 employability, being made sensitive to creativity, problem solving and critical thinking, emotional intelligence, organization skills, respect of the differences and communication. At the end, this experience should increase for everybody the feeling of being part of the same Europe considering our differences as possibilities to learn better and to be in keeping with today\u2019s society.", "http://www.langleygreenprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA219-016389_6"], [2017, "Raising standards through creativity and the outdoor curriculum", "Langley Green Primary School", 34409.0, 7, 7, "The aim of this project is to encourage and inspire pupils and teaching staff through positive outdoor experiences.

The selection process will be clear and transparent so that all members of staff are clear why and how successful staff are selected.\r\nThe opportunity to collaborate and learn from our European partners, will help us improve our future cooperation both as teachers and as future workers, using our languages in a meaningful way and developing our understanding of the huge potential the outdoor curriculum can develop in children's lives.\r\nThe project partners in England, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Romania and Italy are keen to develop our skills, knowledge and understanding together. All partners are new except for England and Greece. We would like to work together again as during our Comenius project together, which finished 2 years ago,  we identified these skills as a priority for both of our schools. We are planning a 2 year project including teacher training and job shadowing.\r\nDuring the first year of the project (2017/2018) there will be a focus area each term. In the first year we will also participate in two 'Outdoor Curriculum' courses which will focus on different skills. On returning from the courses the teachers will develop 'Outdoor Curriculum' guides that can be used as a training tool with staff and that can be shared on our etwinning space.  This can ultimately be shared with a wider audience when we publish the space as a website. In the first year we will also develop literacy skills during an 'Enchanted Woodland' project, develop a health and wellbeing project and there will also be a Science focus.\r\nDuring the second year of the project (2018/2019) we will review all the training we have received in the Spring and Summer term of the first year and ensure that we incorporate the skills and practices into our projects. Our focus areas will be Maths in the Outdoors, Art in the Outdoors and caring for our Environment.\r\nAssessment and dissemination are two of our main concerns whilst carrying out the project.

We will review our curriculum during the project to ensure skills acquired whilst we are collaborating with our partners are embedded as part of our ongoing curriculum. This will ensure that these skills continue to be taught and developed long after the project has finished.

The teachers involved in this project are some of the permanent employee and one from the Senior Management Team (management and organisation).\r\nBoth training courses will be realized during July of the second year and they will last 6-12 days.\r\nSeven teachers will be trained, each one of them in a different field of methodology or in the usage of ICT tools and later they will teach the rest of the teachers\u2019 staff of our school.\r\n \r\nActivities to be done:\r\nThe year before the beginning of the project: free English language courses at the same school for the teachers who are going to do the training and also for those who are eager to improve their English skills.\r\nA promoting team will be created as well.\r\nOnce we have found the schools where we are going to attend a job shadowing, we will plan the stay in order to take the most out of it.\r\nA work plan is going to be done so as to prepare the stay, to evaluate the results, to introduce any necessary changes or recommendations that our partners might suggest us.\r\nBefore we do the training course (that will last 6-12 days) we are going to work on each methodology in order to widen our vision and knowledge about the field and at the same time knowing in advance what doubts do we have.\r\n\r\nThe following step is the courses and the job shadowing.\r\n\r\nOnce we will have finished, we are going to held observations between teachers so everyone will have the opportunity to learn from the participant teachers in the project.\r\nThe Senior Management Team will ask lesson plans monthly where there will be reflected the new methodologies. Video tutorials will be recorded at school in order to show and train new teachers in our school and at the same time, to spread our project.\r\nHopefully our teachers will learn enough how to implement ICT tools and new methodologies so as to help the rest of our teachers\u2019 staff apply this knowledge in their lessons. We will continue with our schools\u2019 internationalisation thanks to our new partners and eTwinning projects. Better academic results, higher students\u2019 confidence and autonomy, openness towards other cultures and coexistence.\r\nBetween mid-term and long-term period, one of the impacts of this project will be the improvement of core subjects and English academic results in Key Competences tests.\r\nOur school will benefit from this project as well regarding our academic results and teachers motivation. This methodological change will give us visibility among others schools in our region.", "http://www.langleygreenprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-047441_2"], [2018, "IZOBRA\u017dEVANJE ZA PRIHODNOST", "Langley Green Primary School", 6147.0, 4, 4, "The ERASMUS project EDUCATION FOR FUTURE originates from the school staff's decision to form exact guidelines for our school's development. We will follow these guidelines and they will influence significantly the raise of quality of our students' knowledge, their creativity, linguistic competence and last but not least their integrated development. These guidelines are:\r\n\u2022 developing digital competences,\r\n\u2022 promoting a healthy lifestyle of students, their parents and staff members,\r\n\u2022 encouraging intercultural integration and raising the level of linguistic competences.\r\n\r\nCirila Kosma\u010da Primary School Piran was the first UNESCO school in Slovenia and it was also in the first cycle of Healthy Schools project. We share years of experience with our partner schools and other organizations through various international projects that include all students and teachers at our school. We are very proud of our interdisciplinary weeks during which we study a particular topic through all school subjects and successeful ETWINNING and other projects.\r\nAs a Healthy School we try to follow the topics and goals of Healthy Schools Project. In the school year 2018/19 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of our membership in Healthy Schools Project. This is a very important event for our school  and thus we decided to pay attention to the topics of promoting a healthy lifestyle. In agreement with our partner school Sekundarschule F\u00fcrstenberg from Germany, which also tries to raise the quality level of Healthy Schools Project activities, we will focus on the following themes: FOOD, EXERCISE and MENTAL HEALTH.\r\n\r\nBeside a healthy lifestyle we will seek other methods of teaching ICT, LANGUAGES, INTERCULTURAL LEARNING, the ways of introducing topics into curricula of individual subjects and new, innovative ways of teaching these contents to our students. Our partner school Langley Green Primary School from Great Britain was chosen as a school with rich experience in teaching ICT. Being a school with many immigrants the nature of work is different from other schools and it coincides with UNESCO goals.\r\n\r\nThe most important topics of this project are:\r\n\u2022 food, exercise and mental health,\r\n\u2022 ICT,\r\n\u2022 motivation, communication practices, language through culture, various teaching tools.\r\n\r\nEuropean connections, partnership, projects, training and the related new acquired knowledge and international experience in authentic environment are some guidelines at our school. Our school is located in the bilingual area where Italian is a second language and it represents part of our cultural heritage. The knowledge of a second language is important for the future of our students and better adaptation to the requirements of the European Union, developing multilingualism means acquiring different skills.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the acquired knowledge we want to influence our students as future active citizens who will be acquainted with our common history of European Union, will be able to communicate in intercultural dialogue, will be computer literate, will value health and exercise, will be acquainted with global and environmental problems, will be able to accept difference and who will think and act locally and globally. The project on mobility will help to know foreign education systems. We are going to try new methods of intercultural learning, ways of entering its contents into the curricula of individual subjects and seeking innovative ways of teaching. The acquired knowledge and experience will thus go beyond the boundaries of our school. The openness of our school to the local and wider environment is essential and one of our goals. Raising the level of teaching will be the foundation of our rich creativity and vision for the future.", "http://www.langleygreenprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SI01-KA101-046814_1"]]}}, "7SX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "CHS all around Europe", "Gatwick Investment Ltd", 44157.0, 8, 18, "CHS, Centrum Humanberuflicher Schulen des Bundes Villach, is a secondary vocational school providing higher education entrance qualification and comprises the following specializations: \r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Berufe (business administration)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kommunikation und Mediendesign (communication and media)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kunst und Gestaltung (arts)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Modedesign und Grafik (fashion design)\r\n\r\nWithin the project \"CHS all around Europe\" 28 CHS students will complete their internship in various EU countries.
