It will help to inspire all of our young people involved, helping them to engage with their peers across borders in partner schools, as well as with their local communities, working towards promoting positive attitudes in the wider school alongside developing curricular competencies.\r\n\r\nThe project will include approximately 500 participants from secondary year 2 and 3 (approximate ages 12-14 years old) in state schools from Ireland, Spain and Scotland, in each year of the project. There will be 6 key teaching staff directly involved in the partnership with a wider network of teachers participating in sharing practice events. \r\n\r\nEach partner school will research, plan and create a series of videos that highlight particular areas of their culture, which also tie in with identified areas of the curriculum. The topics will be discussed between the partners to ensure consistency across the project period. Each of the video projects will be created using two of the partner schools\u2019 languages so that all participants are able to use their language skills to translate and gain a deeper understanding of language in a variety of contexts. The project will also aim to change attitudes and promote responsible local, national, European and Global Citizenship. The project will help to inspire all of our young people involved, helping them to engage with their peers across borders in partner schools, as well as with their local communities, working towards promoting positive attitudes in the wider school.\r\n\r\nThe project relates directly to curriculum developments in each of the involved partner schools.  The project will Develop the Young Workforce (DYW) by enhancing the employability of the students involved through their engagement with and development of numeracy, literacy, language, digital competencies, problem solving and entrepreneurial skills.  The project will also raise the profile of students studying other languages, with the benefit of enhancing delivery of the Scottish Government's 1+2 Languages Policy as well as providing a practical application for music and music technology skills in an interdisciplinary context. \r\n\r\nAs teachers, we continually engage in professional development in order to enhance our own teaching practice in order to improve the learning experiences of young people. A key area of this is our ability to reflect on our practice and work collaboratively with others to enrich our experience and pedagogy. \r\n\r\nThis project will facilitate the sharing of unique and innovative teaching practice, not only between the partner schools, but also across the local education authorities and communities of each partner, as supported by EU policy. Additionally, the project will allow us to establish a forum where exceptional and innovative teaching practice can promote longevity of the project beyond its period of funding and allow teachers to continually evolve their pedagogy by sharing and engaging with the expertise from each of the partner schools.  \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that the creation and development of multilingual resources will be used to support the learning and teaching in each partner school. The video product will also benefit relevant stakeholders within the community. It is hoped that negative attitudes will be changed and positive attitudes will be reinforced. The embedding of this project will bring the participating curricular areas to life in an engaging way that aims to increase motivation and uptake in participating subject areas as well as benefiting literacy, numeracy, Health and Wellbeing and Skills for Learning, Life and Work. Pupils with SEN will benefit from a renewed focus on methodology to overcome barriers to learning and provide equity of experience.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated and evolve year on year as it is embedded into the curriculum for each school, as appropriate, after the initial two-year period.", "http://www.carluke.s-lanark.sch.uk", "Carluke High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036837_coordinator"]]}}, "4SD": {"life": {"data": [[2000, "Core forest sites - Woodland Habitat Restoration : Core sites for a forest habitat network", "Caledonian Partnership, Highland Birchwoods Ltd", 2586980.0, 1034792.0, "Scotland hosts a range of UK woodland types including several that are protected by the EU Habitats Directive.
