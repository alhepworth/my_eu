This curriculum change is driven in part by the need for a highly digitally competent workforce to remain economically competitive, but also by an understanding that thinking computationally will enhance students cognitive abilities, their understanding of the world and their ability to create using digital technologies. The partners in #co-think- 5 5 local school authorities/educational centers and 5 pilot schools from Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, Finland and Denmark - believe that computational thinking is an area of learning not only crucial to our students adaptation to their digital surroundings, but also to their ability to problem solve, develop new knowledge, and above all to harness the full potential of their creativity. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of computer science concepts, including computational thinking, into the education systems in many European countries, has been challenging, especially as many teachers have not received pre-service or in-service training to teach these areas. These new aims go beyond the demands of previous teaching and learning and requires teachers to learn new skills and knowledge. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the Erasmus+ objectives and the latest report from the OECD\u2019s Innovation Strategy, the ultimate objective of the project #co-think is to: SHARE AND EVALUATE MODELS AND APPROACHES FOR THE INCLUSIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to learn from approaches, pedagogies and expertise across the 5 countries to support primary teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills and understanding of how to teach computational thinking by creating a community of practice to extend this expertise into schools across each locality. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS AND ACTIVITIES\r\nMore than 30 ICT educators, 100 teachers, 1000 students will participate in activities that will be disseminated and of benefit to more than 10000 primary school teachers and ICT educators, 60000 primary school students and 1800 policymakers across the partner countries.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s activities will involve 4 transnational meetings, 3 computational thinking learning and training activities and 3 student challenges or \u2018teachathons\u2019, taking place across the partner countries and involving both students and teachers. The project will culminate in a final training and dissemination event to ensure that learning from the project is integrated into local practice and outcomes from the project are embedded into each region's professional development programme for local schools. The project will also create an international network through which teachers can work together on resources and documentation to support ongoing progression in their learning and collaboration around computational thinking.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe transnational nature of the project will enable each partner to apply methods developed in other countries\u2019 contexts and to learn from best practice outside of their immediate environments. Tasks have been divided into 5 work packages ( PROJECT MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION, LEARNING AND TEACHING ACTIVITIES, CURRICULUM IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION)  and distributed democratically among the country coordinators on the basis of their expertise. The 5 pilot schools will serve as local \"role models\" for all other schools within the reach of each educational center. \r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe project will result in establishing clear evaluated and documented knowledge, approaches and pedagogies for the teaching and learning of computational thinking on both a partnership and individual level. Results will include:\r\n-- the improved digital competence of teachers, students and policy makers taking part in the project. \r\n-evaluated and documented  approaches and pedagogies for the teaching and learning of computational thinking that can be disseminated at a local, regional, national and international level.\r\n-- a shared website where all results and resources, materials and lessons plans will be accessible.\r\n- a norm critical framework that can be used to teach computational thinking in an inclusive way\r\n- an increased awareness of ICT implementation in schools all around Europe.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nA generation of European citizens growing up with with these valuable computational thinking skills and high levels of digital competency will secure a successful economic and community engagement on a global level.

As such the aim of the project is to enable our staff to deliver high quality Spanish lessons  ensuring good progression from year group to year group. We would like Spanish language and culture to become embedded in the school culture. The curriculum will be delivered more effectively when the teachers have the subject knowledge, confidence and experience of Spanish culture. Immersion courses allow a fully encompassing experience whereby the teachers are exposed to the language and culture over a five day intense period which allows greater progress and deeper understanding of the language and social aspects. There will be 20-24 participants, some participants will attend more than one language course.

A challenge because we need to ensure that those student make their expected academic progress or above it during their KS1 & KS2 education; and an opportunity because it is widely documented that in the long run bilingual students over perform those pupils who only speak one language. In other words we are educating some students who in the future could have brilliant academic and professional careers because of their perceived ability to access some of the best universities in the world.  That is why the sustained promotion of bilingualism in our school is vital ingredient for the level of academic and pastoral care we must offer to our young students and their families.\r\n\r\nAnother long term objective, as a result in the promotion of staff language training and bilingualism in our school, is a more cohesive and integrated school community, something that can never be underestimated in terms of its emotional, social and academic impact. This project will allows not only to deliver better cross-curricular lessons and language tuition but also will help us set up the tone for a much more successful relationship with parents and students.
