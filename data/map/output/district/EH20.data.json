The aim is to embed and integrate the teaching of French from Primary 1-7 (L2) and build on the work already done by the class teachers and the French Learning Assistant the school has had this year. The Primary 4 teacher has a basic understanding of French at Standard Grade level. This teacher has learned Spanish and some Mandarin in recent years and would relish this opportunity to develop more understanding of French. Having learned Mandarin on an immersion course she realises that this is one of the most effective ways to learn a language in a fast and secure way. In order to meet the expectation of the 1+2 Approach this teacher would like to take part in this immersion and is sure that, with her ability to learn new languages, she will quickly improve her basics and grammar to a confident level.  In addition to this the application includes two Development Officer, with primary and visiting language specialist background.  By taking part in this project, they will be able to support developing similar models for training teachers across Midlothian and in turn develop skills in French and it\u2019s delivery.  The course activities will include learning the target language with native speakers, developing a greater cultural awareness, developing new methods of teaching languages, and discovering ways to engage learners through the use of ICT. The courses offer valuable training in the teaching of European languages to young learners via observations and tutorials. The language selected is French as this is planned as Midlothian Council\u2019s L2 in line with the 1+2 Languages recommendations from the Scottish Government.  This will have an impact on the school plans and at a local and national level.The anticipated outcomes resulting from this project are an increase in language capacity, staff confidence in teaching French and an improvement in the language learning experience of our pupils, earlier accessibility of language learning in P1 and, though not a policy requirement, nursery. There will be increased use of ICT to support linguistic development, including E- twinning opportunities.  The inclusion of the Development Officers will ensure they are able to offer continued opportunities for career long professional learning (CLPL) in language teaching.The ultimate goal in the longer term will be to raise attainment in languages, increase the uptake of languages at secondary school and ensure the young people of Midlothian are given every opportunity to broaden their horizons for life and employment opportunities across Europe and the world.", "http://www.loanhead.mgfl.net", "Loanhead Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023727_coordinator"]]}}, "9HG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "Paradykes Primary School", 3804.0, 1, 1, "The application is for 2 primary teachers and a Development Officer from Paradykes School to take part in immersion courses to increase language capacity in line with the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 Languages Approach.

Neglected zoonoses, such as anthrax, rabies, brucellosis, bovine TB, zoonotic trypanosomiasis, echinococcosis, cysticercosis and leishmaniasis, are major causes of ill-health in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Production animals and companion animals of significant societal value act as reservoirs for transmission to man, and the burden of these diseases on affected communities is compounded by the adverse effects many diseases have on the productivity of livestock and hence the livelihoods of the poor. Control of these diseases in animals represents an opportunity to address the constraints they pose to both human health and animal productivity, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and the MDGs.  Effective control in animals will require scientific innovation to identify and (where necessary) develop tools for diagnosis, for quantification of disease burdens, and for control.  Public engagement at all stakeholder levels will be needed to ensure that strategies are appropriate for use in affected communities and are adopted within the policy framework of affected countries.  The project will: (i) map and review research activities at a global level, (ii) survey and assess the burden of zoonoses in communities, (iii) improve or develop disease control tools as appropriate for conditions in affected countries, with private sector inputs where appropriate, (iv) develop cost-effective control and prevention strategies taking into account economic, sociological and cultural factors as well as traditional knowledge, (v) build capacity in ICPCs through technology transfer and training and (vi) empower communities and policy makers to utilise control and prevention strategies appropriately and effectively.", null, 6448262.0, 18, 22, "ICONZ", null, "http://www.lab901.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/143621.jpg", "fp7_90293_998260854"]]}}}}
