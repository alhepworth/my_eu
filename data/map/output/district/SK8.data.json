Furthermore the last European elections and numerous elections in the Member States in recent times show, that there is a growing absenteeism of young people combined with an increasing European scepticism. This development and the complex situation of young people in transition to adulthood call for trained and experienced professionals in the field of youth work. \r\n\r\nDriven by our members, the \u201cYES Academy\u201d project contributes to achieve a greater impact of the Inclusion and Diversity Strategy in youth work leading to increased active citizenship of young people:\r\n\u2022 To create a more inclusive environment, with more and diverse young people participating in civic activities throughout Europe.\r\n\u2022 To enable organisations working with and for young vulnerable people to be a more effective force \u2013 to make it easier for young people to actively participate \r\n\u2022 To increase the capacities of individual youth workers and their organizations in working with young people and to foster greater cooperation among organisations and other sectors throughout the EU\r\n\r\nThe idea for the project came from our partner organizations that have an ongoing interest in increasing civic participation of disadvantaged young people. All the project partners bring strong expertise in working with young people affected by social inequalities (educational, emotional, economical etc.) in their own communities. Ranging from school social work to street-based work, our partners aim to prevent, resolve and avoid the worst effects of exclusion and help young people flourish. \r\nOver the span of 16 months, the YES Academy project will include four events for youth workers including an international seminar, two contact-making events, and a study visit. The project aims to reach 115 participants from 15 different European countries. The first event builds a common approach based on mutual understanding. Using interactive methods, participants present their experience applying concepts and methods concerning young people\u2019s engagement, active citizenship, participation and social inclusion. The second contact-making event will conclude the learning activities and summarise the experiences into an action-oriented report on how to be more effective in reaching young people and to make it easier for young people to actively participate in society. In addition, our international seminar organised in Brussels will foster a space for exchange of good practices and information between participants and high-level EU stakeholders in the EU policy field of Youth. Here we aim to be in dialogue with European policy makers as well as public bodies involved in youth social inclusion, youth unemployment, and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project will culminate in a study visit in Finland co-organised with After Eight, an organization with a long standing experience in the development of youth active citizenship, participation and social inclusion. The event offers an in-depth look into After Eight\u2019s implemented measures and projects with young people, their methodology and their political, financial and administrative infrastructure. The event will provide youth workers with space for reflection on different approaches, methods and perspectives, as well as an opportunity to exchange experience with their professional colleagues. Finally, activities facilitating transfer into practice will take place to analyse ways to promote and use constructively the knowledge gained during the project visits and adapt it to reflect participant\u2019s own context and working environments.\r\n\r\n\u201cYES Academy\u201d will innovatively combine a process-oriented learning approach that prioritises youth worker reflection on key issues with an aim to produce tools for sustainable approaches in working more effectively with young people in Europe. The envisioned tangible results of the project include:\r\n\u2022 policy recommendations for European youth work on promoting active citizenship among young people, as well as involving young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in democratic decision-making processes;\r\n\u2022 a good practices guide for youth workers throughout Europe on issues of active citizenship and youth social inclusion; \r\n\u2022 an action-oriented final report that will summarize the case studies of good examples for inclusive youth work. \r\n\r\nThe expected learning results for youth workers are:\r\n\u2022 deeper knowledge of structures and support measures for young people in the Member states of the participants,\r\n\u2022 qualitative support for the dialogue between with different stakeholders in the field on Youth on issues of young people with fewer opportunities,\r\n\u2022 greater knowledge and implementing new transferable models for supporting active citizenship of young people with fewer opportunities", "http://www.togethertrust.org", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012744_22"], [2015, "Youth political participation: Level up!", "Together Trust", 24347.0, 5, 6, "CONTEXT This project is building upon another youth exchange organised by the YES Forum in July 2015 on European Citizenship. Based on the young people\u2019s follow-up ideas it was decided that the topic of the current project should be active citizenship. This is an area which seems very distant and inaccessible to young people with fewer opportunities and there is a danger that citizenship becomes yet another area of exclusion as active citizens appear to be generally more highly educated than their peers. Hence, there is a clear need to address the issue of young people with fewer opportunities being grossly underrepresented in formal and alternative modes of political participation. Through the activities in this project we aim to enhance the young people\u2019s knowledge and understanding of active citizenship and provide them with the skills necessary for active political participation at both EU level as well as local, regional, and national level. Furthermore the goal of the project is to enable the young participants to see both the value of engaging with the political process, as well as becoming confident to pursue opportunities for meaningful political participation. OBJECTIVES The objectives of the project are:- Enhance the knowledge and understanding of young people with fewer opportunities of active citizenship - Provide young people with fewer opportunities with the skills necessary for active political participation  - Increase self-empowerment and self-esteem of young people with fewer opportunities- Enhance intercultural awareness of young people with fewer opportunities - Improve foreign language competences of young people with fewer opportunitiesNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThere will be 36 participants, out of which 24 will be young people facing educational difficulties , economic obstacles, cultural differences (immigrant background, minorities), and/or social obstacles. The participants should preferably be at their first transnational project experience.  The rest of 12 are the group leaders and interpreters. The young participants should be between 16 and 30 years old. The group of participants remains the same for both activities.DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESThe preparatory meeting will take place in Stuttgart, Germany, on the YES Forum\u2019s premises, 15-16/02/ 2016. During the meeting they will review the project\u2019s schedule, activities, methods, evaluation, risks, and venues. As part of the first exchange in May, in Strasbourg, it is planned that the young people participate 2 days at the European Youth Event 2016 organised by the European Parliament. At the meeting it will also be discussed how the young people will contribute to the EYE.The first exchange in Strasbourg, 16-21/05/2016, hosted by Itin\u00e9raire Internationale, will have 6 days of activities.  The theme will be empowerment and will address access to rights and the importance of political participation by young people, with a focus on EU level participation. There will be workshops on active citizenship, preparation for and participation at the EYE 2016, an event aimed at including them in the EU-level decision-making process.The second exchange, hosted by the Stiftung Evangelische Jugendhilfe St. Johannis in Bernburg, 22-26/08/ 2016, will have 5 days of activities. This exchange will be an opportunity to reflect on the experience at the EYE 2016 and build upon it, as the same young people should participate in both activities. But the focus will be on the skills and knowledge necessary for participation of young people at local, regional, and national levels.METHODOLOGY The key concept of the project is based on non-formal learning approaches encouraging the active involvement of participants, giving them space to take an active role, express themselves and share their own experience. The following methods will be used in the project: icebreaking games, team building exercises, situational games, individual and group work, interactive presentations, open discussions, field visits, practical work, outdoor activities, and common project development.IMPACT AND LONGER TERM BENEFITSEncouraging young people to become active citizens has benefits for the young people as well as the communities in which they live. Giving the participants the opportunity to debate, explore first-hand, and reflect on active citizenship, will help them realise their full potential and encourage them to play an active role in their society, while their participation in a transnational youth exchange could improve their mobility. Furthermore, becoming more self-confident and able to communicate more easily could help them in the long term to access educational and professional opportunities they did not even dare to previously consider. Encouraging young people, especially those with fewer opportunities, to become active citizens has positive impact on the community and the societies the young people live in.", "http://www.togethertrust.org", null, "erasmus_2015-3-DE04-KA105-013253_3"], [2018, "Garga'n'Europe", "Together Trust", 7591.0, 2, 3, "The Special Education School Gargasindi from Calp main aim is the full inclusion of the students, betting on all those projects directed to favour the social interaction and participation of its student body at the same time we must assure a high-qualitiy education compliant with the individual needs of all of them.\r\nThe centre counts on an important career regarding the specialization of its professional team in different fields (new technologies, development disorders, sensorial integration, behavioural-cognitive intervetion, and so on) in order to let not only offer this high-quality educative response but also to lead us to establish ourselves as a Centre of reference of Resources for the rest of professional people of our influence area to keep spreading good practices and methodologies of specific intervention for the student body with functional diversity.\r\nThe purpose of carrying out this Mobility European Project (KA101) emerges so, from the necessity of improving the linguistic competence of the English language professionals since that can allow us to access to a greater amount of scientific and informational knowledge at the same time it pushes us to desire and want to take part in European Projects in the future that pass through the collaboration and cooperation between the different partners around Europe.\r\nOn the other hand, to cover the specialization needs and be able to offer a proper advice and orientation to the Education Community form which we take part, it is needed to go in depth with those educational experiences on the European level which, based on the good practices, let us know and develope strategies of valid intervention for our educational reality; at the same time we accomplish another objective as important as this, which is to spread and make public our centre and those innovative practices that we work as on an international level.\r\nThe activities that we value they lead us to our purposes are, in the first place, those related to the training in its two methods: specific of English language but also in English language for the training en drama methodologies, in order to achieve a greater ability and fluency through the learning of susceptible contents to enrich our project of dramatic arts.
