This is of particular concern, as a much wider range of air pollutants are found at high levels indoors than outdoors. Indoor air quality is a major concern to businesses, building managers, tenants, and employees because it can impact the health, comfort, well being, and productivity of building occupants, as most Europeans spend up to 90% of their time indoors and many spend most of their working hours in an office environment. Studies conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others show that indoor environments sometimes can have levels of pollutants that are actually higher than levels found outside. In spite of the obvious need to better control and manage the quality of indoor air, no European legislation or norm currently defines indoor air quality auditng and management systems, leaving it to the member states' responsibility to define air quality targets and risk levels, certification procedures and audit management processes. AIRLOG proposes a web-based Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Audit Management platform that will save specialized SMEs up to 40% of the cost of performing audits, helping auditors improve their audits and clients better understand the IAQ process. AIRLOG\u2019s Decision Support System will learn from past experiences and propose the most effective Best Practice mitigation actions to ultimately improve IAQ control and healthier conditions in EU buildings. The link between sustainable building design, energy-efficient management and green procurement will be actively fostered by AIRLOG, through the development of a unique knowlegde base at EU level on successful indoor air management practices for various building types in various EU areas.", 189986.0, 1233772.0, 7, 10, "AIRLOG", null, "http://www.greenairmonitoring.co.uk", null, "fp7_101121_965986335"]]}}, "2AW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "PERMETTRE AUX JEUNES EN FORMATION PAR ALTERNANCE DE S'IMMERGER PROFESSIONNELLEMENT DANS UN PAYS EUROPEENACCOMPAGNER LES PROFESSIONNELS A VIVRE UNE MOBILITE EUROPEENNE POUR MIEUX APPREHENDER UNE MISSION D'ENSEIGNEMENT OU UNE IMMERSION EN ENTREPRISE", "SLADES STABLES CIE HOUSE CERTIFICATE", 292814.0, 11, 39, "ENABLE STUDENTS IN AN ALTERNATING SYSTEM TO GET A PROFESSIONAL IMMERSION IN A EUROPEAN COUNTRYThe Regional Federation of MFR (FRMFR) in Brittany undertakes, in its mission of facilitating networks, 13 MFR located throughout the Breton territory. The 220 young people involved in the Erasmus + program will go to 15 different countries: Romania, Malta, Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Finland, Cyprus and Greece. The young people will leave for a month in a company of one of these countries on the spring season of 2017.

They aim the alternating training and social and professional integration of young people. As such, an immersion in a European country should allow young people to better adapt themselves to the jobs of tomorrow. Live a new experience, with different professional practices in host countries, while discovering the cultural characteristics guarantee of openness and personal development should enable greater creativity to flourish in our society and European citizens. The project aims to improve youth employability by acquiring new skills carried out within the framework of a reciprocal process of sharing knowledge while being in compliance with the standards degrees. In addition, training masters and mobility referents of each MFR co- construct term objectives for each young person to discover the host company, organization and progress of tasks and responsibilities assigned. Beyond the strictly professional contributions, language learning will help to overcome shyness in practicing foreign languages and facilitate integration into family units or lodging structures. The challenge is that every young person can, after its training course, become a European citizen engaged and proud of it to create the jobs of tomorrow and improving the competitiveness of Europe.HELP PROFESSIONALS TO  EXPERIMENT A EUROPEAN MOBILITY IN ORDER TO GET A NEW EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING OR AT WORKIn parallel with the mobility of young people in vocational training, the FRMFR wants to mobilize teachers who have a true educational mission to youth. Their responsibilities are great in the implementation of the mobility project but also in the implementation of alternate training, educational project, monitoring alternation business / MFR and social and professional integration of young people. For this, the FRMFR aims to enable 8 teachers to live a European mobility for a week, to meet the objectives of the movement of MFR which are to boost education and teaching teams by strengthening their capacities and skills to re - update their knowledge to progress and innovate in their practices. Sharing experiences will improve the quality of relationships with European partners and particularly institutions, host companies and social partners to enable recognition of qualifications and skills acquired including non-formal situation. Comparison of training systems is rich and allows us to understand another reality that is taking support on these distancing own practices. Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support. Faced with the rapid development of our society, education systems need to modernize and adapt themselves to new ways of teaching and learning by taking all the opportunities that the professional immersion, with our European partners, offers our teachers.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022255_36"], [2017, "PREMIERS PAS VERS L'INTERNATIONALISATION DE NOS JEUNES BRETONS EN MFR", "SLADES STABLES CIE HOUSE CERTIFICATE", 93201.0, 11, 39, "First steps towards the internationalization of our students from Brittany in the MFR schools\r\n\r\nWe wish, as the MFR from Brittany network, to boost mobility activities in order to promote students formal, non formal and informal skills in an international and European economic context.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Federation of the MFR in Brittany (FRMFR) is involved in the Erasmus program and leads 5 schools all over the Breton territory.  61 young students are concerned by the European program, they will leave to 9 different countries: Denmark, Croatia, Poland, the Netherland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland and Greece for a four week- work experience in Spring 2018.\r\n\r\nThis training is a part of their vocational or technical A level studies specializing in farming; Personal help and Territory support, Agronomy and sciences.\r\n \r\nThe mobility project aims to improve the youth employability, by getting abroad new professional skills as part of a reciprocal approach of sharing the knowledge whilst respecting the diplomas framework.

They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded. It should also allow a higher creativity to grow up in our European and citizen society.\r\n\r\nThe European mobility is accessible to all vocational or technical A level students and should allow them to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Practice a foreign language and to improve it\r\n\u2022 Gain new Professional skills\r\n\u2022 Meet new people and discover their culture, their way of life  and their traditions\r\n\u2022 Push themselves\u2019 limits and to take responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the students could, after their studies become involved and proud European citizens able to create their future jobs and to increase the European competitiveness.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035440_30"]]}}}}
