However, they are yet to have created specific tools and methods to mobilize younger generations around cooperative entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, youth organizations benefit from large networks of young people, actively testing, implementing and developing VET methods to actively involve young people around structured projects tackling collective needs, in a democratic way. However, they are still yet to have developed systematic approaches to actively promote and support entrepreneurship among their members.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of CoopStarter 2.0 are the following:\r\n\r\nMain objective: \r\nEstablish a VET Strategic Partnership between cooperatives and youth organizations, aimed at developing a cooperative entrepreneurial culture among young people and youth workers in the EU.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives:\r\n- enabling young leaders to transpose their skills, experiences and approaches into a cooperative entrepreneurial action;\r\n- improving the capacity of CoopMentors to reach young people, and youth workers to support cooperative entrepreneurial initiatives;\r\n- creating sustainable cross-sectoral and transnational workflows between cooperative associations, youth organisations and training centers;\r\n- enabling EU-wide cooperative and youth networks to implement a large-scale dynamic for youth cooperative entrepreneurship at EU level.\r\n\r\nThis pilot project will directly involve a total of 23 participants from 5 EU countries, including:\r\n- 10 young ambassadors, i.e. volunteers in youth organizations or informal groups of young people, and willing to set up a cooperative-related project;\r\n- 10 mentors, among whom 6 CoopMentors and 4 youth workers, willing to develop VET partnership aimed at promoting and supporting youth cooperative entrepreneurship;\r\n- 1 cooperative trainer;\r\n- 2 representatives of EU-wide networks (one network of cooperatives, one network of youth organizations).\r\n\r\nThis project will reach these objectives through three main activities:\r\na. Creating an online Knowledge Base providing VET training and learning material, enabling mentors throughout Europe to stimulate and support the creation of cooperative start-ups by young leaders;\r\nb. Implementing a pilot programme of young cooperative ambassadors, testing and exploiting these project results among a panel of young leaders;\r\nc.

However, there are two important challenges before development of cooperatives.. First, depending on the inadequacies in number of qualified trainers these trainings cannot be done extensively throughout Turkey. Second, these trainings in general are limited to legal, bureaucratic and financial issues. Moreover, it focuses on the rights and responsibilities of the members and financial management topics. It is obvious that existing training programs do not offer solutions to problems like the lack of social capital and culture of working together or inadequacies of digital and e-commerce skills especially for people in rural areas. Neither has it integrated specific training approaches for disadvantaged groups like people in rural areas, women and unemployed people.Taking all these problems into account, this Project aims at contributing to the rural sustainable development by strengthening cooperatives through innovation in the area of adult education for the purpose of improving basic organizational skills of people. Specific objectives of the project are developing a new cooperative training programme through innovation (especially in the areas of e-commerce, marketing, branding and promotion as well as communication and working together), strengthening the capacity of stakeholders  and trainers in trainings for cooperatives , increasing number and participants of cooperative trainings as well as increasing the skills and competencies of cooperative administrators/members  and dissemination of best practices.To realize these objectives,  under the leadership of Ankara Development Agency;  Directorate of Trade, , Directorate of Agriculture, Food and Livestock, Governorships of Nall\u0131han and Beypazar\u0131 came together with Legacoop Puglia, Cooperative College and DGRV which have extensive knowledge and expertise on cooperatives. .

It is true that youth organisations operating at EU level or at national level are struggling to create better politics, better opportunities for young people to allow their voice to be heard. But very often the challenge is at the grassroot level, where the contact with young people is more personal. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create a space where young people operating in local youth platforms in various EU countries are able to share and exchange good practices on common topics of interest such as youth participation, active citizenship, EU awareness and social inclusion without other intermediary youth structures. This ideas has received good feedback during the EU Youth Conference in Luxembourg 2015 and indicated as possible solution for empowering young people at local level and for giving an international perspective and strengthening the role of R/L youth platforms, as according to the Revised Charter on the Participation of Young People in Local and Regional Life.\r\nThe main goals of the project, in accordance with the Erasmus+ Programme objectives are:\r\n- to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level;\r\n- to allow organisations to develop and reinforce networks, increase their capacity to operate at transnational level, share and confront ideas, practices and methods.\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n- to share and exchange best practices related to the youth field, namely youth participation, active citizenship, EU awareness and social innovation in various EU countries;\r\n- to establish a European network of Regional and/or Local Youth Platforms (i.e., youth forums, councils, parliaments or other similar youth structures) in legal terms with an appropriate governance structure;\r\n- to strengthen the international cooperation among youth platforms operating at regional and local levels in various EU countries;\r\n- to formulate a set of minimum standards for the establishment and the functioning of youth platforms at regional and local level and how to meet principles\r\n- to develop a shared medium and long term strategy related to the common topics, namely youth participation, active citizenship, EU awareness and social inclusion and equity\r\n- to increase youth participation and to foster empowerment of young people at local level.\r\n\r\nThe partnership of the project is wide in terms of geographical area and very diverse as type of organisations.

Objective: to acknowledge the various existing forms of R/L Youth Platforms in each P's country and to individuate and to create a collection of good practices.\r\nActivity N2. Basics for new R/L Youth Platforms. Objective: to create a set of minimum requirements for the establishment of R/L Youth Platforms.\r\nActivity N3. Validation4 Share. Objective: to validate the content produced by partners and integrated with the feedback and ideas emerged after the 2 blended mobility.\r\nActivity N4.
