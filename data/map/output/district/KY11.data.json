Because of the direct and localized treatment, the system is environmentally friendly, with a minimal impact on the ecology of the lake.The new water robot concerns the retrieval, prevention and abatement of harmful algae blooms in lakes and in inland water reservoirs used for drinking water production.<br/>In lakes and reservoirs, species of blue-green algae and their concentrations can vary locally due to wind or water flow direction and local variations in temperature, nutrients and depths. In lakes and reservoirs, hotspots of blue-green algal blooms can be often detected only in one area of the water body whereas other area's experience no problems due to blue-green algae. Therefore, it is important to map the algal concentration over extended at flexible, different area's in order to localize algal hotspots. The mobility of the robot will allow targeted intensive algae reduction at hotspot locations, thereby increasing the efficiency of the abatement measure.<br/>Measurements directly related to algae concentration will be combined with measures of water quality and dimension related parameters to locate the algae, make an estimation of the local water quality and hydrographic parameters.<br/>This new robotic approach offers the first cost-effective method to control algal blooms in larger lakes, reservoirs, canals and rivers with low water velocity (< 1 m/s). With DRONIC technology blooms of blue-green algae will be treated locally at the place where the blooms are present and there is no need to treat the complete surface of the lake or reservoir anymore.

Glaucoma is an age-related major cause of blindness. The eye disease is characterized by an irreversible damage to the optic nerve head caused by increased intra-ocular pressure. The current screening and basic diagnostics for the disease involve intra-ocular pressure measurement, visual field tests and detection of structural damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer. The present methods have high rates of false positive or false negative results since the in depth analysis of optical nerve head damage is not possible due to the poor resolution of available optical technologies. A leading candidate is optical coherence tomography (OCT), but the required axial resolution is ~1 \u03bcm, well beyond the 3-5 \u03bcm resolution of commercial systems.  GALAHAD aims to develop a label free, compact and easy to operate high resolution diagnostic OCT system. The multiband and multimodal system will use submicron ultra-high resolution polarisation sensitive OCT (UHR PS OCT). The key breakthrough elements are: (i) A revolutionary low cost multiband supercontinuum light source. (ii.) Ground-breaking ultra-broadband photonic components required to exploit such a source. (iii.) Automated glaucoma screening algorithms: using end user evaluation of cell and animal models and tissue samples, automated algorithms will be developed, trained and tested so that non-expert operators will be able to perform glaucoma screening.
