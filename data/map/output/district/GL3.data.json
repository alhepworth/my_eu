We also expected that they will have more confidence to experiment with different tools and approaches to developing competencies for employability of young people they are working with. By improving our participants' competencies, we are improving their future practice and thus impacting positively on the work of their organisations. Partners of this project are implementing number of youth work activities, and we expect that their project quality will be improved by using new tools that will acknowledge efforts of youth work in increasing employability of young people, which will give them new confidence in working with youngsters. In turn, we believe that these new approaches will attract more young people to partner organisations. N addition, partner organisations will use new possibilities offered by Erasmus+ programme. Finally, it is expected that young people, beneficiaries of partner organisations, should benefit from increased employability. They will have new tools that would help them recognise and develop their competences and link them to their employability and advantage on the labour market. \r\nWe expect that the long term benefits of this project will be giving confidence to youth workers to help young people increase their employability through youth work, as well as more innovative and creative tools for facilitating learning and increasing competencies of young people available in European youth field.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-CY02-KA105-000446_8"], [2015, "Young and Enterprising", "Gloucestershire Mentoring and Support CiC", 12514.0, 4, 4, "Gloucestershire Mentoring and Support CiC from Cheltenham (UK) is applying to host groups of young people from Gottingen (Germany), Pau (France) and Torun (Poland) to explore entrepreneurship for young European citizens.

We will then set up four multi-national \"businesses\", splitting the young people form different nations into joint teams.  From here we will run through daily tasks in a variety of methods.  We will explore marketing through a video and graphic design work shop; we will think about product/service design by visiting a successful local and pan-European business to see their product deisgn in action; we will explore ethics in business by visiting a business for adults with learning difficulties and also thinking about the local, unethical history of the slave trade and its heritage at Gloucester Docks.
