These 60 individual mobilities spread between both mobilities will allow to renew the artistic, technical and managerial approaches of the participants and to contribute to strengthen the quality and the internationalization of the projects of social and cultural activities of all those concerned.\r\n\r\nThe singular educational approach opens the way to creativity, adapts itself to the participants\u2019 needs and integrates the experiences of experiential learnings through innovative digital certifications and their recognition through the Youthpass certification. This educational approach will allow to strengthen the language, digital, social and civic skills, as well as the development of the analytical mind, the initiative and the entrepreneurship of all the participants.\r\n\r\nThe learning mobilities aim to make the participants live a positive experience supporting the dissemination of good practices and results of the project to a direct target public of 128 people among the young people and the youth actors involved in the partnership and the indirect target public of 18100 people among the learners.\r\n\r\nThe steering committee of the project is comprised of  the Board members and the employees of both partners. It distributed and planned all the tools and active procedures throughout the life cycle of the project around a longitudinal, appreciative and participating evaluation. Tools which guarantee a full participation of all those concerned to measure the results, the changes and the impact of the project, to give clear expression to its broadcasting and to ensure its sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow to identify the transferable good practices, locally and in Europe, which will contribute to raise the awareness of cultural entreprises in committing themselves in non-formal training so that young people win in mobility and permeability, and so that the local political powers include the strategic importance of the cultural sector in the creation of social and economic wealth for young people.\r\n\r\nIndeed, representing 4,6 % of the European GDP for 3,8 % of the working population, the cultural sector knows a constant growth even in these difficult economic times, and everywhere in Europe, the cultural sector makes a notable contribution in terms of job creations due to its capacity to work transversally making the creative sector \"an essential tool in crisis exit policies\".\r\n\r\nThus, the activities of post-project dissemination within the cultural sector and local political instances will favor the implementation of concrete actions around pragmatic strategies of internationalization which will open opportunities of employability to the young people and new markets of spreading cultural goods and services in Europe and around the world.\r\n\r\nThe European dimension of the project will allow to envisage the sustainability of this cooperation by opening to other operators in Europe and in the world through the design of international projects of social and cultural activities which join the European Union 2020 Strategy, for an intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.", "http://www.sambayabamba.com", null, "erasmus_2016-3-FR02-KA105-012228_1"]]}}, "3LW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Language training", "Trinity High School", 1861.0, 1, 1, "As previously stated to be funded for this course would give the opportunity to raise awareness of the European Union by making links with teacher\u2019s from other European partners met on course.
