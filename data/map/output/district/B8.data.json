This project emerged from the common needs of students and teachers from partner schools to address the issue of violence in schools, reduce absenteeism and dropout.     On the other hand after the needs analysis, there was a institutional need  motivating students to develop Key Competences, in accordance with the implementation of Europe 2020 Strategy, and special to develop English language.     In this context, partner schools found religion as a common theme of interest to attract students to school and participation in project activities, motivating learning of English for communication between partners.      As a mirror of society, school is directly concerned with the question of the place of religion in public life.       The partnership will conduct an exploration of beliefs and values currently held across European countries and Turkey and a comparison between holidays, festivals, tradition and customs.           The target group is: students 13-15 years old, teachers, parents.  The concrete objectives of the project are:- reduce violence in school, dropout and absenteeism- develop basic skills, particularly language skills: mother tongue and English- to create an environment favorable to enhance the European intercultural dialogue among the partners of the project;- to promote and develop creativity among the participants in the project, both teachers and students; - to create a favorable atmosphere for an inclusive education at the level of the partner schools;- to make all the students have equal chances for self development with no discrimination.- to promote common European values, such as: tolerance, respect for other people\u2019 culture and traditions, multiculturalism and linguistic diversity. Subjects to be addressed: - Beliefs and values currently held by participants, their peers and extended families- Practices within religions, and the reasons for them. - The importance of festivals within religious communities, their adoption by non-believers for secular celebrations. Food, clothing and music on these occasions.- The lives and standing of Saints (national and local) within communities. Are there modern day saints and martyrs? - The impact of political regimes on the ability of individuals to practise their faith. Workshop driven underground and how faith survives despite repression- Ancient myths and legends, their continued place / importance in a nation\u2019s culture- social networks as a substitute of religious practicesApproach:- Pupils will be given a high degree of responsibility to develop the project and their own learning. They will be encouraged to use questionnaires, converse with appropriate guests, hold debates, visit faith buildings, and conduct research- They will collaborate to discuss, plan and develop their ideas of how to present the information. They will be encouraged to use as many different formats as possible including electronic, published, 2 and 3 dimensional, dramatic and musical forms.- Pupils will be actively involved in the plans for mobilities and will conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation.   To ensure the quality of our project, the  management team has established a strategy for dissemination and exploitation, a periodic and permanent evaluation strategy,  initial evaluation, evaluation of progress and final evaluation and monitoring plan where prepared a set of tools and methods .Results:- Site and project poster- Newsletter- Dictionary of religious terms in English and partner languages- E- book Traditions of religious holidays- Guide methodical teaching World Religions History- Collection of popular myths and legends- Tourist Guide with important religious buildings and monuments in each countryIntellectual output:- Curricula Intercultural Education for a inclusive school and E- book Blooming Flowers in FestivalsConference: Religion and its impact on child development     We believe that the project fits into the strategic priorities and meet its objectives  about students, will give a a better involvement of parents as active partners in the structuring, development and evaluation of the project activities,  will  create a good opportunity for each school for organization  local partnerships with Churches, Religion institutions, Museums, Libraries, Art Galleries, Houses of Culture, for the realization and implementation of each year\u2019s end\u2013products, will generate  a close collaboration with the local mass\u2013media: magazines, newspapers, strong partnerhips with  the Council Authorities and National Ministery of Education to organize the international seminars and conference.", "http://www.washwoodheath.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-024204_1"], [2018, "Les apprenant de la vie, Cl\u00e9ment Ader aussi 4", "Washwood Heath Academy", 51659.0, 6, 7, "LOL CAT consists in enabling students in their two final year of Nbtec to do their last work placement in a bristish company .
