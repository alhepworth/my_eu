Increasing patient acuity means access to specialty training and high quality intensive care nursing (ICN) education is imperative. There is a need to raise the level of practice to more advanced nursing practice (ANP) roles in order to accommodate these changes.  However not all countries have developed programs to do so and there is a lack of consistency of content among the existing programs. Our recent survey of intensive care units across Europe (n=24 countries) identified: considerable variation in eligibility requirements, how students were assessed/examined and duration of programmes (30 days to 24 months); challenges in providing ongoing education (n=22 countries); and lack of access to educational resources in 6 countries. This variation in baseline creates role confusion between countries, impeding mobility across Europe and career progression for the ICN workforce. \r\nObjectives\r\n1. Use consensus methods to develop a set of competencies required of an advanced level intensive care nurse.\r\n2. Map these competencies against country-specific and multi-country policies and evidence for advanced practice nursing.\r\n3. Identify the feasibility and support the application of these competencies in a number of countries\r\n4. Develop an outline curriculum based on the competencies, freely available online.\r\n5. Map the competencies and curriculum against existing web-based curriculum resources.\r\n6. Develop a prototype online educational resource to support the competencies and curriculum.\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nParticipants will be involved in four activities for the project: \r\n(i) A Delphi study (WP 2): n= 75 -100 drawn from VET & HE sectors, the nursing profession and patient representatives.\r\n(ii) validation of competencies (WP4): n= 72 patient representatives and n= 80 multi-professional team members, including VET educators \r\n(iii) pilot of the online educational resource (WP7): n= 150 ICU nurses and educators \r\n(iv) dissemination activities (WP8): (n= 250 minimum)\r\nDescription of activities\r\nThe INACTIC Project is a 2 year project and will be delivered through a series of Work Packages. In the central WP (WP2) competencies will be developed, using a three-round, online consensus process across 24 countries. At the same time a review of evidence and policy will be undertaken (WP3), the initial outcomes from which will feed into the second round of the WP2 consensus Delphi process. Following development of the competencies, these will be tested in WP4 to determine the applicability and feasibility of the competencies for individual countries. Content validity testing will also be undertaken during this WP, to ensure individual competency statements have wide acceptability. A curriculum will be developed (WP5), mapped against existing resources (WP6) to enable the competencies to be used on completion of the Project. A prototype online educational resource (WP7) will be developed from existing ESICM resources. WPs1 (Project management) and 8 (Dissemination and Exploitation) will underpin the whole project. \r\nMethodology\r\nThis project applies established methods in new situations, across a culturally diverse group of professionals who share the same title. Specifically, we will:\r\n1. Apply the principles of competency-based training in a new situation, developing a pan-Europe model of curriculum for advanced nursing practice in intensive care. \r\n2. Seek feedback from patient representatives in the testing of competencies; this will give patients across countries a unique opportunity to engage as co-creators of the primary project output. \r\n3. Develop a final set of agreed competencies that can be taught and assessed in the workplace.\r\n4. Develop an outline curriculum, interactive map of educational resources and prototype educational resource to underpin the competencies.\r\nResults and Impact envisaged\r\nThe expected impact is that the outputs will be used to underpin new education and training programmes, for validation in VET and HE settings as appropriate to the individual country. \r\nSome benefits will take time to be realised but will be captured by the Project Team after completion: \r\n1. Uptake of the competencies to underpin local education and training programmes.\r\n2. Citation of the outputs in policy guidance for workforce development. \r\n3. Uptake of the on-line educational resource.\r\n4. Acceptance of manuscripts in well-regarded journals, ensuring both wider dissemination and longevity.\r\nIn those hospitals implementing advanced nursing practice for ICU, it will be important to analyse the wider impact on adverse events, workforce resilience (for example, avoidance of burnout and reduced attrition) and clinical decision-making.

Due to the economical crisis the transition from education to job sector is becoming more and more hard and strategies need to be created in order to speed up this process. One of the effective way that everybody has at own disposal nowadays are ICT tools and social media. Young people have constantly access to the Internet and are the best experts in managing social media; nevertheless, they do not always use them in a safe and responsible way. \r\nFor this reason, they may incur in problems not only in terms of personal safety but also by harming their own reputation online, for instance uploading inappropriate contents on their personal social profile, and wasting the opportunity to be a good job candidate on the labour market. \r\nEnterprises\u2019 human resources and job recruiters are exploiting social networks and web platforms more and more to search for suitable candidates; nonetheless in many cases young people seems not be aware of the importance to protect their own reputation online, especially while searching for job opportunities. \r\nTherefore, through this project we aim at responding these needs to well equip youth workers and leaders with knowledge, competences and skills as well as innovative and interactive methodologies to empower the employability of young people.\r\n\r\nThe GENERAL AIM of this project it to promote youth employment through an effective and appropriate use of digital tools, especially social media. \r\n\r\nThe main OBJECTIVES of the training are:\r\n1) Raising awareness among about the use of ICTs and social media as tool for job recruitment and promoting an aware, responsible use of them by young people in order to access to the European labour market\r\n2) Exploring the concept of Digital Identity and Reputation and learning how to create and maintain a good digital reputation\r\n3) Exploring and testing non formal education methodologies (digital mentoring) and other interactive, peer-to-peer tools to be used in youth work, adjusting them to young people specific needs and creating new one.\r\n\r\n The training course will be last 7 days (including 2 travel days) and will take place in Valencia \u2013 Spain from the 6th to the 12th of May 2018. In the project 22 youth workers and leaders will take part, coming from 7 countries: Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Romania, Belgium and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY: All the activities of the training course are based on non formal education and learning by doing methodologies.\r\nThe programme especially focuses on the \u201cdigital mentoring\u201d as a methodology that allow youth workers to guide young people to create and preserve a digital identity and thus becoming suitable candidates on the labour market.\r\nThe mentoring is a strategy that set up a horizontal peer-to-peer learning process that simultaneously benefit both mentor and mentee and allow them to learn form each other. During the TC, participants will be learning about digital reputation and by practicing and testing, they will be also acquiring or improving several technical and transversal competences and skills. During the TC the participants\u2019 learning process will occur through sharing experience, exchanging ideas, practicing and testing new innovative tools, debating, communicating about own culture, etc.\r\n\r\nIMPACT: At the end of the training course, all participants will turn into digital mentors, well-skilled and prepared to mentor young people on how to create a maintain a good digital identity and to exploit adequately social media to successfully enter the European labour market as a future suitable job candidate. Participants will acquire a wide set of technical and transversal skills: couching, counselling, mentoring, managing social media profile, intercultural skills, sense of initiative and innovation.
