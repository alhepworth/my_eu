Due to changes in staffing and changed expectations for Primary Language Teaching for NC 2104, the schools feel that it is time to re-invest in high quality training to refresh Spanish teaching and learning. The main objectives are to:\r\nEquip teachers with the linguistic skills and confidence to deliver high quality teaching and learning experiences in Primary Languages;\r\nRaise the profile of Spanish in the school and local community and improve intercultural understanding;\r\nMeet the needs of the new National Curriculum 2014;\r\nIncrease self-confidence of lower attainers and EAL pupils across the curriculum;\r\nRaise pupil attainment in languages and across all subjects;\r\nRe-energise our \u2018Centre of Excellence\u2019 status for Spanish, in order to act as a support for other schools, both locally and nationally.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to last 2 years, focusing initially on 5 key staff, and then engaging the majority of teaching staff (30 teachers across the Federation) for maximum impact on standards. Many of teachers enjoy language learning and are keen to trial new initiatives in our quest aspiring to be \u2018outstanding\u2019. However, a staff skills audit has shown that most staff hold qualifications in French or other languages, and show less confidence using Spanish. In the past we have been able to offer training ourselves for other schools wishing to develop their language teaching, and now need to refresh our skills, methodology and resources to ensure that we are up-to-date and modelling \u2018outstanding teaching and learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe expectations of NC14 Languages state an increased focus on the development of Reading and Writing, so our project will focus on effective ways of developing these skills with pupils, while maintaining the fun elements of language teaching and learning. Links with partner schools will provide opportunity for pupils to have purposeful communication, and use of e-twinning websites and electronic media will allow teachers to develop and share authentic resources to enhance Literacy skills. By visiting partner schools, Teachers will strengthen our links and be able to have professional dialogue about effective teaching methods and use of authentic resources. Staff will also undertake intensive language training on a residential course in Santander, from which they should return with improved linguistic competence and confidence in delivering their own Spanish lessons. This will support us in embedding Spanish throughout the curriculum, so that pupils begin to use the language naturally as a tool for communication. We are interested in developing our CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and will have opportunity to observe this in practice during the residential courses in Cantabria. \r\n\r\nDue to the commitment of the whole staff in this project, we expect the impact to be extensive and not only evident in our Spanish language teaching, but on the school as a whole, and then disseminated nationwide. Standards of teaching and learning in all curriculum areas will be elevated, which will impact on pupils\u2019 motivation and enthusiasm. This may affect their uptake of languages in further education. As small schools in areas of high deprivation, many of our pupils do not have great opportunities to develop their intercultural understanding, so the project would impact on pupils and parents\u2019 attitudes. Furthermore, as we share the outcomes with local media, we expect the school\u2019s profile within the local community to be raised, which could increase pupil stability and our numbers on roll, while attracting new staff. Teachers will be better equipped to meet the needs of National Curriculum 2014, i.e. Language teaching with an increased focus on reading and writing in the target language. Standards in other areas will improve e.g. Literacy due to pupils\u2019 phonological awareness and grammatical understanding being developed in language lessons.

AKU is a genetic deficiency of homogentisic acid dioxygenase, causing high levels of homogentisic acid (HGA). Oxidation of HGA to pigment polymer, termed ochronosis, alters connective tissues. This leads to multisystemic damage dominated by premature severe arthritis. Currently, multiple arthroplasty is inevitable since AKU is incurable and there is no effective palliative therapy. No data exists regarding the presence or absence of ochronosis before age 30 years. Hence, it is unknown whether treatment is necessary before then.

EU states with a less established data centre industry and  footprint, but with a need for it to grow can benefit greatly from the knowledge transfer, insight, experience and raised profile.\n\nInitial research and workshops held between industry leaders and academic institutions within UK, The Netherlands and Germany has confirmed that Europe would benefit greatly from the creation of a Pan-European Data Centre Research and Development Academy.\n\nMost data centre related standards, guidelines and research comes from the USA which often causes a confusing mix of conflicting information with little relevance to Europe.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop strategies which balance, on an individual basis, therapeutic effectiveness with risks of treatment.\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to develop and validate a treatment algorithm for PIBD based on high or low risk predictors for early complicated or relapsing disease. This will improve effectiveness, while reducing treatment related risks and life-long complications due to uncontrolled disease progression.\n\nTo attain this goal 3 specific aims are proposed under the umbrella of an international network, the 'PIBD-net': \n1) Development of an accessible and feasible risk-stratified treatment algorithm for new onset paediatric IBD on an existing inception cohort and validation in an independent cohort\n2) Generation of a prospective large longterm real world inception cohort in a registry designed to analyze effectiveness and safety signals and correlate them to individual risk factors \n3) Design and performance of a risk algorithm-based prospective large-scale multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) (stratification into high or low risk groups based on specific aim#1) in order to provide optimal personalized therapy : low risk azathioprine vx. methotrexate, high risk : methotrexate vx. adalimumab\nThis project will translate into the first risk-stratified PIBD treatment algorithms allowing optimization of medical therapy while minimizing treatment-related risk (personalized medicine).\n\n'", 58964.0, 5142559.0, 7, 13, "PIBD-SETQuality", null, "http://www.aimes.net", null, "h2020_199745_956000476"], [1485907200000, 1496188800000, "Low Energy X Ray Sterilizer \u2013 bringing OEM medical device sterilization in house and streamlining production", "Enxray Limited", "The sterilization of medical devices (such as implants, artificial joints, syringes, blood bags), as well as \u2018tetrapacks\u2019, food packaging, and even wine corks, is currently performed by third-parties.

Many new medical devices cannot be sterilized through radiation and can only be sterilized through chemical gas processes that results in harmful gases remaining in the packaging which can be harmful to end users of the products such as hospital staff. Moreover, medical device sterilization is currently not properly documented and controlled, often causing broad product recalls should a single product be found to be non-sterile. This adds  further expense and delay due to the need to repeat the sterilization process. EnXray has developed an innovative sterilization machine that delivers high efficiency ionizing radiation, using low energy Xray\u2019s to reach the Sterility Assurance Level, in an affordable manner enabling safe on-site and on-demand sterilization of medical devices.

Our programme is designed to put building blocks in place to enable PM to respond to the challenges it faces in delivering projects successfully in the 21st century. It does this by taking a multi-disciplinary perspective encompassing PM, lean management, psycho-social aspects, innovation and change management. The building blocks will have three broad pillars: one focused on PM efficiency (being Lean), one on PM systems that meet the psycho-social needs of project staff (being Seen) and one on making PM responsive to the need of organisations to be innovative and manage change (being Lean and Seen). The programme will cater for different contexts of project delivery in developed and developing countries, to reflect the global and interconnectedness nature of projects.
