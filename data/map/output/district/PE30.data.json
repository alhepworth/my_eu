It aims to form youth workers to trainings and workshop activities,  to develop a united European network among the youth supporting the use of visual arts as anon formal education tool and to promote citizen expression.\r\n\r\nIts objectives are:\r\n- To develop instruments tools and methods to use visual arts in non formal education and for citizens expression projects, having precise objectives of learnings and skills\r\n- To provide the participants technical expertise and practice on photography, video and graphic design\r\n- To practice tools and methods for team building and collective work, project management,  organization of cultural events, tools of communication, dissemination and follow up in order to plan actions back in their country\r\n- To create a space for exchange of experiences for youth workers and facilitate them to share their best practices through workshops, helping each other to develop their training skills\r\n- To assess best practices and common pitfalls to realize a document of best practices of visual arts in non formal education and for citizen expression\r\n- To develop a common understanding between participants and organizations to support innovative project on the subject\r\n- To discuss future means of distribution of knowledge to extend the impacts of the project at a local and regional level and promote it\r\n- To create an European network that will share ideas and work together during following projects\r\n\r\nThe project will be held in the region and will gather 31 youth workers coming from 9 program countries. The participants which the project will gather are all members of the youth partner organisations, interested to develop their competences and to multiply the effects of the project within their local communities. The target group is composed of youth workers, trainers, motivated youth on the subject or project managers all actively involved in the youth sector and having experience in non formal education with arts. \r\n\r\nThe program of the course will be based on non formal education and will be conducted using an interactive and participative approach. Active group/team work, role-plays, outdoor activities and plenary discussions, as well as theoretical inputs and technical learning will characterize the program of the course in order to cover all aspects of the project themes. Special attention will\r\nbe paid to the fact that competences and knowledge transmitted during the course remain sustainable and transferable. This will be achieved by setting up enough space and time for reflection and evaluation, by providing expertise, documentation, handouts and guidance from the trainers\u2019 team. The trainers of this course are experienced professional artists specialised in their field of photography, video and graphic design. The experience of all the stakeholders will be valued as a ressource for the whole group in order to achieve transfer of competences and best practices sharing. This will be essential for the sustainability of the project, to develop further activities at a local level and between the involved countries. The course will be based on the specific learning needs of the participants. The team of trainers will create a learning and exchanging space, where participants are encouraged and coached to use their creativity and personal reflection to train, work with youth, design new workshops and achieve development of themselves at personal and professional levels. A finished workshop pack of methods will be given to the participants at the end of the training so that they can use it at their return. Tools will be taught and, on the basis of their already existing projects in their sending organizations, participants will be also invited to share good practices, to exchange useful information, work intensively in order to improve their training skills with youths in regards to the subject of this training course and organize workshops in their respective countries.\r\nThe project also aims to equip participants with a sense of initiative and an active european citizenship feeling, to encourage involvment to be transferred later to the target groups with which the participants work on a daily basis and within their local communities in order to achieve multiplying effect. The local communities will benefit of the added value of this training course and get involved in initiatives and actions on the topic which the participants will be better able to organize after their participation at this training course.\r\nTherefore, on a long term basis the project will create a European network to improve skills, best practices, and set up fundaments for a real consideration of visual arts as a mean of non formal learning and citizen expression, that increase creativity, self reflexion, critical mind and youth participation in society for sustainable social changes.", "http://www.kingslynnarts.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR02-KA105-009699_6"], [2014, "Ensemble avec l'Art et la Musique", "King's Lynn Arts Centre Trust", 12078.0, 2, 2, "Together we will discuss the art , especially theater, dance and music.

Sedu wishes to works as a pioneer of internationalization with collaboration between its regional and international partners.  International mobility numbers are used as measure for the development work and an indicator for the success of the strategy.\r\n\r\nSedu has invested in advancement of international mobility and aims for the controlled growth of both student and staff mobility. Mobilities are financed by Erasmus + programme, education centre\u2019s own funds and with the project funds from Finnish Board of Education. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the mobility periods of the students and staff that funded by the Mobility Charter have been the significant part of our school\u2019s international operations. Alongside the mobilities the home internationalization is the second key priority of the international operations. Vocational Education Center Sedu also accepts big amounts of students from our foreign educational partners, which also supports our home internationalization.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mobility statistics of the year 2016 the long term exchange periods of the students has been significantly grown since the previous year, and steady growth is expected in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we seek to ensure the equal opportunity participation in mobility periods for students from all sectors and all ages. Boys have been less interested in the past for participating in exchange periods and so in the future we will give more attention to this fact in the recruitment process. We will also give more attention to the fields that have been participating less in exchanges in the past and additionally the VALMA \u2013 preparatory training students are guaranteed to participate in the mobilities equally with the assistance of supporting staff for the whole period.\r\n\r\nAdult education and apprenticeship-training students\u2019 interest towards international activities is increasing and Sedu is dedicated to increase the demand further. In the light of the vocational education reform, foreign exchange periods can be seen as one of the natural possibilities for personalization and implementation of the personal education pathway.

The situation is also creating division in the EU countries over how best to deal with resettling people. This new situation brings new requirements for knowledge, skills and competences in different fields of work in society. Many transversal skills are crucial on this agenda. Work places and tasks are very often related to dealing with people from different cultural backgrounds. The world of work in safety and security will be more complex and the education offered will need to prepare professionals for this. In some of the countries transversal skills form already a part of the learning outcomes in qualifications, in some of them not yet. Even if these competences are already embedded in the curriculum, they are not yet made visible in learning processes or supported by pedagogical methods or learning environments. OBJECTIVESThe E4S project aims to \u2022 improve and increase multicultural competence among teachers and staff working in private security sector and in immigration services\u2022 increase background knowledge of refugee crisis among teachers and staff in security sector from which also the authorities can benefit\u2022produce learning material and related pedagogical methods to support the students when acquiring these skills and competences.Another issue currently in the agenda in safety and security education is raising awareness on facts related to terrorism. It will be another topic dealed with in the project.METHODOLOGY IN CARRYING OUT THE PROJECTThe consortium of colleges and working life partners will develop the content and pedagogical methods for the vocational upper secondary qualification in safety and security/uniformed services: International Security Operations unit (15 competence points/ECVET points). This unit of learning outcomes will be produced  in cooperation with project partners and external stakeholders. The material produced will serve not only the learners, teachers and trainers presently in VET centers, but also authorities and companies planning and implementing in-service-training for their employees. The lifelong learning perspective is served to a large extent.The learning material with the pedagogical approaches where close cooperation with work life is at the centre, will support the implementation of learning outcomes based approach. The learning material produced will be prepared to support blended learning as a pedagogical approach and this way it will also support the acquisition of digital skills. The material produced will be distributed via project website.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS10 VET schools from 5 partner countries (Ireland, UK, the Netherlands, Hungary and Finland) and several silent partners  (companies, national authorities) from each country will participate in the project.Target groups/actors:\u2022 safety and security and uniformed services\u2019 teaching staff \u2022 safety and security students\u2022 personnel of private security companies. \u2022 national authorities (quality assurance).DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESIn the beginning of the project a survey on multicultural competence needs is planned for students, teachers and stakeholders. The results will be analyzed in the kick off meeting. This will be followed by 4 staff training workshops and one multiplier event in the end of the project. Each workshop will concentrate on one of the main topics of the learning material and pedagogics.RESULTSInternational Security Operations unit (15 competence points/ECVET points) including a practical plan with learning outcomes will be produced  in cooperation with project partners and external stakeholders.  IMPACTThe integration of vocational and common vocational units is one of the key issues in developing vocational education and training .  This is considered to be a way to support the acquisition of general working life skills and as such, very relevant when seeking employment in the 21st century labor market. This learning material will meet various skills requirements of common vocational units and support the developing of the skills related to key competences. As refugee crisis is a common issue all around Europe, the project will support with its outcomes the quality and labor market relevance of safety and security field education in Europe to a large extent. POTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFITSInvolvement of companies and national authorities such as the Finnish Immigration Service, will guarantee the quality and relevance of the unit created in the project. It will bring added value to each education provider of the network by increasing the labor market relevance of the education of the field on question. This will not only be an added value on implementing learning outcomes based approach in education, but also the attractiveness of safety and security field education among potential students.", "http://www.cwa.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA202-022710_5"], [2015, "Move on!", "THE COLLEGE OF WEST ANGLIA", 178109.0, 12, 16, "The European Agency for Vocational Education and Training, Cologne Government Regional Office (EUGES), wants to motivate and support further vocational colleges in the Cologne region to provide Europwide mobilities for their VET students. Moreover, the EUGES motivates the VET colleges to develop a concept of Europeanisation/ internationalization respectively to strengthen the existing ones. Altogether there are 58 state-run Vet colleges in the Cologne region.  The teachers' mobilities help to get to know future partners for students' exchange personally, to agree on their framework (memorandum of understanding) and to exchange and improve ideas of learning and teaching methods.

In former projects we found out that this kind of support helps enable the VET colleges to later on apply by themselves and feel fit for the implementation of their own mobility projects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we would like to use and disseminate the results of former Transfer of Innovation Projects which focussed on improving the quality of mobilities. In our projects we developped competence matrixes for several VET sections which shall be used now for quality management.

Our students,because of the location of our region  are seldom in contact with other European young people. Besides,as they lack information and self-confidence,they are not likely to leave our area even if they can't find a job here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe positive impact former projects have had on the students in terms of linguistic benefits,professional skills and above all personal skills ( self- esteem,adaptability,independence,self-confidence)but also the interest and desire to work abroad born from the communication on past  work experiences abroad and the dissemination  of the results of these experiences lead us to consider enlarging the training and work placements funded by the Erasmus + programme to all our students whatever their level of qualification.Considering the fact that past mobilities limited the possibility to go on work placements abroad to students preparing for an industrial NVQ level 3 certificate and even for one school to the sole Euro -Electrotechnics CLIL class,we come to think that enlarging the possibility to all our classes requires 81 training grants (about 13 per year per school). This enlargement would give the possibility to maximize the training of all the students whatever their academic results ( this is not a selection criterion) and to boys and girls alike without discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development  of the European dimension involves receiving students from our partners and sending 26 of our teachers on professional training periods abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students ( sent and received) will be placed in companies in strict compliance with the training framework as work placements are an integral part of the training ,are assessed and taken into account for the Diploma.The work placements will be adapted to the students' skills ,in particular their language skills. They will be carefully selected in order to avoid the risk of a failed mobility but make the experience  a complete success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers selected for a mobility will be received by our partner schools abroad  for observing activities,mostly but not only as the final objective is the enrichment of their practice ,other activities can be considered (team teaching).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each school  mobilities will be managed by the steering committee and the teachers concerned by the mobility in close and regular  relationship with the inter-schools steering committee.

We expect  students will gain confidence and awareness that it is possible and necessary to  be mobile to find a job and that mobility can be a driving force for ambition.\r\n\r\nConcerning staff mobility we expect the dissemination of their experience and new  pratices acquired or observed.\r\n\r\nReceiving young Europeans will allow the students who haven't been on work placement abroad to benefit from the exchange.\r\n\r\nAs far as our schools are concerned we hope to increase the number of students who want to attend the CLIL class and /or apply for a mobility.\r\n\r\nIn the long term ,we expect our schools will gain in reputation so that it will be students' choice to enroll in our school and not the result of a lack of possibilities.

The goal is controlled and manageable growth in mobility numbers. International mobility is financed by Erasmus+ programme, schools own funding and the funding channelled by National Board of Education of Finland. Mobilities financed by VET Mobility Charter form significant share of international activities of Sedu. At the same time strong allocation of resources in developing home internationalization supports the quality of mobility actions in the future.  The statistics collected in January 2016 indicate that mobility numbers had increasing trend in 2015. Staff exchanges even went beyond the set goals. We estimate the numbers to stay in growing trend in 2016. In learner mobilities we seek to pursue horizontal increase in relation to numbers of study fields and unitsparticipating in international mobility rather than huge increase in total numbers. Taitaja2016, national Skills competition finals organised by Sedu in May 2016 allows us to bring international actions in VET to spotlight. Significant regional adult education provider JAKK merged in Sedu in January 2016. Number of students went up to 20 000 when counting all education forms. We seek to support the integration activities of JAKK by joined mobility periods.  In the beginning, the emphasis will be in staff mobilities in the field of logistics, which has traditionally been the strong point in JAKKs education provision.In the adult learner mobility, we want to see growing numbers in the coming years. The steering group of Sedu Adult Education set the goals for 2016-2017 for 5 long term adult learner mobilities with the idea of increasing the number up to 20 by the year 2020. Apprenticeship training took even stronger goals by deciding to coordinate a national Erasmus + KA 1 for apprenticeship providers. A new strategy was adopted in January 2016 (attached) in Sedu. It covers the years 2016 to 2020. In the strategy internationality is highlighted and even more visible  than previously. The vision is: Sedu \u2013 local and global forerunner in vocational competence building.  More detailed description of the vision states that \u201c Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks. Four strategic priorities will be the following: student and staff welfare, partnerships and cooperation with the work life, resources and new megatrends. The implementation of the strategical priorities will be defined in action plans to be published by the end of April 2016. International actions are set to be part of priority: partnerships and cooperation with the work life. The feedback received for VET mobility charter application will be adopted as part of the goal setting process for the future international activities. The indicators of international actions will be more focused and more limited in number. Increasing numbers of adult education learner and trainer mobility will be set as one of the priorities as suggested in VET mobility charter feedback. Erasmus+ KA1 instrument allows new way of raising quality in VET by making it possible to bring in international industry lecturers. This will be piloted in the field of agriculture and bioeconomy.New megatrends as priority will also touch the goal setting of international mobility. According to SITRA key megatrends include the global sustainability crisis, the accelerating pace of technological development \u2013 and its impacts on society \u2013 and the intensification of global tensions and everyday interdependence. Naturally, these trends affect the context to which we are training our learners. International mobility allows us to contribute to increasing tolerance of learners and teachers/trainers and by this way lowering tensions between people from different cultures in Europe where the numbers of asylum seekers has risen tremendously.To name one practical example, our partner in Sweden has been a forerunner in educating immigrants from numerous cultural backgrounds. We will be able to offer our teachers and students placements in this school to learn how to see opportunities not only challenges. In latest technological innovations in vocational pedagogics we can even be in a position to share some innovations (Opinlakeus network). Aming other things one of the definitions of the vision: \u201d Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks\u201d will affect implementation of VET Mobility Charter mobilities. To implement the term \u201cboldly\u201d will bring with it even stronger emphasis on teacher/trainer work placements abroad.

CLIL) and materials, openness to Europe, reputation and therefore in terms of positive and active school guidance towards our organisms. \r\n\r\nTo disseminate the project results from local to European level, and to allow other institutions, staff, and students, not directly engaged in the project to take full benefit from it, a massive dissemination and communication process will be implemented, with the organization of local and regional dissemination events, the construction of a project web platform, the partnership with the French department for the education in sustainable development.\r\n\r\nThe topic of the project is a global concern and supports the EU Health strategy \u201cTogether for Health\u201d (which in turn supports the overall EU 2020 strategy): HEALTHY LIFE, it ranges through various fields such as Environment, Food, Sport, Prevention & Safety.\r\nSo, to answer to the question 'How to obtain and maintain a healthy population in Europe?', the project includes various and numerous activities which address all these sub-topics: construction of an electrical vehicle; first aid trainings; physical activities; designing of a healthy menu; drafting of a template weekly program to ensure a healthy way of living (including meals and physical activities); creation of a virtual \"Healthy life\" cookbook; realization of large-scale surveys; advertising campaign for a 'Healthy way of living'; prevention techniques learning for interpersonal conflicts and crisis situations; organization of a 'Healthy day' simultaneously in all the partner schools; construction of a project-related website; ...\r\n\r\nAnd to prepare, organize and implement all these activities, a strong development of collaborative activities is planned at a European level and at a local level between learners, staff and local partners. This is the core of the project.\r\nAll along the project and in each country, the high school students will be involved in all the project activities from the first project presentation to the project\u2019s final report and beyond.

The identified 'needs' in this cohort relate to aspiration, achievement and employability amongst young people who follow the apprenticeship route - if aspiration is about inspiration, and achievement is about opportunity, then employability is about workplace skills - both vocational and personal. \r\nThe identified needs are also reflected in The social context of the college, which echoes its predominantly rural location with pockets of social and economic deprivation - and a relatively high level of economic migration from EU member states such as Poland, Portugal and Lithuania. \r\nThis rural economy is separated from larger centers of population by limited road and rail links whilst the skills of its labor market \r\nare generally below the national average.

These placements will expose participants to new people, new places and new cultural norms, which aims to make them highly receptive to new approaches in the teaching and learning of unfamiliar skills This alternate context will be used to reinforce the Project AVocET goal which is to improve vocational skills capability and enhance the employability of Apprentices, and support teaching Professional Development.\r\nThe content of the project, with a primary focus on experiential learning in a host-employer workplace, will facilitate the acquisition\r\nof both vocational/technical and professional skills and social/language skills, whilst extended exposure to a different culture and lifestyle will help to develop positive attitudes, promote European citizenship/integration, build self-confidence and encourage IVT participants to explore pan-European employment opportunities.
