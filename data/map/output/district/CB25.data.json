We will perform two types of RNA interference drug- and hypoxia-resistance screens: one using reverse transfection of commercial siRNA libraries into previously established RCC cell lines, and one using a novel approach through personalised tumour cDNA derived-shRNA library transduction of ex-vivo cultured autologous tumour cell lines. Bioinformatics integration of these complementary individualised clinical and experimental datasets will enable the rapid and cost efficient identification of predictive biomarkers and simultaneously define molecular mechanisms contributing to intrinsic and acquired drug resistant disease in vivo, yielding additional targets for therapeutic intervention.", 143467.0, 6653321.0, 6, 14, "PREDICT", "http://www.predictconsortium.eu/", "http://www.horizondiscovery.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/157456.jpg", "fp7_97661_989579936"]]}}, "9TU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1391212800000, 1580428800000, "Translating neuroimaging findings from research into clinical practice", "Cambridge Cognition LTD", "Abstract 9\nNeuroimaging (NI) has enormous potential to improve the clinical care of patients with psychiatric disorders, but has yet to deliver. The PSYSCAN project will address this issue directly by developing a NI-based tool that will help clinicians resolve key clinical issues in the management of patients with psychotic disorders. Clinicians will use the tool to assess patients with a standardised set of NI and complementary demographic, clinical, cognitive, and genetic measures. The clinician will enter data on to an iPad, and these data, along with NI data will be electronically transferred to a central facility for analysis. Key features of the analysis include the assessment of NI data at a network level, the integration of NI and non-NI data, and the use of machine learning methods to make predictions specific to the patient being assessed. The results will be delivered to the clinician\u2019s iPad and will indicate the likelihood of a given clinical or functional outcome. The tool will have 3 clinical applications. PSYSCAN-Predict will facilitate prediction of the onset of psychosis in high risk subjects. PSYSCAN-Stratify will aid early diagnosis and the stratification of patients with first episode psychosis according to future course and outcome. PSYSCAN-Monitor will allow clinicians to measure progression of the disorder over time. The tool will be developed and validated in 2 large scale naturalistic studies using the consortium\u2019s extensive network of centres. The validated tool will then be disseminated to clinical centres across the EU. The PSYSCAN project involves a world-class consortium of experts on NI and psychiatry that unites academic centres, SME\u2019s with image processing and computerised testing expertise, a large medical device provider, and the pharmaceutical industry. The consortium is thus ideally suited to translating expertise and knowledge in NI to build a tool that can be used to improve the care of patients with psychiatric disorders.", 295606.0, 6902194.0, 11, 22, "PSYSCAN", null, "http://www.cambridgecognition.com", null, "fp7_110572_990012071"], [1262304000000, 1467244800000, "NEURAL TRANSPLANTATION IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE", "Cambridge Cognition LTD", "There are currently no cures for Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) but one of the most effective reparative therapies in patients to date has been with allotransplants of dopamine (DA) neuroblasts obtained from fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue. However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 50369.0, 13189031.0, 5, 15, "TRANSEURO", "http://www.transeuro.org.uk/", "http://www.cambridgecognition.com", "/docs/results/images/2012-10/52712.jpg", "fp7_94248_990012071"], [1356998400000, 1530316800000, "European Medical Information Framework", "Cambridge Cognition LTD", "In response to the need to tackle increasingly complex medical research questions, a growing amount of human health data is being collected, either in routine Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) databases, through research-driven cohort studies, in biobanks or related efforts. However, data sources are typically fragmented and contain information gaps which prevent their full exploitation. EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data. The project consortium is a partnership between Academia and EFPIA and comprises a large number of world-renown experts in data access and linkage and the Metabolic and AD therapeutic areas, with many being involved in other related projects", 26220.0, 43952959.0, 14, 62, "EMIF", null, "http://www.cambridgecognition.com", null, "fp7_203707_990012071"]]}}}}
