It aims to deliver at least 15% saving of energy consumption in domestic boiler industry (~40 million domestic boilers in the EU with a growth rate of 15% per year); equating to 3.6 billion Euros saved per year. For this ambitious goal, SOI-HITS will develop innovative CMOS-compatible, Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) integrated smart microsensor systems, capable of multi-measurand (water vapour, temperature, gas, flow, UV/IR) detection under harsh environment conditions (to 225oC, high water vapour level). SOI technology has several advantages over bulk silicon: enhanced electro-thermal isolation giving lower power consumption, ease of forming arrays of MEMS membranes, option of tungsten as a high temperature CMOS metal, direct integration of high-performance temperature and UV optical solid-state sensors. The smart multisensor chip will comprise multiple micro-hotplates with tungsten micro-heaters onto which selective nanostructured and thin film metal oxide sensing layers have been deposited. For the gas sensors (CO2 (concentration 6-10%, CO (0-1000ppm), and H2S (0-100ppm)), we will achieve fast thermal response time of a few ms and loss per micro-hotplate below 0.2mW/oC. Water vapour sensors, flow sensors (for liquid & gas) and precision on-chip temperature controllers will be also integrated. On-chip processing electronics, including drive circuitry, filters, amplifiers, processing circuits and analogue to digital interfaces, operating at 225oC, will be developed. The extension of the SOI platform to optical detectors, such as UV photodiode flame detectors and IR combined sources/detectors, will be explored.

Multichannel neurons will be made to compete on analogue chips to obtain flexible motor sequences underpinned by a wide parameter space.  By building large scale nonlinear optimization tools and using them to assimilate electrophysiological data, we will develop a method for automatically finding the network parameters that accurately reproduce biological motor sequences and their adaptation to multiple physiological inputs.  In this way, we will have resolved the issue of programming analogue CPGs which has long been the obstacle to using neural chips in medicine.  An adaptive pacemaker will be constructed, tested, validated and trialled on animal models of atrio-ventricular block and left bundle branch block to demonstrate the benefits of heart rate adaptation, beat-to-beat cardiac resynchronization and respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

Light exposure in the red part of the spectrum (620-750nm) induces growth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in deeper layers of the skin. The blue part of the spectrum (450\u2013495nm) is known to have antibacterial effects predominantly at the surface layers of the skin.

It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 \u03bcm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.", 270880.0, 5375100.0, 10, 14, "FineSol", null, null, null, "h2020_198380_999586844"], [1377993600000, 1504137600000, "All-in-one manufacturing platform for system in package and micromechatronic systems", "Microsemi Semiconductor Limited", "The mission of the NextFactory project is to develop and validate a new type of all-in-one manufacturing technology combining, for the first time, in a single piece of equipment, 3D freeform printing and ultra-precision 3D assembly.
