Dynamical aspects, which involve the atmospheric circulation, have received much less attention.

Moreover the dynamical aspects of model projections are much less robust than the thermodynamic ones. There are good reasons to believe that model bias, the divergence of model projections, and chaotic variability are somehow related, although the relationships are not well understood.

Although climate models have hugely improved, knowledge has grown and confidence increased, the climate feedback parameter, which determines the amount of global warming that results at equilibrium for a given radiative forcing (the heating due to greenhouse gases and other agents) is still very uncertain; for example, the range of equilibrium warming for a CO2 concentration of twice the pre-industrial level is 1.5-4.5 K, the same as estimated 25 years ago. It is widely assumed that we can evaluate the climate feedback parameter from the observed past or from an idealised model experiment with increased CO2, then use it to estimate global warming for future scenarios. However, research has revealed that, as well as being uncertain, the climate feedback parameter is not constant; it depends on the nature and magnitude of the forcing agent, it changes over time under constant forcing, it does not apply equally to spontaneous unforced climate variability, and it is not the same in the historical record and projections.

Latest innovations in flavanol analytics, chemistry, food processing technology, and cardiovascular function analysis make the elucidation of underlying mechanisms of flavanol bioactivity not just possible, but also impactful with regard to dietary advice and public health. Thus, a practical application of novel findings emanating from flavanol research in terms of a science/evidence-based development represents a worthwhile endeavour. This entails development of novel food ingredients, and innovative nutrient-delivery matrices. Such novel, nutritionally responsible food formulations hold the potential to open novel avenues in the prevention and amelioration of cardiovascular diseases in Europe. FLAVIOLA aims at: (i) illuminating the cellular and sub-cellular effects of flavanols and their main human metabolites; (ii) investigating key parameters of dietary flavanol absorption, clearance and efficacy towards surrogate markers of cardiovascular function in humans; (iii) developing innovative, functional, and nutritionally responsible food matrices for optimised dietary flavanol delivery; and finally (iv) demonstrating cardiovascular benefits and safety for a newly developed prototype food product.", 502242.0, 3399208.0, 7, 8, "FLAVIOLA", "http://www.flaviola.org/", "http://www.rdg.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725230.jpg", "fp7_91256_999984156"], [1364774400000, 1490918400000, "Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System modelling - Phase 2", "The University of Reading", "IS-ENES2 is the second phase project of the distributed e-infrastructure of models, model data and metadata of the European Network for Earth System Modelling (ENES).

Yet food production and benefits of chemical products are vital for the functioning of European societies. In order to ensure sustainable use, EU regulations require extensive risk assessment before a chemical is approved for use. Current risk assessments focus on risk at the level of individual organisms, but according to EU directives the protection goal aims at achieving sustainable populations. Population-level effects depend not only on exposure and toxicity, but also on important ecological factors that are impossible to fully address empirically. Mechanistic effect models (MEMs) enable the integration of these factors, thus increasing the ecological relevance of risk assessments as well as providing vital understanding of how chemicals interact with ecosystems. Such understanding is crucial for improving risk mitigation strategies and ecosystem management. So far, however, regulators and industry have lacked understanding of the potential benefits that MEMs can deliver, and academics have been inconsistent in the approaches applied. This has led to scepticism about models, preventing a wider use of MEMs in risk assessment. Examples clearly demonstrating the power of MEMs for risk assessment are urgently needed, and industry, academia and regulatory authorities across Europe need scientists that are trained in both MEMs and regulatory risk assessment.

To maximise their potential young people should start thinking about their future career at a young age. However many young people do not engage in career planning and personal development planning and lack aspirations, attitudes and confidence with respect to future careers. \r\n\r\nOver the last ten years there has been an upsurge of interest in using digital games for learning and attitude and behaviour change. This has emerged from optimism that the motivating features of entertainment games could also be deployed to motivate learning. However, games also offer methods of learning that are highly consistent with modern theories of effective learning, which propose that learning activities should be active, situated, problem based, interactive and socially mediated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims and objectives of the project: The aim of the current proposal is to develop a game-based approach to supporting awareness raising and behaviour change in the area of youth employability and career management. A game could provide an active, decision-making approach to supporting young people in thinking about employability and self-development by using motivational game mechanics that can induce in the users a sense of fun and self-actualisation patterns that will be helpful in raising awareness of issues. It seems likely that, as \u201cdigital natives\u201d who have been brought up with digital technology, young people would find a game-based approach to employability and careers highly attractive.  \r\n\r\nThe YESGAME fits well with current thinking about employability and careers, putting the student at the centre of their career decisions. The YESGAME will be built around 4 key features that young people need to be aware of in thinking about their careers: self, strengths, horizons and networks (Scottish Government, 2012). The aim of the game is to make young people more aware that taking personal responsibility for planning their own career and having realistic goals is more likely to help them achieve satisfaction in their career. The game should also allow young people to realise that their future career prospects are not fixed and that some factors that impact on their employability are more broad-ranging and flexible than they might realise. The YESGAME will be a role-playing game where an in-game character has the opportunity to take part in a series of activities which will provide \u201cexperiences\u201d, mini-games or \u201cchallenges\u201d requiring a series of choices. \r\n\r\nDuring the design phase of the project, tasks will include a literature review of career management and decision-making resources; a review of existing digital employability and careers guidance resources; a user requirements analysis and design specification. Key activities during the implementation stage will be the development of the YESGAME and additional resources to support the game, such as a pedagogical guide and videos. Piloting of early prototypes of the game will determine the acceptability and usability of the game with a small number of end users of the game. In addition a larger scale evaluation will be carried out on the final version of the game to establish the value and effectiveness of the game in interesting and supporting young people in career management activities. Best practice case studies and use case scenarios will provide further guidance about how best to use the game with different groups of young people. A range of dissemination activities to increase awareness and interest in the game amongst key stakeholders and interested parties, will be carried out during the project: a project Web site will be established; newsletters will be distributed, dissemination events will be held for employability and careers guidance practitioners and refereed academic & professional papers will be written. \r\n\r\nGame design, development and evaluation will be an iterative process. User requirements and design specification will use a negotiation-centric user-led design process. Results of piloting of early game prototypes with a small number of end users will feed into the refinement of the final game. A larger scale evaluation of the final version of the game will establish the value and effectiveness of the game in interesting and supporting young people in career management activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the YESGAME will contribute to enhanced potential for career management skills, with young people taking more responsibility for planning their own career and having aspirational but realistic career goals.

This is particularly true for the United Kingdom where only in 2014 languages were made a statutory requirement in primary schools in England. Whilst language teaching in primary schools is the foundation for a successful language strategy at all levels of education, research has shown a strong decline in motivation for pupils once they enter secondary education. Two of the main factors for this are the lack of assessment of learning progress in the UK and traditional, de-motivating testing methods in other member states. \r\n\r\nMindful of the need for urgent action regarding this issue, educational organisations with a stake in the improvement of language learning provision have decided to enter a strategic partnership under the Erasmus + programme. Their main aim is to combine primary language learning with a method of assessment which motivates young learners to continue learning languages. The participating organisations aim to improve language teaching and the assessment of linguistic competencies in primary schools by producing an assessment tool in the format of a computer game. The game will use a common core of curricula from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as its foundation and \u2013 with its seven language versions - create opportunities for converging standards on a European level. \r\n\r\nThe ten partner organisations were chosen for their expertise in promoting languages, research, teaching primary languages, assessment, translation, e-learning and language games. The Goethe-Institut London, a supporter of language teachers in the UK and all EU member states, is project lead. Together with its British and other European partners, it identified and developed the project idea. Both the Spanish Embassy in the UK and the British language teachers network, ALL, have been extremely helpful and influential in discussing the need to address the imbalance of language learning in the UK and other member states. The Universities of Reading and Leipzig were identified as leading primary language research experts while the University of Perugia was chosen as assessment expert. In order to ensure the necessary practical focus, the Education Ministry of Tenerife supports the development of the tool for Spanish and together with the Education Ministry in Rioja will conduct the piloting in its regions. The University of Siena with its e-learning centre  joined the partnership to provide the basis for the development of the language game for Italian. The University of Westminster will add it translation and localisation expertise for French in the UK. \r\n\r\nAs the project progresses, this tool will to be tested in schools in four countries and the outcomes will be evaluated using standard quality criteria. In order to support the anchorage of the assessment tool in state schools, a specific training of teachers is required which will be done exemplarily at the Education Ministry in Rioja. Teachers can take home course methodology to be implemented in their schools. Project partners taking part in the course will draw on this experience for their own teacher training courses.\r\n\r\nThe design of the game will be based on intensive research to provide insight into assessing progress in language learning. Parts of the programming of an existing computer game developed by the GI's headquarter in Munich in cooperation with the software company OVOS will be used to develop the new tool. The game will then be piloted to calibrate the e-learning content to ensure validity of content and construct. The feedback of pupils, teachers, parents and external educators will be recorded, analysed and implemented. Once the game is used in various classroom situations, the obtained data will show the pupils\u2019 progress. The results will be compared with traditional pen and paper tests.\r\n\r\nThe project benefits all participants. Schools and teachers will become \u201cinnovators\u201d. Students will find language learning more enjoyable. Their learning outcomes will be better and their acquisition of transversal skills will be enhanced. Teachers will be able to develop their professional skills further using innovative methods and digital integration. They will derive great personal and professional satisfaction from improving their students\u2019 learning outcomes. Universities will benefit from research and data analysis from the assessment tool. The GI and the public authorities will be strengthened regarding their work to promote languages. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term, this project should yield strong evidence to convince national authorities to endorse the assessment tool and actively promote it.

Around 81 million tons of liquid whey was produced by the approximately 150,000 European cheesemakers in EU-27 in 2011. However, according to the European Whey Products Association (EWPA), only 40% of the liquid whey in Europe is being processed for its utilization in food and human nutrition or in feed applications, while the rest is still being dumped into municipal sewages, mainly by SME dairies. As a liquid waste, whey treatment generates unavoidable costs of around \u20ac0.04 per liter. Hence, there is an urgent need to tackle this environmental problem and valorise whey by proposing innovative, energy efficient technologies, with low operational costs and high industrial yields that are able to ensure the economic viability of whey processing for European dairy SMEs.\nIn this context, our pan-European partnership of SMEs and RTDs from 7 Member States has identified the potential of a highly efficient, selective, gentle and economically attractive electro-membrane filtration (EMF) technology to enhance separation and concentration of proteins and protein peptides from whey. The efficient recovery of functional protein fractions through EMF technology will provide an important source of high-value natural food emulsifiers and protein supplements for various food formulations and nutritional applications, while providing an economic alternative to whey disposal and reducing the environmental impact of European SME dairies.\nThe EMF technology enhances the separation of molecules with similar weight but different charge and \u2013 compared to ultrafiltration \u2013 significantly increases filtration yields and reduces cleaning efforts, waste water and membrane replacement costs.\nImpact: the proposed technology will provide a cost-effective method to separate protein fractions from whey, which will in the end increase the competitiveness of European SME cheesemakers.
