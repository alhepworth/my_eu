One of our main concerns is not only to increase our participants\u2019 knowledge, but also to grant them the opportunity to widen their experience so that they will be able \"to see the bigger picture\" and \"think outside the box\". We are planning to provide work placements for 40 students who are training to become office management assistants, industrial business management assistants, or management assistants in freight forwarding and logistics. The work placements are to be carried out in two flows. During their stay in England, our students are to participate in a three-day language course with emphasis on language for specific vocational purposes followed up by a two-week internship in St Albans and its environs. Through their participation in the Erasmus+ traineeship programme, the students will be well prepared for the challenges within an international labour market, thereby significantly improving their employment perspectives.Furthermore, it is our goal to establish the Erasmus+ KA1-Mobility at our vocational college to support and develop the internationalisation of our teaching staff (VET Mobility Charter). A one-week internship abroad will provide four teachers with a unique and hands-on experience of internal procedures within British companies, thus expanding their knowledge and professionalism decisively. As a modern educational institution, we are striving to implement future-oriented approaches to education and training by which our students can benefit from a continuously renewed academic knowledge gained by looking beyond the horizon of our classrooms. In addition, we particularly wish to qualify for a long-term institutionalisation enabling us to embed transnational mobility at our vocational college.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003034_1"], [2014, "Qualit\u00e4t in der beruflichen Bildung", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 52477.0, 2, 2, "Resulting from the advancement of global networks and ongoing internationalisation activities in combination with the growing stress of competition in the labour market, general professional competencies no longer suffice. The aim of the mobility project is to counteract these developments and to help trainees enhance their employability. The project offers trainees the opportunity to gain relevant skills, including international experiences, the acquisition of intercultural competencies, the improvement of foreign language skills, the ability to carry themselves with confidence within the international market and the recognition of lifelong learning as a necessity for employment progression, in order to continually adapt to current developments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries profitting from the mobility project are trainees during their initial vocational training in the fields of early child education (kindergarten teachers), social work and business, as well as one accompanying person for each flow. Twice each year, in February and October, ten trainees, who, due to the great interest in the programme, have to undergo a selection process, take part in a work placement abroad lasting three weeks respectively. Each group is accompanied by a tutor from their home institution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trainees, a member of our teaching staff will also benefit from the Erasmus+ mobility project. The staff member is going to be placed in an English college for Further Education for a period of four weeks. The placement will enable them to become acquainted with local conditions and workplace culture, to improve their skills and competencies and to apply them in teaching activities in Germany upon their return. Consequently, the temporary employment abroad does not only contribute to the staff member's personal development, but also serves as an opportunity for trainees in Germany to learn and benefit from their attained knowledge and insights and the internationalisation of the curriculum. This is also applicable for the abovementioned accompanying persons. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Placements UK is responsible for selecting and organising suitable work placements, determined with the help of an assessment of demand, for each of the beneficiaries. Trainees participating in such placements, thus, become acqainted with the English labour market and develop expert knowledge and key competencies relevant to their field of vocational training, such as intercultural understanding, language skills and the ability to observe closely and analyse situations, as well as an aptness for critical self-reflection, including related values and attitudes towards others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe respective activities, rights and responsibilities of each partner, will be defined in a carefully drafted memorandum of understanding. Additionally, expected mobility goals are determined prior to the commencement of mobility in the form of a learning agreement. The evaluation of these objectives is carried out using the Europass Mobility tool. The aim is to utilise both the newly developed ECVET resources and documents as well as instruments for quality assurance generated through the innovation project \"Q-Mobil\", EQF and DQR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the mobility project and the, as a result, acquired competencies and specialist knowledge as well as the realisation of the importance of continuous learning and personal development, trainees in the dual system are being prepared to adjust to demands of professional skills and expertise in the service sector and to actively close any personal development gaps. This also means that they learn to consciously follow developments in their respective field of work and are capable of contributing to their work environment by proposing innovative and creative ideas and solutions. Thus, the benefits of the project are not limited to the individual participants alone. In fact, the particular institutions, organisations and businesses, tutors, future participants and so forth profit, in particular because reports put together by beneficiaries upon return are presented internally as well as externally at fairs and exhibitions, conferences, congresses and other similar events.

The world of work is constantly changing, especially in the field of logistics, where processes, documents and organisational structures are subject to rapid change. Due to Europeanisation in logistics, those aspects are becoming more and more international and require a good command of the English language. \r\n\r\n2. In the curriculum of vocational schools, English is being scheduled for a single lesson per week, and thus does not take those developments into account. Hence it is essential for the students' future career prospects and their personal development to enhance their foreign language skills in combination with practical work experience. Furthermore a project like this may always develop the participants' personal competences und leads to a better understanding of joint European values.\r\n\r\n3. The apprenticing companies in the logistics sector in the Aschaffenburg region have expanded their branch network in the last years beyond the German boarder and are now increasingly working with partners and customers all over Europe. Apprentices with practical work experience made in the United Kingdom are therefore, in combination with good language skills, an important gain for every apprenticing company. That is why many apprenticing companies in the Aschaffenburg region have the burning desire for some time to have the possibility to integrate a part of their apprentices' training into a work placement in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n4. The participants have the opportunity, while doing a work placement, to gain a deep insight into the operational procedure of a British logistics company. They will reflect processes at their apprenticing companies and hence develop their practical skills. This project offers apprentices at the Staatliche Berufsschule II Aschaffenburg the possibility to qualify sustainably for the future challenges on the labour market\r\n\r\n5. The one-week language course that the students attend before their work placements includes contents that are part of the curriculum as well as general language skills and will prepare them for their work placements.\r\n\r\n- Sebastian Weyres, the project leader, is going to monitor  and evaluate the project in collaboration with the teaching staff of the \r\nworking team \"international relations\" at the Berufsschule II Aschaffenburg and the quality management team of the school.

In a record log they describe their working place and reconsider thoroughly their personal daily or weekly activities. \r\nAs a result of the internship, the participants gain work experience on the European scale.

The project will be presented to apprentices in the logistics sector (warehouse logistics operators), retail sale and wholesalers with an emphasis on logistics processes in their second year of apprenticeship and their apprenticing companies. Those students will have access to the project and are asked to apply for it.- Partner Organisation: WorkplacementsUK, United Kingdom. The organisation is involved with the realisation of language courses, with the placement in operations side companies, with organisational issues the participants might have during their stay in Brighton and the selection  of host families. - The need for the project is a result of different developments:1. The world of work is constantly changing, especially in the field of logistics, where processes, documents and organisational structures are subject to rapid change. Due to Europeanisation in logistics, those aspects are becoming more and more international and require a good command of the English language. 2. In the curriculum of vocational schools, English is being scheduled for a single lesson per week, and thus does not take those developments into account. Hence it is essential for the students' future career prospects and their personal development to enhance their foreign language skills in combination with practical work experience. Furthermore a project like this may always develop the participants' personal competences und leads to a better understanding of joint European values.3. The apprenticing companies in the logistics sector in the Aschaffenburg region have expanded their branch network in the last years beyond the German boarder and are now increasingly working with partners and customers all over Europe. Apprentices with practical work experience made in the United Kingdom are therefore, in combination with good language skills, an important gain for every apprenticing company. That is why many apprenticing companies in the Aschaffenburg region have the burning desire for some time to have the possibility to integrate a part of their apprentices' training into a work placement in the United Kingdom.4. The participants have the opportunity, while doing a work placement, to gain a deep insight into the operational procedure of a British logistics company. They will reflect processes at their apprenticing companies and hence develop their practical skills. This project offers apprentices at the Staatliche Berufsschule 2 Aschaffenburg the possibility to qualify sustainably for the future challenges on the labour market5. The one-week language course that the students attend before their work placements includes contents that are part of the curriculum as well as general language skills and will prepare them for their work placements.- Sebastian Weyres, the project leader, is going to monitor  and evaluate the project in collaboration with the teaching staff of the working team \"international relations\" at the Berufsschule 2 Aschaffenburg and the quality management team of the school. Futhermore, Mr. Weyres is in close contact to the participants and their apprenticing companies to ensure that the project goals will be reached. - The dissemination of the project will be carried out on a regional, as well as on a national level.This application refers to a three-week project from 30th of October 2016 to 20th of November 2016 and 2017. The first week will be a language course to develop the participant's language skills and to prepare the participants for the following work-placement. The second and third week will be a work placement in a retail store or in a logistics company.The project will be taking place in Brighton, United Kingdom UK (first week) and in companies in and around the Brighton region (second and third week). Hence, the project is meant to largely improve the participants' professional competences as well as their language and social skills and, as a result, contribute to the improvement of quality of the vocational eduction in the Aschaffenburg region.  After having participated in the project, the participants will have significantly improved linguistic and professional skills.In addition, the participating students, as well as the participating teachers, will develop  an in-depth understanding of the country and people. Experiences that will in many ways result in interesting and motivating lessons. The Staatliche Berufsschule 2 also expects an improvement with regard to intercultural skills and methodological expertise.To summarise, the project is meant to lead to the better qualification of the students and participating teachers, while, at the same time, increasing the internationalization of the Staatliche Berufsschule 2 and the Aschaffenburg region all together.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002932_1"], [2017, "Flexibilisierung von Industriekaufleuten und Kaufleuten f\u00fcr B\u00fcromanagement f\u00fcr den internationalen Arbeitsmarkt", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 38168.0, 2, 2, "The vocational school Dinkelsb\u00fchl wants to send trainees (industrial clerks and office management clerks) to English work placements in Brighton.

The trainees are going to work at their work placements for 10 days and attend a language course at a certified language school for two days. They should work with authentic English documents and be encouraged and trained in oral and written communication skills. These are also goals in the curriculum and the training regulations. The trainees should achieve competences in cooperating with colleagues and clients of different culutural backgrounds. That goal should also be achieved by their stay in British host families. \r\n\r\nOne main goal is to encourage them to tolerance and open-mindedness towards other cultures. The mobility is supposed to boost their English language skills, their expertise and interdisciplinary skills as well as their social competences to help them to facilitate their future careers within a European business market. It should also help them to become politically mature, responsible, self-assured, tolerant and open minded citizens of the European Union. The internationally oriented Franconian businesses require confident behavior even in the context of the globalized market and conversations in foreign languages.  \r\n\r\nThe mobility is going to be well prepared.

It is here where our project can contribute most. Trainees who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in European exchange programmes in particular will benefit from our project.\r\n\r\nWhen in 2004/2005 English was introduced as a compulsory subject in vocational business schools for students in retail sales and office administration, this was the starting point for our school to tailor a special language learning programme at the ECBM in London for this target group alongside their normal English lessons. Initially an exchange programme was designed in the form of a three week college course to meet these students\u00b4 needs by focussing on practical English usage and intercultural competence at the same time. However, as our students strive for work experience it very soon became clear that workplacements abroad would be of even greater use to them.

Despite the great achievements in the past, many young people and pupils have mixed feelings about pushing the integration in Europe to the next level. An essential reason for that sceptical attitude is that the pupils cannot collect any positive, individual experiences on private or on a professional level e.g. working or living abroad, because there is a lack of opportunities for them due to the high costs which come along with such a practical experience.  The only chance to support the idea of a merging Europe, continuing the integration process in the future, is to secure that the ideas of the European Union will be supported by a convinced major part of our young citizens. Our school is observing this nuisance for a while and we would like to do our part to change this, making Europe to a practical shared perception for our apprentices. Therefor, we officially apply to the Mobility Program of the European Union to give our trainees the chance to participate and experience the advantages and achievements in Europe on their own. The vocational \"School for Business and Information Technology\"  is a public institution from the city of W\u00fcrzburg. We have the plan to offer our pupils and teachers the opportunity to participate in a practical training as an optional module in their apprenticeship. We expect that the pupils will benefit from the participation in the Mobility Program in several areas, as an individual reaching a higher quality in their education and qualification and as an apprentice on a private level (self development).

This was done by including children from an early age (4 \u2013 7 years; primarily those who are overweight, obese or with low level of physical activity) into regular sports activities accompanied by indoor and outdoor activities with their parents and workshops on healthy nutrition and cooking at weekends. It combined physical activity and balanced diet as the most effective way to increase general health, mental development and performance in children and reduce the risk of obesity. The main activity of the project was the execution of pilot programmes in Croatia, Malta, Slovakia, United Kingdom, Portugal and Slovenia, designed by experts in kinesiology, nutrition and health according to age and fitness level of participants. The designed programme introduced children to elements of basic sports (athletics, gymnastics and swimming) in order to boost their physical, cognitive and academic development and to create healthy habits at early age. The partnership consisted of 7 organisations from 6 European countries - a mix of public bodies with access to decision makers, educational and health institutions, sports organisations with experience in working with children and promoting grassroot sports to all generations, and organisations specialised in raising awareness about the importance of physical activity and healthy food and nutrition as best suited to achieve the goals set for this project.", "http://www.cvsbeh.org.uk", null, "erasmus_567298-EPP-1-2015-2-HR-SPO-SCP_6"]]}}}}
