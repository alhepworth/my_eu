In the meantime many new youth circus organizations with younger entrepreneurs and youth circus trainers emerged, bringing new approaches, new drives and fresh energy\u2026\r\nAt previous youth circus platform meetings of EYCO, a strong need was expressed to share expertise and knowhow on implementing more youth empowerment  and  participation in our organizations.  And relating to this, another \u2018opening up\u2019 evolution: the crossing-over of circus with other popular youth (street) art disciplines \u2026involving also new youngsters and target groups in our non-formal youth education communities.\r\n\r\n\u201cCircus Moves on\u201d  brings  experienced and new organizations/youth workers(trainers)  together for this EMPOWERING OF YOUTH AND NEW GENERATIONS within youth circuses that want to \u2018move on\u2019 after the pioneer years.  We will focus and reflect on two new change-maker topics :\r\n1. YOUTH PARTICPATION on the PEDAGOGICAL level of circus education\r\n2. Participation of YOUTH CULTURE CROSS-OVERS  in circus education \r\n\r\nWe use the celebration of 25 years of Cirkus In Beweging as an opportunity to bring a mix of 50 experienced and starting youth workers from 14 different youth circus organizations to Leuven for a 4-day mobility of youth workers with practical workshops and a seminar. A mix of sessions of experienced partners but also external experts from other youth art or youth work disciplines, and peer to peer teaching in a non-formal learning environment.  \r\nWhile sharing practices on the floor, such as \u2018assistant circus trainer\u2019 programs for circus adolescents, we also reflect on these activities to create a better awareness of the philosophies of the different partner organizations and countries towards (circus) education and youth participation. We are we on the \u2018participation scale ladder\u201d and where do we want to reach and how? \r\n\r\nBesides its strong international CV, CIB may also lean on the expertise of EYCO and its previous platform organizers, using their successful methods for bigger mobility events of youth workers from 14 countries. \r\n\r\nSharing the knowledge on these topics on a European, international and intercultural level can be an important crowbar and impulse to foster further projects and to motivate the participants to put their new experiences into practice in their home country and organization.  Presenting samples of assistant trainer programs, tools and methods on youth participation or cross-culture cooperation often need to be further explored or implemented at the floor back home.  But the partners and presented experts in this exchange can help each other in further (bilateral) follow-up actions. And With the help of the European youth circus network EYCO the results of this exchange CIB will lead to more structural realizations (such as a EU assistant circus trainer course model).    \r\n\r\nOn the long term we strive to improve the quality of youth circus in Europe and enhance youth participation and empowerment via circus, not only at the educational level but also in the management of youth circus organizations.
