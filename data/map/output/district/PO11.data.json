The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs. The project will be the first nationally co-ordinated programme of action for the species, working with 29 colonies (about 65% of the total population) in 15 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the Natura 2000 network.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4755", "http://www.littleternproject.org.uk/,", "life_103"], [1999, "Living with the sea  - Living with the sea : Managing Natura 2000 sites on dynamic coastlines", "English Nature", 1814120.0, 907061.0, "There\u2019s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_206"], [1999, "saline lagoons  - Conserving saline lagoons & their birds on ten Natura 2000 sites in England", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1108104.0, 554051.0, "Saline lagoons are a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive and now total just 1300 hectares within the UK.  They are subject to ongoing degradation and loss through natural and man-induced processes.  Threats include development pressure, pollution, erosion, disturbance and disruption to salinity and water exchange processes.  \n\nSaline lagoons also provide nesting sites for internationally significant concentrations of terns (Sterna spp.) and gulls (Larus spp.) and feeding and roosting sites for migrant populations of waders and wildfowl.  Breeding populations of the avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, an Annex I bird, are virtually confined to this habitat in the UK.  Threats specific to the bird populations present on the sites include vegetation encroachment, erosion, predation and human disturbance. \n\nBecause of the importance of the habitat, a saline lagoons action plan has been established as part of the UK\u2019s Biodiversity Action Plan.   The aim of this LIFE project was to give a significant initial boost to the plan by maintaining and enhancing the conservation of saline lagoons and their birds on 10 English Natura 2000 sites.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=470", null, "life_232"]]}}}}
