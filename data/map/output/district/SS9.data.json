The resulting data will allow for improved insights on the full extent of available water and existing pressures on global water resources in all parts of the water cycle. The project will support efficient and globally consistent water management and decision making by providing comprehensive multi-scale (regional, continental and global) water resources observations. It will test new EO data sources, extend existing processing algorithms and combine data from multiple satellite missions in order to improve the overall resolution and reliability of EO data included in the re-analysis dataset. The usability and operational value of the developed data will be verified and demonstrated in a number of case-studies across the world that aim to improve the efficiency of regional water distribution. The case-studies will be conducted together with local end-users and stakeholders. Regions of interest cover multiple continents, a variety of hydrological, climatological and governance conditions and differ in degree of data richness (e.g. the Mediterranean and Baltic region, Ethiopia, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh).

The applicability of Scubacraft can also be adopted for marine conservation and search and rescue operations. The current state-of-the-art method for performing underwater inspections uses divers to manually carry equipment to the inspection site and then perform the inspection. Scubacraft can revolutionise this way of inspecting by transporting a team of divers and equipment directly to the inspection site quicker, thereby creating a larger window of opportunity for the inspection to be performed, maximising inspection efficiencies and enabling earlier defect detection of structural integrities.\n\nThrough this feasibility study, Scubacraft Ltd will undertake full market analysis to establish the potential for exploiting this technology into wider markets on a global scale.

Darlinghurst is a larger than average sized academy in a predominately working class area of Southend with 680 pupils and 80 staff. \r\n\r\nOverall, pupil mobility is higher than the national average.   Though the percentage of pupils with special educational needs and or disabilities is below average, general pupil mobility is higher than national expectations with a rising roll of families moving into the area.  Intentional links, language learning, Global links and Outdoor Learning have been strongly embedded in to our school as a way of encouraging the raising of our educational standards and engaging with our pupils.\r\n\r\nAt our recent Ofsted inspection, Outdoor Learning was identified as one of strengths of the school.  We need to build upon this by up-skilling more teachers to be able to have the knowledge and experience to teach strong Outdoor Learning lessons which inspire our pupils and bring to life the creative curriculum our pupils need. \r\n\r\nDuring our 2 year project, we intend to send 12 key Learning Leaders (6 each year) on training in Spain and  Denmark to learn new methods and experience a different education context-- in order to compare, contrast and evaluate best practice. We believe this will give us fresh ideas and the context to think about our teaching practice in a way that can be shared with all our staff and contribute to whole school improvement. \r\n\r\nParticipant teachers from EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) to year six will be sent  to attend one week training so that Outdoor Learning is focused on and then shared and new activities implemented throughout the school, with the support, guidance and attendance of the Senior Leadership team.\r\n\r\nAll learning outcomes and progress will be recorded and documented and then analyzed with the aim to maintain and improve on the high standard of teaching and our understanding of Outdoor Learning at Darlinghurst School.

As a school, we are passionate about bringing the world to the classroom and preparing children for a future filled with exciting international opportunities and experiences. The school does already have some educational links with France, South Africa and Latvia and high importance is placed on the international dimension. Although French is already taught across the school, we recognise a strong need for children to develop deeper language learning strategies, which can be transferred to new languages. As a result of recent auditing staff skills and observing lessons, a significant lack of proficiency and confidence in language teaching has been identified. \r\n\r\nA key aim of the project would be to provide an invaluable opportunity for teachers to improve their own language skills. In light of the new statutory requirements for MFL in the primary curriculum, we are committed to ensuring our pupils are receiving high quality, engaging lessons, rich with the target language. Secondly, we aim to help children acquire useful language learning strategies which can be used and applied when learning new languages. With this in mind, we want to expose children to a second language; Spanish. Another aim is to deepen children's understanding of the world, through educating them on countries and their cultures. Furthermore, we hope to create and extend our links with national and international schools and practitioners, in order to share good practice and enable pupils to communicate with children around the world. Lastly, we aim to ensure that other staff also gain the learning that our participants can share with them. Outcomes from the project will be disseminated widely across the school within our local community.\r\n\r\nAs part of the project, 4 keys stage 2 teachers will undergo intensive language training in France and a further 4 teachers will do the same in Spain. 2 from each wave will then return to France or Spain for a second time, in order to further develop their skills. These participants are largely less experienced teachers or NQTs, who have had little or no MFL training before now. They have also expressed a desire to become more competent and confident in delivering and speaking the target language. They will attend 5 days of language lessons and be immersed in the language for the duration of their stay abroad. Language learning strategies will also be demonstrated for their professional development.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the project, the participants will have improved language skills and a better grasp of how to deliver high quality lessons. The school will benefit from a renewed sense of excitement around languages and the introduction of a second language will enable children to transfer language learning skills. The profile of the global dimension will be raised and children will recognise that languages play an important part in their futures; they have a purpose. Moving forward, we want children to have a lifelong passion for languages, travel and much more.
