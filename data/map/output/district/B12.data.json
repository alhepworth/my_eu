The project will give students as many chances to compete in the games and therefore approach values such as adversity, tolerance, respect, and opening on the world and others. Another specificity is that both Polish and French schools have developped partnership with local special needs schools, those links will continue well beyond the 2 years of the programme and will be more occasions to include these children into the mainstream system.\r\nEach country will be in charge of the preparation of its own events.

Besides promoting taking more initiative and responsibility, it is to  enable a cultural open-mindedness and encourage any actions working towards opening oneself to others and the world.  Precisely it is to give the opportunity to as many of our young learning people in our MFR to live an experience of mobility within the European Union.  Based on professional mobility actions lead with success by many of its\u2019 associations these last years with LEONARDO, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionale des MFR de Basse-Normandie, with the support of its\u2019 Director and its\u2019 President, named a regional representative for Mobility and chose to pool its\u2019 experiences.  This is how the consortium was created thus permitting the building of a common project through a steering committee with the goals to strengthen the sense of a European citizenship and to help broaden the mind of the young people in our MFR in Basse-Normandie.  Make Europe \u201clive\u201d to our students and staff of MFR is the priority of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionale des MFR de Basse-Normandie.\r\n Indeed, leader of the project, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration supports the 5 associations who are well anchored in their regions and active in the consortium.  These associations hosts young girls and boys (aged 15 to 19 years old) studying to obtain a BAC PRO in:  MFR  la Bagoti\u00e8re (14) and MFR Saint-Sauveur-Lendelin (50) both offering a BAC PRO SAPAT (working with children, elderly, handicapped and patients), MFR Balleroy (14) and MFR La Fert\u00e9 Mac\u00e9 (61) offering a BAC PRO CGEA (horse and cattle breeding) and MFR Cerisy-Belle-Etoile (61) offering a BAC PRO Am\u00e9nagements Paysagers (landscaping).  Based on volunteers, 127 young people and 6 staff members (4 teachers and 2 principals) wish to live an experience of mobility in Great-Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Greece and Spain from 2015 to 2017.\r\n Initiated in the summer of 2014 by the Director the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionale des MFR de Basse-Normandie and the Mobility representative, the idea of a consortium was validated in December 2014 during an information meeting for all MFR of Basse- Normandie.  5 associations enlisted in the consortium naming 1 representative per association forming thus the steering committee assisted by a representative from CREAN (Carrefour Rural Europ\u00e9en des Acteurs Normands).  This committee is lead by the Director and the Mobility representative.  The writing of the project started in January 2015 through group and individual work; this work was put online (Google docs) so that everyone could change and add information and give their opinion.  Meanwhile, the Mobility representative and CREAN representative took part in a writing workshop on Erasmus+ given by the Ministry of Agriculture.         All that is written is put in common in February 2015 before submitting the final version online.  There are also written letters of intent, partnership agreement F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionale/MFR and mandate letters.  Once the project is accepted by Europe (summer 2015), will start the organisational actions for departures and editing of all needed documents such as: selection grid, training agreement, evaluation grid, check lists, logbooks\u2026  In fall of 2015, after a meeting of the steering committee, each MFR will organise an information meeting for all participants and their families.  There will also be a day of workshops for all MFR participants, organised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and Europe Direct, to prepare these young people for their mobility.  The first departures will be in November 2015 and will continue until March 2017. Obviously, follow ups and assessments will be made throughout these experiences by each MFR.\r\n The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionale des MFR de Basse-Normandie, leader of this project, chose to create a consortium with the 5 MFR interested in mobility for their learners and staff.  Its goal was to put in common experiences and competence of all the MFR under the coordination of a Mobility representative.  Thus, a mobility project could be cooperatively built giving a chance to students and staff of various professional training to live an exceptional experience at a personal and professional level.

There is an ongoing need for increased awareness, knowledge, and skills, and experience to improve the professional profiles of education staff to strengthen Europe\u2019s economic position.

To enable us to achieve this there are four key objectives:\r\n\u2022 To provide high quality vocational learning experiences at some of the world\u2019s leading institutions\r\n\u2022 To open up new opportunities and international networks with a new set of peers\r\n\u2022 To develop a robust understanding of the potential of incorporating digital technology into artistic practices \r\n\u2022 To provide a framework for self-reflective personal attainment in new skills, experiences, and knowledge in language, European culture, and the application of creative learning for youth work\r\n\r\nSEPP:YW will take a cross-disciplinary approach whereby 22 youth workers over 24 months in the fields of plastic and performing arts will work with peers in the host countries of Spain, Austria and the Netherlands.  Among the peers will be technologists, developers and coders, creatives and artists.  The cross-disciplinary environment will bring together a professional network, and an opportunity to learn how arts practices can innovate through the use of digital technologies and new media.  SEPP:YW will support an expansion of opportunities, through access to organisations working with digital technologies and new media, in ways that can benefit the arts education sector with new ideas and increased competitiveness.\r\n\r\nWe will work with key leaders in the field where digital technology is inherently used within the creative industries.  These are:\r\n\u2022 Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria, one of the most significant centres of excellence in terms of the development and presentation of electronic arts, science and technology.  They will host 10 mobilities.  \r\n\u2022 Cinekid, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, hosts the largest new media festival for children. Cinekid aims to strengthen the position of youth towards the media through their active and creative participation. They will host 10 mobilities.\r\nFollowing an induction with the host, a crucial and significant element of the participants\u2019 learning experience will be a highly tactile \u2018hands on\u2019 approach, working across disciplines to develop their skills.  The process will enable the participants to gain new ideas and ways of working to develop their practices.  Furthermore, the participants will be able to offer insights of their own practices to transnational peers.\r\n\r\nActivities include:\r\n\u2022 Assistance with programmes related to innovation and product development through interdisciplinary working\r\n\u2022 Collaborative working with programmers and software designers in an collaborative environment\r\n\u2022 Hands on learning how to innovate their artistic practices through use of digital technology\r\n\u2022 Hands on learning about the processes of international collaboration, production and knowledge transfer for research and development\r\n\u2022 Assistance and delivery support for exhibition and events related to digital media festival content\r\n\u2022 Hands on learning about new concepts and trends in art and digital technology \r\n\u2022 Understanding the process of curation, and exhibition, and management of digital products\r\n\u2022 Collaborating as part of a wider team to achieve desired results\r\n\u2022 Networking with European peers\r\n\u2022 Attendance and support at professional conferences\r\nOverall, in the long term the project will increase opportunities and access for youth work professionals, with a particular emphasis upon encouraging under-represented Minority Ethnic individuals, to improve competitiveness, networks and employability, benefiting students and young people in the arts education sector.
