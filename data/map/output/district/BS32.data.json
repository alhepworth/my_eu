The associated training and guidance for teachers will have a multiplying effect and can be extended to all STEM subjects. \r\n\r\nThe project management is based on the principles of Prince2.  The pedagogical method is assessment based on learning outcomes and competence based criteria supported by comprehensive open source collaborative technologies running in the Cloud.
