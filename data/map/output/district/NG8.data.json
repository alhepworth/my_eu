Genomics approaches will be employed to describe global changes in gene target networks and gene interactions in the nucleus during ES cell differentiation into the hepatic, neuronal and hematopoietic lineages. Proteomics will be employed for the characterization of transcription factor and epigenetic modifying complexes and of the in vivo protein composition of specialized chromatin domains. The research activities of this ITN are organized in the context of a multidisciplinary Training Program, which provides unique opportunities for the training of early stage researchers to address fundamental biological questions with far reaching implications in biotechnology and human health.", 178843.0, 1978727.0, 5, 8, "INTEGER", null, "http://www.sourcebioscience.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111932.jpg", "fp7_88958_998644683"], [1235865600000, 1330473600000, "Advanced affinity tools and technologies for high throughput studies of the human proteome", "Source Bioscience Plc", "High specificity affinity reagents (\u2018binders\u2019) are essential probes for proteome research, enabling the detection and localisation of multiple proteins in tissues and fluids in health and disease, through the application of binder-based technologies (affinity proteomics). This proposal links the high throughput production of quality-controlled, recombinant binding molecules of different types (antibody fragments, engineered scaffolds, aptamers) with advanced applications (capture microarrays, multidimensional fluorescence imaging, single molecule detection, intracellular knockdown) in the analysis of human proteome targets. The partners are five established SMEs and five leading academic groups, each with a reputation for innovation, engaged in binder production and characterisation or protein detection technologies. The project will aim to resolve bottlenecks in high throughput binder production and application technologies, including cost, throughput, automation and quality. The linkage of production, quality control and applications will be exemplified by targeting kinases and other proteins involved in the TGF-beta and MAP kinase signal transduction pathways, implicated in many diseases and where the availability of high quality binding reagents is particularly needed and drug development is actively evolving. As well as potential products, it will provide the SMEs with opportunities to exemplify and improve their technologies for future exploitation in proteomics, diagnostics and therapeutics.", 154045.0, 3532899.0, 5, 10, "AFFINITYPROTEOME", null, "http://www.sourcebioscience.com", null, "fp7_90292_998644683"], [1317427200000, 1412035200000, "A Treatment-Oriented Research Project of NCL Disorders as a Major Cause of Dementia in Childhood", "Source Bioscience Plc", "'The DEM-CHILD project focusses on the main cause for childhood dementia in Europe, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). The NCLs are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dementia, blindness, epilepsy and physical decline leading to an early death of the patients. Since no cure is currently available, these disorders represent a serious social, medical, and economic challenge.\nTo date, eight NCL genes have been characterised. There is evidence suggesting that further gene loci remain to be identified. NCLs are under-diagnosed in many countries around the world as there is an overall lack of research, early diagnosis, treatment and expert availability. Furthermore, due to their broad genetic heterogeneity it is difficult to collect large numbers of genetically similar patients. As such, large therapeutic studies required for advances in treatment are difficult to initiate. The DEM-CHILD project will combine the expertise of (i) recognized European research teams with (ii) high-technology SMEs, and will (iii) collaborate with Indian experts on the following objectives:\n(1) High-technology SMEs will develop innovative cost- and time-effective testing and screening methods for all NCLs in order to ensure early diagnosis and thereby prevention.\n(2) DEM-CHILD will collect the world\u2019s largest, clinically and genetically best characterised set of NCL patients in order to study disease prevalence and precisely describe the natural history of the NCLs leading to the development of an evaluation tool for experimental therapy studies.\n(3) Novel biomarkers and modifiers of NCL will be identified to support the development of innovative therapies.\n(4) Focussing on the development of therapies for NCLs caused by mutations in intracellular transmembrane proteins, two complementary therapeutic strategies will be used and compared in eye and brain of mouse models: a) viral-mediated gene transfer and b) neural stem cell-mediated delivery of neuroprotective factors.'", 121828.0, 3294729.0, 5, 13, "DEM-CHILD", "http://www.dem-child.eu", "http://www.sourcebioscience.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-12/57844.jpg", "fp7_100068_998644683"]]}}}}
