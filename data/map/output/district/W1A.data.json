As a result, new visual signal-processing areas have emerged such as light fields, ultra-high definition, highframe rate and high dynamic range imaging. The novel combinations of those technologies can facilitate a hyper-realistic visual experience. This will without doubt be the future frontier for new imaging systems.

Moreover, the outomes of the EAGLE DOI project that followed upon the IMPAECT ECVET pilot, are another source of input and expertise for this mobility project as the scope of EAGLE was widened to the supplementary domain of an integrated implementation of EQF, ECVET and ECTS focussing on end-users in close cooperation with stakeholders from working life, VET and Higher Education. This project with learner and staff mobility will zoom in on assessment, validation and recognition of learning outcomes in cooperation with examination boards and competent bodies and in coherence with infrastructural aspects, procedures, rules and regulations, sustainability, cost-effectiveness and quality assurance. Quality standards and assurance, fundamental for ECVET implementation and validation and issues like procedures, assessment methodology, usage of documentation, demonstration of Knowledge, Skills and Competences/Learning Outcomes and the expertise or training of assessors will be screened and monitored alongside current mobility and validation best practices. Consequently, ongoing fine-tuning will be effected and improvements will be made to  finally come up with a model for validation and recognition that is widely accepted. Cooperation by all sectors of education as an integral feature of the community of practice, and ECVET-oriented quality audits are to safeguard an integrated, institutional framework or model for quality assurance, a continuous acquisition of expertise and building of an infrastructure for an institution-wide implementation of ECVET. Gilde\u2019s International Platform is concerned with the operationalisation of learner mobility. Designated working groups for internationalisation, contact persons/counsellors and the sectoral offices for work placements and apprenticeships are entrusted with the actual preparation, guidance and support of the students and others involved. The host companies or institutions, selected on the basis of mutual trust, past performance, their participation in the IMPAECT and/or EAGLE projects or good practice and expertise demonstrated in TOI or ECVET pilot projects, will contribute towards developing the validation model by re(de)fining procedures, arrangements and quality measures with regard to assessment and validation. This project is also meant to be exemplary as a sustainable practice for ECVET and Validation approaches in the setting of the national ECVET Community of Practice and the Partnership for Lifelong Learning. Features and outcomes of this project will be transferred to the national and euregional implementation levels, illustrating established standards and necessary conditions for ECVET implementation and validation and ascertaining remaining challenges and areas for improvement.", "http://www.johnlewis.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA102-022786_12"]]}}, "3AA": {"nhs": {"data": [["RRV", "Middlesex Hospital", "nhs_RRV20"]]}}, "5PZ": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "DTZ DEBENHAM TIE LEUNG LTD*", 44806.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2017_55705"], [2016, "DTZ DEBENHAM TIE LEUNG LTD*", 44271.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_56255"]]}}}}
