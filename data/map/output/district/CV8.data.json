They want to support local sustainability, rural communities and vulnerable target groups through tailored, open-source and tested education processes. The partnership represent all geographic parts of European Union and various non-formal and formal educators active in agricultural, horticultural  and environmental sectors.  Their target groups range from children, high school and university students through vulnerable groups of rural and city population as well as unemployed, seniors, prisoners up to own staff and teachers, trainers, educators  involved in adult and youth education.  \r\nThe overall objective of the project is :  Increase the skills and abilities of vulnerable groups of people to be self-dependent,  employable, active and competitive in their effort  to have and live a sustainable, fruitful and  rewarding life. \r\nSpecific Objectives : \r\n1) Increase the skills and abilities of trainers, teachers, practitioners and representatives of local municipalities in areas of formal and non-formal education. \r\n2) Develop innovative learning and teaching tools that will fulfill the overall objective and satisfy the needs of the trainers and learners in area of social enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to produce 3 intellectual outputs : a best practice guidebook,  modular training course and a demonstration testing site for practical evaluation of educational tools. Through short term staff training and skilled trainer mobilities the project envisages active participation of 200 learners (60 own staff of partners, 60 educators, teachers  and local activists, at least 60 high school and university students and at least 20 people participating in demonstration sites). \r\nThe project will be organized in Work Packages whose management will be conducted by various project partners. The project activities in those work packages  are primarily  focused on design, preparation, testing and dissemination of educational tools    ( best practice guidebook,  modular training course and a demonstration testing site for practical evaluation of educational tools).\r\nIn order to share knowledge, develop skills and establish twinning and lasting relations the project will organize 3 types of transnational learning/teaching activities : \r\na) training of trainers and educators through site visits and expressed needs\r\nb) local training (mixed staff and beneficiaries) provided by skilled trainers of partners \r\nc) skilled partner trainers delivering tailored training to 3  demonstration sites\r\n \r\nThe project will organize various dissemination platforms, among them 3 dissemination events (2 specific workshops for dissemination of educational tools) and a final dissemination and awareness raising conference.  \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes will be demonstrated and tested increase of skills of trainers, educators and activities involved in adult education. Another result is the production of a training package based on best practices and modular training course aiming to influence European educational area.

Nature, among others, fulfills their physical needs by providing unique sensory experiences. The constant desire to return to Nature may be associated with \"innate feelings that people are part of all living things on Earth\" (so-called Biophilia Theory). But also its mystery, depth, beauty, fragility and strength are what attract us at these days of rapidly changing Environment. We are more and more surrounded by inanimate things with monotonous, unchanging and ever-repeating rhythm and way of life that reduces our attention and flexibility.Some human senses may suffer from a lack of contact with nature. Most of the technologies work primarily with sight and hearing, but we also have other senses that weaken by less frequent use. Played down senses, such as smell and taste, are also important for our wellbeing. So called \"3D perception\" of the surrounding environment flattens to \"two-dimensional reality\". Obesity, decreased mobility and overall fitness are successive consequences. Contribution of Nature and Garden Therapy consists of strengthening the physical and mental health, improving relaxation and wellbeing and also shortens hospital stay and leads to reducing of the medicament consumption. Inalienable is also the profit of increasing social integration and intercultural understanding, which are the most current needs of changing Europe. Nature does not know boundaries and can thus become a medium of communication of different social groups regardless of their religion and political view. The garden is an ideal space for intergenerational living and sharing experience. We live in a world where technology and mobility simplifies everyday life, but our contact with natural environment is becoming scarcer. The garden is a safe space for improvement in this situation, which lies right outside our door. It can help improve our motor skills, social skills, increase creativity and enables spontaneous elimination of aggression.Garden Therapy is defined as treatment and relaxation through contact with nature. The nature is represented by garden and as therapeutic remedy are used plants and work in garden. Garden Therapy has preventive effect on health, in social sphere and on relapses. The target group of this project is wide range of people with disadvantages, such as people with health disadvantages (different handicaps or developmental disorders), people after injuries, surgeries or people with mental illnesses. The other target group is defined by people with social disadvantages, such as people in difficult social and economical life situation (migrants, war veterans and refugees, minorities, children from families that fail to fulfil some of its functions, abused people, addicted people, inmates, people in hospices, retirement or nursing homes, single parents and people seeking re-integration or relational competencies, etc.). Each of us is a potential client in current hasty time.In this project we are focused on sharing experiences and best practices when working with target groups. Many of them are on the edge of social interest. They are currently perceived as an economic burden on the social system. Social and Therapeutic Gardening helps build mutual confidence, to acquire knowledge and enthusiasm. It improves employability of the target groups and support their entrepreneurship. The Social and Therapeutic Gardening also helps them to develop their communication, social and entrepreneurial skills. The project partners will become regional coordinators, which will be gradually followed by other organizations from this field and the idea of nature based therapies will eventually spread to the whole Europe.During the project we want to connect organizations dealing with Garden Therapy and Nature based therapies in various European countries. Activities within the project enables mutual exchange of cultural, work and learning experience. Each partner country has a different approach to working with target groups. Therefore it is very useful to be familiar with these different approaches on the spot and show each other what, where and how it works, or what problems they face elsewhere.Seven five-day educational activities for representatives of each partner will be held during project. Each educational activity is hosted by different partner. There are two educational activities per a year; each activity is designed for 2-4 representatives of each partner. The output of the project is summary of experience, creation of a network of potential educators and finding educational needs similar in all countries. In following project we find areas to supplement education common for all EU member states and we set further education in Garden Therapy that is specific for each target group.", "http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA204-024071_2"]]}}}}
