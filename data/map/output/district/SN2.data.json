More efficient ways to obtain safety information are needed, which could be achieved by applying grouping and read-across approaches to NMs. On a conceptual level, regulatory accepted approaches for grouping and read-across for NMs already exist, but actual application remains difficult as the required knowledge is not systematically brought together,   lacks data curation or is still missing.

At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.

However, these technologies address only two aspects of the process, namely the stability of the receptors during purification and the ability to form well-diffracting crystals. The strategies also apply only to GPCRs and not transporters or ion channels.

Although one G protein GPCR complex has been crystallised this was exceedingly diffciult and resulted in poor resolution of the GPCR component of the complex. We believe that it is possible to thermostabilise both arrestin and heterotrimeric G proteins, which will allow a simplified strategy for the crystallisation and structure determination of GPCR complexes.

This is a crucial process in eukaryotic gene expression and we aims to greatly increase our understanding of its molecular mechanism through cryoEM studies of the spliceosome. The spliceosome comprises five canonical subunits, namely U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP factors. During the initial stages, U1 and U2 snRNPs bind the 5\u2019-splice site and branch point of pre-mRNA, respectively, and the spliceosome is fully assembled when the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is recruited. The spliceosome then becomes activated through extensive structural and compositional remodeling which leads to the formation of the catalytic RNA core. Recently we determined the crystal structure of U1 snRNP and two key spliceosomal proteins: Prp8, which harbours the catalytic RNA core and Brr2, which catalyses the rearrangement of the RNA interaction network and plays a crucial role in spliceosomal activation.

Fusion must be carefully controlled and the core fusion components are typically found within a complex regulatory machine. There have been decades of research on the structure and function of individual components, on the dynamics and biophysics of fusion, and on phenotypes resulting from mutating or inhibiting component proteins. These have led to a model for fusion in which regulated refolding or assembly of proteins draws two membranes closer together until they fuse. Despite this breadth of study, we know very little about how the components of the fusion machinery function in context: How are they arranged on the membrane around the site of fusion? How do they respond structurally to regulation? How does the fully assembled machinery rearrange to reshape the membrane and drive fusion? These gaps in knowledge can be attributed to a shortage of structural biology methods able to derive structural data on proteins assembled within complex, heterogeneous or dynamic environments such as a fusion site.

Three locations, namely Prague in the Czech republic (ELI-Beamlines), Szeged in Hungary (ELI-Alps) and Bucarest in Romania (ELI-NP) have been designated to welcome these unique and complementary centers to be constructed and operated as facilities for the scientific and private community with an investment volume exceeding 850 M\u20ac. A fourth infrastructure (Apollon) of the same type as the ELI centers is also being developed in Paris at Ecole Polytechnique. \r\nThe design, construction and operation of these large-scale laser infrastructures require highly educated personnel in various domains. We evaluate that each site has to recruit technical human resources among technicians, engineers and researchers. Altogether, the need for high level skills represent a pool of 500 to 600 people. Additionally, the laser sources and beam lines will be delivered through public procurement either partly or entirely by private companies mainly originating from the EU. The supplemental industrial workload generated by the ELI programs will require companies to hiring several hundreds of specifically trained employees. On top of that, European laser facilities already operational experience turnover which target the same pool of trained professionals. Each country in the EU proposes standard curricula covering optics, lasers and photonics aimed at educating a rather stable flow of students. However, the sudden need engendered by the ELI programs exceeds the training potential of our nations in these specific topics. Even if we setup an emergency program at several universities, it will still take at least 8 years to train a high school student at a doctoral level. We are therefore facing an extended skill deficit that might endanger the actual implementation of these large-scale infrastructures. \r\nIt is the aim of this project to bring together strategic partners able to propose short-term solutions covering the immediate needs identified by the consortium. The consortium has been naturally created with partners experiencing the skills deficit (5 major laser facilities) and 5 partners experts in education, training and innovative pedagogical techniques (Universities, training center, \u2018serious games\u2019 company). \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to mitigate the above mentioned massive skills shortage in a time scale compatible with the infrastructures roadmap. As a first priority, we intend to develop a global laser safety program with certification at the European level. An additional laser-based nuclear radiation safety program will also be elaborated. Beyond the personnel safety, the partners have identified a large deficit in skills and knowledge about optics, lasers, photonics and associated technologies. We therefore propose a pedagogical approach that has been never used so far in laser and optics education (we are not aware of a similar approach in other domain either) aiming at training students and professionals at the highest level in very short terms. \r\n\r\nThe safety programs development will consist in building curricula at different levels and, in a second phase, produce the teaching material based on the agreed curricula. The challenge here is to come up with a program that is compliant with national workers law and labor codes and succeed to obtain certification at the European level. The revolutionary approach we propose here will be implemented in the context of topical education in optics, lasers and photonics. Our pedagogical concept will use information technologies. Two types of actions are considered. We will develop a library of small programs aiming at simulating complex physical effects occurring in laser or optical devices significantly easing the understanding of the underlying physics. The other action considered as a key action will use the advanced technologies of video games for educational purposes and develop a complete training tool.

Augmented reality will help him assemble the proper components by explaining, on demand, the properties and uses of these components.

The final achievement of the project will be a macro-economic impact report on cultural heritage in the times of climate change akin to the STERN report which would be a truly European contribution to future IPCC Reports.", 19725.0, 5531736.0, 14, 28, "CLIMATE FOR CULTURE", "http://www.climateforculture.eu/", "http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54054.jpg", "fp7_92906_998040470"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Maintaining Historic Buildings and Objects through Developing and Up-grading Individual Skills of Project Managers: Fostering European Heritage and Culture for Years to come", "THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR PLACES OF HISTORIC INTEREST OR NATURAL BEAUTY", 304575.0, 7, 9, "Europe has a fascinating history and various historic sites, which demonstrate imperial glory and power, which attract tourists and students of different disciplines like architecture, building culture, but also cause serious concerns. In Austria, a vast number of buildings is considered of historic value, namely ------. On one hand each building causes costs for maintenance, on other hand they need to be kept in shape to fulfil the requirements of modern life and commercial needs. Staff of bodies looking after such historic buildings do need specific skills in order to ensure that Windsor Castle, Viennese Hofburg, Schoenbrunn, Stronghold Salzburg and the Tower of London (Austrian sites, historic buildings of the UK and Amalfi coast villas) are available for future generations \u2013 and at the same time can be utilised for several purposes to cover costs. Nowadays you find offices, flats, museums, shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants and many other ways of utilising those buildings and above all we can learn about environmentally friendly building techniques. \r\n\r\nThe aim of \u201cMODI-FY\u201d - Maintaining Historic Buildings and Objects through Developing and Up-grading Individual Skills of Project Managers: Fostering European Heritage and Culture for Years to come\u201d is to provide professionals with the required certified skills and competences to help responsible organisations in developing innovative VET; this includes \r\n\r\n-recognition of previous learning and already available skills \r\n\r\n-establishment of a European certificate issued by ECQA \r\n\r\n-train-the-trainer education for experts in management of historic buildings \r\n\r\nThe consortium addresses these needs by developing a model of certified education for people working in management of historic buildings and sites. In a blended training approach old and new skills and competences will be merged into a standard requirement for current and future employees of the partner organisations as well as their suppliers and subcontractors.\r\n\r\nThe project results will be made available to other organisations around Europe and the World after completion of the project. By offering a certified training, acknowledged by ECQA, linking it into ECVET and European Skills Passport, \u201cMODI-FY\u201d helps responsible bodies to guarantee the survival of European historic treasures and protected heritage.", "http://  http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/  ", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA200-001034_3"], [2017, "Visa pro paysages et milieux naturels d'Europe 2017", "THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR PLACES OF HISTORIC INTEREST OR NATURAL BEAUTY", 15724.0, 2, 4, "Our School is located near Grenoble, an area well known for its Universities, industries and research centers especially in advanced technologies. We are surrounded by alpine mountains, National Parks and natural reserves. The population has a high rate of managers and English speaking people and is mostly keen of sports and cultural performances.\r\n\r\nWe have 450 learners in the following topics: \r\n- \u201cBac Pro\u201d (BTEC National Diploma) \"Landscaping Management\" and \"Wildlife preservation and Natural Spaces Management\" , \r\n- \"Bac Techno STAV \" (BTEC Advanced) \"Landscapes, natural spaces and resources management\", \r\n- \"BTSA\"(BTEC Higher National Diploma \u2013 120 ECTS) \r\n- Bachelor in Landscape management in cooperation with Grenoble University. \r\nWe have optional modules in English european section, photography, rugby and mountain hiking.\r\n\r\nWe have been organising school trips for 15 years and developped european and international activities since 2009: \r\n- learners placement mobility and staff mobility through Leonardo program, Erasmus, Erasmus+ Charter accreditation, EFP consortium France Europea, National Agriculture Department and Auvergne Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region fundings, \r\n- We have developed partnerships with european schools: Scotland\u2019s Rural College (Elmwood - Ecosse), Hadlow College (Royaume Uni) and l'IFA (Institucion de Formacion Agro-ambiente) of Jaca \u2013 Spain and with the National Trust estate \u201cMount Stewart\u201d in Ulster. \r\n- We offer a european section in Bac  STAV and \"2nde GT\", and are planning to open one in Bac Pro (vocational BTEC ND).\r\n- English or Spanish assistants have temporary joined us to help our teachers for 3 years.\r\nWe develop our involvement in European exchanges and international cooperation.\r\n\r\nEuropean internships will improve our learners professional and language skills and their employability. It will help them to:\r\n- understand other countries professional methods\r\n- open their mind to other cultures\r\n- acquire more autonomy.\r\n\r\nWe would like to support the increasing demand of our learners for european workplacements (3 mobilities in 2009, 10 in 2015, 16 in 2016, 20 in 2017 on a class of 100 learners every year). In line with this regular increase we would like in this project :\r\n- to obtain 22 placement mobilities for our learners\r\n- to improve the quality of these mobilities by sending 2 coaching teachers at the beginning of the placements. We choose the welcoming organisations according to our professional fields (English or Mediterranean gardens, natural spaces).\r\n\r\nWe would also like to obtain 2 staff training mobilities:\r\n- to reinforce the teaching team for our English european sections,\r\n- to improve the teaching, educational and technical skills of our teachers and staff, \r\n- to have more staff implied in international projects.\r\n\r\nMethods: \r\nThis project will help us to improve the quality of our mobilities. \r\nWe would like to continue the development of partnerships with european schools in order to have more placements and more educational and technical exchanges. Our steering committee defines objectives, plans our actions, selects candidates and works out monitoring documents. We organize mentoring meetings to help applicants to achieve their project and we plan preparation days before the departure.  \r\n\r\nImpact: \r\nOur target is to yearly increase learners placements in order to reach finally a high rate of foreign placements: 60% in Bac Techno STAV and 20% in Bac Pro. \r\nWe plan to improve the quality of our placements by more coach visits. Every learner mobility will be certificated for their exam and all mobilities by europass. We will monitor our results by survey on school-to-work transition and participant reports analysis.\r\nWe want to organize regular staff mobility and we plan to certify the skills acquired by language tests and participant reports analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDissemination:\r\nAfter their return, students and staff present their experience to new classes. Teachers present their new skills, knowledges and projects to the team. Communication will be planned and systematized towards parents, students of agricultural education, local partners, professionals and authorities.\r\n\r\nThis whole process should help us to improve the quality of our education, enhance our learners employability and the lifelong education of our community.", "http://  http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036833_3"], [2015, "ERASMUS HERITAGE LEADERS - Give Everyone access to Heritage", "THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR PLACES OF HISTORIC INTEREST OR NATURAL BEAUTY", 8138.0, 7, 7, "The seminar ERASMUS HERITAGE LEADERS Give everyone access to Heritage is proposed by Union REMPART, which is a Youth and Community Education association dedicated the safeguard of heritage.
