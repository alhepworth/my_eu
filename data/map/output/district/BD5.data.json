All participating organisations produce programs that cater to youth at risk or youth representing a multicultural context. The individual professional profiles among the representatives from each organisation include unique competencies in defection from radical and extremist affiliations, de-radicalisation experts as well as many years\u2019 experience working with youth in refugee camps.There will be a total of three activities taking place in each of the countries represented in the project. Each of the activities include presentation and workshops related to partner specific methodologies in the field of working with at risk youth, youth from refugee camps or youth that have extremist, radical  or criminal affiliations.  The joint sharing and learning among the professional participants from each organisation will result in evaluation, development of new modules for programs based on the mutually beneficial new competencies gained. There will be assessment of experiences learned in the United Kingdom for implementation in the Scandinavian context.Additionally the new competencies obtained will be tested on a specific group of youth from the network of the Swedish organisations participating in this project. This practical implementation of the capacities learned will be given to this group of youth by both professionals from each of the partners, as well as by youth leaders from Sweden and Norway.

The five demonstrator vehicles, for this purpose developed to TRL 7,  that use the hybrid powertrains will among other give a direct cost versus performance comparison at two system voltage levels in the light duty vehicles, and include the modular and standardized framework components in the heavy duty vehicles. Achieving these innovations affordably will strengthen technical leadership in powertrains, enable a leading position in hybrid technology and increases the competitiveness of European OEMs. The vehicles will be ready for market introduction between 2020 and 2022 and (price) competitive to the best in-class (full hybrid) vehicles on the market in 2013.

Project background and project goals:\r\n1. Internship during the vocational training: All of the internships form an integral component of the vocational training courses and aim at transfer and implementation of theoretical classroom room knowledge (in)to vocational practice. The focus lies on the acquisition of vocational knowledge and skills / competences to allow for independent work in a professional setting. This coincides with the acquisition of personal competence, i.e. social competence and professional autonomy and independence. The concepts correspond with the DQR, the German adaptation of the EQF.\r\n2. In order to be able to act interculturally in the future, intercultural competences are required. We see it as our goal and obligation to teach the competences necessary for successful intercultural communication. In their respective professional environments, intercultural exchanges play an increasingly significant role for our graduates and teachers. The professional environments are characterized by people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, with different religions and languages. Migration within Europe, the growing together within Europe, globalization and internationalization have led to constant changes within vocations education as well as the emergence of new professions. We consider direct interaction with people from different cultures in their homeland environment to be the most enriching and promising opportunity to acquire intercultural communicative competence.\r\n3. At the same time, our students should be prepared for a life in a democratic Europe. Due to the opportunity to move freely in Europa and the recognition of the professions in other EU countries, our graduates can also work in other countries. This also applies to the educational staff.\r\nII.

They work in educational institutions and facilities for disabled people or schools. We assume that the so-called Brexit has not yet been implemented or has no effect on our projects.\r\nIII. Expectations:\r\nWe expect an acquisition or an increase in intercultural competence in the context of professional globalization and ever closer ties within the EU. We also expect knowledge of the tasks and structures of one's own profession in other countries, knowledge about EU conditions of mobility and travel and in other countries.

After having focussed on the topic of transition from school to worklife, the need to concentrate on communication and interaction abilities for a more successful participation arouse. \r\nBoth schools are special needs schools that are focussed on learning disabilities. All participating students have therefore special educational needs in the development of their cognitive abilities. That means, besides the learning difficulties they have additional problems in reading body language and understanding communicational content as well as being a bit naive in interpersonal contact.\r\nThe students don't live separated from society but are part of it as well as their social environment. The UN convention of the rights of people with disabilities, the Paris declaration of 2015 as well as the Europa 2020 goals of the European Union emphasize the need for a better integration and participation of people with disabilities (regarding this project: with mental disabilities). Everyone has the right to live as part of the respective society, to interact with people around them and to take part in the community.\r\nSeveral institutional guidelines and laws as well as miscellaneous programs and projects concentrate on developing parameters for successful participation. In school education, there have been big changes regarding the options for disabled children to participate in the regular schooling with implemented special needs education. Further there have been major changes in the methods and goals of institutional education in special needs schooling as well. \r\nThis project takes another route. The focus is on empowering the individual student to attain the needed skills for a successful participation in society.\r\nThe exchange of good practise serves as platform to get information how students with mental disabilities can be enabled to have positive and productive interaction. Consequently, the focus of this project is on the empowerment of persons with mental disabilities and not on developing general parameters. \r\nTwo important fields of social interaction are focussed during this two parts project which are related and consecutive. \r\nAt first the direct, interpersonal interaction is taken into account. The goal is to determine the included challenges and the resulting conditions for a risk-free and functioning interaction. \r\nThe personal attributes of the participating students determine the basis, the direction but also the limits of the educational process.\r\nIn comparison of the participating schools, different methods in developing the needed skills and in encouraging the students to accept their disability in a appreciative way, to know their own limits and to get help when needed, can be evaluated.\r\nThe goal is to experience and accomplish interaction positively to motivate the students to be more confident in social interaction. Further the personal environment of the individual student is strengthened to provide the necessary support. \r\nConsecutively the second part of the project focusses on communication using information and communication technologies. All students use new media in different ways. Though there are many advantages, there are also a lot of challenges. In fact, there are options to get web contents read to you or websites that use easy language, but all of these are general parameters and don't empower the individual person with mental disability. \r\nAgain, in exchange of good practices educational methods to enable the students for a safe online interaction and communication are compared. Possibilities for transferring skills from interpersonal communication to digital interaction are evaluated and additional skills determined.\r\nThe focus is again to enable the student to be safe in online communication, to know their own limits and to get help when needed. \r\nBoth parts of the project are focussed in two students exchanges and one short term training for the staff. During the training and in support of additional cooperation partners, the individual methods of each school is evaluated.\r\nImportant for the project is that both schools work on the topics individually between the exchanges. \r\nThe targeted results are the development of small tutorials, the establishment of the contents in curricula and the inclusion into the school programs. \r\nFurther it is intended to develop methods and media for addressing these topics in lesson as well as making an information leaflet and a handout for the students.\r\nFinally, two different concepts for information events concerning these subjects are going to be developed. \r\nIn the long run the developed methods and concepts are intended to become part of the school profiles and enable them as a specialist contact for other schools or institutions.", "http://www.southfieldgrange.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035519_1"], [2015, "Auszubildende und Bildungspersonal verschiedener Fachrichtungen des Elisabeth-L\u00fcders-Berufskollegs entwickeln interkulturelle Kompetenzen in Europa", "The Southfield Grange Trust", 53889.0, 5, 7, "The project integrates mobility of learners and mobility of teachers in the area of vocational education.
