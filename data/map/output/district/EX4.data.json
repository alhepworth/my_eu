We will then build on this, designing a series of nine pilot projects, to be delivered by SPIDAS partner schools, setting out the learning objectives, the data analyses skills to be acquired, the characteristics of the proposed learning activities and ICT tools to be used in each pilot. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate each pilot, by creating communities of research - university researchers, teachers and students - to both implement and understand these learning experiences using \u201cdesign-based research methodology\u201d (Wang & Hannafin, 2005) and a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, including interviews, assessments, student-logs, observation and focus groups.  We will synthesise our results, identifying common success factors and lessons, and will draw our conclusions from these together into a structured SPIDAS Toolkit, that others can follow in order to replicate or build on our own experience. \r\n\r\nAs an immediate result of the pilot projects, we expect to: \r\n\u2022 Raise young peoples\u2019 understanding of role data can play in addressing a wide range of  real-world problems \r\n\u2022 Provide young people with the statistical and ICT/digital skills they need to use data to address these problems;\r\n\u2022 Help young people to acquire the questioning, team-working and communication skills needed for careers in data analytics; \r\n\u2022 Raise young peoples\u2019 interest and participation in subjects related to data analytics at higher levels.\r\n\u2022 Increase students\u2019 critical thinking, collaboration, creativity and caring.\r\n\u2022 Improve teachers\u2019 skills, confidence and ability to teach data analytics, statistics and other related skills.\r\n\u2022 Generate new knowledge and capacity to use ICT / data visualisation tools.\r\n\u2022 Enhance teachers\u2019 ability to design and deliver projects focused on active student-centred / problem-based learning. \r\n\r\nThrough Stakeholder engagement and partners responsibilities for teacher training and creating research impact, we expect the project results to: be mainstreamed into partner schools ongoing practice; to inform the content of initial and in-service teacher training delivered by our institutions and more broadly; to be shared with others schools in each participating region; and to inform regional and national policies on the teaching and learning of data analytics.", "http://www.exetermathematicsschool.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036520_5"]]}}, "3QJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "E-TOURISM 2016", "Astley Media Limited", 270772.0, 6, 14, "The project is presented by a Consortium composed of six Technical schools and a Vocational one, social partners, companies, and public bodies of Treviso Province; many local partners provide their external support. The common interest of this partnership is focused on the marketing of the territory and its touristic resources as an instrument for promoting and encouraging the local development in an international perspective.The project emphasizes the focus on the changes that are affecting the tourism sector: in order to attract the flows of tourism to the inland areas, and at the same time to face the change requested to the so-called \u2018Tourism 2.0\u2019, it is primarily required to act on the education and training of the next touristic operators. The project aims therefore at increasing their competences as regard the use of interactive communication tools based on the web and the touristic e-commerce. The participants will be 110 students at the end of the fourth year of study at the following schools: ITCG Sansovino -Oderzo (Consortium Coordinator); ITST Mazzotti \u2013Treviso; IPPSAR Maffioli \u2013Castelfranco Veneto; ISISS Scarpa \u2013 Motta di Livenza;  ITCS  L.B.

The students belong to the sectors of Administration, Tourism, Foreign Languages, ICT, Graphic and Communication, Hotel, restaurant and catering, Hospitality services. The profiles listed above are coherent and complementary for a competitive touristic offer in a territory which is not that much known by the general public. The specific professional skill alone is not sufficient unless it is supported by the mastery of key competences, in particular as concern the communication in foreign languages, the digital competence, <learning to learn>, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, intercultural awareness. The project aims at offering the operators of the future some training opportunities which can strengthen these skills. This will be realized through preparatory activities and the mobility during summer 2017; the mobility will last 5 weeks, being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time work experience in companies in Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), Lithuania (Vilnius), UK (Liverpool, Brighton , Reading, Torquay) and Spain (Valencia). The choice has been made taking into account the offer of various but complementary typologies of tourism, and the impact that the IT development has on this particular economic segment. All the project partners have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), that regulates the implementation of ECVET procedures in the internships. This will enable the sending schools to validate and recognize the learning outcomes according to the principle of the training equivalence. The mobility is integrated into the compulsory school-work Alternance scheme.The transnational mobility will allow the participants to run an experience into foreign companies belonging to their sector of study where the learners will have the opportunity to acquire or enhance their skills also in the multimedia field.

Within the last four years, 25 staff members (including our Deputy Head and our fund manager) and 59 pupils from different vocational paths have taken part in mobility projects involving three different host countries: England, Spain and Sweden.The aim of our project is to make our school, Isnelle Amelin, an International Vocational School by 2017.To meet this goal, our training offer will be completed by 2017 with the opening of post-A Level diplomas; we will first launch a Higher National Diploma in Esthetics, Cosmetics and Fragrances - with a Management option.By then, our training offer should be supplemented by the opening of post- A -level sections (BTS : French equivalent of British HND) in order to supply our students with a European Vocational Curriculum.To achieve this goal, we are proposing a project which is well-rounded and which entirely meets our requirements:The aim of our Erasmus+ project is to train our staff on a large scale (15% of them).Thus, we shall offer 12 staff members the possibility to improve their linguistic and teaching skills, as well as to become part of a European professional environment.The staff members concerned will be the following:  1 member of the administrative team, 2 of the school office and 9 teachers (among whom 5 vocational teachers, 2 colleagues teaching general education subjects and 2 language teachers).The goal of this project being: -to improve linguistic skills -for our human resources, to gain more experience in managing projects leading to virtual or real mobility schemes. At the same time, we shall implement around 70 mobility schemes for pupils (that is a 50% increase compared to the Leonardo project 2013-2015). These mobility schemes will revolve around three main points: - The vocational dimension (involving 4 weeks of work placement) which will be recognized with the Europass diploma.- The cultural dimension (which will consist of a complete immersion of the students within host families, a programme of organised tours around the Capital City  and around the host area).

On the one hand is the pursuit of qualifications and professional skills and on the other is the acquisition of cultural awareness. Mobility, by enabling participation in European programmes, can help to sustain such skills and the ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nAs such, our school has been developing a number of projects; since 1995 we have been part of a variety of European language schemes (PETRA, COMENIUS, LEONARDO and ARION) This scheme fits in with our school\u2019s global plans for cultural awareness and, more widely, it adheres to the Education Board\u2019s curriculum requirement for every student. This scheme has been enforced by the creation of our own European Section which affords our students the opportunity to take part in a five-week work placement in England. In addition to this, we organize regular trips abroad and have hosted language assistants for the past seven years. For the coming academic year we are looking to introduce a new event; a Languages Day during which all of the activities will be delivered in a foreign language. Moreover, we are now involved in an E-Twinning scheme that will give students the chance to take part in a partnership with a British school.\r\n\r\nOne of the aims of this scheme is to offer 30 students, from modest social backgrounds, the opportunity to enhance their learning. In addition to their regular language learning, it will improve their critical understanding of cultural differences and their professional skills regarding new surroundings and work habits. School trips abroad frequently provide our students with their first exposure to a foreign country. Furthermore, our Languages Day will help to bring the relevant staff together with a common goal in mind.\r\n\r\nThis project is run under the guidance of the Tertiary Supervisor and backed by the school\u2019s head teachers. The accounting department deals with the scheme\u2019s finances, with the help of the accounts secretary who looks after the administrative contact with our students\u2019 parents. The teachers from the \u201cEuropean Section\u201d (from both the English department and other disciplines: DNL) see the project through and take care of the follow-up.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the students who have benefitted from this programme will receive a qualification in European Studies. Moreover, each student will also receive a EUROPASS. The language skills developed with the programme will give them a real advantage in the professional world. This is especially useful for our students as there are plenty of local job opportunities that require language skills, given our proximity to Paris (Roissy Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports and Disneyland).\r\n\r\nThus, this professional experience in a foreign country will support our students\u2019 applications for their post-Baccalaureate studies.

An ecosystem approach is taken that explicitly links the health of the ecosystem with the livelihoods of dependent communities, and identifies the governance structures needed to implement sustainable development. Project outcomes are reached in four steps. First, a series of experimental, observational and modelling studies are carried out to understand both the ultimate and proximate drivers of reef health and therefore identify the chief causes of reef degradation. Second, the project assembles a toolbox of management measures and extends their scope where new research can significantly improve their efficacy. Examples include the first \u2018coral-friendly\u2019 fisheries policies that balance herbivore extraction against the needs of the ecosystem, the incorporation of coral bleaching into marine reserve design, and creation of livelihood enhancement and diversification strategies to reduce fisheries capacity. Third, focus groups and ecological models are used to determine the efficacy of management tools and the governance constraints to their implementation. This step impacts practical reef management by identifying the tools most suited to solving a particular management problem but also benefits high-level policy-makers by highlighting the governance reform needed to implement such tools effectively.

This is failing both the community, and the University, for whom the local community presents a wonderful vehicle for collaborative engaged research.\r\n\r\nAs higher education faces unprecedented public scrutiny and increasing pressures from the political, economic, social and environmental agendas, there is increased public interest in the impact of universities on their localities and regions. There are growing calls for universities to be more socially relevant and responsible by addressing the needs of society, both locally and globally. In recent years, the concept of the \u201cthird mission\u201d has become popularised, referring to the social, enterprise, and innovative activities that universities perform in addition to core teaching and research tasks.\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly accepted that universities, when well-connected with their communities, can be a vehicle for making healthier, culturally richer and more interesting places to live, work and study. Globally, more and more universities are integrating social responsibility into their mission statements, including those for research and teaching, arguing that higher education is improved when it gives back to the society that is responsible for funding it. Indeed, University Social Responsibility has become a core mission of many higher education institutions around the world.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe central aim of this proposal is to share experience and know-how of relationships between European Universities and their civic societies and to use this as the basis for a series of innovative pilot projects in each partner city. \r\n\r\nWe want to understand how Higher Education Institutions can respond to what their local community really needs and perform or broker research with and for communities, in a demand-driven way. \r\n\r\nFinally, we want to drive institution-wide commitment to co-production of knowledge and innovation through social engagement and citizen-led research, where the experience and expertise of individuals, communities and civic organisations is recognised, used and valued.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants:\r\nThis project will bring together universities, their local authority partners, community members, Civil Society Organisations and engagement practitioners, through stakeholder involvement, and participation in case studies and pilot projects in each Partner City.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nWe will conduct a review of the different models of community university partnerships such as front-door (e.g. science shops), embedded and networked partnerships. We will aim to define the processes, structures and governance which best nurture successful partnerships and identify facilitating and hindering factors which influence the collaboration process. We will explore the different approaches currently being used to include underrepresented social groups and ethnic minorities in the engagement approach and consider opportunities for improving equity throughout all stages of the collaborative process. We will also review the methods used by universities to capture and evaluate impact from community university partnerships, and aim to try to understand which indicators different stakeholders such as community partners and policymakers find useful in measuring the success of engagement activities. \r\n\r\nWe will use a case study methodology, to explore successful examples of community university partnerships in each Partner city, understanding what works and why, and measuring the impact of the projects, using interviews, documentation (of reports, course progression etc.) and observations.\r\n\r\nOur findings will then be used to inform the co-design of a community-led Pilot Project in each Partner city, each of which will be evaluated for factors such as impact, inclusion and transferability. \r\n\r\nFinally, to aid dissemination, the lessons will be made available in a variety of formats within a Toolkit which will help universities to identify opportunities to undertake, and scale-up successful citizen-driven approaches. \r\n\r\nResults and impact:\r\nThe immediate outcome of this project will be enriched knowledge and understanding of the myriad ways in which universities can engage with their communities in order to become more embedded in, and responsive to, the needs of their local city and society.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits:\r\nIn the longer term, lessons learned will enhance the relevance and impact of trans-disciplinary engaged research into societal issues (e.g. health and wellbeing & sustainability) by helping researchers to engage with the right people using the most appropriate approach, ensuring equity throughout the engagement, and understand and respond to the nature and quality of relationships which develop.", "http://www.ex.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048046_coordinator"], [2017, "Strategic Partnership for Innovation in Data Analytics in Schools", "THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER", 269419.0, 3, 13, "The everyday use of digital technologies is creating vast reservoirs of data.

The labour force in Europe is projected to decrease by an average of two million every year between 2010 and 2030. This represents a loss of 1% of its current size per year for 20 years. Yet, in many countries, most workers still retire (relatively) early. They often do so not because they want to, but because they feel compelled to (or) that they do not have other options. Solutions need to be found to make work more sustainable, and to extend working lives in order to avoid old-age poverty and to reduce state expenditure on pensions and welfare. (Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, Eurofound Report January 2017)\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research has highlighted that there are many millions of adults in Europe with low levels of functional literacy and/or numeracy skills and that the majority of these are in employment (OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2016). This has negative implications for their employment potential and longer term career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the Mid Life Career Review (MLCR) is one which is gradually gaining favour in many countries and the role of social partners in both lobbying for and delivering elements of this is one that could be critical to its success (Eurofound 2017). A MLCR is a holistic engagement designed to cover many topics such as retirement planning, finance, pensions and central to all models of a MLCR - skills. \r\n\r\nIn the UK John Cridland\u2019s very new report on pensions (published 23 March 2017) includes a recommendation to have a mid-life 'MOT' at 50 for skills and pensions. L&W Institute and TUC can take some of the credit for their campaign for everyone to have this mid-life entitlement at 50. This is the perfect time for this project, which can make a real and lasting impact.\r\n\r\nOur project will develop a suite of new materials to support the delivery of a Mid Life \u2018Skills\u2019 Review \u2013 with the emphasis on reviewing skills and competences and targeted at adults (at or around 50 years of age) with low levels of basic skills in literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. We will create new materials specifically designed for use both by Europe\u2019s social partners and others in the workplace carrying out similar 'skills review' functions. These materials will include new online \u2018gamified\u2019 skills assessment tools in a variety of languages and new online learning modules for the reviewers/assessors. Where there is a learning need identified, learners will be signposted to existing training materials. A platform for hosting these materials will be developed and the materials themselves translated into partner languages. We will also explore with partners how these new resources can be combined with the kind of holistic offer needed for a full MLCR. Further, the reviewers across the partnership will be encouraged to become \u2018mid-life skills champions\u2019, with the support of online tools and a virtual e-network. This network will support its members and share ideas and experience.\r\n\r\nAs well as a new suite of materials and in keeping with the European priority for prioritising the recognition of skills and qualifications, we will accredit learning through a new online digital badge and explore linking this into the Europass CV Programme.

Although the shift towards commercial small-scale entreprises has been identified as the most important professional outcome of the extensive funding and job- cuts in the post-2008 archaeological world in UK for example (according to studies conducted by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists - CIFA; formerly IFA) there is currently little emphasis on increasing the awareness of archaeology students towards the great diversity of entrepreneurial, skill-based career opportunities in archaeology, and no university programmes in UK and Europe with a formal curriculum on the subject. Thus, although archaeology is traditionally taught in many universities in Europe, only few graduates are aware of their great potential in providing specific specialist skills within an entrepreneurial framework; therefore, they find insertion in the traditional job market to be very difficult and only few of them are able to develop successful careers in archaeology.\r\n \r\nAmong the causes that led to the identified problem are:\r\n-  poor opportunities for sharing know-how among research-active staff involved in educating students and for collaboration with other institutions employing qualified personnel in the field of archaeology;\r\n- shortage of good practice models in archaeology aimed at developing entrepreneurship among young people and of working tools for the acquisition and recognition of skills and competences acquired in an archaeological field school at European level;\r\n- low level of international and interdisciplinary collaboration in archaeology among teachers, researchers or students.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe aim of our project is the creation, adoption and promotion of a coherent model of nonformal and informal learning, and the development of cross-border competences and of professional and transferable transversal skills for the European students within the framework of the archaeological field school at Sarmizegetusa, in order to facilitate the achievement of entrepreneurial awareness and practical experience useful in student mobility within a trans-European professional labour market.\r\n \r\nOur objectives are:\r\n1.      To increase the quality and relevance within the labour market and high education in archaeological field schools for students through innovatory practices encouraging critical thinking in the study of classical antiquity;  use of IT in archaeological recording  & heritage presentation; and virtual cooperation in research among the students.\r\n2.      To promote the employability-focused education in archaeology, with particular emphasys on practical skills entrepreneurship and on increased contact between educators and employers in the field.\r\n3.      To innovate, develop and adapt a working methodology for the teaching and recognition of archaeological competences and skills of students to the field school from 2016 and 2018 at Sarmizegetusa.\r\n4.      To consolidate the professional development and cross-border  cooperation of 10 researchers from 5 European institutions working in high education in the field of archaeology through an innovative combination of nonformal and informal learning pattern and increase  the quality of high education in the archaeological field school from Colonia Sarmizegetusa.\r\n5.      To increase the active learning and abilities for professional insertion of 40 European students through interdisciplinary and international cooperation though undertaking discrete collaborative research projects.\r\n6.      To develop active European citizenship among the students in protecting and promoting our shared European archaeological heritage.\r\nIn our project we planned a set of activities on a 30 months plan that is approaching each objective. The main activity are related with the intellectual outputs of the project (A International Curricula and a Manual of learning methods on archaeology ) and includes besides management activities also two ISP for testing and updating the above mentioned outputs, 4 multiplier events that aims the dissemination of the results and 4 transnational project meeting.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of intervention, we can start resolving this problem and as an impact we will have inovatitve and updated learning models, adapted to the current social environment and which will stimulate students in their professional development and entrepreneurship.

The overall aim is to provide coral reef managers with a toolbox of sustainable management practices that minimise the loss of coral reef health and biodiversity. An ecosystem approach is taken that explicitly links the health of the ecosystem with the livelihoods of dependent communities, and identifies the governance structures needed to implement sustainable development. Project outcomes are reached in four steps. First, a series of experimental, observational and modelling studies are carried out to understand both the ultimate and proximate drivers of reef health and therefore identify the chief causes of reef degradation. Second, the project assembles a toolbox of management measures and extends their scope where new research can significantly improve their efficacy. Examples include the first \u2018coral-friendly\u2019 fisheries policies that balance herbivore extraction against the needs of the ecosystem, the incorporation of coral bleaching into marine reserve design, and creation of livelihood enhancement and diversification strategies to reduce fisheries capacity. Third, focus groups and ecological models are used to determine the efficacy of management tools and the governance constraints to their implementation. This step impacts practical reef management by identifying the tools most suited to solving a particular management problem but also benefits high-level policy-makers by highlighting the governance reform needed to implement such tools effectively.
