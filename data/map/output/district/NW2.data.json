We feel that we can build strong links with a French or Spanish school and look forward to learning lots from our partnership . We would like our children to begin to become more aware of languages and preparing them for ks2 where they will begin to learn languages as part of the curriculum. We plan to use this project to enrich our curriculum and so that teachers can link the curriculum to the children's experience. It is important for us to create international links with our neighboring countries so that as the children learn more they can eventually use the skills they have required and put them into practice. First lead teachers will have improved language skills and leadership of subject and develop the skills to train and mentor other staff. This project will enhance their career prospects and their professional development. Subject teachers Collaborative work in the second year will be about developing international projects, promoting European Dimension and producing material for cross curricula enhancement Inspire pupils because of greater intercultural understanding by teachers and embedding of ED throughout areas of the curriculum eg Geography. The evidence gleaned in terms of needs for growth, development and improvement identified in the European Development Plan will be used  as a guide to review action to  be taken and expected results for school improvement including staff professional development. The Senior Leadership Team, Project Manager and Administrator will set up Learning Agreements with each participant setting them individual targets. The learning agreements will include references to areas for improvement and development resulting from participation in the course. The in-school project management team  will oversee the implementation of project outcomes. Participants will have improved their language competence as measured using the Europass Language Passport Participants will have developed their intercultural understanding of Spanish/French culture and life. Participants, especially those attending the first course, will have enhanced training and mentoring skills and be able to provide leadership in the implementation of the statutory requirement to deliver a language at KS2 The school will have embedded the European Dimension into the curriculum with changes to the curriculum to accommodate this intercultural understanding. Pupils will be inspired to enhance their language learning by having more competent teachers and a real audience for their language learning.

In order that the system is built and implemented in a similar manner by all EU countries, it is necessary that the people in the occupational group who provide training on HACCP, make HACCP audits and are liable to build and implement HACCP system in the food companies will be trained with the common training modules and also improve their professional levels.  The implementation of this system became compulsory by laws in the EU countries since 1998. Its implementation has become compulsory in our country by the Food Law no 5996, enacted in 2010. In order that HACCP system can be disseminated and implemented in all countries, it is necessary that the people, working at the food companies implementing HACCP System will increase their knowledge and experiences. It is necessary for this to be created a common training module, which can be implemented in all countries, by discussing the innovative methods and good-bad implementations of the different EU countries. 2-Objectives of your project: The objective is to make contribution to the elimination of the regional differences by developing ICT-based training methodologies about HACCP issues in the EU Member States or Candidate Countries. so objective is to make contribution to the dissemination of this system in the food companies by increasing the number of people, learning HACCP.3- Its participants and their profiles: the participants of this project are the academicians, providing training on ensuring food safety, food inspectors, teachers, giving food safety lessons at the vocational schools and official auditors 4-Activities: The transnational meetings will be held in each participant country by gathering the good and innovative implementations in the regions and countries of the project partners and in order that an innovative implementation be created and the participants will meet at these meetings in order to ensure the innovation and exchange their ideas.5-Method that you use in the project execution: Our objective is to ensure an Online HACCP training modules, being an innovative product, to be used by all countries at the end of the project with the share of the knowledge and experiences about HACCP implementation, regulations and site studies in different EU countries and our country and that all occupational groups, working in the field of food, receive this training and also improve their professions via ICT.

This will be composed of 7 Modules, 35 lessons and 30 hours. While the ICT program will be our biggest concrete result through the website where it will be published. Firstly, the professional competencies of the participants, taking part in the project, will increase at the stage of creating module and the other food instructors and inspectors, working in their institutions, will be impressed by this project.  The audit performance of the food inspectors will increase and the audits will be productive.The food companies can easily build and implement their own HACCP systems without receiving support from the consulting firms. The number of the people, learning HACCP in the food companies, will increase. The quality and safety of the food products will show increase. Since the public's confidence in the companies, the demand in the products of these companies will also increase and the food companies will economically reach prosperity.  The food poisoning complaints, other spoiled food complaints and product disposal will decrease.The different implementations among the EU countries, in particular England, Germany and Slovakia, being our project partners will decrease through these innovative common training modules. The commercial activities among the EU countries will show increase.The contribution will be made to the EU principle of free movement of goods owing to the positive impacts experienced locally, regionally and nationally by means of successive effects. When the safety of foods of animal origin is ensured within the scope of HACCP especially in our country, the importation and exportation of these products will be made with the EU Member States and also there will not be any excessive price fluctuations.

The objectives of this project are therefore to cohere a strategic partnership of researchers, policy and practitioner organisations in the UK, Greece and Italy to i) share educational practices in the vocational education and training (VET) of teachers who work with children with autism aged between 5 and 10; ii)  develop the skills, knowledge and understanding of educational professionals in each country; iii) adapt a UK programme professional development programme  in a manner that enables the development of ecologically valid materials  for these educational contexts and standards of practice; iv) create a framework for international collaboration and a method of delivery that can be applied to other countries to research/evaluate and develop their own educational practice in autism and to v) create a website with Open Educational Resources developed from the project to support the education of children with autism internationally. There are six partners in this project, consisting of Universities, non profit organisations, a school district and a private creative agency. These partners recognise the importance of strong links between higher education, the policy community and school practitioners. They will work together through planned regular communications and activities such as project meetings; seminars and workshops with policy makers and practitioners; and conferences in each partner country to jointly develop and deliver a range of training resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will reflect and build on current autism VET training programmes in the partner countries, and will specifically draw on the experience and expertise developed through the creation of the AET partnership programme, which is the largest ever face-to-face autism training scheme for schools across England. This programme was developed through an innovative partnership model that included individuals on the autism spectrum and a creative agency, all of whom developed a shared ethos and a vision for autism education, which linked the public, private and voluntary sector together. It has received excellent evaluation, with clear evidence of enhancing the knowledge, understanding and practice of autism practitioners (Cullen et al., 2013). We will establish a similar professional development programme in Italy and Greece consisting of three levels of training in autism education for school staff; a set of Quality Indicators for self-evaluation by settings and a Competency Framework to enable professionals to plan their Continuous Professional Development. This programme will aim to show i) sensitivity to the local and national delivery context, ii) have a sense of shared ownership, and iii) will provide the basis for further organic development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy learning from the processes and experiences of the AET programme, this partnership will employ an innovative and participatory methodology that integrates the use of ICT in novel ways. The project will be managed through a collaborative methodology enabling open communication, clear roles and responsibilities and ensuring the voice of individuals with autism is central to the work. We will carefully examine the UK partnership model and analyse how it has been delivered to over 27,000 people since February 2012 in over 100 local authorities in England. We then consider whether aspects of this methodology can be employed to the development of similar professional development programmes in Greece and Italy and to the construction of a website with Open Educational Resources, which will be targeted at school staff who work with children with autism internationally. Through an iterative developmental approach involving feedback from training deliverers and other stakeholders throughout the creation of the materials, we will ensure that all content is clear and accessible, and relevant to the local educational context and practitioners in partner countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe anticipate positive and long lasting effects on participant organisations and policy systems as well as on the individuals directly or indirectly involved in the project.
