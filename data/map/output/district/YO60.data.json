Because our schools are diverse, cover wide age-ranges, ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds and abilities of children, the challenges to ensure children acquire the necessary skills and competences have never been greater.  Achieving these goals, whilst enabling our students to further develop their awareness of cultures, languages, skills and technologies from working together with other European schools is a key aim of this project.  Raising the profile of maths, modeling and demonstrating, as teachers, that maths is fun, interesting and an essential life skill is also crucial.  All staff involved in this project realise that we, as well as our students, are continuously learning and improving our skills.  Embracing new technologies and ensuring the wide-range of digital resources that are currently available are used effectively and to their potential is also an aspect of this project we value highly.  We want to demonstrate to our students, staff and all stakeholders involved in our schools that maths is fun and engaging.  We want staff to feel more confident and enthusiastic in their own maths skills as it is more likely that this enthusiasm and confidence will be transferred to our students, their families and beyond.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe key objective of the project is to face and tackle the problem of under achievement in maths and science. The project will promote the acquisition of skills and competences connected with maths through effective and innovative teaching, learning and assessment. We are going to achieve this by supporting both teachers and students in adopting collaborative and innovative practices resulting in more holistic and effective approaches to the teaching, learning assessment of maths in our schools. \r\nThe project supports networking by schools which aims at exchanging innovative practices among partner schools (both students and teachers), improving language and digital skills but also at the same time promoting other important values such as counteracting prejudices against other nationalities, supporting collaborative work and diversity (students with different abilities work together), solving problems on international level, counteracting racism and discrimination in any aspect. The project will bring cultural knowledge and awareness to all participating pupils and staff. The collaborative work will support gender-balance and equality.\r\n\r\nPartners: \r\n6 diverse schools from the  UK, Sweden, Spain, Poland, Greece and Portugal.  Each school brings a wealth of expertise to the project either from their experience in the participation of previous projects and/or through their specialist subject knowledge including. This will include: headteachers; senior teachers; maths, I.C.T, English and Special needs specialists who teach across a range of  age ranges and abilities.\r\n\r\nActivities/Methodology:\r\nEach school will contribute a wealth of activities and events in order to achieve our objectives.   Activities, explained in the 'learning, teaching and training' and description of activities' section of this form are varied, engaging and have been shared equally between partner schools whilst also drawing upon each school's area of expertise.  Many activities are ongoing throughout the duration of the project and all activities and outcomes will be disseminated and shared on our websites and blog. All activities aim to provide students and teachers the opportunity to see how maths links to the real world and to enable staff and students to share best practise and learn from one another.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n- increasing the level and quality of education in the field of maths, science, foreign languages, ICT\r\n- developing practical skills of students connected with the use of maths in everyday life\r\n- developing learning materials, tools and resources to be used after the project\r\n- developing innovative methods in teaching, learning assessing maths\r\n- developing teachers\u00b4 awareness regarding didactic choices and teaching approaches in relation to pupils\u00b4 learning\r\n- developing pupils\u00b4awareness in connection to maths, ICT and culture\r\n- enabling all students, irrespective of their material status and possibilities, an equal access to ICT, maths news.\r\n- enhanced maths, lCT and language skills among students and teachers\r\n- increasing the awareness of equality, diversity, inclusion, gender balance, non-discrimination, cultural awareness and knowledge by adopting collaborative practices.\r\nThese results will be shared widely within our local  schools, communities and regions via a meticulously constructed dissemination plan.  Our aim is also to continue to strengthen the links made by our partner schools for many years to come, as has happened with previous projects some of our partner schools.", "http://www.sheriffhuttonschool.org", "Sheriff Hutton Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036638_coordinator"]]}}}}
