It further aims to use this global dimension to increase pupil attainment in basic skills, particularly literacy, through developing an entrepreneurial approach to education. This will focus on the development of critical and independent learning skills which sees children generating their own ideas and projects linked to their learning experiences. We aim to increase pupil's motivation to learn and to develop their creativity through the study of common literature and through sharing these experiences with other pupils across Europe, learning from and with each other. By accessing learning that is emersive and relevant we aim to promote children's self esteem and their confidence in their learning, as well as improving their abilities in basic skills.The project participants are 5 primary schools, one each in England, Spain, Italy, Finland and Sweden. During the life of the project five children's stories will be studied. The children will read these stories, or have them read to them, in their mother tongue and in English. A range of different activities will then be carried out relating to each book which address literacy objectives and curriculum needs in each school. These will be planned in detail at each of the project meetings and will include but are not limited to: writing and performing playscripts, producing illustrated books, writing book reviews, writing diaries and letters in the role of characters, writing poems based on the stories, producing non-fiction texts such as encyclopedia entries and writing newspaper reports on the main events of the stories. The children will also discuss their views of the stories and time will be built into the curriculum to meet with pupils in other schools through Skype to discuss their responses to the stories. The language of all partner countries will be studied through word banks relating to the key words in the stories and through the sharing of a book per unit which will physically travel around Europe with a character from each book, to be written in by pupils at each school as that character's diary, as well as multi-lingual activities such as creating audio books. Throughout the life of project opportunities will be given to pupils to use their initiative and develop their own ways of responding to set tasks and to develop their critical thinking skills.The project will culminate in a Business Enterprise style event where pupils will be able to apply the entrepreneurial skills they have learned. They will work in small collaborative groups to develop an idea into a product that can be sold to others. This product will be made and sold in all five schools of the partnership and information collected about profits made.This project will result in an increase in pupils basic skills and in their motivation to learn, as well as developing a positive approach to life long learning. We will develop their creativity and their ability to work independently. Pupils will have shared experiences with other pupils in different European schools resulting in a greater awareness of their place in Europe and their role as global citizens. It will allow teachers to reflect on their teaching, to learn from others best practice and to improve the quality of education within each school, developing a more creative and relevant approach to teaching.

Our team of schools consists of Pilton a previous winner of 'International Secondary School of the Year' and Braunton full International School Award holders who have been involved in many other funded projects.\r\n\r\nThis project resulted from extensive discussion about a common theme which would have a lasting impact on all our institutions. Discrimination is a problem which has many forms but which affects every school and even community.  The current European climate of migrant acceptance, cyberbullying, bullying, gender equality and the whole prevent strategy has made awareness and acceptance amongst young people a prominent issue.\r\n\r\nOur project group felt that by addressing this issue we could develop a complex project which will help not only the individuals involved in it but the whole school and wider community in which our schools exist.\r\n\r\nThe student participants will be selected in each school to reflect students from different backgrounds who have differing experiences of the issues mentioned or who belong to existing mentoring or support projects in their school.  It is intended to take 6 students and 2 staff members to each mobility.  This will be a different group of students each time to allow for maximum exposure to joint collaboration.  The overall number of students and teachers directly involved over the project lifetime is estimated to be at least 800.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve a range of activities in individual schools leading up to each mobility and then joint working groups taking part in a variety of collaborative activities during the mobilities.

Developing the culture and sustainability of international relations at the institutional level\r\nThe intention to  develop intercultural competencies and language skills is important as our school has been a sending and host organisation for years.  The improvement of these skills and competencies and a stronger cooperation with the partners are expected by encouraging the involvement of our staff members. In the dual vocational training  system co-working with the external training places is a must and mobilities provide an opportunity to study and implement the good practices available in several partner institutions (Finnish, French). The accompanying teachers also play a crucial role in realising this strategic goal.\r\n2. Developing the quality of VET providing innovative, competitive, modern and up-to-date theoretical and practical knowledge for students and staff\r\nOn behalf of our staff members there has been a demand to get to know new educational trends, practical methods in order to provide our students with up-to-date knowledge in theory and practice and support them to find their place at the labour market. Thus they can also raise the standard of vocational education and training in our school.\r\nThe urge for our hospitality and tourism teachers' mobility in the UK comes from the necessity to  develop the quality  of vocational training  as well as the special modern methodological requirements of tourism and dual vocational courses. \r\nIn the framework of this project, VET learners participate in mobilities in our partner institutes. In the majority of the time they spend their work practice at an external training place of the host institute, meanwhile they also participate in practical lessons in the host institution. The work programme is in accordance with the participant's actual home training programme at the sending institution,and form an integral part of the fulfilment of their compulsory course requirements improving their basic, professional, personal and intercultural competencies and skills. The participants do hotel-tourism and hospitality practice in a real working environment and the acquired knowledge can be applied at work, at school and during the exams too.\r\nThe prerequisite of the tourism final exam is a B2 level accredited language examination certificate, therefore spending work practice in the context  of the traget language is a real need to improve their language skills as well.\r\nImprovement: our school felt the necessity to implement ECVET tools to validate the learning outcomes of the mobilites for the students: their performance during the work placement will be assessed and transformed into marks in our school.  We modify the learning agreements and re-define our learning outcomes  by profession/grade. \r\n3. Decreasing the number of drop-out students\r\n The rate  of students with special educational needs and/or with poor socioeconomic status is nearly  30 % of our full-time students  and they require individual help and are taught inclusively.  With special emphasis on reducing the number of unsuccessful/drop-out students , and improving their ability of self-support, social integration and finding their place  on the labour market our aim is to increase their numbers among the participants. Staff members will also study the co-working of the school, practice place, parents and students  and the ways of preventing drop-out to learn alternative methods and solutions.\r\n\r\nActivities: We would like to implement 4 main types of activities:\r\nI.VET learners mobilities\r\n09-10/ 2018 and 2019, Slovakia: 5 \r\n09-10/2018 and 2019 Finland: 4 \r\n10-11/2018 and 2019 France: 4\r\n01-02/2019 and 2020, UK: 4\r\n09-10/2018 and 2019, Italy: 4 \r\n10-11/2018 and 2019 Spain: 6 students of hospitality-hotel-tourism per round\r\n10-11/2019 Estonia: 2 students of hospitality-hotel-tourism.\r\nI..

THE AIM OF THE PROJECTThe aim of the project is the implementation of VET student and teacher mobilities on the basis of the pedagogical programme of the sending institution, bearing in mind the current training and institutional development needs.THE PROFESSIONAL CONTENT OF THE PROJECTIn the framework of this project, VET learners participate in mobilities in 6 partner training institutes. In the majority of the time they spend their work practice  at an external training place of the host institute, and participate in practical lessons in the host institution. The work programme is in accordance with the participant's actual home training programme at the sending institution, and form an integral part of the fulfilment of their compulsory work practice course requirements.  In our previous mobility certificate projects the students did only catering projects, but we recently introduced the tourism major in our initial vocational courses and our post-secondary courses, so we enriched the variety of Erasmus+ mobilities we offer. The prerequisite of the tourism final exam is the acquirement of a B2 level accredited special language examination certificate, so spending work practice in the target-level context is a real need, where language skills and professional skills and competencies can be developed side by side. A brand new feature of the previous Erasmus+ programme was the involvement of the staff members on the basis of an integral institutional international strategy. In this round we developed further our project by planning staff mobilities, too, thus fulfilling the institution\u2019s professional and developmental needs. French mobility enables our pastry cooks and instructors to get to know the wide selection of bakery products. Our hospitality instructor\u2019s Slovakian mobility aims at the study of the practice hotel as well as international cuisine following the internationalisation strategy of our institution. The need for our  hospitality and tourism teachers' mobility in the UK comes from the special modern methodology requirements of the newly introduced tourism and dual vocational courses. Our school trains the most, almost 70 special needs students in a vocational context in our area, among them several ones with multiple learning difficulties and behavioural disorders, as well as mental disabilities, physical  handicap. We develop them individually, but at the same time we integrate them in the school community. Our learning support teacher is going to study the good practices of inclusive pedagogy in a vocational context in the UK, with special emphasis on the ways of reducing the number of unsuccessful students at school work , the ability of self-support, social integration and finding way on the labour market. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROJECT:11th, 12th,13th and 14 th Year hospitality and tourism students : 44 students; 4 hospitality instructors (France and Slovakia); 2 hospitality & tourism teachers (UK); 2 learning support teachers (UK)PROJECT ACTIVITIESIn the course of the project we would like to implement two main types of activities:I.

The objective is to give students a differentiated awareness of other EU countries and apart from their system of training, school/university education and concerning art and design an insight into trends and how to realize design tasks accordingly. To do this they will carry out a two-year project which focuses on analysis and comparions first and in the second year on realizing international design objects and more importantly setting up an Internet platform that will contain all kinds of information about the different jobs in the field of art and design and finding the fitting job, how to best apply, platform for vacancies of companies and agencies in cooperation with local job agencies.We are five participating schools from all over Europe. Even though Scandinacian schools are missing, the techniques the students aquire in the course of the project will help them to find information and/or an internship/job in those countries which are not involved. Our students all have a creative affinity and the focus is to help them find a way of making a living of their skills keeping their motiviation high to stay at school.We will apply a variety of activities and methods (doing role plays, making videos, visiting museums, galleries, ... , creating a design object and communication design, planning an exhibition, blogs and Internet platform). The students will be guided to plan and execute the Learning/Teaching/Training Activities on their own. During the lessons they will prepare the international Learning/Teaching/Training Activities in small groups. After that they will present their work during the meetings and finally execute and evaluate them in multinational groups.All in all, this project follows the method of autonomous learning by means of an orientation towards project work, resulting in a final product. Modules for method training, communication training and team development are planned as accompanying measures during the national project phases.On a professional level the main result will be the Internet platform and the digital competence connected to it but also the students' strengthened self-esteem and ability to work and communicate in an international context.On a social level the main result is an awareness concerning intercultural behaviour and to work in international teams.The cooperation with the local job agencies is a big asset in the dissemination process making future students aware of their possibilites in the European Union and strengthening and/or establishing contacts to local companies/agencies.", "http://www.petroc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-023038_1"], [2015, "European Pathways to Employment for Disabled Young People", "PETROC", 49466.0, 2, 2, "The European Pathways to Employment for Disabled Young People is a 2 year Strategic Partnership project involving Petroc, an FE college from Devon, and Duveholms Gymnasies\u00e4rskola, A school from Katrineholm, Sweden.

In the majority of the time they spend their work practice working at an external training place of the host institute, and they spend at least one day per week at the host institute, participating in practical lessons. The work programme strictly suits the participants\u2019 actual home training programme at the sending institution, and form an integral part of the fulfilment of their compulsory work practice course requirements.  In our previous mobility certificate projects the students did only catering projects, but we recently introduced the tourism major in our initial vocational courses and our post-secondary courses, so we enriched the variety of Erasmus+ mobilities we offer. The prerequisite of the tourism final exam is the acquirement of a B2 level accredited special language examination certificate, so spending work practice in the target language context is a real need, where language skills and professional skills and competencies can be developed side by side. A brand new feature of the Erasmus+ programme is the involvement of the staff members on the basis of an integral institutional international strategy. The Leonardo Mobility Certificate did not allow us to include staff mobility. In this round we developed further our project by planning staff mobilities, too, thus fulfilling the institution\u2019s professional and developmental needs. Our hospitality instructor\u2019s Slovakian mobility is rooted in the development of our training courses on offer. We would like to introduce bartender and barista courses in the near future. The aim of our French teacher\u2019s mobility in France is to experience new methods, and collect realia, authentic teaching materials, tests, etc. that can be used in French for Hospitality and Tourism lessons in the newly introduced dual vocational training courses. Such materials are not available at the moments, and the collection of methodology tools and authentic materials will enhance French teaching in these courses for all our French teachers. The need for our  hospitality and tourism teacher\u2019s mobility in the UK comes from the special modern methodology requirements of the newly introduced tourism and dual vocational courses.

Activities have been carefully selected by an appointed Project team in order to meet the organisation's needs in terms of quality development of teaching and learning, modernization and internationalisation. The general objective of the project is focused on improving teachers\u2019 transversal skills as important attributes that enhance individual\u2019s interactions and job performance. More specifically, the project aims at:\u2022 improving language skills and culture competences for the staff and the students, to help them tackle the needs of a global and interconnected economy;\u2022 promoting the digital (ICT) competence and practical classroom skills of teachers thus filling the generation gap between teachers and students; \u2022 achieving a stronger awareness of the European dimension of education.The selection of 10 teachers of the staff participating to the project \"Europe in M.I.N.D.D.\"  takes into account the following criteria:\u2022 the knowledge of the language in order to take full advantage of the benefits deriving from training activities and interactions in host schools abroad;\u2022 involvement in CLIL methodology courses, the use of ICT in teaching and course for ECDL, foreign language courses and/or language certificates, organized by schools or universities;\u2022 motivation and awareness of duties connected with the promotion of materials to disseminate the results.Participating teachers will take part in the evaluation of the Project through self-monitoring and self-evaluation, before, during and after the activities. They will set personal aims and expectations, they will write a log to update colleagues and students about their experiences abroad and they will write a final report.The learning experience in a EU dimension will strengthen our response to the needs of innovation promoted by the strategy Europe 2020 (ET Lisbon) and the modernisation agenda (EC 2011).The strategic use of ICT-based methodologies and new tools learnt in the international project activities will enable learning for all, thus creating an inclusive learning environment well suited for several learning styles and disabilities, including:\u2022 pupils with diverse needs of personalised learning approaches;\u2022 students from different culture and social backgrounds (i.e. immigrants and refugees).The impact of results on the organization will be supported by an effective plan of dissemination through the cooperation between all the parts involved (host school, training provider, participants, students, families).The dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be carried out using a variety of tools (web site, newsletter, informative corners inside the school, multimedia products as well as the communication with other relevant organization involved in teaching and training process).The competences and knowledge gained will motivate in organizing more mobility projects in the future, incoming and outgoing, hopefully finding KA 2 partnership with one or more partner schools from other countries participating in Erasmus+.", "http://www.petroc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023990_1"], [2015, "Petroc Go Barcelona 2015", "Petroc", 12092.0, 2, 2, "Petroc Go Barcelona! is a Key Action 1 project, which will allow 10 students and 2 staff from Petroc, a large General Further Education College in Devon, to undertake 2 week work placements and training opportunities within businesses in Barcelona in Spring 2016.\r\n\r\nThe project targets participants in an isolated rural area, who face barriers to accessing education, training and personal/professional development opportunities.

The galenic formulation will consist of drug loaded biodegradable polymer particles (e.g., chitosan, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) embedded into a biodegradable hydrogel matrix (e.g., hyaluronic acid (HA)-based) to be deposited as a patch onto the olfactory region. A pH-sensitive, mucoadhesive particle coating (e.g., chitosan, chitosan derivatives) will ensure an environment-specific adhesion to the olfactory epithelium. This novel technology will largely enhance the controlled and sustainable delivery of drugs and increase the drug bioavailabilty to the CNS. NogoA antagonist NG-101 will be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Proof of concept studies and initial clinical data have proven the enormous potential of blocking NogoA for spinal cord remyelation and axonal integrity. However, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) like NG-101, do not sufficiently cross the BBB. The sustainable and controlled release of NG-101 to the CNS will be achieved via the transport of embedded polymer particles to the olfactory epithelium, the subsequent release of API and permeation through the olfactory region, the only part of the nasal epithelium which is in direct contact with the brain. The direct transport route from the nasal cavity to the brain, bypassing the BBB, offers an exciting mode of central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery not only for demyelinating disorders but also for other CNS indications, e.g., stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or tumours. The proposed new innovative N2B drug delivery platform is a practical, safe, and minimally invasive technology. It will be exploited for NG-101 and has the potential to be implemented with other APIs with a low CNS bioavailability.", 533596.0, 5646500.0, 8, 11, "N2B-patch", null, null, null, "h2020_206572_926453791"]]}}, "4JB": {"nhs": {"data": [["RBZ", "North Devon District Hospital", "nhs_RBZ12"]]}}}}
