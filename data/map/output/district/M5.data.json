Finally, energy transition affects the entire spectrum of organizations in an area, since all consume energy, produce waste or have mobility needs. This means that anyone who promotes initiatives to accelerate energy transition must, if they want to avoid failure, be ready to deal with a considerable number of factors, whether obstacles or enablers, covering almost the entire range of human experience, from political practices to the most intimate aspects of the lives of families and individuals.", 88568.0, 2410145.0, 8, 11, "MILESECURE-2050", "http://www.milesecure2050.eu", "http://www.salford.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156135.jpg", "fp7_106718_999829441"], [1330560000000, 1419984000000, "Mapping the population, careers, mobilities and impacts of advanced research degree graduates in the social sciences and humanities", "The University of Salford", "This proposal is focused on increasing our understanding of the career paths and employment patterns and contribution of doctoral graduates in the social sciences and humanities.

In addition, service user partnership and involvement in education is growing in importance for the development of future and current practitioners.  Despite policies placing a strong emphasis on positive approaches like recovery-orientated practices and social inclusion, service user empowerment and involvement is still a common challenge across European countries. Higher Education Institutions have a significant role to play in developing this and in developing the competencies needed by current and future practitioners, through leading the knowledge triangle of education, research and work.  Across Europe there is no model in mental health that harnesses the contributions these groups have to make.  This project sets three objectives.\r\nThe first aims to create a Tripartite model for working encompassing the university, the service user and staff in clinical practice, to bring research and the service user perspective to mental health practice, central to current mental health policies.  Central to this, is the project use of a participatory research design and the co-production of materials drawing from service users experiences, coupled with an appreciation of different kinds of knowledge and positive attitudes that they can bring.  This is regarded as important to the education of future and current professionals. For service users, co-production of knowledge and co-operation in education supports social inclusion, strengthens participants\u2019 self-efficacy and increases the sense of involvement via a shared understanding, equality and dialogical approach.  \r\nThe second, focuses on the development of a competency assessment for undergraduate students. It is hoped that this will be a comprehensive assessment for both mental health and general skills competencies, across different countries and education systems. \r\nThe third focuses on the development of eLearning materials for mental health created through the process of co-production.  A criticism of eLearning and eHealth is that it places emphasis on learning instead of doing.  A shift in emphasis is needed from eLearning to 'learning by doing' (Aldrich 2012).  Here the concept of 'gamification' can facilitate this transition from learning to doing.  Although new, this approach has seen positive results in mental health (Johnson et al. 2016).  This project aims to strengthen multi-professional competencies in mental health with nursing, social and health care students, service users and professionals in international context through blending eLearning and intensive programmes and training. \r\nThe project uses a participatory research design  with collaborative learning methods. It will produce intellectual outputs in the form of online digital modules and a tool for the assessment of mental health competences for undergraduate programmes. The project follows the ideas of the European Commission's Modernisation of Higher Education Agenda (2014) in developing new modes of learning and teaching in higher education and is in line with the recommendations for Opening up Education by using innovative teaching and learning for all, through using new Technologies and Open Educational Resources (2013).  It also supports  the concepts of lifelong learning, internationality and continuing professional development (Education and Training 2020).\r\nThe partners are from higher education institutions in Ireland, Finland, Belgium, UK and Greece.  Undergraduate students and educators from these institutions will participate the project, with service users and practitioners on each site. During the project there will be transnational project meetings, intensive programs for both learners and educators, in addition to training days for a wide audience. The project will produce three intellectual outputs in addition to increasing the mental health competences of the participants and greater international co-operation. Active dissemination is crucial to the project and the intellectual outputs and results will be made widely available for others to use nationally and internationally. \r\nLong term benefit of the project will be the development of a collaborative tripartite learning model, created for work with practitioners and students (service providers), service users and educators. The model will have the capacity to be adapted to other contexts.  Online modules will place emphasis on 'gamification' using co-production with professionals and service users;  this will represent a new approach to creating online materials.\r\nThe way of working could be implemented also in other contexts. For the collaborating partners long term benefits will be in changes in the area of mental health competences, an increase in international co-operation and greater opportunities for co-operation between the members of this new undergraduate mental health consortium.", "http://www.salford.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IE02-KA203-000548_2"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", 211386.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.salford.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046812_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", 176063.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.salford.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023148_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", 163790.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.salford.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012904_coordinator"], [2017, "Redes activas de colaboraci\u00f3n para el aprendizaje", "THE UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD", 70746.0, 4, 4, "The aim of this project is to help low-skilled or unqualified adults, identifying transverse skills that have acquired a long-term life span and have not validated either in their jobs or in their formal or non-formal education, and their further recognition according to the European Framework.

This ensures the identification of transversal competences typical of the 21st century.\r\nIO2: Creation of a technological tool in web format to be used from any computer and in mobile device format so that it can be extracted from the mobile device of any intelligent device.\r\nIO3: Provide feedback and feedback from adults and adult educators on the platform and mobile device and developed.\r\nIO4: Dissemination of the the main output of the project through adult education organizations, adult education networks and decision-makers.\r\n\r\nThe methodology at all times is teamwork. It will be  led and supervised by the University of Valladolid and by the person in charge of each of the IOs. This methodology is essential for the direct work with the group that are carried out throughout the project. All partners are responsible for their tasks and active participation in each of the IOs. \r\n\r\nIt is expected to have a large impact on adults. Nowadays, the importance of transverse competencies from the employers is similar to the techniques - if not greater, but there are no parameters of control or evaluation of the same. With this project, it will be achieved a tool capable of assessing the level of personal's transversal competences, allowing to give people information in order to improve them.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, through the use of this tool it is possible to increase the level of competences of the adult population, and more concretely of adults with low qualifications and difficulties to access formal education.
