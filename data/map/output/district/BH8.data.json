Sport is a social activity and our organisations believe that by practicing any kind of sport one does not only stay healthy and fit but, he or she will also get the opportunity to meet new people and interact with others. In fact we want to carry out this project because we want to meet new people who are also interested in sport activities. We also want to use sport as a vehicle to promote greater cooperation, cultural interaction and social inclusion. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are the following:\r\n\r\n1. To exchange good practices;\r\n2. Promotion of active participation of youths through sport; \r\n3. To promote the value of tolerance and an inclusive society; and\r\n4. To promote the free movement of persons. \r\n\r\nThe needs and the issues that we want to tackle in this project are:\r\n\r\n1. To continue to encourage us youths to take part in sport;\r\n2. To enable us to learn more about the culture of another European State;\r\n3. To enable us to get the opportunity to voice our opinions in a group; \r\n4. To address topics related to employment, entrepreneurship and social inclusion\r\n\r\nThe participants in this project will be young people with an interest in sport - especially football. This youth exchange is aimed towards those youths who have a passion for sport and who seek to explore new opportunities which go beyond their personal or country's limitations. The participants that were chosen for this youth exchange project are affiliated with the participating organisations and they are young people who would like to further their knowledge in sport and gain more knowledge about the opportunities that this sector has to offer in other European States and its added value that may provide to European citizenship. \r\n\r\nThe project will include the following activities:\r\n\r\n1. Welcome address and the ice breaking activity; \r\n2. Presentations;\r\n3. Discussions;\r\n4. Meetings;\r\n5. Practical Activities; \r\n6. Cultural activities; and\r\n7. Visits.\r\n\r\nThe project proposal that we are presenting will have a positive impact not just on us but also on the participating organisations. \r\n\r\nThe young people involved in this project are all interested in sport activities and together we can share experiences, knowledge and ideas. In fact one of the objectives of this project is the exchange of best practices. \r\n\r\nWe will have time to get to know each other and the role of the partner organisation in the UK. We will also get a clearer picture of the sport-related employment opportunities in Britain, Malta and the EU. Most of us are interested in finding a job which is related to sport, but due to the geographical limitations of Malta this is not always possible. However, some of us are also willing to find employment in the EU, which means benefiting of the principle of the free movement of persons. Discussing this topic in more detail with the young people from Britain will further our knowledge about the possibilities that exist in this sector. We will also help our British partners who may be interested in getting more information about the situation in the Mediterranean. \r\n\r\nThis experience will help us improve our team work skills. We have already learned about this during the preparatory stage of this project, and we will continue to learn about the importance of team effort once we are in the UK to implement the project. The applicant organisation has involved us from the beginning of this project, and we had to communicate with our partners in order to draft the activity programme and agree on a final version. The youth exchange per se will definitely have a positive impact on our communication skills. \r\n\r\nWe did not have experience in project planning, but the process so far has already taught us a lot about what is required to design a project proposal, present it to your partners, and communicate with the involved stakeholders to achieve a final draft on which there is group consensus.  We have also acquired knowledge about the Erasmus+ Programme because we had to familiarise ourselves with its objectives in order to be able to draft a good project proposal. \r\n\r\nMoreover, this project experience will also have a positive impact on the participating organisations. As already stated in other parts of this application, both organisations intend to establish a better relationship in order to be able to team up together in the future to apply for other funding opportunities. This project may only be the starting point of the process. Both organisations have shown great commitment, and they have been of assistance to us young participants from the start. Although we drafted the project proposal and the activity programme, the work we carried out was always monitored and vetted by the applicant organisation.", "http://www.starsoccerboysclub.com", null, "erasmus_2017-2-MT01-KA105-027019_1"]]}}, "8EW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1614470400000, "Big Data for Medical Analytics", "My Mhealth Limited", "There are three main reasons for an immediate innovation action to apply big data technologies in Healthcare.

This implementation both limited consumption of plastic bags and promote people to using recyclable bags or bags made of less harmful substances. In this way, created awareness resulted in economic advantages. In addition, applied legal obligations directed people to question themselves about unrestrained usage of plastic bags.

This also generates a greater need to ensure that teachers share best practice and expertise. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, there will be a greater enthusiasm for second language learning and for cultural exchange visits. Staff will be asked to build a range of language skills so that impact on research projects is enhanced through staff ability to disseminate results internationally and pupil transition to  secondary partners developing language learning will be more efficient.
