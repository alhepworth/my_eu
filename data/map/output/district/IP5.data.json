The APACHE concept is based on developing devices having both multi-functionality and agility in order to reach Terabit capacities on a single photonic integrated chip. The technology is based on the combination of indium phosphide monolithic elements, silicon submounts and silica-on-silicon planar lightwave circuits for achieving cost-effectiveness, high yield, small footprint, low power consumption and device scaling far in advance of the level commercially available today. The APACHE integration approach includes an increase in scale for both horizontal and vertical integration through a 'monolithic-on-hybrid' technology. Horizontal integration (the serial increase in the number of and type of components hybridly integrated) will be implemented using low loss passive assembly. Using this technique, the integration of different photonic elements such as lasers, amplifiers, modulators and filters will be achieved. In parallel, vertical integration (increasing the complexity of the optical components from single function devices to large arrays using monolithic InP integration, which are also subsequently hybridly integrated) will provide a scaleable and low cost platform for the realisation of compact and low power consumption modules. Phase and amplitude modulators (EAM, MZIs and nested MZIs) will be fabricated exploiting InP technology, opposed to lithium niobate (LiNbO3), for achieving at least a factor of twenty in footprint reduction, lower driving voltages and increased stability.

As a result, energy limits will constrain future growth, and this is predicted to be a significant brake on development of the global knowledge economy. The C-3PO project will develop a new generation of 'coolerless' and 'colourless' photonic components that will reduce power consumption, whilst enabling bandwidth growth and constraining cost. Taking a large modern internet data and switching centre with 5MWatt power consumption (44GWh/year) as an example, the ability of C-3PO photonic components to operate without cooling can lead to annual communications equipment and air-conditioning power savings of up to 4GWh, which will reduce energy costs by ~500k\u20ac/year for such a typical data centre. In addition, the C-3PO components will be 'colourless', or non-wavelength specific, which allows a single component type to operate at any wavelength in a dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) system. As such, C-3PO technology can be universally applied from low-cost and reconfigurable router interfaces for metro networks down to the end-user optical modem in fibre to the home/business networks. In detail, C-3PO will develop low cost photonic-integrated multi-wavelength laser sources with high temperature-stable performance and use these as 'optical wavelength power sources' to seed colourless and coolerless InP-based reflective modulators driven by power-efficient SiGe BiCMOS electronics. This will remove the need for use of expensive, thermoelectrically cooled tuneable lasers, leading to projected global annual equipment savings of more than 300M\u20ac from data and switching centre applications alone. This saving would be achieved through simplification of optical and electronic hardware, the reduction of the need for thermal management and the elimination of manufacturing costs associated with device characterisation and the generation of individual laser tuning maps.

Sequential application of the process enables different components of different functionality to be manipulated in a highly flexible and programmable way making best use of the materials.

Around 80% of electrical power is wasted in a 1.55?m laser chip as heat. Most systems require thermo-electric coolers and an air-conditioned environment, further increasing the energy budget by over an order of magnitude. The losses are due to Auger recombination in semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs), and due to the temperature dependence of the energy gap in electro-absorption modulators (EAMs). Incremental approaches to overcome these problems have reached their limits. We propose a radical change, to manipulate the electronic band structure of novel dilute bismide and dilute nitride alloys of GaAs and InP to eliminate Auger recombination and dramatically reduce the temperature dependence of the energy gap. This allows us to research, develop, test and demonstrate uncooled EAMs, highly efficient uncooled lasers and SOAs.

Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.\n\nTo overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.\n\nVICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries.
