The project centres on the development and validation of a new method in health promotion, namely a community-based coach education program aimed at promoting the psychosocial development and adoption of healthy lifestyles among young people in Europe. The proposed project will foster collaboration between major research groups representing 5 countries (8 universities) in the European Community and promote the integration of their ongoing research efforts centred on health promotion in youth from two perspectives, namely (a) motivational processes and optimal functioning in the physical domain among young people, and (b) cross-national differences in and environmental impacts on children\u2019s health behaviour.  In terms of study design, the PAPA project will examine differences between the provision of youth sport and its health related impacts as currently exists in the targeted countries and a youth sport intervention designed to enhance personal competence, relatedness and self determination of the young players aged 10-14 and their adoption of a healthy lifestyle.   In examining the effectiveness of the intervention programme, the pre- and post-season (plus beginning of the subsequent season follow-up) responses of coaches and players in the intervention arm (representing 50 football teams) will be contrasted to a control group of 30 coaches and their players.", 80522.0, 3236586.0, 5, 8, "PAPA", null, "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/147637.jpg", "fp7_90413_996613988"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 100039.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047070_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 80633.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-036012_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 79108.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023653_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 75935.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000019_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 57199.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.yorksj.ac.uk", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012849_coordinator"], [2018, "BBA Oldenburg - Let's go Europe!", "YORK ST JOHN UNIVERSITY", 19940.0, 4, 6, "BBA Oldenburg, an initial vocational school for Occupational Therapy in Germany, is aiming to offer its students and lecturers inspiration through international experience and exchange in order to provide an up-to-date and high-quality training.
