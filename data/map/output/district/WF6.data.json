This objective will be achieved through integrated research into the field based technology knowledge gaps, such as cavity progression and geomechanics, potential groundwater contamination and subsidence impacts, together with research into process engineering solutions in order to assess the role/impact of site specific factors (coal type, depth/pressure, thickness, roof and floor rock strata, hydrology) and selected reagents on the operability of a given CO2 emission mitigation option in a coalfield.\nCO2 storage capacity on site for European and international UCG resources will be assessed and CO2 mitigation technologies based on end use of produced synthetic gas will be evaluated. The technology options identified will be evaluated with respect to local and full chain Life Cycle environmental impacts and costs.\n\nThe project takes a radical and holistic approach to coupled UCG-CCS, and thus the site selection criteria for the coupled process, considering different end-uses of the produced synthetic gas, covering other options beyond power generation, and will evaluate novel approaches to UCG reagent use in order to optimise the whole process. This approach aims at minimising the need for on-site CO2 storage capacity as well as maximising the economic yield of UCG through value added end products, as well as power generation, depending on the local coalfield and geological conditions.", 109536.0, 3217941.0, 12, 16, "TOPS", null, null, null, "fp7_109590_952073334"], [1251763200000, 1354233600000, "Automatic Oil-Spill Recognition and Geopositioning integrated in a Marine Monitoring Network", "Scensive Technologies Ltd", "The concept of the ARGOMARINE proposal is the monitoring of the marine traffic due to carriers and commercial ships through environmental-sensitive sea areas. This monitoring will be realized by means of sophisticated electronic, geopositioning, and telematic tools connected through a high speed network along with data transmission through suitable data links. Data from different sources will be collected in an independent and remote fashion and sent to a main acquisition and elaboration central unit. . Motivation and scope of the Argomarine project is the safe detection, notification and interventions on vessels in emergency situation and the protection of sea and insular environment, endangered by heavy and continuous activities, mainly due to intensive ship traffic, generating a consistent pollution risk.The envisaged goal is connected to the necessity of precise and punctual pollution control in areas and shores which are, for instance, of particular naturalistic value, and/or are exposed to risk of accidental or even intentional contamination due to their vicinity to industrial or highly densely populated settlements, or crossed by a heavy ship traffic. All the data and the information obtained will be merged and elaborated in a Marine Information System (MIS), i.e. an information system where remote sensing data, field experiment results and estimates from simulation models will be integrated, and tools for data storage and retrieval, data manipulation and analysis, as well as for presentation, will available through a common interface", null, 4139069.0, 6, 9, "ARGOMARINE", "http://www.argomarine.eu/public/", null, "/docs/results/images/2013-06/57639.jpg", "fp7_92507_999723905"], [1214870400000, 1320019200000, "Virtual Pathological Heart of the Virtual Physiological Human", "Euro (Pms) Limited", "Heart failure accounts for almost a quarter of all admissions to hospital for cardiovascular events, has a high mortality (median survival around 18 months), and places a great burden on all healthcare systems, with estimated direct costs of \u00a3905m (?1350m) in the United Kingdom in 2000, 2% of total NHS expenditure.VPH2 aims to develop a patient-specific computational modelling and simulation of the human heart to assist the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon in defining the severity and extent of disease in patients with post-ischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD), with or without ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR).

ARTreat will apply the developed patient-specific model on two main applications: the clinical decision support and the training. ARTreat will produce two decision support tools to assist clinical cardiologists into providing personalized treatment selection and real-time, on- the-fly advice during invasive interventions, such stent positioning. The aim is to minimize future therapy costs, by providing higher than even possible personalized treatment support. The same patient-specific model will also be used to develop a real-case simulator training, which will support realistic hands-on skill development training to clinical cardiologists. Finally, ARTreat is coupled with advanced clinical support tools for plaque characterization, and the discovery of new knowledge; associations among heterogeneous data, that can improve the predictive power of the patient-model. It thus supports the medical expert into programming the accumulated knowledge into the existing model and generating an adaptive patient-specific computational tool.
