These studies belong to the occupational category of Information Technology and they are taught both in English and Spanish.The main goal of the Project is to wrap these bilingual studies up by offering a professional internship in UK to maximise their English level and their professional skills. That is why UK has been chosen as destination, because English is essential in a more and more globalised world and it is the language of Information Technology since the most part of the documentation is written in this language. With regards to professional skills, UK is a pioneering model of the main quality IT methodologies on the European level (ITIL, SSADM...) and, besides, it is the European general headquarters of many of the world cutting-edge companies (together with Ireland). Therefore, it is the ideal location to absorb the best professional practices and innovations in the field of Information Technology.Other aims pursued by the project are to improve the employability level reduced by the crisis, which will be achieved with the inclusion of this added value, the quality professional skills acquired, the possibility of build up a professional career in UK or the discovery of an unexplored market niche in the local sphere. In addition to this, the immersion in methodical working habits inherent to the Anglo-Saxon culture stuck to quality processes. Finally, it is a very enriching experience both personally and professionally, improving social skills.All this will result in a better preparation of the participants at a professional level, a personal and bilingual development, and with regards to IES Francisco de Goya, it will benefit from the knowledge of the British IT industry for the preparation of students, new participants, development of the training program, dissemination to IT local & regional industry, more attractive training, etc.", "http://www.adtsystems.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024486_2"]]}}, "3AY": {"creative": {"data": [[1475020800000, 1538006400000, "Refugee Engagement And integration through Community Theatre", "ACTA COMMUNITY THEATRE LTD", 171586.0, 3, 3, "The REACT project will directly engage refugees in the creation and performance of original theatre based on their life experiences and national cultures, engaging with and performing within, local communities within their host countries.

In this proposal we look at short supply chains from the perspective of urban rather than rural development. Short supply chains can play a role in addressing urban problems such as climate change, obesity, storm water control, etc.\nShort food supply chains have been advocated as a means to reduce CO2 impact of the agricultural system. Although a reduction of food miles certainly contributes to reducing climate impact, this proposal takes as premise that to really improve the ecological performance of the food system other flows of goods and services need to be shortened as well (e.g. nutrient, water, and carbon cycles need to be closed). In the current context these aspects are usually treated separately, this proposal argues to treat them more integrated.\nThe research will analyse the way in which several European city regions deal with short supply chains in food, nutrients, water, and carbon. The project will facilitate selected SMEs to further innovate in food production and delivery, nutrient and water management, and multifunctional use of space, and will disseminate the results among a wider audience of SMEs.

According to the latest data available (EUROSTAT, May 2016) a total of 3.8 million people immigrated to one of the EU-28 Member States during 2015, while at least 2.8 million emigrants were reported to have left an EU Member State. On 1 January 2015, the number of people living in the EU-28 who were citizens of non-member countries was 19.8 million while the number of people living in the EU-28 who had been born outside of the EU was 34.3 million.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for Germany alone, the newly arriving migrants and refugees in 2015 exceeded 1 million people and the number of asylum applicants per million inhabitant is nearly 3.000. The total number of arrivals to Europe by the end of December 2016 has been recorded as 387.739. \r\n\r\nEven though the numbers of arrivals have decreased in the last year, we still have to seek permanent solutions to support and facilitate migrants and refugees integration. In 2015, 40.2% of the non-EU-born population in the EU was assessed to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) compared with 21.7% of the native-born population. The integration would allow migrants and refugees to become economically productive and it would lead to self-reliance, dignity and social interaction.\r\n\r\nSocially integrated migrants may represent a resource for the whole society and especially for the labour market of the receiving countries: migrants may be part of the solution to the challenge of ageing and decrease of the European working population.\r\n\r\nIn this context a fundamental part of the integration process is the professional development of migrants.
