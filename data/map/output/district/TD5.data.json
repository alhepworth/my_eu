The teacher will be trained in French language and also teaching methodology, after training the teacher will use the training to support her own practice in the classroom as well as to support colleagues in the school to embed the target language of French throughout the school. The school has identified a need for training, support and resources for it's teachers in order to meet the government target of all primary children developing the language skills by 2020. The school initially will focus on language learning to bring the children of the school more in line with their peers in other European countries. Once language skills and understanding have increased the intention is to develop further the links and partnerships with European schools and teachers that participant will experience and learn about during the project.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to allow the participant to develop their own language skills and understanding of foreign language teaching pedagogy in order to build confidence and competence to support teachers and staff at the school. The participant has undertaken training through the local authority as well as privately in her own time, she will build on this training by attending the immersion course and receive specific training, advice and resources suited to her role as a primary school teacher. \r\n\r\nLanguages will be a priority for all staff at Broomlands Primary School and the participant will share her experience and knowledge with other teaching staff and support staff throughout the school year. The impact of the training will be felt by all who work and learn at the school as languages will be given emphasis and encouragement throughout the year, including opportunities for celebration and the involvement of the wider school community.\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits of the project will be to increase staff confidence and enthusiasm for the subject of language teaching and embedding language throughout the school. Staff will learn to engage their pupils with a relevant, fun and active methods and to enjoy and not fear the implementation of the 1 plus 2 approach.", "http://www.broomlandsps.ik.org", "Broomlands Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013369_coordinator"]]}}}}
