This distinctly bucks the national trend for broadly declining numbers of female pupils in Science.  Perhaps this is at least partially due to the School\u2019s pioneering work developing new eLearning resources, an initiative headed up by the School\u2019s science department and one that gained the school its enviable eMature status in 2012, placing it amongst the top schools in the UK.  Battle Abbey is one of England\u2019s most distinctive landmarks and as such the school it hosts boasts beautiful and historic surroundings: a fabulous juxtaposition of heritage and new technology. The school has state of the art science facilities and its Science Department is one of the most successful in the UK.  The Science Department has had record results year-on-year over the past 5 years, despite tougher GCSEs, putting the school in the top fifty schools in the country for attainment.  This arguably makes our Science Department amongst the best in the country. Members of the Science Department contribute to the national curriculum and work in collaboration with leading Universities in the writing, trialling and piloting of context-led activities.  Science teachers have run numerous workshops for researchers, teachers, technicians and students at schools and universities, and organised many conferences.  They have taken part in many national and international projects, such as Bright Sparks, COSMOS, NANOYOU, and Open Discovery Space.  Teachers are encouraged to show initiative, develop their own areas of interest, share resources and contribute to further developments in the development.  The training courses consist of preparatory and follow-up phases in addition to the actual course period which is a week long intensive course that includes keynote lectures, workshops, social/parallel activities. The learning objectives and outcomes will be assessed and documented in an evaluation report. The impact of the course/training framework is that the participating science teachers will be immersed in the process of science-inquiry via their interaction with collections of digital educational resources, tools, online labs and be exposed to innovative best practices linked with the science curricula applied in their country but also increase awareness of developments that are taking place in other European countries. These resources and methodologies do not impose a fixed curriculum but support the development of a model that can  be customized to reflect location and culture, and thus are ideal to be used in the European context and their use can further strengthen the course\u2019s social cohesive and its Europe-wide dimension within the learning mobility of individuals key action of Erasmus+ programme.", "http://www.battleabbeyschool.com", "Batte Abbey School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002271_coordinator"]]}}, "0UF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Pestalozzi Educational Programme", "Pestalozzi International Village Trust", 17125.0, 2, 2, "Pestalozzi  is a registered charity with the aim and mission of inspiring young people to make a positive and lasting difference in the world.

Viewpoints to Multiculturalism\u201d is a joint student and teacher mobility project coordinated by Salpaus Further Education and realized by Sanare, a network of Finnish vocational institutions and education providers. The network partners are Finland\u2019s Diaconia College, The Federation of Education in Jokilaaksot/Ylivieska Vocational College, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School, Rovaniemi Municipal Federation of Education/Lapland Vocational College, The Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, and Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Educational and Training Consortium Lappia/Vocational College Lappia. The project is carried out in co-operation with our foreign partners in Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. In choosing the partners, versatility has been taken into account to the effect that there are on-the-job learning places both for practical nursing students and for youth and leisure instructor students. In addition, the foreign partners have experience of multiculturalism, the central theme in the current project. The on-the-job learning places are in day care centres, schools and in care units for the elderly and the disabled. In the \u201cVlog Up!\u201d project there will be altogether 54 student mobilities and 14 staff mobilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has carried out international projects previously, too, the most recent one being the Erasmus+ KA1 project \u201cIlona \u2013 voluntary work as part of the welfare field\u201d (2015-17). The previous experiences in collaboration act as a starting point in the current project. Thus, the practices that have proved to be good previously, as well as the designation of assignments within the network, are adopted to efficient use in the current project.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the knowledge possessed by the applying network and the collaborating working life networks about the opportunities and challenges of multiculturalism in the European partner countries and in this way promote a new kind of European sense of community and equality. This goal is reached through video blogs, or vlogs, produced by the students taking part in the mobility periods. \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has international partners, of which the ones chosen to be in this project are the ones with the most experience of supervising students from different cultural backgrounds and in whose staff and/or clients the multicultural dimension has traditionally been present. \r\n\r\nAs the concrete result of the project there will be, in addition to the mobility weeks, video blogs made by the participating students. In these vlogs, the various manifestations and forms of multiculturalism, as encountered in the on-the-job learning places abroad, are recorded and presented. The vlogs are recorded using for example cameras, smartphones and tablets. The students will update the vlogs in real time during the on-the-job learning periods. The vlogs will be advertised on the websites of the participating colleges. The vlogs can also be used for example in the marketing campaigns of the colleges, in parents\u2019 nights, and in staff education. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are recognized using the Europass mobility certificate. In addition, the mobility periods are recognized as on-the-job learning periods belonging to the students\u2019 qualifications as an obligatory part. \r\n\r\nThe various activities of the project are planned in detail in the autumn of 2017. At the same time, orientation is arranged for the first students going abroad in the spring of 2018. The staff mobility periods will take place in an early stage of the project, mostly in the autumn of 2017. The student mobility periods will take place between the spring of 2018 and the spring of 2019. The project will end with a final evaluation and report in the spring of 2019.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034557_1"]]}}, "9AJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "MAGIC VALUES", "Crowhurst Church of England Primary School", 62500.0, 4, 4, "The \"Magic Values\" project was born from the idea of offering and train members of the project experiences of cooperative work between the family and the school and the development of social values.
