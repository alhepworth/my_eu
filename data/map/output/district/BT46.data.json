This includes the areas of skills development, careers education, work experience, entrepreneurship as well as the key competences of ICT, mathematics and literacy. \r\nThe concept for the project was born out of the realisation among the partners that our school systems are quite insular and thereby fail to a large extent to prepare our young people for education and employment beyond their national boundaries.\r\nThe key objects of the PIE project include:\r\n\u2022To deliver opportunities for participating students to develop a range of skills required by today's European labour market\r\n\u2022 To engage young people in the production of sustainable educational resources which enhance school curricula and which will be both beneficial and attractive to their peers\r\n\u2022 To create opportunities for students to experience the recruitment and selection process\r\n\u2022 To create opportunities for the development and practice of basic and transversal skills including entrepreneurial skills.\r\n\u2022 To create opportunities for students to identify alternative European pathways for both education and employment\r\n\u2022 To enable students to identify alternative ways for both personal development and self improvement within a wider European context, for example, through work experience, gap years, volunteering, social entrepreneurship\r\n\u2022 To create an effective European collaborative partnership which gives all participating schools equal input into the development, delivery, monitoring and evaluation of the project while respecting different cultures and systems\r\n\u2022 To foster the European values of tolerance, respect for intercultural diversity and solidarity\r\n\u2022 To create opportunities to cooperate innovatively and to exchange good practice\r\n\u2022 To create opportunities for students to experience a variety of learning contexts to benefit their personal development and future employment opportunities\r\nOver the duration of the project we expect to achieve the following key results:\r\n-420 students will be selected to participate directly in the project activities\r\n-2175 students will participate in project generated activities\r\n-the management of each school will amend curriculum policies to reflect outcomes from the project\r\n-all students within each institution will experience teaching and learning activities as created by the project. The result will be that 4493 students will benefit from the project\r\nThe project methodology involves active collaboration between the partners and includes a series of structured SMART activities.

Growth in electricity from renewable sources is stalling due to intermittency, grid restrictions, curtailment, and high costs. Sustainable energy to supply the transport sector and heating demand are even further underexploited. GENCOMM will address these issues by developing a sustainable, renewable community-scaled, hydrogen (H2)-based, energy model based on the results of 3 pilot plants that will use local renewable sources to supply electricity, heating and transportation fuels.\nThe project will begin by addressing the communities, mainly remote, around the pilot facilities in the Western Isles (Scotland), Saar-Lor-Lux region (Germany, France, and Luxembourg), and County Antrim(, to then continue to expand throughout NWE region.\nGENCOMM aims to reverse the current situation in which communities meet 75-80% of their energy needs from non-renewable sources. The proposed model will allow renewable generated energy to: [1] be dispatchable [2] meet heating demand and [3] supply transportation fuels. Therefore, through the model, communities will be able to develop autonomous, secure and sustainable energy matrixes.\nThe main output of the project is an H2-based energy model. The second output is the adaptation of the model to a Decision Support Tool (DST), allowing communities to project and implement their own H2-based energy matrix. The 3 H2-based pilot facilities (H2/biogas plant for heat and power, a solar-powered H2 station for vehicles, and a wind farm with H2 storage and distribution) will constitute the third output of the project.

CLIL classroom practice provides a more holistic, purposeful and authentic way of teaching and learning languages, a view and hypothesis central to this initiative.\r\n\r\nLinguistic and cultural diversity of the European Union is one of its major assets, but also one of its main challenges. Throughout the last decade, European multilingualism policy has been guided by the objective set by the Barcelona Council of March 2002, which called for the improvement of mastery of basic skills, in particular, by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age. I\r\n\r\nThe improvement of quality and efficiency of language learning has become one of the key objectives of the Strategic Framework for Education and Training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019). The framework underlines the necessity to enable citizens to communicate in two languages in addition to their mother tongue, as well as the need to Promote language teaching and provide migrants with opportunities to learn the language of the host country. Language learning has also acquired a prominent place within flagship initiatives integrated in the European Union\u2019s overall strategy \u2013 \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 \u2013 promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In articular, language skills, as a means to encourage the cross-border mobility of EU Citizens, play a crucial role within the Youth on the Move initiative and the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs. Over the past two decades an increasing body of research has demonstrated that CLIL can enhance multilingualism and provide opportunities for deepening learners\u2019 knowledge and skills. CLIL has been seen to be a key lever in realizing some of the eight key competences for lifelong learning as recommended by the european Parliament in 2006. \r\n\r\nWhy does CLIL work? The logic lies in the acronym: in delineating that Learning involves the Integration of both Content and Language, CLIL makes explicit the fact that the learning of any content must involve the learning of the language associated with the content. At the level of schooling, successful education in either a first or additional language requires that learners are equipped with the language for thinking about the content. When learning through CLIL, where an additional language is used, language-supportive resources, methods and activities are actively and coherently used to enable learners to use language purposefully. \r\n\r\nKey findings: \r\n\u2022 In most European countries, CLIL provision is a part of mainstream school education. Pilot projects are operating in around ten countries. \r\n\u2022 In most cases, the target languages are a combination of regional and/or minority languages and foreign languages. \r\n\u2022 CLIL type provision may generally be associated with any subject in the school curriculum, although in some countries it is mainly used to teach science subjects or social sciences in secondary education. \r\n\u2022 The main barrier to CLIL becoming more widespread is the lack of appropriately qualified teachers. \r\nhttp://www.cedefop.europa.eu\r\n\r\nIntegrating STEM content with advanced foreign language instruction provides a unique way for students to gain foreign language capacities directly related to promising career pathways. Content and language integrated learning (CLIL), also referred to as content-based language teaching, simultaneously promotes skills in the target language and advances content knowledge, making this a promising approach for students to gain STEM skills in a foreign language classroom (Brewster, 2004; Mehisto, Marsh, & Frigols, 2008; Smala, 2009). \r\n\r\nProject-based learning (PBL) in a CLIL classroom fosters foreign language learning by engaging students in important, real-world projects and having students utilize their first and second language knowledge, skills, and abilities to complete the work. Project-based learning integrates all four language skills (listening, reading, speaking, and writing), incorporates collaborative team work, lends itself to clear outcomes, and challenges learners to use the foreign language in different capacities inside and outside the classroom (Stoller, 1997, 2010; Thomas, 2000). \r\n\r\nSuccessfully planning a thematic unit of PBL to integrate STEM topics into a foreign language classroom involves collaboration with STEM content teachers, identifying final outcome goals, creating guidelines for students, assisting students in gathering, compiling and reporting information in a second language, and and reporting information in a second language, and creating useful evaluation tools to assess student work.", "http://www.stbrigidspstirkane.com", "ST BRIGID'S PS TIRKANE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036550_coordinator"]]}}, "5PY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Rights In Sight Everyone!", "Saint John's Primary School", 83455.0, 6, 6, "The RISE! project, (Rights In Sight for Everyone!) is a partnership of 6 schools with N. Ireland co-ordinating, Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Finland in a programme designed to promote the educational rights and life chances of pupils from one to twelve.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to motivate and engage young learners so that they become intrinsically driven and suitably skilled , thus wanting  to stay on in school and to improve their employability. In some European countries, the economy has been dictated by the curriculum. This partnership aims to make sure that the pre-school and primary curriculum has more of a role to play in shaping the future economy. European studies of pupil achievements show that in N. Ireland, pupils achieve well but that they are becoming bored with the curriculum at around ten years of age. \r\n\r\nOur objectives include devising suitable classroom activities and teaching strategies based on pupil consultation about what and how they want to learn. This will also involve parent information and education so learners are supported at home as well as in school.\r\n\r\nWe aim to study best practice in the early years as these foundations are key to effective learning in later stages. We aim to improve transitions from pre-school, to primary to post-primary. Research and attitudinal surveys will provide direction for the project's activities.\r\n\r\nThe development of ICT skills is also a key objective of our project. Employers need people with the right behaviours and dispositions and not just qualifications. There are thousands of IT jobs available and not enough people skilled to fill them. This project aims to get children, teachers and families to see the link between education and job prospects as well as boosting their individual capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe methodologies include research on statistics related to achievement and employment in each country, as well as into attitudes and dispositions to learning and to the barriers to learning for particular groups of children.\r\nThere will be sharing of good classroom and curricular practice from country to country. These practices will feed into policy development and adoption between the countries.\r\nThere will be competence checklists devised, for pupil ICT progression. Pupils will be given opportunities to use digital technology for presentation, communication, information exchange and collaboration, particularly in their 'news style' videos for example.\r\nThe inclusion of a business venture for the older pupils will include a range of learning and skills development in a real-life context. A key feature will be pupil consultation, choice and creativity, leading to analytical thinking, innovation and problem-solving.\r\n\r\nA major impact foreseen is on the creation of more positive attitudes to learning for staff, pupils and families, with greater parental involvement and a charter of rights for learners and their families. ICT skills will be developed which support learning across the curriculum. Institutions will review and amend their approaches to provision for pupils with barriers to learning and in light of best practice shared. Policies devised will influence classroom practice.\r\nThere will be stronger and wider community links between schools and between schools and business.\r\n\r\nSuch impact can be maintained after the life of the project. In the longer term, it is also envisaged that schools and pupils will have a focus on internationalisation which will lead to active European citizens, aware of their own national identity and yet respecting the rights and identity of our European neighbours.", "http://www.stjohnsswatragh.ik.org", "Saint John's Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013559_coordinator"]]}}}}
