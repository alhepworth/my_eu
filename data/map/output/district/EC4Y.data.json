The project will unite all relevant disciplines and stakeholders to establish: i) pragmatic, solid read-across procedures incorporating mechanistic and toxicokinetic knowledge; and ii) ab initio hazard and risk assessment strategies of chemicals with little background information. The project will focus on repeated dose systemic toxicity (liver, kidney, lung and nervous system) as well as developmental/reproduction toxicity. Different human tiered test systems are integrated to balance speed, cost and biological complexity. EU-ToxRisk extensively integrates the adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-based toxicity testing concept. Therefore, advanced technologies, including high throughput transcriptomics, RNA interference, and high throughput microscopy, will provide quantitative and mechanistic underpinning of AOPs and key events (KE). The project combines in silico tools and in vitro assays by computational modelling approaches to provide quantitative data on the activation of KE of AOP. This information, together with detailed toxicokinetics data, and in vitro-in vivo extrapolation algorithms forms the basis for improved hazard and risk assessment. The EU-ToxRisk work plan is structured along a broad spectrum of case studies, driven by the cosmetics, (agro)-chemical, pharma industry together with regulators. The approach involves iterative training, testing, optimization and validation phases to establish fit-for-purpose integrated approaches to testing and assessment with key EU-ToxRisk methodologies. The test systems will be combined to a flexible service package for exploitation and continued impact across industry sectors and regulatory application.

In the past 15 years, doping behaviour research and anti-doping education have come a long way but these efforts remain largely isolated and uncoordinated.  It is imperative that we now activate a collaborative doping prevention agenda and shift the focus away from stopping the bad (doping) to promoting and helping the good (clean athlete). Instead of trying to understand what drives some athletes to dope, anti-doping research should concentrate on what drives clean athletes to remain so.  At a time when the media is perpetuating the belief that doping is widespread, the voices of clean athletes need to be heard and this has become a priority for National Anti-Doping Organisations across the EU, who serve to protect the right of athletes to clean sport in their own countries, and abroad. Furthermore, the project is based on the principle that policy and initiatives should be evidence-informed and athlete-centred. RESPECT will instigate change and capitalise on the power of the collective athlete voice. It will activate athletes to come to the forefront of the campaign for clean sport by presenting them with the opportunity for their voice to be heard across Europe. Accordingly, the RESPECT project features an international athlete forum focused on the meaning of clean sport to athletes in the 21st century; it will culminate in a 10-Year Research-Embedded Strategic Plan for Anti-Doping Education (Clean Sport Plan 2030) and an internet-based Clean Sport Knowledge Exchange Platform that will enhance the European sporting community\u2019s capacity to combat doping and strengthen the integrity of sport.", "http://www.ukad.org.uk", "LEEDS BECKETT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_590824-EPP-1-2017-1-UK-SPO-SCP_1"], [2017, "Teaching Awareness of Ethical Governance in Sport", "Sports Dispute Resolution Panel Limited", 137687.0, 4, 5, "Context / Background:\r\nThis project is a direct response to the EU motion passed on the 12 December 2016 and adopted on the 2 February 2017 on an integrated approach to Sport Policy: good governance, accessibility and integrity (2016/2143(INI)).  The motion calls upon Member States to promote the education, skills development and training of volunteers in sport in order to assist in the development of better ethical governance in sport.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\n1. To liaise with key stakeholders to identify a competency framework for ethical governance within the sports sector;\r\n2. To identify, thematically order and annotate key cases from disputes in sports governance;\r\n3. To develop a high quality teaching resource that focuses on developing awareness of ethical governance in sport;\r\n4. To engage in dissemination and exploitation activities that promote the practical utility of the teaching resource;\r\n5. To develop the following intellectual outputs:\r\n(1) Intellectual Output 1 (01): Needs analysis survey report;\r\n(2) Intellectual Output 2 (02): TAGS case study compendium;\r\n(3) Intellectual Output 3 (03): TAGS higher education learning materials\r\n(4) Intellectual Output 4 (04): TAGS project and pilot evaluation report\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\n1. Each HEI partner will pilot the TAGS Higher Education Learning Materials (O3) and therefore approximately 100 (25x4) undergraduate students will benefit from the module material and case files prior to wider dissemination.\r\n2. There are 150 providers of undergraduate degrees in sports related subjects within the UK, 6 providers in Greece, 15 providers in Czech Republic, and 23 in Romania. All providers will be contacted to comment upon outputs 1 and 3 and will be invited to view and attend dissemination activities for all four outputs (O1-4).\r\n3. There are currently 134 national sports governing bodies (NGBs) affiliated to Sport England, with additional NGBs affiliated to the other home nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) (58) within the United Kingdom, 40 sport federations within Greece, 68 in Czech Republic, and 81 in Romania. All NBGs will be contacted as part of the Needs Analysis Survey (O1) which will be used to develop the TAGS Higher Education Learning Materials (O3).
