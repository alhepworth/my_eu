THEATRE FOR SOCIAL INTEGRATION.", "Citizens Theatre Limited", 203232.0, 5, 5, "The CC concept takes into account the needs and constraints of adults from various vulnerable groups. They fall behind the rest of the society in terms of missing personal skills and capacities on one hand, and lack of appropriate available educational programmes on the other. Their common difficulty is to adapt to a standard learning environment. This is why the project focuses on alternative and unconventional teaching methods and their practical applications into programmes of non-formal education sector.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at developing, testing and widely disseminating an innovative methodology based on creative approach in adult education. The choice of theatre and precisely puppetry art was made on the basis of the long-standing experience of the Applicant in using this specific art form in education and therapy. Even though puppet theatre is usually perceived as something childish, it can serve as a very efficient and attractive way of teaching adult students how to discover their aptitudes and abilities needed for a true social adaptation. For the partners invited to participate in the project the use of puppet theatre in AE is a new approach, even though each of them has a long-standing experience in working with adult students, also with the use of creative methods. \r\nThis fact shows that this particular discipline of art has not been recognized as useful and adequate for adult education, so the project is truly innovative.   \r\nTeatr Grodzki, the author of the project, will present their approach of using the elements of puppetry art and visual storytelling in adult education to other partners during the Short-term Joint Staff training at the beginning of the project. Then, all the partners will test the methods presented during the training, modyfying them and further developing according to specific needs/constraints of their target groups. It is envisaged that at least 120 socially vulnerable adults will participate in these pilot workshops. \r\n\r\nThe project consortium consist of 5 partners from 5 European countries: Poland, UK, Italy, Lithuania and Bulgaria. They all have an access to different socially vulnerable groups, including mentally, physically and sensory disabled persons, seniors, prisoners, people in addiction, asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, homeless, unemployed. They are also linked to the European community of educators and professionals active in the field of social inclusion, including teachers and trainers, social workers, therapists, artists and art instructors, as well as volunteers in NGO and governmental sectors. \r\n\r\nThe partners will jointly produce 3 Intellectual Outputs: \r\n-Platform for Sharing Best Practices which will provide the environment for on-line learning and will be the main dissemination tool of the project - a place to publish its findings.\r\n-Methodological Guideliness - the description of methods developed by international project team and evaluated on the basis of feedback from the user groups. \r\n-Multilingual E-Compendium - presentation of knowledge and experience gained by the trainers during pilot workshops through a detailed description of different learning processes, step-by-step, and supported by evaluation conclusions.  \r\nBoth the Guidelines and Compendium will be published in 8 European languages (EN, PL, IT, LT, BG, DE, FR, ES) and freely available on the platform.\r\n \r\nA number of dissemination actions will be organized in order to reach a wide group of individuals and institutions active in the field of adult education and social inclusion across Europe. In particular, multiplier events will be organized in ech partner country. \r\nIt is envisaged that at least 1300 educators will benefit from the project findings during the lifetime of the CC initiative. The number of the long-term beneficiaries - the disadvantaged adult students and those who will be using CC methodology should be several times bigger.", "http://www.citz.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA204-038462_3"]]}}}}
