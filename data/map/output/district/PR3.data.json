The project will offer vocational students in these subjects inspiring and educational 4-week work placements with our experienced European host partners. The project also offers VET tutors the opportunity to undertake 7-day staff training visits to European host partners, to learn from their training methods, share experience and form lasting mutually benefical partneships. The project will fund 4-week placements for 47 environmental students and 55 craft students. PETS will also fund 7-day staff training placements for 18 teachers from environmental courses and 26 craft tutors (all from VET courses level 1-3).\r\n\r\nThis application benefits from over 10 years of Grampus promoting environmental and traditional skills and craft placements through the Leonardo da Vinci programme. This application and consortium combines the experience of delivering two certified IVT projects \u2018Training in Contemporary Applications of Traditional European Crafts\u2019 (TICATEC) and \u2018Developing Environmental Skills In Rural Europe\u2019 (DESIRE) within the Lifelong Learning Programme. (mobility certificate UK/09/LLP-LdV/MC/Z007) \r\n\r\nHost countries represented in the consortium are Czech Republic, Slovakia, Cyprus, Germany, Romania, Iceland, Slovenia ,Bulgaria Ireland and Turkey.\r\n\r\nParticipant students and recent graduates will develop a higher degree of self confidence, put theory into practice, gain new skills, improve existing skills and competences, inspire a renewed interest in their chosen subject, gain new language skills and complete a CV enhancing placement which will improve employment prospects and/or enable an informed progression to higher level study.\r\n\r\nParticipating staff will benefit from placing their own training in a wider European context. Travelling tutors will not only explore new skills, methods, approaches and techniques but will also share their own experiences with host organisations. This experience will give staff access to new ideas and approaches to training which will have a positive impact on their own training delivery. This will ultimately benefit vocational students of the tutor and enable the tutor to pass on new skills and information with a broader European scope.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: 1 Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for beneficiaries studying environmental and craft courses in the UK at VET level. 2. To ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the participant\u2019s course of study and can be accredited as such. 3. To increase the appreciation in beneficiaries of the benefits of European cooperation and the fact that we are facing similar challenges across Europe. 4. To provide beneficiaries with sufficient time and support to increase competencies in key environmental and craft skills being used on the placement. These include:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Skills: planting, coppicing, footpath design and construction, countryside furniture construction (bridges, steps benches etc), biodiversity assessments and species identification, basic surveying, habitat management, organic sustainable food production.\r\n\r\nCraft Skills: weaving, embroidery, silversmithing, blacksmithing, ceramics, wood carving, green wood construction, traditional building techniques (natural materials), \r\n\r\n 5. To develop a sustainable European VET partnership (hosts, UK colleges and Grampus) which can share experience and develop future cooperation projects. 6. To increase the employment prospects of participating students through gaining real-work experience and laying the foundation for language skills 7. To enhance UK VET training provision in environmental and traditional skills by providing 7-day staff placements for tutors with relevant European hosts.\r\n\r\nThe project management methodology for the PETS consortium is consistent with the 2001 Recommendation on mobility for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers and the ten principles set out in in the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nStudents are accredited as part of their UK course of study for the mobilities. All participant mobilities are recognised through the Europass certificate as well as the Europass CV and language passport. Host partners provide a minimum of four language lessons with professional tuition. All staff mobilities are recognised within an agreed CPD plan with their own organisations. Host partners also provide certification and a record of achievement in their own format as additional evidence of achievement.\r\n\r\nDetailed learning agreements are drawn up prior to placement through discussion between participants, hosts and UK colleges.

In doing so the project accounts for the economic and political need to provide increased VET workplace opportunities for young people, across all partner countries, by creating a blended learning methodology that incorporates highly effective learning content with efficient methods of delivery. \r\n\r\nThe project addresses the need for high-quality work-based learning with a clear pedagogical purpose, defined learning outcomes and specified objectives that both the learner and the employer are aware of.  It uses ICT to maximise access to training  by new methods and learning packages with quality-assured use of technology. \r\n\r\nFlexible, blended Work Based Learning pathways will be produced to meet defined learning outcomes and learning technologies will be used to develop online interactive learning packages, peer learning and assessment. Quality standards will be established to validate the quality of the interactive learning resources that are produced. The methodology and interactive learning resources will be tested and adapted during a 16 month piloting period which will also develop capacity and expertise of partners to enable them to embed an innovative and flexible WBL model within their organisations. Trainers will gain skills in using technology to produce interactive on line learning resources and improvements will be made in the pedagogical understanding of peer learning using social networking in teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThe project co-ordinator is Myerscough College is a land based and sports college in the Northwest of England that delivers work based learning to apprentices throughout England.

They will also identify good practices and have ideas on how to develop their own WBL delivery models. Participating adult education professionals will increase their knowledge and professional skills as well as language and international skills. After this project, partner organisations will continue working together with student and staff exchanges and new projects. \r\n\r\nThe long-term aim is that the partner organisations have a learner-centered, efficient and high-quality way to use digital tools and methods to guide, monitor and document adult students' WBL periods. This model could be implemented in all study programmes. In addition, the use of digital tools and methods, model would contain pedagogical guidelines on how to arrange work based learning periods.  \r\n\r\nThe project coordinator the Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia (Kpedu) is vocational college that delivers education to both adults and young in seven educational sectors. Other participants are Myerscough College, a land based and sports college in the North West of England and Joniskis Agricultural College in North of Lithuania that delivers education to adults in bookkeeping and floristics. \r\n\r\nThis project is to exchange practices between partners. As a result of three transnational meetings, partners will: \r\n- Learn how digital tools and methods are utilised in guidance, motitoring and documentation of adults' WBL periods in partner organisations.\r\n- Identify good practices that could be transferred to other countries.\r\n- Discuss development ideas on how adults' WBL could be improved using digital tools and methods.  \r\nPartners will also arrange one national meeting in each country to disseminate project results and hear target groups\u2019 ideas on developing adult students work based learning periods. \r\n\r\nThe project will result a final report that summarises the project results:\r\n- Descriptions how partner organisations are currently using digital tools and methods in guidance, monitoring and documentation of adult students\u2019 WBL periods. \r\n- Good practices and development ideas that have been indentified during transnational and national meetings. \r\n- Summary of the survey done to the participants, what they have learned during the project and how they will utilise these things in their own work.\r\n\r\nFinal report and all other material project produces will be freely available in Epale platform.", "http://www.myerscough.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA204-034787_1"], [2014, "Vocational Education and Personal Social Development Abroad", "Myerscough College", 17584.0, 2, 2, "The Vocational Education and Personal Social Development Abroad project will take place over 2 weeks and involve 8 students with special educational needs (SEN) from Foundation Learning Entry Level/Level 1 courses run by Myerscough College, a specialist land-based and sports college in the North-West of the UK.  The students will undertake this placement at the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Paralisia Cerebral de Coimbra (APCC),  an organisation for people with special needs with experience of educating students similar to those studying Foundation Learning courses at the College.  The link with APCC was established following a successful partnership with a Portuguese premier league football club developed over a number of years and senior management visits to the centre by College staff which identified an opportunity of working together on vocational educational exchange programmes.  The project also follows a hugely successful work placement visit by SEN students from the College to APCC in 2013 which was identified by the Ofsted inspectors shortly after the students returned, as an area of excellent practice and one which should be incorporated within programmes of study.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project will be to provide a worthwhile and meaningful European work exchange opportunity that will improve/develop the learners' skills, increase their self confidence, enhance their employability opportunities, enable them to gain cultural awareness and also help develop the life skills of all those taking part.  The programme will be varied and involve a combination of work experience linked to their vocational qualification, social events, cultural visits and allow the participants to have a unique insight into how a Portuguese institution provides employability and personal development to its students.\r\n\r\nThe project will be managed by teams of staff at both the College and the host organisation, APCC who will liaise closely on arrangements for the project, organisation and delivery.  The students will be prepared for the experience through training incorporated within their course prior to travel and additional language support.  Due to the high level of need of the participants in the educational environment, they will be accompanied during their placement by 4 SEN trained tutors who, as well as supporting the students, will map the learning outcomes to the students' vocational curriculum, monitor the work undertaken and ensure formal recognition in their final qualification.  \r\n\r\nThe project will allow 8 participants who otherwise would not get the opportunity to travel abroad, the experience of going to a foreign country independently of their families/carers, some for the first time.  This will have a profound affect and a life changing impact on their life and work chances.  The intention is to select students who have the potential to benefit from the whole process and ultimately be able to find sustainable employment either paid or on a voluntary basis.

Apart from expected benefits, distinctive properties of NMs may also affect (environmental) health risks. Safety assessment requires sufficient information for each NM, but testing every unique NM for their potential adverse effects is virtually impossible. More efficient ways to obtain safety information are needed, which could be achieved by applying grouping and read-across approaches to NMs. On a conceptual level, regulatory accepted approaches for grouping and read-across for NMs already exist, but actual application remains difficult as the required knowledge is not systematically brought together,   lacks data curation or is still missing. GRACIOUS will address this urgent need by developing a framework for grouping and read-across based on physicochemical, release, exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetic and toxicological information. This framework will be delivered as a practical e-tool, fit-for-purpose for various key (regulatory and industrial) stakeholders, who will be engaged from the start of the project. To develop the framework, GRACIOUS will build upon currently available approaches by collating, curating and assimilating existing and new knowledge on intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties in relation to their (environmental) health risk. The resulting framework will support safe innovation by enabling considerations of safety a.o. via grouping and read-across in industrial decision making at various stages of product development. For regulators and policy makers, GRACIOUS will facilitate actual application of grouping and read-across of NMs to enable risk analysis of NMs without extensive testing.", 217283.0, 6261447.0, 13, 23, "GRACIOUS", null, "http://www.thereachcentre.com", null, "h2020_212339_985308444"], [1380585600000, 1490918400000, "SUSTAINABLE NANOTECHNOLOGIES", "The Reach Centre Limited", "SUN (Sustainable Nanotechnologies) is the first project addressing the entire lifecycle of nanotechnologies to ensure holistic nanosafety evaluation and incorporate the results into tools and guidelines for sustainable manufacturing, easily accessible by industries, regulators and other stakeholders.
