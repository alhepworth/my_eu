They show who we are and where we come from. Without this knowledge, without those roots, it is impossible to know others and to accept them.\r\nKnowing the space we share, can help us live better together in a respectful environment for everyone.\r\nOur project focuses on two areas:\r\n- Myself, my environment, my future, my past, my culture.\r\n- Know the others to live better together.\r\n\r\nWe aim to involve all children 3 to 6 years (800 in all schools) in all project activities to make the learning process more interesting for them and give them the opportunity to learn by experience.\r\nIn addition, one of the project's objectives is to encourage teachers to implement new working methods and devices.\r\n\r\nThree meetings a year are planned for the project organization in which participate all contact persons or their representative. The agenda of these meetings will systematically include a financial component. A work program as well as specifications for the most accurate and detailed possible intellectual products are made at the first project meeting. These tools will monitor the progress of the project.

Many national and international surveys have demonstrated consumers' generally low level of understanding of financial matters and of basic economics, at a time when financial system and products are becoming more complex and sophisticated, making them difficult to understand. Few adults have engaged in learning about finance because of a lack of capacity of adult training providers to offer such provision including the lack of competent teachers in the subject. \r\n\r\nThere is growing interest in financial education and the European Commission is supporting the development of capacity to offer it. Its profile has been increasing and it now features very prominently in some state education systems. It is now part of the school curriculum in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together providers of adult learning from different educational sectors to form  a strategic partnership, to strengthen the capacity of institutions to deliver financial education, enhance the professional development of staff and develop innovative approaches to learning including the use of digital technology to improve the overall quality of the provision and stimulate demand for financial education.\r\n\r\nWithin this broad aim the key objectives are to:\r\n1. Evaluate current approaches and practices in teaching financial education\r\n2. Determine the level of finance competence in finance among teachers \r\n3. Improve the pedagogical and financial competence of teachers\r\n4. Equip teachers with new tools to deliver financial education\r\n5. Stimulate demand for learning and increase the take-up of financial training\r\n6. Improve the accessibility and quality of training in personal finance\r\n7. Mobilise social capital to help promote financial education\r\n8. Provide guidance to organisations wanting to develop capacity to deliver financial education\r\n\r\nThese objectives will be achieved through a number of complementary and interrelated activities. These include research on strategies and plans to promote financial education, a needs analysis in order to identify institutional needs and the specific needs of financial education teachers, identifying the  needed by teachers to deliver financial education effectively and developing a competency framework and training course for teachers, developing a financial capability framework and training modules for adult learners,  developing learning materials in which functional and digital skills are embedded  and a toolkit for organisations and teachers delivering financial education.\r\n\r\nThe project targets two main groups, teachers of adults and learners. The teachers include those currently deliver, as well as who do not, but wish to develop the competences to do so. The adults are those in the community with few or no formal qualifications, especially the unemployed, migrants and minority groups, older adults, in or out of learning. The project will target 15 teachers directly 120 adults across the partnership. \r\n\r\nThe main results of the project will be a toolkit for organisations and teachers delivering financial education  containing a financial competency framework and course teachers, a financial capability framework and training modules for adults, learning materials and sample session plans, a website with the learning materials available as Open Education Resource, and a technical paper  providing a comparative analysis of policies, strategies and initiates to promote financial education in the participating countries.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that participating institutions will have sustainable capacity to deliver financial education, including competent teachers and learning resources that will improve the quality of the provision and stimulate the demand for learning. It is expected that other local and regional providers will be sufficiently impressed by outcomes of the project and decide to build similar capacity and offer financial training in their institution, and engage with European partnership working. \r\nThe project\u2019s legacy will be the mainstreaming of financial education in adult education provision matched by increased demand for learning about personal finance and a more financially literate population.", "http://www.global-learning-skills-partnership.org", "Global Learning & Skills Partnership", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013728_coordinator"], [2016, "Taking to the Top - Adult Educators on the Journey", "Global Learning & Skills Partnership", 149317.0, 6, 7, "In relation to rapid changes in the labour market, aging population and immigration issues, there is a continual need for adult training in the EU member states that sets the requirements to the quality of training into a totally new perspective.
