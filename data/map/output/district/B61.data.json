A lack of concrete methodologies (what exactly to do to act in an inclusive way), of professional training (where to learn inclusive methods) and of resources (which means are necessary) are seen as major obstacles. Even though inclusion is primarily understood as model of attitude, professionals need a) information about special educational needs of children, b) concrete methods and c) resources.\r\n\r\nAIM:\r\na) \"Early Inclusion\" aims to increase the quality of services in ECEC and Youth (especially for vulnerable children) by a) transfering best practice INFORMATION material (UK briefing packs focused on diverse typs of disability) linguistically and conerning the target sector into ECEC and youth work.  \r\nb) The project also aims to increase the availabilty of inclusive skills: On the job learning of concrete INCLUSIVE METHODS is facilitated by a community of practice tool. Professionals learn from each other by describing \"concrete sucess stories\" of inclusive acting. By means of automatic translation fucntion these learning opportunities are also available for other linguistic backgrounds, especially enabling access for more professionals towards EU28 experience.\r\nc) \"Early Inclusion\" also bridges the gap between stakeholders/parents peception/expectations and professional performance and increases the match and mutual understanding what can be done on a concrete level concerning inclusive pedagogy in ECEC.\r\n\r\nOUTCOMES\r\na) Inclusion Briefing Pack: ICT based learning material for ECEC professionals for \"ready to take\" materials concerning the educational needs of young children with disabilty or at risk. Best practice material transfered from school settings in UK (EN, DE, FR, MK, HU. TR)\r\nb) Inclusion Method Market: online community of practice exchange platform which enables concrete professional skill learning from other by \"concrete inclusive sucess stories\" (EN, DE, FR, MK, TR, HU)\r\nc) Online certification and monitoring of informal learning: Complementary online platform for professionals to accreditate formal and informal learning (EN, DE, FR, TR, MK, HU)\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP:\r\nMultisectorial (AT, UK, DE SME), DE, MK, LU (NGO), TR, HU (university), Community service (DE) and multigeographical consortium (DE, UK, TR, LU, MK, HU, AT) with partly extensive experience in EU partnershiop and partly no.\r\n\r\nTARGET GROUPS (mainly sectors, who are not specifically prepared for \"Inclusion\")\r\nkindergartenteachers\r\nday mothers/day fathers\r\nProfessionals in \"Fr\u00fchen Hilfen\"\r\nEducators in nurseries\r\nTherapists (e.g. occupational..) \r\nYouth workers\r\n\r\nIMPACT: Early Inclusion increases the quality of services by concrete implemetation of professional inclusive skills.

The Partnership will bring about both a collaborative curriculum development programme created, promoted and shared by the Partner Institutions and which has wide cross-cultural parameters and a collaborative continuing professional development programme (CPD) in the Arts for the staffs of Partner Schools and the University which emphasizes wide parameters of cross-cultural international co-operation. The Partnership will raise the status of traditional art forms as mediums of communication of cultural identities. The aim is to create innovatory curricular and resources. To achieve the goals the Partnership will support Institutions in developing to maximum capability their utilization of ICT applications, whilst supporting one another in areas where there is  an inequitable distribution of resources. The Partnership is substantial spreading across Europe with a wide range of backgrounds. Seven of the schools have previous successful collaborative working experiences, whilst others joined having been attracted by the proposals. The Art Education Department of Mehmet Akif Ersoy University will lead the Partnership academically being an outstanding fit with the requirements of the project.In terms of ethos, self-view and commitment to one another Partner Institutions will develop close and purposeful contacts which leave a legacy for the schools and the university Education Department and enhance future life choices for pupils and students. Partners wish to develop and enhance learners' views of themselves as contributing European citizens and to enable them to share their lives, languages, education and communities via a range of mediums in an enjoyable, productive and meaningful manner whilst collaborating and sharing experiences with their peers in other countries.For staffs the aim is to promote good teaching practice within Partner Schools and the University and the dissemination of this practice to a wider audience. Opportunities for staff mobilities will be maximized in order to enhance the relationships between staffs and develop the wider European perspective in their operational curricular.  One of the clear aims is to produce a practical view of a pedagogy for the use of the Arts in the promotion of cross-cultural perspectives and educational practice which is sustainable in the future. Inter-school meetings, both for cyclical review and training will be directed towards this. The Partnership, led by the Art Education Department of MAEU, will disseminate widely to all interested parties the planning, progression and outcomes in a range of forums and via modern communication technology. The decision taken at the planning stage was that an Intellectual Outcome would be produced which would offer a practical one-stop guide to the use of the Arts across the curriculum within primary education. It will be the accumulation of the experiences, study, research, experimentation and innovations of the Partnership and will be freely available. As well as research the publication will contain guides to the implementation of the agreed advice of the Partnership. Statutory and base line requirements vary across countries and due cognizance will be taken of this. Programmes of work which are cognizant of the needs and aspirations of pupils with special needs or disabilities (SEND) and those who are gifted and talented in particular areas, will be produced as part of the Action Plans. All pupils contribute to planning and assessments. As well as leaving a legacy of good teaching practice within schools, the local communities will have been drawn into participation in the celebration of their own cultures. The project is divided into six Semesters of approximately equal length to allow for differences in school terms in different countries. During the period of the Partnership threads will be followed. Within these threads are included a wide range of activities, plans for the future and activities intended to display the work results to wide audiences, including the production of an Erasmus Festival and Arts activities guides for wider school community consumption.Semesters begin with a Planning & Review Meeting. These P&R Meetings are the administrative driving force behind the Partnership. As well as making administrative decisions they create Action Plans for the coming Semester and rigorously review the work of the previous Semester. Hosting rotates between Partner Schools. In the final Semester the product of the Partnership will be drawn together and all communities involved will participate in a Europe-wide simultaneous Erasmus Festival.The plans meet the criteria of substantial sections of the Key Action 2 expectations and the Strategic Partnership Horizontal and Field-Specific priorities.", "http://www.sidemoor.school-portal.co.uk", "Widden Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024412_10"]]}}}}
