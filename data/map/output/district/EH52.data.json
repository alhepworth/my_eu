There will be 15 youths and 5 youth leaders from Malta and the same number of youths and youth leaders from Scotland, therefore there will be 40 direct participants in total in our project. It will be held in Malta.\r\n\r\nWe will be building on twinning between our localities of Mtarfa and Pumpherston, and a previous exchange between our organisations held last year in Pumpherston. The objectives of our project are to:\r\n\r\n\u2022Strengthen ties between our localities and football clubs\r\n\u2022Learn informally about each other's cultures\r\n\u2022Promote social inclusion of individuals through sport\r\n\r\nOur youth exchange will be held in October 2018 and will be tackling sport, social inclusion and networking between our organisations as well as networking between our organisations and other NGOs, including those not in the field of sport. We shall be having public activities such as a Sports Festival which will help us spread the word about our project and its aims, as well as the Erasmus+ programme.\r\n\r\nWe will be having discussions, talks, interactive activities, public activities, workshops, brainstorming activities, volunteering, cultural activities, visits to places of interest for tours and discussions. There will be morning warm up every day to start with a fun energiser activity to wake everyone up and prepare for a day of activities. Each day we will have around 5 activities to work on together. For each activity we will be accompanied and supervised by our youth leaders.\r\n\r\nThe project will strengthen each of our organisations, so both in Malta and Scotland the project will lead to the capacity-building of a small NGO. We will have time for networking, sharing best practices and thinking of ways in which we can continue to communicate and cooperate in future.\r\n\r\nThe activities and ideas behind this project were thought up by us as youths and this project will lead to the above learning outcomes and impact for us, which is considerable for a six day project. Our coaches too will have the learning outcomes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThrough participating in this Erasmus+ project we will be able to gain capacity in applying for similar projects in future as well as participating in international projects. We are planning on applying together for an Erasmus+ sport project (Small Collaborative Partnership) after this exchange. We have gained experience reading the Erasmus+ programme guide, understanding previous successful projects and networking with Sport Malta, Malta's national sport agency for help with finding other partners for our sport project.\r\n\r\nWe would like this project to be a stepping stone to future projects together, to continue strengthening our organisations and learning from each other as well as networking with other football and sport NGOs as well as NGOs in other sectors (e.g. social inclusion).\r\n\r\nTwo small sports organisations from Malta and Scotland, separated by 2,600 kilometres, will work closely together on a project that benefits youths. The long-term impact of the project will benefit all of our clubs' members as we will gain expertise which can be applied to other international and EU funded projects.\r\n\r\nWe will be reaching our target groups beyond Scotland and Malta thanks to the dissemination activities we have planned to spread word of our project aims and activities, as well as project results (outcomes of discussions and activities). This will inspire other youths, sports organisations and persons to organise similar projects/ activities.

One of the parameters thereof is the use of ICT to develop innovative, creative and inspiring didactic material (playfully learning, learning by doing, talent development and prevention of early school leaving). For this reason, we offer a diverse group of teachers from our VET, general secondary and primary education, the opportunity to participate in an international course and job shadowing with colleagues abroad in order for them to acquire these skills and tools and at the same time broaden their horizon whilst establishing international contacts.

In West Lothian Council, and in St Nicholas Primary School, we are keen to embrace the 1+2 approach.  \r\n\r\nStaff need, however, to be confident in their own language skills before this can become a reality.  This two year project seeks to train 12 members of staff in Spanish in the 2015-2016 session, and a further cohort of staff being trained in French the following year.  With a confident, fluent staff, confident fluent children can become a reality.\r\n\r\nAll staff were invited to show a note of interest in taking part in the Erasmus+ programme.  Twelve showed interest and we ask for funding for all 12 of these enthusiastic members of staff.  The members of staff are of diverse ages, stages in the school and levels of ability.  All share one thing in common: the desire to improve in confidence and ability in speaking a European language.  Following training, staff will be encouraged, not only to improve their practice within the class, but to use the Spanish/French language as a way of embedding the language throughout the daily routines of the life of the class/school.\r\n\r\nAs a school, we would seek to undertake a variety of activities: improved daily teaching and learning in European languages; Spanish/French Days, Spanish/French cafes, European language afterschool clubs, Spanish Zumba classes.   As a school we would hold curriculum evenings to explain to parents how French and Spanish are taught within the school.\r\n\r\nTo publicise the importance of the 1+2 approach, activities would be posted on our blog and the West Lothian Council's own  blog.  We would publicise our cultural and learning events in local press.  We would also be keen to speak about the success of our project on any Erasmus+ promotions or literature.\r\n\r\nThe impact and results we would expect to achieve are 475 children directly benefitting from 12 members of staff who have undergone an intense Immersion course in Spanish/French.  The scope of the project does not end there.  Our children have siblings and families - these parents, friends and siblings will also be included in our events and will benefit from our enthusiasm and activities.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits will be seen  long after the children leave St Nicholas Primary School.
