The project has been developed for and in cooperation with the three target groups:\n1) Renewable energy project developers whose access to financing is getting more challenging\n2) The part of the public that has an interest in investing even very small amounts of their savings in renewable energy projects\n3) Crowdfunding platforms who act as intermediaries facilitating the financial transaction between the public and the project developers.\n\nThe overall objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the acceleration of the renewable energy growth in Europe by unleashing the potential of crowdfunding for financing renewable energy projects.

The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the school, we were able to implement compulsory vocational experience in companies abroad through Erasmus +, KA1 Mobility of VET Learners and Staff. This activity was a great success not only among the 15 pupils who attended it, but also among other pupils and teachers. Moreover, the school has also been successful distinguishing itself from other schools, making it more attractive. Therefore, we decided to continue this activity by submitting another application under this program.

The subject of the project is the realization of foreign mobilities, which will take place in the Czech Republic (specifically in Ostrava) and in England (specifically in London) for a duration of 2 weeks - 10 working days, 14 days together with a journey and a weekend.  It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area.

The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market.

As concerns personal development, the beneficiaries will have gained more independence and flexibility, an open mind and a general detachment.

You then take it in turns to create a film or drama piece to share that other groups' story - this fosters an understanding of issues that are important to the other group, and also teaches us to be aware about the importance that we place on our own stories - how does it feel when someone else tells our story? The course will also include training on how to work with groups to \"process\" the experience, and to lead discussions about differences and similarities.  Creating the Stories is just the first step, the intercultural learning comes from what happens next, and must be handled sensitively.The Course will be delivered using drama, films & active techniques, and participants will learn how to make useful tools for delivering this work using everyday items (eg making masks using paper plates and elastic, rather than shop bought masks at \u00a320 each, or making films using mobile phones and tablets rather than high end film equipment)The course will upskill youth workers from across Europe, making them more able to engage and work with young people around issues of  intercultural communication, community cohesion & discrimination, as well as developing a pan-European group of youth workers who are primed to develop work together in the future.There will be 30 participants from 8 partner organisations in 6 countries from across Europe including new and older EU member states as well as accession countries.Participants will create their own films as part of the process, and the course will culminate in a public presentation of these films with a Q&A session.
