There are just over 800 HVE learners at the school, 20 permanently employed staff and around 60 employees who are contracted to work with teaching.The aim of the project for staff is to gain more knowledge about EU tools and to obtain a greater insight into the overall objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for Higher Vocational Education. More knowledge is needed regarding SeQF, EQF and how ECVET should be applied regarding the transfer of credits & qualifications, which is acquired when the staff gain insight into how work assignments are carried outdone in Europe concerning the professional roles that HVE learners at Frans Schartau are educated for. Additional aims of the project are to learn how the curriculum could better reflect the European dimension. The aim of the project for HVE learners is to acquire international work experience and to strengthen their language skills, since this is request made by the labour market. As a result of mobility, employability increases and at the same time HVE learner increase their opportunities to work in an international labour market. Mobility provides them with the opportunity to acquire key competences that include the ability to communicate in a foreign language, and to assimilate new technologies that lead to digital competence. Living in another country leads to the development of their social, personal and cultural skills. By participating in the exchange project, individual initiative is also stimulated.The project will be organised by three members of staff who have previous experience of international cooperation. Activities are well established and methods for running the project have been planned for some time. Once the project has started up and is implemented by staff and HVE learners, the work will progress according to the Activity Plan that includes, among other things, theme days, help with writing CVs and that every participant prepares themselves by investigating/examining specific areas in the destination country.Four different professional areas of work will be represented among the 16 members of staff participating in mobility, in order to achieve a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to apply their new knowledge immediately for the benefit of HVE learners and to support the school\u2019s own work with internationalisation. The 25 HVE learners participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across these four areas of work. Learners should have good interpersonal skills and a clearly stated goal for what they hope to achieve in their future careers with the help of this new experience. Participants must also have good communicative skills to be able to convey what they have learnt after their period of WPL. After selection, the goals for mobility should be agreed and anchored with the host company or organisation and the Learning Agreement written.The anticipated result is that Frans Schartau will be at the forefront when it comes to working with internationalisation. Within the organisation there will be a greater understanding of professional roles seen from a European perspective. The acquired knowledge will add an international dimension to the school\u2019s programmes and teaching, provide knowledge about SeQF, EQF and ECVET, and ensure that international Work Placements (WPL) maintain high quality.

In fact, there are many ways that deaf and hearing people can communicate with each other and work together very well. The first requirement is that both sides are open to each others needs.\r\n\r\nWhat the project will develop: ACTIVITIES & OUTCOMES \r\n\r\n1. DEAF PEOPLE AT WORK: Role Models - Portraits \r\nDeaf people are hardly visible in our society. To shine a spotlight on Deaf people and their work situations is the best and most effective way to build Deaf Awareness, and especially \u201cDeafness at Work\u201d to the employment sector. \r\n\r\nPortraits and reports about the Deaf at work, give helpful tips for employers who aren\u2019t familiar with issues about the integration of Deaf individuals in their companies or institutions. The portraits are also enriching and motivational for Deaf youngsters to get first hand information about real work experience from their peers . \r\n\r\n2. DEAF-YOUTH-MEETS-EMPLOYERS-TOOLKIT: \r\n\u201cNothing about us without us\u201d- the participation of young Deaf people themselves is used to address Deaf Awareness- and communication activities to the employment sector. It is crucial that they are  visible with their own language, their potentials and expressions.\r\nDeaf youngsters show important sign and communication tips to make the everyday cooperation between hearing and deaf colleagues easier. For example, how to say \u201cgood morning\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name\u201d, \u201chow are you\u201d. Many of these phrases are quick and easy to learn and allow an easy start in to sign language communication.\r\n\r\n3. ACTIVE NETWORKING: networking with organisations in the employment sector and for the Deaf Community is essential to build sustainable bridges to work for the young Deafs\u2019 entry in the regular job market and is a major part of the project. SIGNS FOR HANDSHAKES is establishing a NETWORKING MAP with organisations and companies that promote and support the Deaf-friendly workplace. \r\n\r\n4.

Curricula have been updated and goals have been sharpened. The 2011 Eurodyce report \"Mathematics in Europe: Common Challenges and National Policies\" acknowledges the efforts of the central authorities but also states that a variety of teaching methods are needed and that learners\u2019 motivation is often an issue and that only few countries in Europe work on extracurricular project-based ideas.\r\n\r\nVidumath would like to contribute to this discussion with an innovative teaching method with ideas of a technology-rich ecosystem built around video production. Video nowadays is a common form of communication that most young people enjoy. Video can be a very motivating tool and bring in many different facets compared to a conventional textbook. The moving image can help to illustrate more complex structures and can aptly connect with the real world.\r\n\r\nEuropean video education experts and mathematics innovators will develop a framework of ideas of what could be done within the mathematics classroom with and for the age of 9 to 12 years. The core idea is that the learners themselves are the active part of the production process. In this process, using systematic but creative thinking, mathematical content will be re-worked and visualised. Mathematics is a science that occupies itself with such things as rules, patterns, abstractions or proofs that can be applied in a large number of settings, applied or philosophical or playful. In this approach:\r\n\r\n  * Children will playfully discover learning within mathematics\r\n  * Children will document this process themselves on video\r\n  * Other children, as an immediate repercussion, will be learners and consumers of these productions\r\n  * Children will be given opportunity for self-reflection from this learning-by-teaching approach\r\n  * Teachers will facilitate appropriately and provide ideas and examples\r\n  * The ideas will be further developed together with other EU teachers \r\n\r\nTeachers will be the interface to reach the learners and the project will take great care to address and include them appropriately. To give structure to our productions, vidumath will collect and develop video material within three matrix themes: entry task (screen recording, one-shot video), intermediate task (stop motion / animation) and advanced task (creative explorations \u2013 edited video). Basic ideas with a clear pedagogical outline and well produced video tutorials will especially address teachers with no video experience. For these teachers ideas will include: what can be done with a limited amount of classroom time, how tasks can be combined with homework as well as ideas for interdisciplinary project work especially in conjunction with the subject of art.\r\n\r\nIn order to promote the vidumath vision the project will produce attractive and clear pilot examples for each matrix theme. Pedagogical material will include background information and video tutorials will offer a good introduction about what kind of videos can be produced and how. The focus will be on visual material with little amount of words. This will support the exchange of outcomes and help schools to work in tandem across Europe. A project wiki will offer a space for schools to connect with each other and showcase their ideas and outcomes freely.\r\n\r\nThe vidumath ideas will be spread within European teacher workshops and courses as well as online. Our existing promotion expertise with popular online platforms will guarantee that hundreds of thousands of European educators will hear about the project and its results. The project will work on a cross-platform promotion campaign and rely on Facebook pages, YouTube playlists and channels, Twitter, LinkedIn and additional social platforms. The integration of the outcomes on open platforms will make sure that vidumath will have a long-running and sustainable home (The project will of course take appropriate care that privacies are respected.
