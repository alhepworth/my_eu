This system will include optical non-contact monitoring and innovative Human-Machine-Interfaces, which are easily manageable for the worker. Based on thermal and optical models embedded into integral process simulation tools combined with novel machine and laser technologies, for the first time a tape winding system will be realised which is able not only to drastically reduce the occurring waste, but also predict potentially arising failure in order to reduce machine downtimes. Statistical reliability and maintenance models for detection of critical elements and definition of their reliability will also prevent sudden machine breakdowns and allow defining the most cost-efficient maintenance schedule. \n\nThus ambliFibre will be a major breakthrough for the continuous and discontinuous production of neuralgic tape-winded tubular composite components, such as gas tanks for automotive application, pressure vessel housings for the desalination of sea water or composite ultra-deep-water risers which are all affected by rapidly changing product requirements concerning both, material and design. With respect to changing and challenging environmental influences, quick adaptability, failure-free quality and safe operation over the complete life-cycle are mandatory. \n\nThe successful application of the ambliFibre results will dramatically accelerate the replacement of metal components in these domains, reducing the carbon footprint thanks to the low weight and long life cycle of FRP components and provide new opportunities for European manufacturers in global, high-value multi-billion \u20ac markets.\n\nambliFibre is conceived as a small collaborative project lasting 36 months and will be submitted to the call FoF 14 \u2013 2015:  Integrated design and management of production machinery and processes.", 228497.0, 3963931.0, 7, 12, "ambliFibre", null, "http://www.pultrex.com", null, "h2020_198352_951683491"], [1425168000000, 1582934400000, "Adapting the feed, the animal and the feeding techniques to improve the efficiency and sustainability of monogastric livestock production systems", "Cobb Europe Limited", "Feed-a-Gene aims to better adapt different components of monogastric livestock production systems (i.e., pigs, poultry and rabbits) to improve the overall efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact.

Such traffic increase is impacting on both network costs and power consumption. Moreover, traffic is not only increasing but becoming much more dynamic, both in time and direction. For these reasons, transport network evolution from current DWDM systems towards elastic optical networks, based on flexgrid transmission and switching technologies, could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc) to directly control the bandwidth of the Bandwidth Variable Transponders (BVT) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.This then defines the key objective behind IDEALIST: To research in detail a cost and power efficient transport network architecture able to carry a wide range of signal bandwidths, each of which will be varying in real time in direction and magnitude, and some of which will be extremely large and possibly exceeding 1Tb/s.
