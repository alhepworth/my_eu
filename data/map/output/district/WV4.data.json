We want  to provide our students with positive experiences of working with people from all heritages and backgrounds, in order to dispel the myths and provide them with an experience which will enable them to come to their own world view, and challenge prejudice. In addition, as citizens of the European Union, our students need to be well educated and well qualified in order to fulfill their potential as active, responsible, and employable citizens of this community.  Colton Hills and Helpsen are ideally placed to begin this work. In Colton Hills, German students will be able to work and socialize with predominantly Asian students, together with significant numbers of students from the Caribbean and, especially with the vote for \u201cleaving the European Union- Brexit\u201d for those students at Colton Hills it is necessary to get in contact with Europe and in this case with dominantly \u201cwhite\u201d students to get out of their cultural niche.\r\nHelpsen has a student population where there are few students from ethnic groups, apart from white German. The rural communities of this area have little experience or knowledge of the diverse nationalities represented at Colton Hills, and this brings fear and anxiety. As the borders of Europe have opened within our project we aim to provide students from both schools with opportunities to challenge these attitudes and stereotypes.\r\nThe activities in our project will be in year 9 because of the high communicative competence which is needed for the deeper understanding of the partners. The project will last for 2 years each year the current year 9 at IGS Helpsen and the current year 10 at Colton Hills being given partners for getting to know each other and hopefully staying in contact from then on. In year 2  of the project  modules 5 and 7 will be added  The partners get to know each other in joint projects and a group of students will visit each other. There will be different modules which will take part in subjects both schools work together on.\r\nModule 1 will take part in \u201cEnglish\u201d at both schools Students of the whole year group  \u201creading the book \u201cThe boy with the topknot \u201c by Satnam Sangera as this book describes life of an Asian boy growing up in Wolverhampton.\r\nModule 2 will be a group of German students visiting Colton Hills listening to the author of the book \u201cThe boy with a top knot\u201d and doing research on how life is as an Asian in Wolverhampton as Satnam Sanhgera describes in his book.\r\nModule 3 will be about the different  faiths (Sikhism and Lutheran Church) All students of both year groups doing research on the faith of the partner's religion.\r\nModule 4  is about the question \u201cwhere do  prejudices come from , this will take part in \u201csocial studies\u201d.\r\nModule 5 will be about the current world situation and how it is influenced by prejudices , this will take part in \u201csocial studies \u201c at both schools as well. \r\nModule 6 will be a group of English students visiting the IGS Helpsen in order to find out what activities the school has done so far to get the label as \u201cschool against racismt\u201d. In adddition the students will present new ideas they have learnt in the project what the whole school can do to prevent racism.\r\nModule 7 will be a study of political right wing parties , their ideas and what their attitude towards our project would be comparing  the party AFD in Germany and the UKIP party in the UK.\r\nAs all students in both schools in the same year group have got partners , due to our objective \u201c understanding people better by getting to know my partner\u201d the partners will interview each other about their own perspective to the modules  to then introduce the partners in their classrooms. This will be videographed for the partners in the other country to see being introduced.  \r\nBy different means of dissemination students from both schools will get access to and other schools are able to see the project as a role model for combatting racism. \r\nObjectives: Our objectives are to enable students from two key members of the European Union to challenge their perception of the world in which they live and to interact with students who live in very different circumstances to consider attitudes and perceptions of the current migration and mobility which has become a feature of their everyday life.  We will reach this objective by implementing the modules into our curricula of  both schools  to then have it  last hopefully without funding.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.st-teresas.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_7"]]}}, "6BL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1359676800000, 1454198400000, "Development and demonstration of compact, multi-source heat eXchanger technologies for renewable energy applications", "Advanced Chemical Etching Limited", "Europe's refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump industry has an annual turnover of \u20ac30 billion and employs around 200,000 people.
