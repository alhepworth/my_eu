The discovery and development of new antibiotics is essential to maintain medical advances but poses significant scientific, clinical, and financial challenges, particularly for antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli). Such bacteria have effective barriers against drugs, making treatment difficult, resistance likely and development costs and risks high. In addition, any new antibiotics brought to the market would likely be used cautiously to delay the development of resistance, adding an additional financial challenge in recouping the development costs. The O\u2019Neill Report on AMR identifies diagnostics as critical to the battle against antibiotic resistance.\n\nThis innovation action, BreathSpec, proposes a viable solution to the global problem of AMR through the final developmental stages of an existing diagnostic device, which will allow a rapid, binary decision to be made on the need for antibiotic treatment, and which with suitable optimisation will allow further differentiation and stratification to take place. The Innovation Action includes technical developments to optimise its function, data acquisition for the development of the decision making analytical function and clinical validation.\n\nIt addresses these issues by producing reliable identification and quantification of key signature volatiles present in exhaled breath. It provides a non-invasive method for monitoring the volatile organic compounds present in an individual\u2019s exhaled breath (and subsequently the blood) and has long been recognised as having significant utility as a clinical test that can be used for early disease detection and monitoring, and potentially to diagnose specific bacterial infections for better, more targeted use of existing antibiotics.", 101977.0, 2914227.0, 3, 5, "BreathSpec", null, null, null, "h2020_210626_926919294"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "REDKNIGHT CONSULTANCY LTD", 101432.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_15296"]]}}, "8XR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Granollers on the move", "Royal Glamorgan Hospital", 14276.0, 2, 5, "Institut Escola Municipal de Treball in Granollers (Catalonia) submits this mobility project in the field of VET, under the title Granollers on the move (acronym Granmove).The center, whose owner is the City Council of Granollers, starts with this projects its firm commitment to the internationalisation, and specifically in the VET field. This commitment has to do with the II Strategic Plan of the city of Granollers, and its Internationalisation Plan, and also with the fact that Granollers has a VET Council, to foster and increase its reputation in the city and its influence area.The  school took part previously in some European projects, but it intends, with the current project, to start a consistent and long-lasting internationalisation process.The participants will be four VET students, and they will be hosted in companies in the United Kingdom, in order to follow there the compulsory subject of Practical Training in companies.The participants will be students of the following profiles:- car mechanic- electricity and automatic systems- nurse assistant- electromechanical maintenanceThe main goals of the project are as follows:- at strategical level, to provide the school with a European dimension, to improve its attractiveness in the city of Granollers and surrounding area- to strengthen the link between education and work worlds- to improve the educational portfolio of the school, including international placements- to offer the students the chance to live an international experience- to improve the CV of the students taking part in the mobilities, increasing their attractiveness among companies and recruiters- to improve technical, language and soft skills both of students and members of school staff involved in the projectThe placements in the UK will include the compulsory activities detailed in each VET training plan. The participants will practice in a real company the skills they have been learning while they were learning at school.Some soft skills are expected to be achieved, developed or improved: adaptability, communication, initiative, willingness to learn, self-management.The expected impacts of the project among the participants are:- better English level- personal development and maturity- increase of employabilityAmong the staff, the project will improve their project management skills and also their language level. Last but not least, the project will impact at macro level:- in the town of Granollers and its area, since the attractiveness and reputation of the school wil be increased- the reputation of the school will be better among the companies in the area, because of the dissemination of the international mobilities among them- the companies themselves will benefit in the near future of new professionals with international experience- the achievement of the goals of the Strategic and Internasionalisation Plans of the Town of Granollers", "http://www.cwmtafuhb.wales.nhs.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-023331_3"], [2018, "Ergotherapie im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich - Eine Erweiterung beruflicher Perspektiven und sprachlicher Kompetenzen", "Royal Glamorgan Hospital", 11939.0, 4, 6, "The project offers the opportunity to absolve an abroad vocational placement in a medical resp. therapeutic institution in Cheltenham (England, UK), Mosta (Malta) and Llantristant (Wales,UK) to three students of the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg.

By this they should realize as well as recognize their own competences and value as well as extend them.  Being on their own in an unknown environment in a foreign country the young adults will rise their personal competences and gain more independence, flexibility and personal maturity. In addition the language skills of the participants in speaking, comprehension and writing in a foreign language will extend during their stay in the English or Spanish speaking countries. \r\n\r\nA high-grade quality support during all stages of the stay abroad project (preparation, mobility phase, revising) is to be guaranteed. In order to achieve this aim the foreign language competences of the responsible teachers, Ms Scherer and Schmidt, are to be improved by an English course in Malta. In their spare time the teachers get to know the socio-cultural environment and the sights of Malta. \r\nThese personal experiences will contribute to the future preparation classes in which students shall be prepared for a mobility in Malta, and thus, the teachers will improve the quality of assistance and support.\r\nBesides, the director of the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg, Mr Vollmer, the project coordinator, Ms Scherer, and Ms Schmidt assisting to the coordinator, will have the opportunity within their week of study in Alicante (Spain) to develop a better appreciation for and open-mindedness to the social, linguistic and cultural variety of Spain. \r\nThis is to serve as the basis for a better assistance of future activities for the support of mobility of the students within the Spanish speaking area.\r\n\r\nSo by our participation in the Erasmus project we would on the one hand like to secure a high-value quality of project support by the teachers who will be able to show the students the possibilities and perspectives.
