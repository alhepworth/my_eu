The industry is regulated by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN specialised agency for maritime affairs. IMO is aware that over 80% of the reported accidents and incidents at sea and in ports are due to human errors (IMO, 2012, Horner, 2014) and over 30% of these accidents are due to linguistic and communications mistakes (Ziarati, 2006, Trekner, 2010). \r\nSince its inception the IMO has recognized the importance of human resources for the development of the maritime industry. Following the adoption of the revised International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) in 2010 a number of IMO member states suggested that IMO should develop model training courses to assist with the implementation of the Convention and in achieving a more rapid transfer of information and skills regarding new developments in maritime industry and technology. In addition, there was a consensus that a comprehensive set of short model courses in the various fields of maritime training would supplement the instruction provided by maritime academies. Model courses would also allow administrators and technical specialists already employed in maritime administrations, ports and shipping companies to improve their knowledge and skills in certain specialised fields. It interesting that IMO has adopted different set of language requirements for different types and rank of seafarers and has referred to EU MarTEL standards but as added three new categories to MarTEL seafarer classification namely, Electro-Technical Officers, GMDSS radio operators and for personnel providing direct service to passengers in passenger spaces on passenger ships\r\nLanguage and communication are fundamental elements of the shipping sector, especially with Maritime English being the language of the sea.  The IMO approved the newly revised Model Course 3.17 for Maritime English in January 2015. This will lead to adaptations and updates of existing academic programmes requiring alignment with the IMO-approved revisions. In devising the course IMO has made references to  EU funded projects such as MarTEL, MarTEL Plus, MarEng and MarEngPlus as well as SeaTALK.\r\nIMO states that (http://www.marifuture.org/Reports/Development-Papers/IMO_New_Model_Course_Maritime_English.pdf) because educational systems and the cultural backgrounds of trainees in maritime subjects vary considerably from country to country, the model course material has been designed to identify the basic entry requirements and there are no mechanisms for controlling the variation of the output from such courses. To remove the acknowledged variation this proposal aims to develop a new set of assessment standards for the IMO\u2019s revised Model Course 3.17 for Maritime English and include the three new categories of seafarers into the existing standards.  The project will use the results of recent EU-funded projects to produce a combined learning and assessment package with clear sign posts to existing materials available Europe-wide.\r\nThe project will develop an e-learning and e-assessment package for up-skilling seafarers and one that will grow in importance as e-learning becomes more widely implemented now that the IMO has recognised its validity in the recent IMO 2010 STCW amendments. \r\nThe new assessment standards will not only be in-line with the newly revised model course 3.17 Maritime English, but be linked with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).\r\nSetting common standards for assessment with training programmes directly linked to the CEFR, ECVET compliant, will ensure students and seafarers can learn and work throughout Europe, through the application of common content and assessment. This will help seafarers to be mobile, and have a greater access to job opportunities and career progression across Europe and the world. A number of studies (OECD, 2010, European Commission, 2011 and  BIMCO, 2005, 2010), have demonstrated there is an imbalance of seafarers in different EU countries.

However a study undertaken by Acar et al (2011) showed that almost 50% of seafarers disregard/ignore the COLREGs at sea. This is supported by recent MARS and MAIB case law (UK accident agencies), which indicate that many of the principles of collision avoidance are improperly applied, particularly relating to the more complex rules or complex real-life situations (Ziarati et al, 2015 - http://www.marifuture.org/Reports/Development-Papers/ADP_11_2015_MARIFUTURE.pdf). Collisions remain a major source of accidents at sea resulting in serious injuries and loss of life and property. EMSA'a 2014 Accident Review found that between 2011-2013 in the category of 'accidents with a ship' collisions were the second leading cause of accidents resulting in serious injuries.  It was accepted that there will be no changes to the COLREGs in the short-medium future when the International Maritime Lecturers Association made its position supporting the COLREGs clear in its June 2014 Newsletter. where it stated that \"COLREG specific\" accidents can be attributed to \"the unsatisfactory results of maritime training\".Seeing the severity of this issue, along with the target of zero collisions in the EU's R&D framework (Horizon 2014) research has been carried out during the ACTS project (2013-15) to identify training needs, resulting the ACTS+ project aims:1.

Women, as a disadvantaged group, have suffered from less stable employment due to various factors. Some of the reasons for less stability in the workplace can be listed as marriage, childbirth, gender roles in the society and cultural issues. Knowledge society transformed business world into an environment where intangible assets are considered the main value of the organizations. There was a radical change from traditional business environment to contemporary social environment where the focus is not only on consumers and organizational needs but also on environmental, social and ethical issues. Diffusion of rapidly changing technology into the business world discouraged people, especially women to return to work force. Moreover, intense penetration of the technology use and social media require developing new skills and abilities for a successful career.

Both HEIs and SMEs are encouraged by policies to jointly generate new knowledge and innovations. HEIs in Europe are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, where they need to cater to diverse stakeholders. In addition, research evaluation considers the impact of university research outside academia. Thus, the HEIs are expected to develop more cooperative links with the business community. At the same time, SMEs need to improve their skills and knowledge, considering their limited resources, so that they can develop their innovation capabilities and improve their competitiveness against bigger players. HEIs tend to seek for links with rather large businesses for reasons of prestige and to access additional funding for their research and teaching activities. Hence, the links between university departments/research centres and SMEs may have been side-lined although they can be beneficial to both sides. \r\nTo fill this gap, the proposed programme pursues the objective of conceiving a collaborative cloud based platform that implements a new agile methodology to support higher education institutions to collaborate in innovation processes with businesses across Europe in a systematic and organised way. The cloud based platform will support companies to manage and implement the complex innovation processes by taking advantage of universities' research and technological knowledge and expertise in a systematic way, by enabling an open multi-agent focused innovation (i.e. HEI/business focused innovation).

Background of project  - A global approach for the development of energy efficiency systems including an effective emission control is led by the IMO on account of the continued rapid growth of the world trade in the maritime transport.  (IMO2012).  According to GL (2012), IMO has mandated certain measures related to energy efficiency in international shipping as listed below: Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) which mandates energy efficiency standards for new ships; Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) to provide a tool for measuring the ship\u2019s fuel efficiency in operation and monitor the effect of any variations e.g. more frequent propeller cleaning or improved voyage planning or introduction of technical measures such as a new propeller or waste heat recovery systems; and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), a management tool for ship owners. These three standards came into force on January 1, 2013 within a new chapter of MARPOL Annex VI. Complex technologies will be involved in building a ship efficiency system by the marine suppliers since as stated earlier the life expectancy of vessels is estimated to be around 30 to 40 years and also of the mandatory regulations to be met as set by IMO (Oceana 2013).\r\n\r\nWhat? Objectives - Currently there is no standard for the proposed role of the Energy Manager as proposed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). This project proposes the development of an energy managers job specification and a training programme for it specifically for the shipping industry to be able to continually improve its energy management on board ships with the view to save energy, reduce pollution and to improve the overall quality of energy management.  The intention is also to encourage shipping companies to seek ISO 50000 certification.  The expectation is to develop a specification and a training programme for the newly established ship energy managers helping to develop tailor-made arrangements for more efficient use of energy on board ships and their interactions with ports in line with the Energy Management System of ISO 50000.  This would allow setting targets and objectives, with a requirement to monitor use of energy and to assess how well the proposed arrangements are effective on pilot basis. Maritime is a transnational sector and it is important to bring in partners which have knowledge of ship types, ship propulsion, ship navigation, energy production, electrical and mechanical parts and circuitry, safety issues, national certification, accreditation and validation of learning materials, pedagogical aspects of learning and last but by no means least online application.\r\n\r\nWho? Number and profile of participants \u2013 the partnership is composed on an organisation (C4FF) with unique knowledge of energy production and engine emissions, the project manager has considerable experience of job specification and training programme development and their validation and recognition internationally.  C4FF is supported in the UK by one of the two major universities (SSU) with considerable experience of developing and offering high quality maritime programmes and as a university is an awarding body in itself. The university will work closely with professional bodies and relevant training boards and licensing authorities to ensure the specification and its associated training programme will receive the recognition intended.  C4FF and SSU are supported by four Maritime Education and Training (MET) providers (SUAS in Finland (North); BAU in Turkey (South); MUS in Poland (East) and UPC in Spain (West) covering the periphery of the Europe to ensure multiplier activities reach as many as countries in Europe as possible. The partnership is complemented by a shipping company (Makroshipping) and a port (Rauma) to make sure the specification and training programme takes all practical aspects into consideration.

It seems likely that if we were able to teach plastics or other polymers how to template new copies of themselves that we would similarly be able to make new, impossible materials and hence further expand the potential function and properties of these materials. These new materials would provide enhanced properties and function (such as replication and evolution) that are not currently available to material chemists.

We propose a radically different alternative, which brings insights from social psychology to bear on cognitive models of economic judgement and choice by distinguishing between underlying preferences and expressed preferences. Underlying preferences are stable characteristics of people, but do not inform everyday choices directly because people have no conscious access to the strength of their underlying preferences. Expressed preferences in contrast are learned, context-dependent, and do inform everyday choices directly. Bringing insights from cognitive models to social context effects, we implement a parallel distinction between underlying and expressed attitudes and quantify the concepts of authenticity preference and social extremeness aversion.

To do so, I use experimental market methods to test whether ethnic and gender diversity deflate price bubbles by disrupting herding behaviour. 2) The second study tests how the social structure of attention affects valuation.

In bacteria Escherichia coli uses predominantly phosphorus-containing lipids (phospholipids) in its cell envelope, including phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. However, beyond E. coli a range of lipids are found in bacterial membranes, including phospholipids as well as phosphorus (P)-free lipids such as betaine lipids, ornithine lipids, sulfolipids and glycolipids. In the marine environment, it is well established that P availability significantly affects lipid composition in the phytoplankton, whereby non-P sulfur-containing lipids are used to substitute phospholipids in response to P stress. This remodeling offers a significant competitive advantage for these organisms, allowing them to adapt to oligotrophic environments low in P. Until very recently, abundant marine heterotrophic bacteria were thought to lack the capacity for lipid remodelling in response to P deficiency. However, recent work by myself and others has now demonstrated that lipid remodelling occurs in many ecologically important marine heterotrophs, such as the SAR11 and Roseobacter clades, which are not only numerically abundant in marine waters but also crucial players in the biogeochemical cycling of key elements. However, the ecological and physiological consequences of lipid remodeling, in response to nutrient limitation, remain unknown. This is important because I hypothesize that lipid remodeling has important knock-on effects restricting the ability of marine bacteria to deal with both abiotic and biotic stresses, which has profound consequences for the functioning of major biogeochemical cycles.

Solving this puzzle requires a holistic approach involving measuring and modeling the relevant interacting parts together. \nOur goal is to develop a multidisciplinary approach rooted in solid and solution state NMR that will make possible studies of complexes from PKSs.

In particular, beyond the generation of new materials, the functionality of these systems may allow the development of supramolecular living polymers, a long-standing goal in polymer chemistry that is still elusive. The functionality and versatility of the SPBs obtained in this work open the route to a wealth of applications, and we will focus on one specific target: the fabrication of drug delivery vectors. We will exploit the unique combination of features presented by this new class of polymer therapeutics, such as multiple attachment points for one or more drug(s) / targeting ligands / markers, the ability to self-disassemble into smaller and easy-to-excrete components, and an elongated shape that enables diffusion and interaction with cells more efficiently than traditional globular delivery systems.

Improvements to NDT through the use of NCU are leading to new applications in hostile environments, such as measurements at high temperatures or of moving samples, helped by the lack of need for couplant. This proposal covers applications of great importance which could benefit from the use of NCU. The problem of partially closed cracking in metals will first be investigated.

Popular summary structures include the Bloom filter, which compactly represents a set of items, and sketches which allow vector norms and products to be estimated.

Roughly speaking, deterministic systems are those that evolve without any randomness.   Nevertheless, the probabilistic approach is appropriate since specific trajectories are unpredictable in \u201cchaotic\u201d systems.  At the other extreme, stochastic systems evolve in a random manner by assumption.\n\nOne of the main topics of this proposal is to investigate how separation of time scales can cause a fast-slow deterministic system to converge to a stochastic differential equation (SDE).   This is called homogenization; the fast variables are averaged out and the limiting SDE is generally of much lower dimension than the original system.   The focus is mainly on situations where the SDE limit is driven by Brownian motion, but SDEs driven by stable L\u00e9vy processes are also of interest.   Homogenization is reasonably well-understood when the underlying fast-slow system is itself stochastic.  However there are very few results for deterministic fast-slow systems.   The aim is to make homogenization rigorous in a very general setting, and as a byproduct to determine how the stochastic integrals in the SDE are to be interpreted.\n\nA second main topic is to explore the idea that anomalous diffusion in the form of a superdiffusive L\u00e9vy process arises naturally in odd dimensions but not in even dimensions.   The context is pattern formation in spatially extended systems with Euclidean symmetry, and this dichotomy can be seen as an extension of the classical Huygens principle that sound waves propagate in odd but not even dimensions.  For anisotropic systems (where there are translation symmetries only), the situation is simpler: chaotic dynamics leads to Brownian motion and weakly chaotic dynamics (of intermittent type) leads to a L\u00e9vy process.

Both are ambivalent documents of European civilization, as instruments of intolerance and catalysts for cultural exchange. Our starting point is the first ever promenade production of The Merchant of Venice in the Ghetto, bringing into a creative relationship two milestones of European intangible and tangible heritage. This historical performance will be disseminated through various activities: a summer school, ten artistic workshops translating place and play into different media, two symposia, programmed from 2016 to 2018 in four different countries. All activities will depend on the interaction between state-of-the-art research and artistic elaboration among the various partners and several established artists. The project will address how sensitive topics concerning the coexistence, exchange, conflict between different ethnic and religious groups can be delivered through art to the broadest and most diverse audiences.

With the development of a mass higher education system across Europe the student population has become more diverse by age, gender, class, ethnicity and disability. The issue of employability is a central policy concern of the EU, national governments and a key goal of the Bologna Process (The European Higher Education in 2012: Bologna Process Implementation Report) and there is also emerging evidence that graduate employability is a problem across Europe. This situation has been affected by the economic crisis but at different levels across Europe so that, for example, it is more difficult for graduate students in Portugal to find employment than graduates in Sweden.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch shows that non-traditional students are particularly affected in terms of graduateness. For non-traditional students the transition into employment often takes longer than \u2018traditional students\u2019 and there is the likelihood of entering employment which is below degree level and, therefore, less meaningful. There is also a mismatch between graduate credentials and employers' expectations. The project involves six partners from a range of countries from north and south Europe.

Its adoption will lead to the online development of open educational resources that can be flexibly modified by educators and learners alike to give exceptionally rich support for blending educational practices combining instruction and construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis contributes to the wider aims for Strategic Partnerships to promote take-up of innovative practices in education, training and youth work and enhance the professional development of those working in these fields by increasing the quality and range of initial and continuing training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed consortium allows for the project to draw on a unique blend of skills and experience, and to access opportunities to trial and disseminate the activity through a number of learning activities covering learners of all ages across the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives and activities\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of our project is to promote 'making construals' as a new practice that promises to better support teachers and learners to create knowledge and solve conceptual problems with the support of digital tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the framework has potential to address policy objectives, challenges and needs relevant to several fields of education, training and youth, our proposal is to form a Strategic Partnership covering more than one field. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe core activities of the Strategic Partnership will be to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Develop and refine the existing framework and tools, drawing on the pedagogical and technical expertise of our consortium \r\n\r\n\u2022 Apply the framework in a number of educational contexts with a range of learners to explore and test its potential to enhance the teaching of computing/programming and other subjects\r\n\r\n\u2022 Refine the framework and tools in light of its application in educational contexts and launch it as an open educational resource\r\n\r\n\u2022 Conduct experimental studies to evaluate the efficacy of the framework for supporting learning \r\n\r\n\u2022 Dissemination of the framework and tools as elaborated below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widespread adoption of making construals as a new digital skill to support personal learning and collaborative construal construction as way of developing open educational resources.\r\n\r\nGreater awareness of the critical impact of the mode of construction upon the qualities of software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDissemination and longer term benefits\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be disseminated via an international conference, and establishment of the proposed MOOC.

A wide process of financial education is required in order to configure a critical and informed citizenship able to understand and make fundamental decisions on aspects related not only to the financial system, its functioning and products but also to all aspects integrated on a solid financial training. However, financial education is especially low among certain demographic groups, including young adults at risk. Some researches show that most young adults at risk make financial decisions and deal with complex financial products despite lacking this basic financial and quantitative knowledge. Moreover, the inclusion of the voices of the young adults is not taken into account when elaborating any curricula on financial education although it is essential to meet the real necessities and demands on financial education and for them to become more active, independent and enterprising.\r\n\r\nThe project has as the main aim the establishment of a learning curriculum on financial education based on the implication of young adults at risk themselves in order to meet their real needs on financial literacy.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n- Develop a participatory process that allows the implication of young adults at risk. To facilitate the participatory process, national working teams of young adults will be created in organizations which are directly working with them.\r\n\r\n- Carry out a comparative study on financial education programmes in the partnership countries.\r\n\r\n- Collect the participatory process followed in the organizations in a methodology that could be afterwards implemented in other organizations working with young adults. \r\n\r\n- Organize transnational and national seminars to disseminate the methodology and curriculum among young adults, organizations directly working with young adults at risk and public administration. \r\n\r\n- Carry out meetings with young organizations, organizations directly working with young adults at risk and public administration in order to guarantee the sustainability of the curriculum and the methodology abroad. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to three different target groups:\r\n\r\n- Young adults between 18 and 34 without basic compulsory education who are at risk of social exclusion due to their difficulties to be included on the labour market. \r\n\r\n- Organizations directly working with young adults at risk: youth organizations, social organizations for social and labour inclusion, financial organizations with training programmes on financial literacy and other stakeholders/adult education providers. \r\n\r\n- Public administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology used in this project will be the critical communicative methodology.

The project consortium will meet on four international meetings and a monthly online meeting. \r\nThe methodology to develop the present project\u2019s outputs will be Communicative Methodology which is based on the principles of equality, inclusion and relevance of all participants. Voices of educators and young adults at risk will be incorporated on the development of the outputs when discussing about each of them during the National Coordination Committee meetings, which will meet at least 6 times along the project, young adult at risk will be also included to guarantee that their needs are taken into account. Finally, when developing the Training Course, it will be used the Dialogical learning (Flecha, 1997)  which claims that learning is produced through equality interactions.\r\nIn order to guarantee a bigger number of young adults will receive a quality financial education, it is necessary not just training educators but also giving access to the outputs that will be created along this project. That is why all output contents will be available in EPALE in order to be used by other centers interested in how to carry out financial literacy courses to young people at risk of social exclusion.", "http://www.warwick.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA204-038697_3"], [2018, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK", 108784.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The important task of finding the right framework and right solutions to recognize prior learning outcomes resulted from everyday life experience, work environments and numerous social practices became a priority task in integrating HEI and LLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEI in Poland are currently in the stage of intense search for its own strategies and solutions when it comes to integrating LLL and RPL. Erasmus + creates a possibilities of learning from the experiences of more advanced partner institutions in EU, analysing their policies and strategies and build its own systems and tools of RPL while allowing European partners critical view of their own practices through action research process and the exchange of their experiences in the field. EDUPRO project is responding to the need to: widening participation in education for adult learners ( over 25 years old), promote   and validate  learning in non -formal and informal learning  settings (i. e. workplace learning),  create new curriculum and educational programmes for learners without prior academic experiences. Added value of the project is the involvement of other stakeholders (employers, local government, NGO\u2019s)  in the process of shaping key competences and skills essentials for the market, local communities and active citizenship practices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four HEI involved in the project, all of them are experienced in participation in international research projects: DSW (University of Lower Silesia) \u2013 non state academic HEI established in 1997 in Wroclaw, Poland. University of Algarve in Faro, Portugal  - HEI established in 70. Well known for its reach network of international cooperation and strong ties with local stakeholders. University of Warwick (UK) \u2013 one of the biggest and most prominent HEI in Great Britain with reach offer in LLL. University of Gdansk \u2013 one of the top state founded HEI in Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities within the project will enable to create and test best practices and solutions  (organizational, institutional, procedural and staff related) in LLL and RPL based on more advanced  partners\u2019  experiences and to analyse  current state of the art in RPL in EU based on resources of HEI. Main tasks of the project are: sharing experiences between partners, sharing resources and working materials, comparative studies between institutions as LLL leaders (case studies, action research, documents analysis), experimental implementation of RPL solutions  in Poland based on recommendation for polish practitioners  in HEI, creating an educational offer for learners from non-academic environments (non- traditional learners of all age and background).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes of the project are both intellectual (institutional profiles, recommendation, research report on action research, website, papers and articles) as well as promotes and disseminates the results of the project (conference, workshops for the stakeholders). Long terms results of the project are: raising awareness of LLL significance as a key learning practice through disseminating the outcomes of the project after its finishing, involving every possible open access resources to promotes it.\r\n\r\nLong term results of EDUPRO are focused on HEI and address the necessity to open up towards new group of learners with diverse learning experiences, social and cultural capitals as well as new learning resources.", "http://www.warwick.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA203-003629_1"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK", 59593.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

As a key theme of the Europe 2020, Digital Agenda for Europe and 2015 Digital Single Market strategies, intellectual property-related industries are identified as being one of the most important for growth and jobs in the EU. Nevertheless, when it comes to the teaching of IP, the important public policy dimension of IP law is given comparatively little attention. Instead, the predominant focus of much IP law teaching is upon the national context, drawing from European law where appropriate, but not engaging fully with the important role of the EU in this field. This is particularly the case in the UK, where IP modules tend to focus on the national or international level, with the EU level being significantly under-explored. As a result, while students may leave university with good understanding of the general IP regime, knowledge of the EU law and policy dimension as well as how to apply this knowledge in practice is lacking.This module will advance the study of EU IP through research-led teaching and a pedagogical approach focused on high-impact activities. In this approach, learning is reinforced through engagement in practical tasks based on strong theoretical foundations. The module will be comprised of blended lectures, which combine formal lectures with interaction and summative feedback, and practical seminars that will focus on the application of studied content in innovative high-impact activities such as institutional simulations, legislative deliberation and drafting, and Advocate General Opinion-writing, which are not used in mainstream legal teaching.

Albeit aggregate gravel is chosen for its high compressive strength and relatively low cost, its use is associated with different problems. Due to its high density, any construction will require more steel reinforcement to support the weight of the heavy concrete. The different sizes and shapes as well as the inconsistent distribution of the gravel causes air and water voids, causing weak points and is responsible for crack propagation in the concrete structure. Despite technical problems, the usage of gravel is also responsible for significant amounts of quarrying, transportation costs and CO2 emissions. We have innovated and developed a novel process and a system (consisting of the GEM-TECHTM machine and GEM-SOLTM catalyst) that creates a \u2018superior foam\u2019, which does not drain off for at least 12 hours, providing sufficient time for the cement to set resulting in high compressive strengths. The geodesic structure that is created by the novel mixing screw action and the ingredients that are mixed systematically in the GEM-TECHTM machine without using any gravel or any admixtures into GEM-TECHTM ready-mixed material provide significant cost savings. The main objectives of the ReMix project is to investigate the feasibility of developing different size machines with different specifications, examine the commercial and technical risks of the process, develop strategies to meet different standard requirements and develop strategies to commerialise our unique product.  The overall objective is to develop an advanced ready mixed concrete replacement material, which is at least 45% cheaper, 28% lighter, with high compressive and flexural strengths.
