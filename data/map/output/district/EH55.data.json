Management, teaching staff and support staff are committed to the implementation process and share a vision where our learners feel confident when communicating in different languages, where they are knowledgeable about their European setting and have regular opportunities to communicate with children in other European countries.  As a school, we recognise the positive impact that a sound understanding of languages will have on our learners\u2019 ability to access a wider employment market as they leave education for the workforce.\r\n\r\nIn order to begin to achieve our vision for learners, two staff members completed French immersion training and their success has motivated other staff to want to participate in Spanish immersion training.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nOur LFEE immersion training project will enable school staff to fully implement the European and Scottish Government's 1+2 Languages policy as we will:\r\n\u2022 Be able to improve learning and teaching in languages across the whole school\r\n\u2022 Have access to new resources, teaching methods and IT approaches to enhance pupil learning\r\n\u2022 Build links with other European schools to share opportunities to enhance pupil learning\r\n\u2022 Be able to support partner schools as they improve their languages provision\r\n\u2022 Be able to support parents in their learning and develop their capacity to support their children\u2019s learning\r\n\u2022 Build sustainability in our project as skills and understanding will be spread across the staff group\r\n\u2022 Build pupil capacity to access the world of work as they leave school\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\nHelen Pritchard - (Principal Teacher Mainstream).

As guidance from the Scottish Government and West Lothian Council is now changing with the 1+2 Approach to Language Teaching, we  are aware that we need to update our methodology to move towards a whole-school approach to language teaching. This approach will mean that language teaching is embedded in every class rather and delivered by the class teacher rather than 1 session per week. In training staff from the infant and middle stages we hope to ensure consistency throughout the school.\r\n\r\nBy training 2 members of staff in language and methodology of language teaching we are confident that we will be able to embed the target language into the school \u2013 French from Nursery upwards and Spanish from P5 upwards.  This training and the teaching of language is a key part of our school development plan for 2015-16 and is also a key part of our cluster development plan.  The impact of the training will be fully evaluated by all staff on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this training opportunity will enable us to implement the 1+2 Approach to Language teaching to the highest possible standards.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to empowering our pupils to communicate with pupils in the UK and abroad as a result of this training both in English and in the target language.  We aim for our pupils to talk, listen, read and write with confidence in the target language and to be confident citizens of Europe.", "http://www.stmaryspolbeth.ik.org", "St. Mary's RC Primary", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013192_coordinator"]]}}}}
