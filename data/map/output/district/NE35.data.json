We see that the results are exceptional in many ways on the Children involved in this practice. . \r\nThis experience has led to cooperation with different Nature based Kindergartens, also abroad. We have had a lot of cooperation with the Scottish partners, and have decided that this work is much to important not to give wide attendance in all of Europe. So we have contacted 2 new partners that is relevant in this project, and we think we have got a strong case.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT; \r\nWe have focused on 3 main objectives:\r\n   1.   A description on different ways of conducting the nature focus in the childcare sector in 4 European Countries.\r\n   2.   A presentation of best practice in 4 Nature-kindergartens in 4 different European Countries, describing methods and philosophy.\r\n   3.   Making a learning Video of best practice in 4 Nature-kindergartens in 4 European Countries, to use in education and as\r\n         inspiration together with the other material.\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS; \r\nThere are 4 different Nature-kindergartens in 4 different Countries involved:\r\n- From Scotland we have the Mindstretchers Organization, represented with Auchlone Nature-kindergarten. They have a base in a  little old farmhouse in the countryside, and an area outside consisting of a large outdoor-space which they have formed out together with the Children, + a large part of the nearby Woods, also including a small Pond. They are basically working with the system and philosophy of \"Talking and thinking Floor-books\", which is reflected in creating learning paths through the Children's own initiative and ways of thinking. It is also a very good method for documentation.\r\n- From England we have the Boldon Nursery School. They are an urban institution, in the middle of the City. They have a modern Kindergarten on ground level, with possibility to open big sliding doors on the side of the building facing the outdoor area. In that way they can include the indoors to the outdoor area in their activities. They have built a outdoor area on a nature model, trying to reflect different natural environments. They are also leaning heavily on the \"Talking and thinking Floor book\" methods.\r\n- From the Czech Republic we have Zakladni a materska skola Jurta. They are situated outside Decin Town, in a rural environment, surrounded with farmland and big forest areas. There are lots of farming and animals involved in their everyday life. They have their own modern \"school building\", but are mostly outside through the days. They have made their own base up in the woods about 20-30 min. away, and spend most of their days in that area.\r\n- From Norway we have Hval G\u00e5rd Naturbarnehage. They are based in several small cabins without electric heating. They are practically outside all the time. The Cabins are set on the outskirts of a larger Kindergartens area, with open woodlands all around, and close to the Sea. They also have a big Boat, and some smaller ones, to go fishing and traveling with the groups on the sea and surrounding Islands. They also have a mini-bus to use for going on longer trips in the Community surroundings. They are also working with \"Talking and thinking Floor-books\" as a method.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES: \r\n* Planning through meetings every 6 months of the Project groups (2 persons) from each Country, with evaluation of visits and making reports. Also planning further ahead.\r\n* 1 study visit  with the Working-groups (4 persons) from each Country to the other Country's Kindergartens.\r\n* Working with documentation in the field every day - pictures and video mostly.\r\nMETHODOLOGY TO BE USED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT; \r\n* Video meetings with reporting from each of the Countries to the Norwegian administration every Month.\r\n* Making reports on the progress of the project on our Internet site.\r\n* Administrating and publishing on our Facebook site\r\n* Gradually through the 3 years-putting together a Report and a Video documentary from each Country. Also to be evaluated in the\r\n   Project group meetings, and putting it all together at the end.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF RESULTS AND IMPACT ENVISAGED: \r\nWe observe self confident children, with great qualities on cooperating with other children and good ability on finding creative ways of problem solving. Physically strong Children,which can manage in almost every situation, and they can handle a lot of necessary tools. They have also learned a lot about contrasts like cold / warm, exhausted/comfortable, passive learning/deep studies.\r\nTHE POTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS:\r\nGreat lasting learning potential. Socially strong and very healthy Children. Great social Capital. New learning models presented. Inspiration to Personnel and Organizations.

Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression. Although the current mind-set for drug treatment in the field is moving to a more personalized medicine and patient stratification approach, there are no accepted methods or guidelines to classify patients according to their prognosis and differentiate between subsets in terms of diagnosis methodology and treatment plan. The APPROACH consortium brings together a competent and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that will setup \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a longitudinal cohort based on highly innovative stratification methods that identifies different OA phenotypes and subsequently develop guidelines for differentially diagnosing the right patient for the right treatment.\n\nThe stratified medicine APPROACH \nThe APPROACH consortium brings together a unique complimentary set of skills to develop, validate and link biomarkers with biological processes and clinical end points in OA patient subsets. This will support future regulatory qualification and guide clinical trials for relevant endpoint validation, thereby paving the road for stratified or personalized medicine. This leads to the following overall objectives of the consortium:\n- Implement and establish a new, integrated and comprehensive database platform of existing data from partners that will be extended with newly collected longitudinal data, incorporating novel high quality biomarkers.\n- Define subsets of (phenotypically) different patients in both the existing cohorts as well as (later) in the new longitudinal extension cohorts and subsequently identify the \u201cright patient\u201d to treat for each subset/phenotype via innovative stratification techniques. \n- Optimize, introduce and validate the next generation imaging methodologies (modality \\ post-processing), human motion analysis and biochemical assays to enable more efficient and reliable diagnoses and treatment of OA patients. \n- Identify mechanistic targets for patient subsets, create prediction models and establish guidelines for a DMOAD development that forms the roadmap for OA.\n\nAPPROACH: a tri-partite partnership between relevant stakeholders\nThe ambitious objectives of the APPROACH consortium require the mobilization of a broad set of skills and extensive expertise, from academics, clinicians and the private sector. The APPROACH consortium brings together a strong tri-partite team from European clinical centers (cohorts), basic research institutes (state-of-the-art tools) and SME/Industry (certified tool analyses and logistics) which also collaborate with large US-based OAI and MOST cohorts. This group is engaged with end users in hospitals and patient advocacy groups actively involved in OA awareness, fundraising and research support. The consortium crosses barriers and enables inter-sectorial collaborations that bring together all the expertise and knowledge in one place, where the information can be seamlessly integrated and, as such, contributes to innovative stratification and personalized diagnostic methods", null, 14373924.0, 11, 25, "APPROACH", null, "http://www.idsplc.com", null, "fp7_203727_949847281"]]}}}}
