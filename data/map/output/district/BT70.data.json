This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them to provide a more professional service for economic benefit.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the SoEngage project is that family farms represent an important resource to maintain and improve the social, economic and cultural sustainability of rural areas. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective is to support farmers to engage in Social Farming by developing their knowledge, skills and competences through training to consider, plan and deliver a professional Social Farm service for the economic benefit and sustainability of the farm and the rural community.\r\n\r\nSocial Farming, also known as Care Farming or Farming for Health is an innovative multifunctional activity which offers farmers the opportunity to use their agricultural expertise and resources to promote therapy, rehabilitation, social inclusion, education and social services for entrepreneurial and economic benefit. The farm remains a working farm where people who need care support can benefit from participation in farm activities in a non-clinical environment.\r\n\r\nThe quality of a Social Farming service depends on the expertise and training of the farmers engaged in its delivery. \r\n\r\nThe partners of the SoEngage project represent 6 regions (UK, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain) and provide a range of training and support for farmers and have identified the gap in information and training on social farming which enables farmers to make informed decisions on whether or not this innovative entrepreneurial activity is suitable for them and the farm family.\r\n\r\nThis gap can be addressed by collaborating to harness the competent mix of expertise and materials that exist between the partners to produce training that brings resources together to create a comprehensive set of digital and online resources. \r\n\r\nThe innovative approach is that unlike existing training, which is delivered on-site and restricted by availability of trainers and financial resources, SoEngage training will make training convenient for farmers to complete by using digital and online platforms for accessible self-learning. Such online learning is not currently available in the partner countries. \r\n\r\nThe partners will share each of their expertise on design and implementation of social farm training; identify and use real life best practice case studies of social farms across the partnership to encompass the different methods, practices, procedures and structures to develop the training and professionalism of farmers delivering social farm services.\r\n\r\nThe training will be delivered to over 300 trainees who will be involved in the testing of the training materials from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe SoEngage training will be available in the 5 languages of the partners (English, German, Polish, Spanish and Romanian) and available as an OER which can be shared across the EU where Social Farming is less developed. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the development of these new technologies with easily accessible onlne and digital platforms the training can be easily shared across Europe to engage and upskill farmers in social farming. This will benefit farmers through the entrepreneurial opportunity it provides them, the people who avail of social farm services by providing more professional services and the wider rural community through the social, economic and cultural sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe partners are grateful to the European Union through Erasmus+ funding for the opportunity to engage farmers with social farming.", "http://www.eurolink-eu.net", "The Rural Centre", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047975_coordinator"], [2016, "\"EuroYouth MEDIALAB\" : a new european approach 2.0 for an inclusive youth citizenship strategy.", "The Rural Centre", 140009.0, 10, 10, "\"Euro Youth MEDIALAB\" defines a new inclusive strategy and approach, to give youth required knowledges, wich will allow all of them to be and act as active citizens. This strategy is modeled in order to be used by any organisation working in the field of youth. It can be used, totally or partially, thank's to the european virtual exchanges platform we will create. To reach that result, we have established a transnational  and multidisciplinary project team composed by 10 organisations including 5 associations, 3 local/regional authorities, 1 university and 1 regional innovation center coming from France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Northern Irland, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Poland. It allows us to verify wether the strategy is usable in any member state, by any kind of organisation working in the field of education, training or youth work. Working in rural areas, as well as largest cities, providing their services in  religious conflicts areas as well as regions where youth unemployment is over 55 % , partners members decided to join their skills, expertises and knowledges to develop this new strategy.The project proposes each partner to constitute Local Group which will represent 150 young people working in teams characterized by its variety. The proposed strategy is to be used to constitute Local groups, to animate it and to achieve the expected results and products.  This strategy is built on a european approach (propose the Local group a virtual exchange with others european young people) and on the use of multimedia reports (photo, video, radio, numerical) to lead young people to : - be aware of the missing knowledges to become active citizen - produce themself needed knowledges by using a large variety of local actors from educational, political, economical, mediatical fields interviewing them - spread and share these knowledges with other young people through the multimedia reports produced- raise public awareness in the EU member states on a common issue (migrants in EU)- impact their society. The strategy gives youth workers, political  decisions makers, teachers, trainers and organisations involved, new approach, methodology and skills to reach all youth in an inclusive way, to develop new transsectorial approach aimed at giving required knowledges to their target group in the field of citizenship. The european virtual exchange platform is a tool to organize virtual exchanges between young people and to animate the common debate on migrants in the EU.It also gives the opportunity to any kind of organisation to : -  register a local group and applying all or parts of the strategy ;- identify potential partners to organize virtual or real youth exchanges;- use multimedia reports realized by local groups as pedagogical tool to work with its target-group ;- propose a transnational debate on an actually european common issue between youth in order to foster common shared values ;- work in the framework of transsectorial partnerships The project is realized by the transnational project team who will organize three transnational meetings and various virtual classrooms which will allow them to adopt a real quality approach built on common :- planification,- realization,- evaluation,- adaptation. A great advantage of the project is that  all its members are part of  the europe direct's network. That will guarantee a large spreading of its results and products among all european regions. Local and national dissemination events are organised and launch the opportunity, for any organisation working in the field of youth, to own the strategy using the methodological guide and the european virtual platform.

A european mobility experience represents, for youth :- acquire new competencies, - new languages, - enhance active european citizenship. In order to reach these results, the partnership proposes two activities.A first level of partnership, including 5 NGO  (France, Spain, Sweeden, Bulgaria, Northern-Irland), proposes 4 youth exchanges in France, Sweeden, Spain and Bulgaria.  More than 150 young people, aged from 13 to 25, with less opportunity, will take part to an international youth exchange with the thematic of \"Migrants in Europe\". The 5 groups leaders, in each exchange, are using methods coming from the non formal education, using video-reports ; debates, workshops, games, visits, participating in local public events  which will provide participants new skills, competencies and habilities. Video-reports they will have to do in the dedicated workshops will give them a tool to act and will sensibilize the population to the question of migrants in Europe. The activity \"I will change the world\" will help to develop their social, political and economical creativity. On the basis of their willing, youth-leaders will provide them information about all the european programs, linked to european citizenship,  which will help them to concretise their ideas after the exchange. A second level of partnership, including the same french and spanish partners and a second northern-irish, bulgarian and sweedish partner, works on EVS. French partner will host 4 young rural EVS coming from these partner's organisations and benefits from them.For the partner's organisations it is the opportunity to add a new offer for their youth which do not have easy access to mobility. It's also a new opportunity of local and transnational partnership. For volunteers it's an enriching personal, professional and linguistic experience. Volunteers will participate to the local and european social-educational activities developped by the host organisation using video-reports. They also will have to develop, among local population, desire to learn new foreign languages. They will have to produce a weekly radio chronicle dedicated to mobility, foreign languages, ERASMUS program in order to reach youth with less opportunity. For each activity, the partnership proposes a lot of activities dedicated to identify new skills and competencies acquired during the exchange/EVS. Youthpass, CV Europass, Language Passeport will be used and promoted. A public event will be organised to deliver these documents to participants.

With the emergence of innovative social enterprise models, now more than ever entrepreneurship programmes can empower young people to generate positive impact at individual and community level. \r\n\r\nHowever, while enterprise centres and VET institutions struggle to engage with young people, tens of thousands participate voluntarily in youth group activities, especially in the creative, performing and digital arts, presenting a clear opportunity to widen the impact of entrepreneurship education.  The problem?  The majority of youth workers, lack the knowledge, skills and confidence to teach entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nYEA has been carefully structured to find new ways to integrate high quality entrepreneurship education into existing youth services and structures by training youth workers. To achieve this we will: \r\na. Establish 4 Youth Entrepreneurship through Arts REGIONAL ALLIANCES, bringing together key youth, enterprise, and social policy stakeholders to explore best practice in integrating entrepreneurship education into creative arts youth work, devising individual and collective commitments to action in a YEA ACTION PLAN; \r\nb. Create, publish and promote the \u201cYouth Entrepreneurship through Arts Tool kit\u201d to encourage the creation of further Alliances across Europe.\r\nc. Develop and publish a course curriculum and learning materials to train youth workers to effectively engage the young people they work with in entrepreneurship education. \r\nd. Test, publish and strongly promote the course, to facilitate its inclusion in mainstream youth work provision.\r\n\r\nYEA will be delivered by six organizations from UK, Ireland, France and Malta with a strong cross-sector focus. \r\n1. Dungannon Enterprise Centre, the principal supplier of entrepreneurship education and training in South Tyrone, Northern Ireland.\r\n2. RIDC a hub organization working for community development and responsible for youth work services in Roscommon, Ireland. \r\n3. Beam Creative Network, a youth work organization engaging over 100,000 young people in arts and drama programme, exploring issues such as diversity, cultural identity and conflict resolution. \r\n4. Momentum, an accredited enterprise training centre with a specialization in online and blended learning.\r\n5. Musique de Nuit Diffusion a cultural centre in Bordeaux working with disadvantaged youth.\r\n6. Vismednet, a Maltese youth work organization whose programmes emphasise the validation of informal and nonformal learning. \r\n\r\nYEA represents a new generation of project that treats entrepreneurship as a transversal skill and a mind set which empowers young people to recognise and solve problems, create value and design sustainable initiatives. Such an approach can be used in any field the young people chooses to apply it to, creating innovation in private or public sectors, at individual or community level.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project: \r\n- hundreds of young people (18 \u2013 30 yr olds) will strengthen their entrepreneurial mindset and acquire concrete entrepreneurial skills, manifested in the development of a proposal for a cultural project or creative initiative which is innovative, sustainable and ready to attract funding. \r\n- Enterprise providers will find new ways of engaging with hard-to-reach young people, often from disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\n- Youth work and Creative Arts organizations will acquire key skills to integrate entrepreneurship mindset and skills as part of their services. \r\n- Communities will experience increase in social and knowledge capital, with young people more empowered as leaders of change in general, especially those who go on to successfully implement their cultural project. \r\n- Stakeholders in the region will understand and actively support integrated approach to ensuring high quality entrepreneurship education for more and more young people.", "http://www.beamcreativenetwork.com", "Dungannon Enterprise Centre", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA205-013994_5"]]}}}}
