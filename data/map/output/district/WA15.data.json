The teaching of languages is already a priority for our school but we wish to use this project to develop and improve our provision further.\r\n\r\nWe want to improve our staffs confidence and competence in the Spanish language and knowledge of  Spanish culture. We also want them to have access to new and innovative teaching methods. This will then lead to an improvement in our own teaching and also in our ability to support training teachers and the schools that we work with in our training school capacity. We want to ensure that we have an exemplary learning environment and high quality, authentic and up-to-date resources that will engage and motivate our pupils and also act as an example for other schools.\r\n\r\nWe will develop links with the school in Spain as part of this project. This will allow us to share good practice with Spanish teachers and develop positive working relationships and friendships that will then lead to great benefits for both schools. We will develop joint curriculum projects as a result of forming these links which will bring language learning to life for our pupils and give them a clear context and motivation to learn. In particular, we wish to develop a large-scale curriculum project involving our school, our Spanish link school and special schools in Spain and the UK. \r\n\r\nWe will embed languages across the life of our school and into our daily routines. We will also greatly increase our cross curricular links which will lead to reinforcement of learning and better attainment. \r\n\r\nWe plan to take part in immersion training courses in Spain over the course of two years. We would like to involve six members of staff from across our school in these courses. (We plan to include teaching and support staff, senior managers and a business manager.)\r\n\r\nThe courses involve intensive language learning through native speaker teachers, methodology, and culture sessions. There will be  opportunities to discuss important issues relating to language learning and all participants will be placed in a Spanish school given the opportunity to develop strong links and take time to discuss joint curriculum projects with Spanish colleagues.\r\n\r\nTaking part in this intensive training will mean that members of staff will have the language skills, cultural knowledge and understanding of methodology necessary to allow them to provide a good model to trainee teachers and staff from other schools. \r\nThe impact on the individual participants will include the development of their confidence in speaking Spanish which will enable them to deliver more effective Spanish lessons. \r\n\r\nThe impact on the school will include an improvement in the level of our pupils\u2019 Spanish, a curriculum enriched with more international links, heightened intercultural understanding in the school setting and the profile of writing in FL developed through email links. \r\n\r\nImpact on our pupils will include more enjoyment of their language learning and more positive attitudes towards languages and other cultures. We want our pupils to have an extremely positive experience of languages in our school leading them to want to continue to learn languages in the future and to increase their career aspirations and consider the options of living and working in other countries.", "http://www.elmridge.trafford.sch.uk", "Elmridge Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013046_coordinator"]]}}, "6BZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Developing Primary Language Teaching and Learning", "Heyes Lane Primary School", 9304.0, 1, 1, "Heyes Lane Primary School is a much larger than average community school in Trafford.  Pupils come to the school from a varied catchment area and the school has very good results at KS2 SATS.  The school was graded 'good' in 2013 by Ofsted and our school development plan reflects the shared aim of achieving an 'outstanding' grading by our next inspection.  Staff are constantly encouraged to develop their skills and teaching practice, including through transferring to teach in different year groups and key stages. \r\n\r\nFrench has been taught at Heyes Lane in KS2 for a number of years, using a programme of study designed exclusively for the school by the form MFL Coordinator.  Last year, French was introduced to KS1 children and this year extended to EYFS.  \r\n\r\nAs language teaching at primary school level will become compulsory from September 2014, the MFL Coordinators have recently conducted an audit of staff skills and confidence in French teaching.  It was apparent that confidence amongst many staff, both in their own French language skills needed to deliver the curriculum, and  was low and therefore not in line with our school aim of delivering 'outstanding' teaching and learning across all curriculum subjects.  A need of developing assessment procedures and monitoring progress in line with curriculum requirements was also identified. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Heyes Lane was linked successfully to a primary school in the French village of Gillette; however, due to staff issues in the French school, this link has not been maintained this year.  The MFL team have agreed with Senior Leadership the enormous benefits for children's learning, of building a meaningful link with a French partner school and this March, one member of staff is visiting a school near Toulouse with the aim of setting up a long-term link.  Such a link would provide a real context for children's language learning, as they communicate with French pupils their own age.  It would also increase intercultural understanding and open the children's eyes to future opportunities overseas.   \r\n\r\nFollowing discussion with Senior Leadership regarding the results of this audit, it was agreed that French CPD training would be beneficial.  The primary aims of the CPD would be to:\r\na) upskill staff in French language skills as required to teach by the National Curriculum\r\nb) increase staff's knowledge of language teaching methodologies\r\nIt was decided that immersion training in France would be the most beneficial for participants as this would maximise language learning opportunities as well as building on their intercultural understanding which could then be shared with pupils.  Staff attending training in term-time would also be able to visit the partner school to sustain and develop the link set up by our colleague. \r\n\r\nSix members of staff motivated to attend French CPD in France have been identified.    These staff all wish to improve/update their knowledge of language-specific teaching methodologies and their own French language skills.  The staff are of varied age and teaching experience.  All staff are motivated by the importance of providing context for learning by sustaining a useful partner school link. \r\n\r\nFollowing discussion with other schools in Trafford and our own research,  we have identified a number of course providers  that would meet our school's needs.  We would like to send participants on week long immersion courses offering tuition in the French language as well as language teaching methodology and curriculum policy.  Courses are available on a variety of dates, in holiday time as well as term-time, in order to minimise disruption to children's lessons from use of supply teachers during staff CPD. \r\n\r\nParticipants will attend these immersion courses over a two year period, beginning this August. On return to school, they will provide written reports of their learning and experiences to be made available to all staff.  They will present key learning points from their training in staff meetings and offer opportunities to other staff for team teaching of French, or observation by peers. Participants will then work with the MFL team to update the Heyes Lane French planning to ensure it meets the needs of the 2014 curriculum.  This will include the establishment of a 'Language Ladder' to be used across the school for assessment of pupil progress in line with curriculum objectives.\r\n\r\nPupils' language skills, confidence and enjoyment will be audited annually, beginning pre-project, in order to determine the impact of this training abroad and its dissemination to other staff.  Pupils will also be asked to comment on their intercultural understanding of the French speaking world and this information will be compared to see if the training has impacted on attitudes and openness to the wider world.", "http://www.heyeslane.co.uk", "Heyes Lane Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000148_coordinator"]]}}, "6QF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1243814400000, 1391126400000, "Clean European Rail - Diesel", "The Engine Consultancy Limited", "The study of CER, UNIFE, UIC and Euromot of the railway and engine manufacturing industries concluded on a risk of disruptive effect of the NRMM Directive application on the railway diesel vehicle supply market, leading to a possible risk of a partial modal shift from rail to road on regional passenger lines and freight transportation specialized routes, with even foreseeable consequences on the operations of the main electrified system.

In the UK, provision of language learning is now compulsory at a primary school level, and that, linked with a growing need to teach areas of respect and diversity have led the school to focus on improving these provisions.\r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of the project is to improve the confidence, engagement and attainment of French language and cultural learning at the school. To achieve these goals the school wishes to send, over the course of 2 years, 3 teachers to take part in a French language and cultural immersion course in Carcassonne, France. The participants will be teachers at the school who have applied and successfully explained why they feel that the course will have a positive impact upon their teaching of French and the learning of the children in their class and the school overall.\r\n\r\nThe course has three main areas. Firstly, participants will be provided with high quality language lessons delivered by native speakers, who are experience in teaching French as a foreign language. Secondly, participants will be taught about new ways of teaching French to the children. These sessions will show how to cater for all learning styles to ensure age-appropriate, quality teaching of listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will also learn other skills such as how to incorporate language and cultural learning into other subjects. The final area is the cultural aspect. This part will develop participants' confidence and knowledge of Intercultural Understanding. To do this the course has a range of carefully selected activities and visits which will encourage participants to learn about the region and practice the language they have been learning with local people in real-life situations.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be given learning goals to help achieve the overall goals of the project. The main focus of achieving the goals is through the cascade of learning applied through training opportunities and staff meetings. Participants will be charged with passing on the skills, ideas and resources they have gained on the course to other members of staff in the school as well as other schools in our local cluster. Participants will also make sure that the new skills will be enacted and applied to their French lessons and planning. \r\n\r\nThe school envisages that over the course of the 2 year project there will be an increase in the confidence and engagement levels in language learning of the participants and their classes. The school also envisages that there will be some increase in attainment in French, especially in the intercultural aspects of learning. Finally, the school expects that there will be an increase in the overall 'buzz' around French language and cultural understanding in the school.\r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefits of the courses will be greater engagement and enjoyment in French learning across the school, higher levels of attainment among teachers and children especially in writing and increased confidence in the planning and delivery of French.", "http://www.broomwoodprimary.co.uk", "Broomwood Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012910_coordinator"]]}}, "8EY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Introducing French to KS1 Children", "St. Vincent's Catholic Primary School", 25923.0, 1, 1, "St Vincent\u2019s Catholic Primary School is much larger than the average sized primary school.

All 6 participants will do this in year 1 and then they will all take part in a follow-on course in year 2 of the project.  The two courses will be progressive. The second will build on all the different aspects of learning of the first and will also be activities in between to ensure continuous learning and rapid progression.\r\n\r\nOur courses will take place in Rouen in France and focus on improving language skills (differentiated according to level), cultural awareness and knowledge of language teaching methodology.

They discover new strategies for increasing the use of spontaneous language and will discover high quality, authentic resources that they can use with pupils.Learning will be spread to primary schools within our cluster and we will have a better understanding of the requirements for teaching languages at KS2, of appropriate methods and materials for this age group, and greater understanding of issues relating to transition. Participants from other departments will develop the skills to modernise and internationalise their teaching, relationships with staff and pupils in the partner schools, and an increase in their interpersonal skills, communication skills and openness to new situations and environments. Our pupils will have a better understanding of why language learning is important and relevant to them, enthusiasm and better intercultural knowledge and more awareness of the future career choices available to them.
