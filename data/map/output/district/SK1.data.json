Since the September 11th terrorism attacks in the United States, catering services through-out the world have been seen as the weakest link in the aviation industry\u2019s service supply chain. Existing sealing technologies are time consuming, ineffective and require a complex paper trail. A reusable and retro-fit, electronic sealing device is therefore required with an ultra-low profile. This new technology will enable the automatic sealing and inspections of galley trolleys, while improving their security by utilising a digital, anti-tamper volumetric sensor. With an initial market value of \u20ac120million retrofitting the technology and an additional \u20ac24milion per year in new trolleys, this market has the potential of significant economic returns. Beyond the catering industry this technology will enable international logistics services and all of the SMEs operating within a secure supply chain to seal their vehicles and reduce their operating costs. Supported by a location dependant (Galileo) tag interrogator and central ICT database, a pair of smart tags will be used to seal and monitor unauthorised access to a trolley, based on a received signal strength indication technology. Upon an authorised activation, the novel security seal will transmit its location and a randomly generated locking number to a central database, using a mobile GPRS communication link in the tag interrogator. By cross-referencing the tag and database values using a standard RFID reader, a security official may ensure that a seal has not been tampered with or replaced. A multi-lingual and bi-colour passive RF display will be installed onto each door of the trolley, for a visual indication of the seal status. Alternatively a RFID reader may be used for an automatic, long range inspection.", 434548.0, 1139572.0, 5, 7, "AIR-SEAL", null, "http://www.maplefleetservices.co.uk", null, "fp7_107791_997831047"], [1317427200000, 1380499200000, "Second Generation Unit Load Device to improve the Security and Efficiency of the Aerospace Logistics Industry", "Maple Fleet Services Ltd", "The SAFEGUARD project presents a new technology to improve the security and efficiency of air cargo through the research and development of a second generation Unit Load Device (ULD). With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements.

Thus, a large variety of different multilayered surface systems (MSSs) with thickness ranging from nanometer to millimetre scales have been developed. However, the design of multilayered surfaces is normally based on experience and no currently available surface modelling technique can deal with MSSs.   The aim of this programme is to address an urgent scientific, technological and market need for consistently reliable high performance MSSs, by developing generic, robust multiscale materials and process modelling techniques for the design, optimisation and performance prediction of MSSs. The S&T objectives are: (1) to develop molecular dynamics techniques to model atom deposition processes and the atomic structure and  interfaces to achieve optimal coating microstructures; (2) to develop multiscale modelling and corresponding experimental techniques to determine nano and crystal behaviour of each layer of a surface coating and the macro behaviour of MSSs; (3) to develop an integrated multiscale modelling approach to link molecular dynamics (nano), crystal plasticity (micro) and continuum mechanics (macro) modelling activities for the applications; (4) to develop modelling techniques and software systems for design, processes and applications of multiscale MSS and (5) to develop modelling-based design methodology for optimised MSSs for high performance components aiming for improved lifetimes and reduced market lead time by 60%.

The first is to establish and validate a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) process in the participating countries. The second is to use that process to identify new technologies and services to address the challenge of Supporting the Independent living of the Elderly through Robotics.<br/>By the completion of this project there will be a fully documented PCP process, capable of being run as a joint cross-border PCP call for tender with the participating countries. Together with this process there will be supporting artefacts, such as application forms and document templates, which can be used by procurers wishing to run a PCP call. Additionally, the awareness and procurement competencies of local, regional and national public/private purchasers in the field of elderly care and of public authorities running research activities will have been upgraded.<br/>For addressing the independent living of the elderly a number of pilot research and development projects will be executed to develop innovative new solutions and technologies. These projects, identified through an open call using the PCP process, will run through a  3 phased life-cycle. This life-cycle will start with short feasibility studies to allow selected highly innovative ideas to be tested in a controlled way to mitigate the inherent risk that innovation brings. Those ideas that prove their viability will then go through a further selection process. The most promising projects will then be selected to develop prototypes and the most promising of those further again into small scale test series of first end-products and thus accelerate their route to commercialisation.<br/>By involving purchasers of care services for the elderly as partners within the SILVER project, we will provide these R&D pilots with intelligent lead customers able to assess and shape the solutions.

The project will take place between 1st September 2016 and 31st October 2018 and is aimed at representatives of local education centres, i.e. at the directors of these institutions and the teaching staff who give lessons to groups of learners aged 60+. The consortium has been structured to ensure that various local education facilities with a range of main strengths and focuses are involved as well as trans-regionally active associations.    The objective of Silver Learners is to improve the programme offered by education centres, taking into account the challenges of demographic change as well as the associated altered circumstances and education practices of senior citizens. The older generation needs to be provided with educational support to enable them to remain active members of society and face the challenges of growing old independently for as long as possible. In this context, the fields of media competence (using ICT and new technical resources) and health are regarded as being particularly significant.  In addition, it is essential to reach poorly educated target groups. Elderly people with a migration background, for instance, rarely attend education institutions.It is planned to communicate tried-and-tested education models from the various countries for improving the learning situation of the elderly and also to jointly develop and implement ideas and concepts. New, innovative educational concepts for the older generation are to be developed on the basis of the different experiences. Since, at present, the adult education centres are primarily attended by the so-called middle classes, the current objective is to focus on persons who have had fewer educational opportunities, including those with a migrant background.  This will entail analysing the motivation for learning as well as the options and the existing barriers to education. The project comprises six meetings of the project partners. The time between these meetings will be used for processing the results and disseminating and applying them locally as well as for preparing the next convention. The meetings of the partners are to be organised as workshops made up of presentations, dialogues in varying work groups, and excursions. The following issues are regarded as particularly crucial:- Competencies and learning abilities of the elderly and the consequent requirements on educational programmes;- Communication for and with senior citizens - How can the target groups be reached, in particular those that are not so well educated? How can the communication skills of older people be intensified (use of ICT, social networks, language, etc.)?- Further education for everyday life \u2013 How can the older generation be supported in their ICT-influenced daily lives (using a PC, online banking/shopping/booking)? How can new tools be made appropriate for elderly people?- Further education on health \u2013 Besides keeping healthy (sport, prevention) and new technical aids, this focuses mainly on dealing with age-related diseases such as dementia. The venues and thematic focuses of the meetings have been selected so as to ensure that the partners can best introduce their strengths into the discussion. Meetings are to be held in Iserlohn, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, Luxembourg, Bunnik, Stockport and Chorz\u00f3w. The first event will be organised as an introductory kick-off meeting. Then, after four content-related workshops, there will be a summarising wrap-up meeting at which future, more extensive, cooperative ventures are to be planned.Besides the specified aims, teaching staff will benefit from the project because their skills will be upgraded, especially regarding the interests of the elderly during lessons, the effective use of ICT, and the inclusion of health aspects. This will enable education centres to improve and expand what they offer and thus for attendees to commit to the institution.   Working together with familiar partners (town twinning, successful partnerships in other EU projects) will reinforce the networks and enable them to be redefined with the help of new partners. The project partners get to know other countries, embark on intercultural dialogues and expand their knowledge, including their linguistic skills. The project will be beneficial to society in Europe as well: well-educated, committed and health-conscious senior citizens face the effects accompanying age with greater confidence. In consequence, the growing generation of elderly people will be encouraged to play an active role in society. Thanks to the joint work of ten partners, the results of the project will be disseminated in numerous different regions and countries of Europe, thus making a major contribution towards added value in Europe.", "http://www.stockport.gov.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA204-003327_5"]]}}}}
