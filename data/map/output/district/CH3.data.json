The above mentioned institution, where students will take their practice, is engaged in vocational training in the construction industry in the broad meaning of the term, including  the area of landscape architecture. It has the most recent machinery, equipment, computer programs and workstations currently used to study the profession of landscape architecture technician .\r\nPreparation of the practice results from the need to enhance professional competence of future landscape architects , due to the booming job market in this field.\r\nOne of the projects's main assumptions is enabling participants to master skills and knowledge most desired in the labor market in the field of road design based on concrete and natural stone paving in the historic and modern landscape architecture . Additionally, the participants will become familiar with new computer programs and technical devices used in architecture. They will enhance practical skills involved in making measurements with use of modern surveyor equipment, including devices using laser techniques, establishment of roads and paths in gardens and parks, fitting the paving stone, designing sites using decorative pavement. In the course of performance of practical tasks, which will take as much as 80 % of the whole time they will learn flexibility in finding solutions to architectural issues and challenges emerging-to-date as well as master the skills of decision-making regarding the use of optimal work techniques.\r\nThe project aims at multi-dimensional development of students. Apart from developing practical competences they will have the opportunity to compare technologies and tools used in the British landscape architecture, which stands on a very high level in many areas and is perceived as trend-setter and is used as a reference to solutions used in Poland. Students will also explores the UK labor market and its needs in the field of landscape architecture.\r\nThanks to common activities with British students participants will not only broaden  professional vocabulary in English (which will greatly facilitate their subsequent professional contacts with employers, customers, contractors), but also will develop their language in everyday communication situations. All of these experiences will be ready to use in their further education and career.\r\nAcquired skills will be confirmed by certificates, which will also constitute additional advantage of participant in their search for jobs on the international labor market.\r\nWe have planned extensive promotion of the project in the region, including  publications in the local media and on the website of our school. Students participating in the project will exchange their experiences with other students of our school during the special workshops in the course of the project's summary as well as with students and teachers of other schools and other institutions of the same profile.
