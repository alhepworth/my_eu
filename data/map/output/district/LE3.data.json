This project aims to bring young people together from the UK, Finland, Hungary, Malta, Italy and Spain to ensure representation from across North, Central and Southern Europe. The purpose is to imbue them with an awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity and to equip them with transferable skills that will both enhance their employability and build their self confidence. the project will take place, following an APV, at a campsite near Bristol. The 60 young people (50% male and 50% female) and 12 leaders will be accommodated in single-sex bunk houses in mixed international groups. Food will be provided by outside caterers, hopefully the British Army from Chepstow Barracks. After initial values assessments, some gleaned prior to the APV, participants will be engaged, on a daily basis, in a series of interactive workshops on the theme of celebrating cultural diversity or anti-racism. These workshops will be led by international leaders and it is envisaged that they will include drama, dance, music, capoeira, journalism, IT, film-making and photography. The idea is that these workshops will culminate in performances at the end of the project. There will also be afternoon workshops provided by external agencies such as, the Red Cross, Oxfam, De Montfort University and Amnesty International. These should feed into the morning workshops and participants will be expected to draw on this learning experience for their performance.

One of our aims is to help youngsters to defeat gender stereotypes by implementing creative activities. We want to develop the competence of entrepreneurship of young people by youth work. We keep it important to guide them to preserve mental health.\r\nThe project will be a multilateral exchange involving young people aged 15 to 23. There will be up to 6 young people and 1 leader from each country (altogether 42 persons). There should be equal numbers of males and females in each participant group. The countries to be involved shall be: Italy, Spain, Malta, Croatia, the UK and Hungary.\r\nEach group leader from each country will supervise and run a workshop around the theme of beauty in the media, cult of beauty, self-confidence, social expectations, consequences, etc. Participants will be mixed in groups and test each workshop. They will then choose which workshop to be in. This will culminate in a film, a street art exhibition and instant newspaper from the project by the participants at the end of the programme. \r\nAfternoons will consist of interactive presentations about their beauty ideals in culture and media by each country. One afternoon we talk about addictions and influences by an expert (drug and rock history).\r\nEvenings will consist of film shows and after that we will have discussions. \r\nDuring dissemination activities lots of people will know the results of our project.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-3-HU02-KA105-000600_5"]]}}, "9QP": {"nhs": {"data": [["RWE", "Glenfield Hospital", "nhs_RWEAE"]]}}}}
