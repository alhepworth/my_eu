Virtually all commercial, infrastructure, and scientific satellites carry one or more tanks, for fuel, oxidiser, or coolant. There is no in-orbit method of accurate establishing fluid reserve mass in a tank. Book-keeping methods are employed to track fuel usage, with ever- increasing error, and conservative margins are applied to ensure reserves for end-of-life disposal compliance. Further, fluid slosh presents a challenging control problem - reducing pointing accuracy and introducing potential resonances that threaten platform safety.\n\nAtout Process Ltd. (\u2018Atout\u2019) is a European SME founded in 2010 to develop innovative products based on non-intrusive electromagnetic imaging and measurement techniques. Atout has commercialised a novel monitoring system for the oil and gas, power generation, food and drink and other industries.\n\nThis project will establish the commercial potential for spin-in to the space sector of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) for accurate real-time measurement of fuel mass and slosh torque vector. A proof-of-concept demonstrator project has already been completed, and a further refinement to TRL6 is nearing completion.\n\nOur industry discussions and analysis to date suggest a strong potential for the technology to extend mission lifetime and improve attitude and orbit control efficiency, yielding a major impact on spacecraft performance.

Instead, we use a large amount of data logged by vessels carrying out their normal business, and later uploaded to our server for processing. By using a large amount of data, the errors from using less accurate instruments can be remoed. We believe this can be developed to provide a cost effective system that will enable much of the shortfall in surveys to be made up.\nThe benefits of this are safer navigation to all vessels in coastal waters, in particular to the leisure, fishing and workboat sectors, and also greater information for the GIS community, coastal engineers, port, harbour and waterway authorities, and applications such as tide power or offshore wind farms.\nThe system will use GPS receivers equipped with EGNOS to provide the required level of positional accuracy, and will use statistical techniques to remove errors from depth measurements from echo sounders that cannot otherwise be resolved.\nThe data logged will be available both as survey data and as chart data.

The youth participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe,  Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\n\r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is the beginning of a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people through creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of non formal learning, combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists.  There are 56 participants in total from a range of youth centres and youth theatre groups, 32 of whom are socially disadvantaged young people with 9  less-abled young artists.  Together we will also explore a 5 year plan of youth activities.  OC is delighted to welcome its first Romanian partner. This is highly significant for OC as in 1995 the company was invited to tour Romania with the British Council.  \"Shameless\" their current music theatre production, directed by David Glass, was a great success in Bucharest, Cluj, Brasov and other cities in Romania.  More importantly the OC artists gained immense respect for Romanian artists and their culture and at the time said that it was in Romania that they grew up as artists.  With Romania becoming a full member of the EU, whose people can now travel freely, it is important that we can contribute to the spread of knowledge, culture and history that surrounds this beautiful country, helping to combat the current spread of  racism connected with their people.  Our programme partners in Serbia and Bosnia have also taught us about their countries and we have learned a great deal from our active engagement with their cultures since 2004.  Cultural awareness, tolerance, inclusiveness, deeper learning, understanding of the other, is at the heart of this creative process.  \r\n\r\nThe activities in this project include:\r\nWays of creating change through culture and the arts- democracy and the global citizen\r\nThe use of music and the creative arts to develop understanding and tolerance through cultural awareness\r\nRespect for the environment and public space\r\nBuilding confidence and the development of  youth leadership skills\r\nRacial and ethnic tolerance\r\nInclusion - understanding of difference - disabilities, gender, race, class, wealth/poverty\r\nGive and Gain - what you get out of life if you give\r\nPartnership development\r\nAlternative methods of finding employment, a new society - skills development, cultural activities - creating the social entrepreneur?\r\n\r\nMany highly regarded cultural commentators have written about the importance of culture to us as  human beings, \r\nFrancois Materasso, \"To put it simply, culture is the expression of human values\" \r\nhttp://www.missionmodelsmoney.org.uk/sites/default/files/24446185-Many-Voices-by-Francois-Matarasso-2006_0.pdf\r\n\r\nComment from a young Bosnian participant in a previous Opera Circus EU Cultural Project:-\r\n\"The project had a profound impact on my life, ideas and thoughts in regard to the future of me individually and my responsibility towards the healing of my society.

More specifically, BOND investigates and addresses the constraints and disincentives, and reaches a higher level of participation of farmers as follows: (i) Draw up solutions and build bonding capital within groups, ensuring cohesiveness and trust among people; (ii) Enable organizations to come closer, building bridging capital to form larger networks, help overcome attitudes and constraints that impede collective action; (iii) Build linking capital, developing ties with entities with different interests and powers, including government, donors, academia, private sector, to reach a stronger position in decision-making, and (iv) Engage multi actors and policy makers throughout these processes.
