It is thought that the UK\u2019s dune area has been reduced to 30 % of that present in 1900, and in England the losses are closer to 50 %. Natural England manages nine National Nature Reserves (covering 954 ha) that have sand dune habitats of European importance. The project takes place across eight Natura 2000 network sites (SACs), which contain a total of 3 412 ha of all seven Habitats Directive Annex 1 sand dune habitat types present in England. The latest UK Article 17 report on the implementation of the Directive states that these habitats are in an overall \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019 conservation status and that this has reached a critical point.

These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. \n\nThe experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=81", "http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk,", "life_72"]]}}, "6JX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "MIRABEEL 3", "Saint Columba's RC Primary School", 248902.0, 7, 10, "This ERASMUS consortium + for the mobility of the staff of the school education  MIRABEEL is carried  by the DAREIC (Academic Delegation in the European, international relations and in the Cooperation) and the GIP (Grouping of Public interest) \" Training(Formation) throughout the life \", of the academy (regional education authority) of Nancy-Metz.
