They will be people, who are characterized by openness, creativeness and who have experience in religious life. The project was prepared for the young Europeans who feel increasingly stronger need to participate in the international dialogue. We have observed that in Europe nowadays, the distance between people of different religions, believes and citizenships is growing. The project is the answer for those people\u2019s needs. The purposes of the project are developing and assisting in establishing an international and interreligious dialogue, European integration, making new acquaintances and getting introduced to and discovering the beauty of other cultures and religions, propagating the idea of international dialogue which is based on respect of the other person or other nation. Equally important for us is deepening our own identity as well as finding and demolishing the common tough untrue stereotypes that we have connected to both Jewish and Muslim religion. The work will be organized in a form of workshops, during which we will be covering various aspects of the figure of Abraham (as he is the one who joins all three monotheistic religions) but also the whole Jewish culture. The following workshops will be touching on fundamental values, that are common for whole humanity: freedom, dignity of human life, friendship, dialogue. The methods which we will use during the workshops will be varied, as we believe in the creativeness of the participants and we want them to show their full potential. The methods will be role playing, working with multimedia materials, talks in smaller groups, brainstorming ideas, field games. The important parts of the project will be the visit to the synagogue or mosque and the discussion with catholic bishop and either the representative of the Jewish or Muslim religion. In the long term effect, the young people participating in the project will be well accustomed to the international and intercultural dialogue which will contribute to spreading the peace among the local communities as well as in the whole Europe. During the project the distance that exists between Christians, Jews and Muslims will be broken and this will increase the participants\u2019 openness and their will of building the future Europe together.

Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill. The project also intends to use the methods and tools for skill and credits recognition through the use of Unit of learning to be capitalized and converted into the school  and / or training credits  by measuring, recognizing, validating the LO through linear and transparent procedures according the indications  of the ECVET.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS80 STUDENTS.

Young people who have obtained  a qualification or diploma within last 12 months  and is connected with the sector of tourism and wellness.The project  will also give the opportunity of participation to disadvantaged persons.ACTIVITIES. Project activities are following:- Project management (divided into 4 main documents, which contain 4 main  aspects of correct project management: Coordination and Control Plan, Plan for Learning and Evaluation, Plan of Management of the Communication,  Dissemination and Valorization)- Preparing for the internship (linguistic, technical, educational, cultural, digital preparation)- Identification and activation of interns (following the selection of participants, the MATCHING of the candidate-company will be held  in collaboration with foreign parties who will evaluate the profiles according to the availability of the enterprises)- Accompanying of the participants under 18 years and disadvantaged persons (mainly by professors of the institutes involved) adequately prepared.- Monitoring during and ex post- Final evaluation (outcomes, project, good practices)METHODOLOGY. The used methodologies are  practices to achieve effective, efficient and repeatable activity.RESULTS AND IMPACT. In general, the project will have the main impact in education and training (VET) sector thanks to: training results  of mobility participants; acquired skill (soft skill, professional skill, personal, cultural and ethical skill); recognition of training credits. The dissemination strategy will support the global objectives and specific project activities, in particular the publication of the project OUTPUT (materials, in particular the video made by the participants), but also the OUTCOMES (results) and OUTREACH (impact).LONG TERM BENEFITS. In the long term, we expect: greater involvement of Italian partners (institutional or non), the extension of the partnership abroad, from territorial and skill point of view; the possibility to carry out exchange projects and cooperation also thanks to the participation in other European programs (as COSME and other instruments that finance the social and wellness tourism etc.); the opportunity to become (as the Consortium) a prestigious partner in mobility management and the adoption of the logic EQAVET  nd of the system of recognition of the credits ECVET.", "http://www.londonplacementacademy.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005267_13"], [2015, "MechMob - Mechanical&Mechatronics Mobility", "London Placement Academy", 268508.0, 8, 32, "Mechanics in Arezzo and Reggio Emilia represents a cross sector for all other major regional production specializations.

The project aims to improve the situation in education and develop an innovative program of training for professionals working with adults with ASD as well as prepare innovative tools and methods of sharing knowledge among this professionals.

The lack of adequate training of functioning in the society excludes these people from social and professional life. The lack of education programs for adults with ASD is directly connected with to the absence of training programs preparing professionals to work with adults with ASD in high education curriculums. During the project all 3 organizations, based on their comprehensive expertise, will collect data and information about good practices in education programs of adults with ASD and education programs of professionals  working with this group of people with disabilities. The next step organizers will develop three programs dedicated for professionals:1. First Step Programme: the basic training program for professionals to work/ cooperate with adults with ASD (2 x 2 days of workshops);2. Step Two Programme: the advanced program of training for professionals working/ cooperating with people with high-functioning autism (HfA).
