Children\u2019s rights will be our nexus. This theme will be adapted to our particular contexts but we also seek to foster peer-to-peer learning in a virtual environment. We will adopt a holistic approach to language teaching and learning building on the diversity found in our classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe objectives pursued by our Erasmus + project are to:\r\n\u00de   develop a transnational collaborative network that allows partners to share and compare pedagogical ideas, practice and methodology.\r\n\u00de   promote skills and competence acquisition, especially social, civic spirit and intercultural competences, in order to develop critical thinking among our students through the research and analysis of Children\u2019s rights.\r\n\u00de   develop peer to peer learning activities, both among students and among teachers through the platform eTwinning.\r\n\u00de   generate emotional, social and compensatory strategies to improve language competence through the building of emotionally healthy classroom environments\r\n\u00de   reinforce our professional profile through joint training activities addressed at two main aspects: differentiated education and collaborative and innovative classroom performances.\r\n\u00de   make access, participation and learning success possible, especially for underachieving students in order to reduce learning results disparity by supporting our work on the motivation that collaborative and innovative methodologies provide.\r\n\u00de   reinforce collaboration among member of our education communities aiming at better involving families in their children\u2019s learning process.\r\n\u00de   enhance both learning and teaching processes assessment.\r\n\u00de  get to know other countries, in order to broaden our minds and to increase respect for other cultures and their costumes. \r\n\r\nThe partnership consist of five schools from Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Spain and United Kingdom. The project coordinators got to know each other via eTwinning platform. \r\nThe schools in this partnership share enthusiasm and commitment to education. They seek their students' school success by adapting to each particular context and through different strategies.  \r\nWe aim to achieve our objectives by the fulfillment of different activities: transnational meetings to manage and evaluate the project, training workshops to share and contrast practices and methods and virtual cooperation and local project activities in order to reach as many participants as possible (students, teachers, families and other stakeholders). Progress and results will be promoted and disseminated so our schools communities are witnesses of the project.\r\nRegarding the methodology to be used carrying out this project, we keep in mind the idea that no child can learn about children's rights in an environment that does not itself respect and promote a culture of children rights. To accomplish this, our schools must, at least:\r\n \r\n- deal with the conflicts that inevitably arise among children in a manner that emphasizes everyone\u2019s right to participation and to - express an opinion, as well as everyone\u2019s responsibility for the welfare and harmony of the group, engaging children in actively resolving conflicts.\r\n- Practise the non-discriminatory attitudes we want our children to learn. \r\n\r\nFor the activities with the students, we will use the methodology of experiential learning because it permits children to develop and change knowledge, skills, attitudes and values in a safe environment that is both challenging and fun. Because it validates the child\u2019s experience and encourages children to take responsibility for their own learning, experiential learning enhances participation, self-reliance and self-confidence. \r\nThe activities of our project are based on a learning cycle with five phases: experiencing, reporting, reflecting, generalising and applying.\r\nWe will adapt the activities to the different learning and thinking styles of our students, as well as their development levels, and we will promote that our pupils use learning strategies to improve their level of knowledge and their confidence. These strategies imply memory,  cognitive, compensatory, metacognitive, affective and social processes.\r\n\r\nThe partnership expect the project to have an impact upon students, teachers and school communities by improving learning environments, promoting sustainable peaceful resolution of conflicts, implementing new teaching methodologies based on teamwork and lifelong learning and fostering intercultural awareness and European citizenship feeling.", "http://www.bishop-loveday.oxon.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA219-038177_1"]]}}, "4PE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Teacher language improvement and modernisation of the MFL teaching methods and approaches with the aim of creating authentic and stimulating learning environments at Bloxham school.", "Bloxham School", 22791.0, 1, 1, "x", "http://www.bloxhamschool.com", "Bloxham School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035870_coordinator"]]}}, "5JS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Combating under-achievement in Reading and Numeracy basic skills through the team-teaching of entrepreneurial skills", "Hook Norton C of E Primary School", 46842.0, 2, 2, "Our project 'Combating under-achievement in Reading, Number and literacy basic skills through team-teaching of entrepreneurial activities' or 'Cre8' is designed to tackle the problem of under-achievement in the basic skills in literacy and numeracy in both schools. This issue was highlighted for Hook Norton Primary School in their latest Ofsted report and the staff at V\u00e4stra Parkskolan are struggling to tackle the problem in their school too. The project will directly include around 20 teachers and 520 children from the ages of 4-12 years. The classes from both schools will work together to tackle the issues they face surrounding the basic skills in literacy and numeracy and the progress of their most and least able children.The project aims to tackle under-achievement in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy through a series of enterprise activities with teachers and children across phase. Teachers will work together to plan activities for children which in most cases they will teach in their separate schools and in some cases they will teach together during a student exchange. The teachers can discuss the issues faced in basic maths and literacy skills in their individual classes during the project meetings and design an activity which will not only teach these basic skills but also give the children the opportunity to apply them in a real life setting. The children's motivation will be increased as they will have the opportunity to put their skills into practice in a practical situation where their main objective is to make money through their project designs. They will face problems which they will need to overcome, be given the opportunity to make decisions for themselves and have to work together to make their designs work. The teachers and children can share their progress with their partners using our online platform or Skype, thus enhancing their communication and literacy skills. For each activity the children will have to write instructions on how to make their product, calculate expenditure and profit margins, market and try to sell their products. All groups of children will be included with a focus on underachievers and most and least able children who should all be challenged sufficiently to help them to achieve their potentials.During the planning of these activities we feel that it is of paramount importance that teachers should spend time observing outstanding practices. The staff from Hook Norton Primary School are keen to spend time with some of the specialist teachers in V\u00e4stra Parkskolan. They are interested in how they could use the expertise of the Maths, literacy and craft teachers in particular to help them to design an enterprise with their children that would tackle the under-achievement in basic maths and literacy skills. The staff at V\u00e4stra Parkskolan are especially interested in the way in which the Hook Norton Primary School staff teach their lessons in a cross-curricular way and how they are able to incorporate different areas of the curriculum to teach basic skills of maths and literacy. They would like to see how this approach motivates children and how teachers manage the approach. Cross curricular planning will be very important when planning the enterprise activities.Throughout the project, every class will be writing either a class letter or an individual penpal letter to their partner school each term. The focus for the letters will be influential businesses, inventors, influential people or innovative ideas they've had. They could talk about things that they have made to sell at school. The letter writing should include some mention of mathematical processes. The purpose of the letter writing is to improve literacy and communication skills and motivate children to want to learn the skills as they may discuss ideas for their class's activity if their activity. The older children from Year 6 and Class 5 will also enhance their communication skills using Skype. They will Skype their penpal every term to talk about what they have been learning in mathematics and discuss mathematical problems they have been trying to solve. We intend that our project will tackle the issue of under-achievement in the basic skills of maths and literacy and that the children who are most and least able in our schools will reach their potentials. Our wish is that the children will come away from the project with a greater appreciation of the importance of maths and literacy skills and a greater desire to succeed in these areas. V\u00e4stra Parkskolan's school vision is to be \"A School for the Future\" and both schools wish that their children will grow up happy and successful and we hope that our project will play a fundamental role in this. We hope that our project will make the children more employable as adults, give them a life long love of learning and arm them with skills in problem solving, forward thinking and entrepreneurial flare!", "http://www.hook-norton.oxon.sch.uk", "Hook Norton C of E Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024326_coordinator"]]}}, "6EY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1251763200000, 1314748800000, "Mobile Refrigeration System Refrigerant Leakage Monitoring", "Sensor Technology Limited", "The European SME haulage industry is under unprecedented pressure due to fuel price increases and environmental pollution.  If crude oil prices average $80 a barrel in 2008 as predicted, prices will have risen 154% since 2003.  In real terms, fuel prices have risen 42% in the last 4 years. Fuel constitutes 30% of the operating costs, therefore costs are increasing at nearly twice the rate of inflation.  The haulage industry in Europe emits over 922.6 M tons of pollutants every year which is not sustainable.  The industry faces increased taxation and legislation, impacting on profitability.  The average profit margin for a haulage firm is between 0% and 2%, down from over 3.5% in 2003.  The problems above are worse for the refrigerated transport industry because refrigerated vehicles consume extra fuel to run the refrigeration plant.  The industry is in desperate need of any technologies that can help reduce operating costs and restore profitability.  This is important because 72.5% of freight in Europe is moved by road.  Low-resistance tyres and aerodynamic packages are helping but technologies specifically directed at refrigerated vehicles are required.  This project is motivated by the fact that even correctly operating refrigeration systems leak refrigerant which causes a reduction in coefficient of performance.  This in turn raises the compressor duty cycle and further increases fuel consumption.  Refrigerants are hydroflorourocarbons which have a high global warming potential and so contribute further pollutants.  We will develop a refrigerant leakage monitoring system based on a network of low-cost surface acoustic wave sensors.  This will enable the refrigerant charge of a system to be maintained at the optimum level so that it operates at the design maximum COP.  The benefit of this system will be a decrease in operating costs equivalent to approximately a 5% reduction in fuel consumption equating to a saving of \u20ac2250 per annum for a refrigerated trailer.", 216019.0, 1125142.0, 5, 8, "LEAKDETECT", "http://www.leakdetect.org", "http://www.pera.com", null, "fp7_92571_997574482"]]}}}}
