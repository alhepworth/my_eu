This project broadens out to  three new occupational sectors providing one months work placement for students in Spain. The project targets students from more disadvantaged backgrounds seeking to enhance their employability and broaden their view of the world of work through the internationalisation of thier curriculum and the work placement.\r\n\r\nThe VESI 2 objectives are to; \r\n- provide exceptional learning opportunities to some of the most deprived young people in the south east\r\n- enhance the development of both hard and soft, employability skills for sectors with a higher than average representation of students from disadvantaged communities,\r\n- enhance and develop linguistic ability,\r\n- building a stronger, more flexible workforce for the future,\r\n- encourage UK learners to develop European identities and broaden their cultural horizons,\r\n- enhance employment experience opportunities for VET learners through the provision of high quality 4 week work placements in either Spain (Seville),\r\n-use European models, frameworks and tools to improve and refreshen learning thereby internationilising these occupational sector curriculums,\r\n- make learning more relevant to the local regional national and international work place.\r\n\r\nThe Consortia College Partners are; Mid Kent College, West Kent College and Sussex Coast College Hastings. The project will select 252 VET learners, to take part in a 4 week mobility placement in Spain. Learners are drawn from deprived communities across the south east,  and are at risk of being;\r\n-educational under-achievers, \r\n-having limited experience of working, \r\n-dependent on state support, \r\n-prone to chaotic, unpredictable home lives, \r\n-in or leaving care, \r\n-vulnerable. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to provide a motivational experience for our learners by offering them an opportunity to attend a mobility placement with an employer in the Hospitality, Leisure,  Sport, Construction and Business Admin sectors. The project will provide linguistic support and cultural orientation as part of its preparatory training. Support and guidance will also be made available to students through workplace supervisors and buddies, and our receiving host partner, 3SI, will provide addition support to all learners during their period of mobility. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to address the needs of all its learners and the creation of Individual Learning Plans, will be used to guide the expectations of each work mobility placement. This document alongside the Europass is central to ensuring that the overall aims and objectives of our learners are met. The project will evaluate the data collected post each mobility, verifying the experience of our learners, employers, and those of our consortia partners. The results of this work will feed into our mobility timetable, and will ensure that quality development runs throughout project delivery with learning points worked into operational plans. Use of the Europass framework will ensure that skills acquisition of learners can be adequately captured. Distance traveled frameworks will also be used through the project to ensure that participants are able to see their growth in personal development. Students will have a significant role to play in the design and delivery of the programme with Student Ambassadors taking an active role in monitoring placements, promoting the programme and disseminating the results through social media avenues.\r\n\r\nThe project anticipates that UK learners will develop their employability skills, will acquire additional technical skills and soft skills,  and develop their linguistic ability through involvement in this mobility project. We anticipate that this experience, whilst also demonstrating important employment experience on CVs, will aid employability outcomes for our learners. This will be considered within our Evaluation Strategy. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that involvement in this VET mobility project this will be the starting point for greater transnational working across our partnership consortia, to find new partners with European colleges building even stronger links with both the UK and EU economy(s).

The overall aim of the Training Course: The aim is to analyse why some projects work and others don't. What could have been done differently? Learning from mistakes is possible when we first notice the mistake and admit that we made it. During this training course we will be analysing how to carry out a successful project. The world gets increasingly interconnected through globalization and individuals or different cultural backgrounds interact with each other in all spheres of life more intensively than before. This integration is increasingly exposing people to different values and ways of thinking and that's why cultural impacts cannot be avoided. The aim is to learn how to pay attention to cultural differences. The methodology of the TC will be built on the holistic approach of non- formal education. Experienced trainers\u2019 team will assess the needs and expectations of participants and based on that to invent new, creative and participatory methods. The methodological order of the programme will be: starting from the individual to arrive to the local and international levels. The phases will be:\r\n- individual assessment of cultural identity and reactions on ambiguity\r\n- recognising cultural impact on individuals and cultural impact on local community;\r\n- exploring cultural challenges within youth work activities locally and international level;\r\n- collecting good practices to tackle cultural challenges locally and international level;\r\n- inventing new youth exchange projects in order to put theories on intercultural learning into international youth work practice according to the proposals of KA1 Mobility projects for young people and youth workers within Erasmus + programme. \r\nWorking methods which can support to achieve our themes: lectures, simulation games, group work, panel discussions, field visits, etc. \r\nTheoretical inputs: \r\n- Iceberg model of intercultural learning;\r\n- Kolb circle;\r\n- Different learning styles;\r\n- Competence;\r\n- Theory of Ambiguity;\r\n- Theories of intercultural learning;\r\n- Project management of youth exchanges according to the proposals of KA1 Mobility projects for young people and youth workers within Erasmus + programme. \r\n- Cooperation possibility between EU  countries;\r\nPractical inputs:\r\n- Self \u2013 assessment regarding to cultural identity;\r\n- Self \u2013 assessment regarding to ambiguity;\r\n- Visit to good practices places in Beja regarding to successful cultural projects;\r\n- Sharing good practices, tools and methods regarding to cultural challenges;\r\n- Putting theories on intercultural learning into youth work realities;\r\n- Inventing new high \u2013 quality youth exchange projects on intercultural learning between EU and MEDA countries according to the proposals of KA1 Mobility projects for young people and youth workers within Erasmus + programme.\r\nThere will be  participants from  European Countries (Portugal, U.K., Finland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia).

In Estonia we are having the biggest wage cap in Europe for men and women working for the same position (almost 30 % difference). Several studies by European commission show that women are in extensive danger of falling into poverty. At the same time we have issues also with men\u2019s rights \u2013 there is societal pressure on men to perform, which brings a lot of stress and sickness. Average Estonian man dies 12 years earlier than average woman (of course work related accidents play here also crucial role, but this is also gender issue). Men are not allowed to show emotions in our society and often face problems when wanting the same rights as women for child leave. These are just a few issues connected to men and women. At the same time we have other gender related issues in our society \u2013 recently there are been many anti-human rights campaigns in Estonia and also in some other European countries against LGBT rights \u2013 especially against same sex marriage and cohabitation law. We were terrified when we saw how many people are willing to go and protect (in Estonia!) against cohabitation law. More terrifying was the aspect, that they didn\u2019t actually protect against the law, but against a group of people. We see a strong need to stand for human rights in context of gender issues, and support free expression of ones\u2019 gender identity or sexual orientation. We also want to start from beginning and create a common understanding between us and our partners what we are talking about and use common terms. For this reason, we are also writing this project in English, as many languages even don\u2019t have different terms for gender and sex, and that\u2019s just the basics. We want to start big and bring together organizations from different parts of Europe, with really different experiences and ideas, to build up partnerships for new gender related projects. \r\nTo be concrete, our objectives are: \r\n\u2022 Define a common understanding what are the main issues connected to gender topic \r\n\u2022 Discuss gender related challenges in youth work in participating countries \r\n\u2022 Create a common space for sharing good practices for organizations working with gender issues \r\n\u2022 Develop new projects in the framework of Erasmus+ with focus on gender issues (some examples of the topics: gender equality, LGBT rights, gender identity etc) \r\n\u2022 Create a network of organizations working with gender issues\r\n\r\nYouth workers mobility (key action 1) in form of partnership building activity will bring to Vidrike, Estonia from 4th to 13th October 2015 37 youth leaders, youth workers and trainers (18+) to develop new partnerships to address gender related issues in our societies through youth work.

Our High School prepares its pupils to their diploma of Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel (Level IV, the equivalent of the BTEC National) in Office Management and Administrative Work (around 390 students at the start of the academic year in September 2016). The proportion of scholarship holders is of 62% and it is increasing. Our school includes two European sections: one in Italian, the other one in English. These 2 sections concern all the levels of our high school: from the fifth year to the final year. It also hosts a ULIS section for mentally handicapped pupils as well as pupils with autistic troubles and a few disabled pupils .\r\n\r\nThe OSE 2017/2018 programme aims at sending 14 pupils in their final year of Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel in Office Management and Administrative Work on a four-week work placement, out of the 22 compulsory weeks spent on placement.

Indeed, it looks for placement and accommodation places, proposes adapted means of transport and public transport tickets. Moreover, it is present in case problems may occur.  The teacher in charge of the European Section in Italian (Mrs Ozanne) also made a second preparatory visit in October, 2014 to specify the conditions of the mobilities in the city of Rome. In 2014/2015, 5 pupils of the European section in Italian did their mobilities in Rome. Then, in 2015/2016, 5 other pupils performed their last work placement in Rome in March 2016.
