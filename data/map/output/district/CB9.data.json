Many materials stored in IBCs become viscous at room temperature. These materials can present customers with a number of challenges including:\n\n- In the absence of heat, the product cannot be discharged quickly enough from the IBC into the manufacturing process, even at room temperature.\n- As the IBC empties, the static head falls, further reducing the flow rate.\n- To keep production flowing, it is often necessary to replace the IBC before it is completely empty, meaning that product is either wasted or returned to the supplier at an inherent cost to the user.\n- Increased energy consumption and costs associated with cleaning such containers.\n\nExisting heating solutions are typically slow and energy inefficient and rely on heating the exterior surface of the drum or IBC. Currently, there is no single product on the market which utilises internal heating of an intermediate bulk container. There is, therefore, a very real need for the development of a heating solution that can heat quickly, efficiently and at a lower cost. By achieving this, the efficiency of heating of drums and IBCs can be increased dramatically.  To meet this market need, the Safe Heat project will develop a novel coating layer with embedded materials, with high conductivity, which can be applied to the internal wall of a small scale IBC to allow an internal heating capability. This will enable the contents of the container to be heated more quickly, efficiently and safely at a heating rate of 4-6\u00b0C per hr.   It is estimated that by uptake of the Safe Heat technology by 5% of IBC users requiring heating solutions the potential reduction in CO2 emissions alone could amount to between 0.14m tonnes and 0.30m of CO2 p.a. across Europe depending upon heating requirements.", 275334.0, 1243524.0, 5, 7, "SAFE HEAT", "http://www.safeheat.eu", "http://www.drumheating.com", null, "fp7_91608_998164727"]]}}, "7AD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1530316800000, "Access to rights data via identification technologies optimisation", "Europe Analytica Limited", "Everything is digital today in the creative industries value network. The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.\nThe digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.\nHowever there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network \u2013 everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.\nThis is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.\nThe time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.\nThe services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets. The final aim is to support SMEs in European creative industries in promoting new business ideas through monetising the re-use of their content.", 127976.0, 1051764.0, 5, 6, "ARDITO", null, null, null, "h2020_205978_994590083"]]}}}}
