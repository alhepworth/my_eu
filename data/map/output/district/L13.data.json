Alternative skills and resources for job searching", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 255387.0, 5, 6, "The world is changing, the way we work is changing and also the way we search for a new job is changing. Strategies, tools and skills required, used and needed have suffered a massive evolution in last years, especially in this period of economic crisis. This fact is remarkable in sectors such as first job searchers, long-term unemployed or lowed skills adults looking for a reinsertion in the labor market. Here is important to notice that old strategies and skills are giving place to new ones, in a context where even the concept of intelligence or competence (the capacity, knowledge or ability we acquire to solve a problem) has changed. And obviously, this has affected the working world, independently of the field we are referring to. Job searchers and counselors are obliged to develop new skills and strategies for a new market. Here there is the place for Emotional Intelligence (EI) and extra weapon to keep and increase the levels of employability in a new economic and social scenario. \r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that, at the executive and professional level, emotional intelligence (EI) or \u201cEQ\u201d (Emotional Quotient, as it is often called) is a better predictor of success than \u201cIQ\u201d. The emotionally intelligent person exhibits such competencies as accurate self-assessment, self-control, empathy, influence. The ability to accurately assess and develop these competencies will set organizations apart. This is a key factor for job searchers, especially first job searchers, long-term unemployed or lowed skills adults looking for a reinsertion in the labor market. Management of EI skills will not be important only for their success in job searching, but also will endow them with a huge amount of abilities to make it more stable, reinforcing their employability in a future. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, EI is becoming a plus for counselors which are developing their work in an extremely difficult and changing labour market. Counselors are experts in the external area of job searching (curriculum vitae, ways of searching, use of searchers, preparation of interviews, etc), but now they also need to work the internal area of job searching, that involves EI skills such as self-esteem, self-knowledge, empathy, avoid social isolation, attitude, passion, weaknesses and fortresses, management of frustration, motivation, delay of gratification, management of emotional state. These aspects are basic not only in the process of job searching, but also in the former level of employability and the capacity to stabilize the position, so it has a short term and mid-long term effects.    \r\n\r\nThe project consortium is composed of 6 organisations from 5 different EU countries (UK, IRL, ES, RO and PT) and shows cooperation between new and old European Member States.

The online system will also feature a platform for interactions between learners, trainers, mentors and mentees, and other stakeholders. All outputs produced will be freely accessible for the public within and beyond the project\u2019s lifetime.\r\n\r\nEMOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT is likely to have sustainable direct impacts within and beyond the project lifetime on three target groups: 1) job counselors and career guides, 2) job searchers, freelances and self-employees, 3) companies and organizations active in the field of training and advisory services.\r\n\r\nBy creating training tools for improving skills and key competences of counselors and job searchers, the consortium expects to achieve the overall objective of the project: highlight the importance of Emotional Intelligence and social skills (creativity, empathy, cognitive flexibility, teamwork...) in the new economic environment and globalised world. \r\n\r\nThe project wishes to set new tools and methodologies to support career guiders and job searchers in enhancing their efficiency.

The certification procedure is not just a \u201ccheck\u201d of written anti-bullying procedures but also contains a social analysis and needs assessment, integration of ongoing goal setting and planning, staff and student training and a guide pointing to effective measures to structurally enhance the school learning and working climate. A key aspect of all this is how students and teachers deal with conflicts and whether the school functions as a model of non-violent problem solving skills and methods which are lodged in role-modelling democracy. The main aim of the certification process is not to prescribe best practices to the school but to enhance ownership and making own choices in an appropriate school policy. \r\n\r\nThe project has 5/6 partners, each working with one or two schools in their own country. The project partners start the project by elaborating a draft certification proposal, which has been developed by Centro Montesca and reviewed in the European Anti-Bullying Network, into a testable toolkit. They also undertake a national review of anti-bullying and social inclusion policies as well as needs assessments in the allied schools by doing research among students and staff and by carrying out a school visitation. \r\n\r\nIn the schools, this is the first step of the certification process. In the schools, the second step is to analyse the assessment results and decide about necessary measures. Then the implementation follows during one school year. A staff training is a key element in any strategy. Another key element of successful anti-bullying strategies is organizing \u201cgolden weeks\u201d at the start of the school year, during which student get to know each other, built  social group process and agree about rules for pro-social behaviour. At the end of the school year, the impact of the pro-social/anti-bullying strategies is evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe project ends six months later. This gives the schools the opportunity to organize the \u201cgolden weeks\u201d in an improved way. It gives the other partners the opportunity to review the certification procedure, the training and the manual on effective measures, to translate, publish and disseminate them. This is done during multiplier meetings in the participating countries and in Brussels. \r\n\r\nAfter the project period, the European Anti-Bullying Network (EAN) will sustain the certification strategy by stimulating her members to implement the procedure (at a cost-covering rate) in their own countries.

To be able to drive legally and safely makes you more employable.  However young drivers typically represent between 18% and 30% of all killed drivers, although people in the same age group only represent between 9% and 13% of the total populations in their countries. Traffic crashes are the single greatest killer of 15-24 year-olds in OECD countries and within European countries, among 15-24 year olds, the majority of road fatalities are car occupants (59%) or motorcyclists (19%. Young drivers pose a greater risk than other drivers to themselves, their passengers and other road users, socially and economically excluded young people being highly represented in accident statistics.  Research has indicated that inexperienced drivers, particularly  young male drivers, tend to fall into the category of high risk threshold drivers. These drivers tend to have a particular set of attitudes that are associated with their lifestyles and driving culture. Risk taking  is  perceived  as  a normal part of driving as young people  tend  to  have  higher  sensation  seeking tendencies. This all has a huge economic and social cost on societies\r\n Improving traffic safety and reducing crashes and resulting deaths and injuries is a fundamental objective of the E-DRIVERS project as it aims to address the high levels of young driver risk by taking into account some of the highly complex root causes of the problem which include inexperience, age, gender , physiological and emotional development, personality, social norms and individuals\u2019 socio-economic circumstances.

They are one of he largest groups of disadvantaged citizens in the EU. Every ten minutes another parent receives the news that their child is disabled. For parents, raising a child with a disability can cause more daily stress, long-range health problems, feelings of isolation, high levels of stress, increasing in depression than parenting a child without disabilities.  They are always lonely, have to work extra to preserve their marriage, worry about dying.\r\nWhen parents learn that their child has a disability or a chronic illness, they begin a journey that takes them into a life that is often\r\nfilled with strong emotion, difficult choices, interactions with many different professionals and specialists, and an ongoing need for\r\ninformation and services. Initially, parents may feel isolated and alone, and not know where to begin their search for information, assistance, understanding, and support.\r\n\r\nOne of the things parents learn when they have a child with special needs is that having a child with special needs is not an after school special, a Lifetime movie, or a very special episode of an otherwise humorous show. It's a whole-life commitment, and generally no one really asks them if they are interested before they sign up. \r\n\r\nSome people romanticize the notion of having a Child with Special Needs.

The youth exchange will make use of non-formal learning methodologies to coach the participants about environmental challenges and solutions, their individual responsibility and the array of actions they can take in order to change their attitude and develop community actions. Among the topics of the workshop, the participants will work on: urban/rural relationships, pollution, the European Agenda 2020 and the SDGs, biodiversity and ecosystems loss, and corporate responsibility. Moreover, the workshop will involve activities to develop intercultural and communication skills, as well as strengthening the European values, as \"united in diversity\". The workshop results will be shared on the Facebook page of the project itself, which will be easily recognisable by its logo.\r\n\r\nThe project will have impacts on the participants, who will experience first- hand how to tackle environmental issues, both changing their own attitude and habits, and also through community action, such as volunteering, but also by being entrepreneurial. In the long term, the project aims to encourage the participants to pursue further education paths regarding sustainable development or getting involved through volunteering or work experience. Both participants and youth leaders will have improved key competences, as well as soft-skills, language capabilities, and self-esteem. All these skills will be validated through several instruments, such as Youthpass, Europass, and Open Badges. The participating organisations will have the opportunity to work in two related fields (social inclusion and environment) and the youth exchange will be a chance to better understand the needs of young people  in relation to environmental issues and to develop innovative actions in line with them. Moreover, the local communities where the participants come from will be involved through a small event that the young people will organise after the exchange. On a longer term, the project aims to contribute to the environmental awareness of young people and their optimism regarding the change they can trigger both from individual and community actions.\r\n\r\nImportant dates:\r\n\r\nAdvance Planning Visit: 30.08.2018 - 31.08.2018\r\nYouth Exchange: 24.09.2018 - 29.09.2019", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-2-UK01-KA105-048514_coordinator"], [2014, "EU young starter", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 12836.0, 5, 5, "The project \u201cNAME\u201d is developed between partners from United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland and Cyprus. All project partners met at a Youth in Action PBA in Denmark in November 2013. There they shared their experiences stemming from their own countries and found that each had experiences that were unique and yet helpful for the other partners. Partners found also similarities on the work field and employment problems among young people. Outcome of the PBA (partner building activity) in Denmark was the idea for cooperation to work with and for young people to prepare them for future employment, promote entrepreneurship and also attempt to decrease unemployment among young people. \r\nProjects idea is to create opportunities for the young participants to be exposed and practice entrepreneurship through non-formal, practical and participative methods and to create situations during the project where participants, reflect and rethink in a conscious but also unconscious way their comparative strengths and how these be used for future employment and their comparative weaknesses and how these can be improved to enable each young participants fulfill their full potential in the work place.\r\nParticipants are chosen in early stage of the project and they are also part of the project building. Project program is developed in full cooperation of participants who are added to the circle of social media, used for the project building phase. Participants are chosen in the age of 17-21, 6 participants per country. Criteria for the participants were young people from high school final course or not studying nor working young people or young person finishing studies and facing future employment. \r\nActivities are developed according to the objectives and aims of the project. Main activities are teaching how to write CV or how to act on job interview. These activities are done by using roleplaying. Participants have also opportunity to learn how to work in multicultural teams and to develop a business plan. For these activities we use from youth to youth tool. Young people from Ireland have had a special entrepreneurship training and are now teaching this to our participants. We also use world-library, world-caf\u00e9 and different team building exercises.\r\nProject management is divided between partners. Each partner has their part in application, program building and project building and also leading the activities. For the coordinating process of project partners are using social media such as Skype, Facebook and Gmail/google doc.\r\nExpected impact on the participants: Improved key competencies and skills, with particular regard to their relevance for the labor market and their contribution to a cohesive society, in particular through increased opportunities for learning mobility and through strengthened cooperation between the world of education and training and the world of work. Development of transferable skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and self-learning. Young people will be more active citizens in their local community and also in Europe. Development of mutual understanding between young people in different countries.  Learning new languages which promote linguistic diversity and intercultural awareness. Enhanced employability and improved career prospects. Increased sense of initiative and entrepreneurship. Enhanced intercultural awareness. \r\nIn longer perspective this project is motivating tool that encourages young people to apply for new projects and/or for new work. Also courage to work on their ideas and enter to the entrepreneur\u2019s world.

This program is an instrument to support the programming and implementation of improvements in the school, whose development and sustainability mobilizes the educational community and its resources. A European Development Plan, with specific actions to meet the proposed goals of an international school, is part of this program.\r\nThis internationalization is also an attempt to answer, not only  to the City Hall, which has provided and stimulated new agents in order to open their doors to a global world (Made In project), but also to the companies of this region that are undergoing  an internationalization process. Our school provides both entities with human resources that can answer to this internationalization challenge.\r\nForave\u00b4s participation in several European projects, namely \u201cGirls Tech\u201d, \u201cEcwork\u201d and \u201cTeachnology in Education\u201d, and in the foundation of a new association of European technical schools (INNOTECS) tries to create conditions for this internationalization to happen, giving skills to teachers and students that allow them to be agents of change.\r\nWe believe that the transnational mobility will provide participants a greater enrichment of their professional and cultural qualifications while fostering understanding, team spirit, the capacity for initiative and tolerance. We also hope to enhance the quality and the access to vocational training in the European labor market and to enable trainees to increase and improve their skills so that they can understand more easily the different technological and organizational realities.\r\nThis application has 4 different groups of recipients, as follows:\r\n1 - 10 ex-students recently graduated from our school who will undertake a long-term internship in Manchester \u2013 UK, Barcelona \u2013 Spain e Berlim \u2013 Germany, having the opportunity to improve their language and professional skills, thus opening up prospects for entering the European labor market.\r\n2 - 16 students still in training who will carry out the curricular internship, an integral part of their training, in Barcelona -Spain e Landskrona - Sweden.\r\n3 - 13 staff members will carry out Job Shadowing periods in contexts and cities as diverse as Liverpool, Manchester, Barcelona, Landskrona, Roma and Berlin in order to provide an exchange of knowledge and comparison of practices that contribute to the improvement of their pedagogical action and the continuous improvement of their training.\r\n4 - 1 teacher who will carry out preparatory visits in Manchester for long-term mobility.\r\nTaking into account that some of the trainees participating in flow 2 are underage, we consider that the group must be accompanied by a teacher who will remain in the host country for a week, in order to integrate the trainees, discuss and redefine, if necessary with the head of the host company and the trainee, the activities to be carried out during the internship, as well as to ensure that everything goes according to plan (established agreements). \r\nWith the presence of the technical area teachers in Spain, in United Kingdom, in Sweden, In Germany and in Italy, this project aims to facilitate the development of innovative practices in the field of vocational training and to make the teachers willingly improve the quality of education practices and training.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-047164_1"], [2018, "Est\u00e1gios na Europa - novas compet\u00eancias num ambiente multicultural III", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 119261.0, 4, 4, "The internationalization process of the school is part of the context of globalization, with economic, social, educational and cultural policies. Globalization requires a definition of new strategies for a better positioning of the school in relation to its counterparts, giving continuity to the consistent and systematic practices developed since 2007.\r\nThe skills acquired by trainees are a tremendous asset for companies in the region, but also for our institution. In conjunction with companies, the school stimulates meetings, where mobility experiences are presented in order to attract entrepreneurs to our institution, promoting qualification and employability. \r\nThe entrepreneurs know that these trainees have the capacity to bring innovations and cutting-edge procedures, giving companies an improvement in the rooted processes, still allowing a change and improvement in the paradigms of the company. \r\nOn the other hand, the trainees will return to school to participate, in addition to the forums with the companies, in activities of dissemination and motivation. They thus show to there  colleagues the importance of the knowledge gained during training at school and the experience of internships abroad. \r\nEuropean projects, for several years, have had a major impact on the school community covered by the D. Sancho I Schools Association. \r\nLearning to \"Read the World\" through active participation in European projects certainly contributes to the integral development of children and young people. This was the direction that led the group to develop several European projects. Now, faced with a new reality,  the School Group D. Sancho I,  build an educational project to meet the needs and objectives of this school community, where are inscribed the guiding principles for the preparation of the European Strategic Development Plan (PEDE) .\r\nThis project aims to promote the qualification and employability of students of professional courses in three areas:\r\nshort-term internships (6 weeks in San Gwann and Barcelona for 28 students, between March and June 2019) for the final graduates of the Professional Courses in the year 2019 of the courses of Accounting,  Electrotechnics. technician,  Commerce technician , Industrial Maintenance, Restoration technicians and Environmental and Rural Tourism technicians.\r\nThe main objectives are to prepare the students finalists for their professional life, putting them in contact with real work situations.\r\n(b) VET PRO traineeships (long-term traineeships in Liverpool between September and December 2018, lasting 100 days for 6 recent graduates) - despite the visible economic improvement and greater confidence on the part of companies, the labor market increasingly requires skilled and demanding professionals to carry out their activities, since the offerings of skilled and stable work are scarce and companies are increasingly selective in the recruitment of employees.\r\nThe solution to the difficulty of entering the job market of the students that finishes the 12th grade is now in the long-term or specific professional training so that they can, in the immediate future, satisfy the interests of the companies. \r\n(c) job shadowing - (5 teachers in Stockholm and  3 mor in Liverpool both in vocational school) - give teachers, coordinators and to school board the opportunity to carry out real experiences of exploration, confrontation and contact with the world of work and professions, by shadowing, so that they are able to propose changes in the educational policies and practices of the grouping and so that they are able to carry them out individually and collectively in their daily lives. \r\nThe needs that are sought to be met not only through the mobilization but also with activities of integration and sharing of learning and dissemination and exploitation of results are at the level of linguistic, technological and professional development. \r\nIn addition, they can have a greater diversity of methodological options in their work and contact networks and incorporate a critical and broad vision of their role, the available strategies and the quality / demand standards in the group's action. \r\nTo achieve the project, we have established 3 partnerships with training institutions, located in the cities of Liverpool, San Gwann, Barcelona and Stockholm, which have extensive experience in curricular internships, which represents not only a guarantee that our students will be well oriented and as well as the quality of the internships and the Companies / Entities that provide them.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-047139_2"], [2018, "Viv\u00eancias Profissionais e Culturais na Cidadania Europeia", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 111463.0, 5, 5, "The project \u201cProfessional and Cultural Experiences In the European Citizenship\u201d is addressed to 17 young trainees of the second and third year of Professional Courses, 5 newly graduated in Erasmus Pro, 2 trainees of the educational staff and a mobility of preparation of the ErasmusPro. The students are aged between 16 and 20 and live in the Ave Valley, a lacking and needy region in Portugal.  \r\nThis group of trainees includes young under-aged students facing social and economical  deprivation , therefore the need to be monitored.. We request two accompanying teachers for each destination. This is really important because our pupils had never travelled before by airplane and aren't aware of the required procedures when travelling abroad.\r\nThey are young people who are preparing themselves for various professions in the world of design, arts, sports and science. The curricular design foresees 610 hours of training in work context (active training) in companies or institutions whose professional area matches the required training. The professionals in these areas have to answer with great acuity and agility to the demands of globalization with the consequent requirement of quality in the rendering of services. \r\nThe internationalization strategy has allowed and will allow motivating, enriching and unique professional experiences because they are carried abroad. The simple perspective of training outside Portugal, already divulged throughout the school year 2012/2013 and the implementation of the approved European projects since 2012 has motivated young people to study foreign languages and to complete the course with higher quality. The possibility to serve as an apprentice in Liverpool in the United kingdom, in the Island of Tenerife, Greece or Italy is a very strong incentive to invest in school tasks. The experience will be rewarding because it makes Europe reachable to deprived young people. It will be a unique experience, since most of these teenagers have never been to an airport, and some have never been to the capital city.\r\nThis project responds to the need to promote the European dimension of citizenship and to enlarge the horizons of these young people. In today's Europe, the contact with a new culture or a new language is assumed as a necessity which promotes equal opportunities as it will put at their fingertips an opportunity that only young people born in more favourable economical status can have. It will be a concrete response financed by European funds directed to a social stratum always overlooked. Mobility provides a direct contact with human and professional knowledge and it leads to the development of the professions.  \r\nThe objectives aim at the apprenticeship in Technical courses of:  \r\n- Graphical Design;  \r\n- Laboratorial Analysis; \r\n- Sports Management;\r\nThe project \u201cProfessional and Cultural Experiences In the European Citizenship\u201d aims to:\r\n- improve cultural sensitivity;\r\n- consolidate European citizenship; \r\n- consolidate/ discover professional practices in another country;\r\n- discover a new culture;\r\n- improve the level of the English language;\r\n- learn a new foreign language;               \r\n- blur social disadvantages linked to the social and economical status of the families;\r\n- promote working opportunities.\r\nThe expected results will have an impact in the professional, social and interpersonal abilities, but also in the domain of the foreign language. In the professional areas of the arts and science, general culture, the ability to communicate, the development of the interpersonal relationships assume particular relevancy.  It is expected that participants return more mature, less introverted, and more competent, technically and socially speaking. \r\nThe apprenticeship will be certified by the Europass Mobility and in the professional course, since the evaluation of the active training will be integrated in the calculation of the final average classification of the professional course.\r\nThe mobility will take place between April and July 2019. \r\n11thgrade (with the duration of 58 days):\r\n- 5 trainees from the Sports Management Course in the city of Liverpool, in the United Kingdom with a duration of 58 days; \r\n- 3 trainees from the Graphical Design Course in the Island of Syros, in Greece;\r\n- 5 trainees from the Laboratorial Analysis Course  in Lecce, Italy. \r\n12th grade (for 68 days):\r\n- 4 trainees from the Sports Management Course in Tenerife, Spain;\r\nNewly-graduated in Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 5 newly-graduated mobility (to distribute among trainees from Graphic Design, Lab Analysis and Sports Management courses) with the duration of 120 days, will have Italy as their destination between October  and February 2019. \r\n- Mobility of an element of the School Team that implements the projects Erasmus + with the duration of 4 days to prepare the mobility of the 5 participants of Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 2 trainees of the Educational Staff for Lecce for 4 days.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-046997_4"], [2018, "CIFP La Laguna: Transferencia Europea de Patrimonio Cultural y Formaci\u00f3n Profesional.", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 27981.0, 2, 3, "CIFP La Laguna is a public school that started to operate in the year 1975.
