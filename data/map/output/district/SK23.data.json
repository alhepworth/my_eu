Currently, there exists no cure for any ND, and most of the available drugs fail to tackle ND pathogenesis. Preclinical studies point to the therapeutic potential of neurotrophins, which have been shown to control a number of aspects of survival, development and function of neurons. However, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of neurotrophins render their use as drugs prohibitive.\nThe key idea behind this project is to address this limitation by developing novel small molecule, neurotrophin mimetics with favourable profiles of stability, tissue penetration and targeted biological actions. We are motivated by seminal (patented) results of beneficiaries NHRF and FORTH, who recently demonstrated promising effects of small neurotrophin mimetics in neuroprotection and neurogenesis. EuroNeurotrophin will be the first European consortium to study small molecule neurotrophin mimetics in depth, use them as molecular probes to interrogate neurotrophins, and emphasise their clinical translation.\nThis approach requires highly skilled researchers that have a deep understanding of neurotrophins, comprehend all steps of drug discovery and development for ND, and possess the necessary skills to translate results into novel therapies.\nThe network has been designed to address the need for the development of new ND treatments through the collaborative training of 14 early-stage researchers. It builds on previous successful collaborations enriched with key specialists, and consists of 12 leading European research groups and 6 private companies of complementary expertise covering all steps of drug discovery and development. Collectively we will (a) conduct a unique training programme that could not be achieved by doctoral training within a single academic institution and (b) accelerate the translation of identified drug candidate molecules into the market.", null, 3100042.0, 9, 17, "EuroNeurotrophin", null, null, null, "h2020_211617_953840189"], [1420070400000, 1546214400000, "Click Chemistry for Future Gene Therapies to Benefit Citizens, Researchers and Industry", "Peakdale Molecular Ltd", "Gene therapy is expected to play a key role in next-generation medicine by correcting the underlying genetic causes of disease, thereby facilitating personalised medicine. Current gene therapy methods possess undesirable side effects, including insertional mutagenesis, toxicity, low efficiency and off-target cutting. Questions also remain regarding the optimal methods for delivering nucleases into cells and tissues. These limitations will be addressed through the original and innovative approach of the ClickGene network. \n\nClickGene\u2019s research objectives are to train 14 ESRs in the field of biomaterials development with specific focus on, i.) site-selective genetic engineering, ii.) liposomal nanoparticle drug delivery, and iii.) optogenetic diagnostic probes for epigenetic base detection. Most of our academic partners are key members of COST Action CM1201: Biomimetic Radical Chemistry and all have outstanding international reputations as scientific leaders in their field. This COST Action will play a vital role in both networking and training elements of ClickGene, and in combination with transferable skills training, intersectorial and cross-disciplinary secondment, and industry targeted workshops, the education of biomaterials chemists with expertise in click-chemistry and cutting edge application areas of gene therapy, nanotechnology and biological diagnostics will be achieved. \n\nThe training provided will match the skills required by next-generation research leaders in biopharmaceutical, nanotechnology, biodiagnostic and other industries. Allied to academic strength in this network, ClickGene features highlycompetitive industry partners with expertise in commercialisation of nucleic acid click-chemistry (baseclick, ATDBio) and liposomal and lipidome technology (LipiNutraGen).
