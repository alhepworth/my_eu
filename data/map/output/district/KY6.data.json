The aims of the Robert Bosch GmbH are based on the \"house of orientation\" that describes the values of our enterprise. Beneath many others, the value of \"cultural variety / diversity\" as well as the core competencies \"being globally present\" and \"personal development\" have main importance as a base of our daily actions.To achieve this aim we offer our apprentices the opportunity of \"being send to one of our Bosch Rexroth partner locations in Germany or abroad\" as well as we \"promote their knowledge of foreign languages\". The young employees should realize that the Bosch Rexroth AG consists of more than one plant. The exchange shows the variety of products and know-how ist generated by get to know different manufacturing processes and techniques.Another important fact is the increase of attractiveness of starting a training at Bosch Rexroth by having the opportunity to be delegated to a facility abroad and to learn a lot about a foreign culture. Because of the demographic change there are less and less young people, who start a training in a company after having finished school. As a consequence for the companies there are less skilled employees. This leads to a hard competition between the companies about getting the best of the school-leavers. Those young people often also make their decision for a company based on additional possibilitis like a delegation.The application of the foreign language should be promoted. This raises the chances on the job market.Out apprentices stay about 3 to 12 weeks abroad depending on which country they are delegated to. We chose a relatively short time period for the commercial trainees, because a longer period would on the one hand mean that our apprentices would miss too many school lessons and on the other hand a longer time period would mean too many additional costs.We choose our partner facilities for the Erasmus+ project within the Bosch Rexroth group. These facilities are in contact with our plant already for a long time. This simplifies the vocational adjustment, because the supervisors of our apprentices abroad already know the Bosch culture and the Bosch values. The apprentices have a locally contact person, whom they can address if they have questions or any problems to solve. Being on their own however, the search for identity and the self sufficiency of the apprentices being promoted. With the increasing globalization it is essential to communicate the importance of flexibility and mobility at the workplace already at the apprenticeship.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002845_2"]]}}}}
