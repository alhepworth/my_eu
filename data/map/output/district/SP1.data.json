LEILAC will develop, build and operate a 240 tonne per day pilot plant demonstrating Direct Separation calcining technology which will capture over 95% of the process CO2 emissions (which is 60 % of total CO2 emissions) from both industries without significant energy or capital penalty.\n\nDirect Separation technology uses indirect heating in which the process CO2 and furnace combustion gases do not mix, resulting in the simple capture of high quality CO2. This innovation requires minimal changes to the conventional processes for cement, replacing the calciner in the Preheater-Calciner Tower. For lime there is no product contamination from the combustion gas. The technology can be used with alternative fuels and other capture technologies to achieve negative CO2 emissions. The project will also enable research into novel building materials with a reduced CO2 footprint, as well the upgrade of low value limestone fines and dust to high value lime applications.\n\nThe high potential of the project is complemented by high deliverability. The requested grant will secure \u20ac8.8m of in-kind funding and support from the LEILAC consortium members, which include world leading engineering, cement, lime and R&D organisations. \n\nTo accelerate further development, LEILAC will deliver a techno-economic roadmap, and comprehensive knowledge sharing activities including a visitor centre at the pilot site near Brussels.

This Calcium-looping process (CaL) is the basis of a proven pilot-scale technology for CO2 capture, which is accomplished by carbonation of CaO and its regeneration in a calciner reactor operated under high CO2 partial pressure and high temperature. The wide availability of limestone (<10\u20ac/ton) is a key factor for the feasibility of the CaL process. However, the huge potential for lime also to store energy has been inhibited by its propensity to sinter at the high temperatures of the standard CaL cycle for CO2 capture, which reduces dramatically its multicycle conversion. SOCRATCES will be built on previous R&D results of the partners indicating that the CaL process can be integrated into CSP plants for thermochemical energy storage and power generation by means of a simple closed CO2 loop. High global efficiencies (>45%) are achieved under new CaL conditions implying carbonation under high temperature (>850\u00baC) at high CO2 partial pressure  compatible with high efficiency power blocks. Moreover, fast calcination is carried out at temperatures < 700\u00baC by the Flash Calcination technology, which allows using mature and inexpensive solar receiver technology. Circulating Fluidized Bed reactors of proven efficiency. The new CSP-CaL integration yields high storage energy density (3.2 GJ/m3) with possible long time gaps between load and discharge.  SOCRATCES is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of this integration by erecting a pilot-scale plant that uses cheap, abundant and non-toxic materials as well as mature solar and fluidized bed reactor technologies.  SOCRATCES will confer the EU a leading role on the development of efficient and non-toxic CSP with low cost storage (<12\u20ac/kWh) and LCOE <7c\u20ac/kWh.\nThe consortium involves the full value chain, in a well balanced distribution between R&D groups and companies", 820869.0, 4340229.0, 7, 14, "SOCRATCES", null, "http://www.calix.com.au", null, "h2020_212577_952356574"], [1393632000000, 1519776000000, "ASCENT - Advanced Solid Cycles with Efficient Novel Technologies", "Calix (Europe) Limited", "'ASCENT will provide a robust proof-of-concept of three related high temperature processes; each will lead to a step-change in efficiency of carbon removal in three types of pre-combustion capture, producing the hydrogen needed for highly efficient low-carbon power production. The project brings together five small and medium enterprises preparing to launch these concepts with the support of leading research institutes, universities and industrial partners.\nThe essential feature linking the three technologies is the use of a high temperature solid sorbent for the simultaneous separation of CO2 during conversion of other carbon containing gases (CO and CH4) into H2. Each technology  provides a step-change in efficiency because they all separate the CO2 at elevated temperatures (>300\u00b0C) providing for more efficient heat integration options not available in technologies where the separation occurs at lower temperatures. Each process matches both endothermic and exothermic heat requirements of associated reactions and sorbent regeneration in an integrated in situ approach.\nThe synergies between the three technologies are strong, allowing both multiple interactions between the different work packages and allowing a consistent framework for cross-cutting activities across all the technologies. Each technology will be proven under industrially relevant conditions of pressure and temperature, at a scale that allows the use of industrially relevant materials that can be manufactured at a scale needed for real implementation.
