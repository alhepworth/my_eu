In the context of our ongoing work on the school program this project is supposed to develop or further the competences of our staff in using and implementing modern, digital media, ICT, e-learning as well as social media and digital communication platforms in their teaching, as well as in future bi- or multilateral school projects with our European partner schools. We hope to be able to profit from the longstanding experiences and profound knowledge and best practices of our European partners as well as from other teachers attending teacher training courses. We want to utilize the experiences of our partners as well as the European idea for our school program work and we want to continue the very good work on the Comenius and ERASMUS+ projects we have taken part in in the past.\r\nThe activities of this project include on the one hand the participation of members of our teaching staff in structured teacher training courses which offer specifically opportunities to increase the participants\u2019 knowledge and competences in the relevant field, especially using hands on approaches and the exchange of ideas and experiences of up to date methods and best practices. Our participants are secondary lever teachers at our school, who both have experience in catering for gifted and highly motivated students and in attending European training courses. The results of the courses attended are to be presented both in our school (internal teacher training program, in the various departments, but also in the school program development groups) and in regional training events. We want to utilize the results in our school development program to bring our teaching and learning up to date in using ICT, modern media and communication platforms. Especially our students are supposed to profit directly from this input. \r\nAnother focus of this project is on job shadowing at our European partner schools in Great Britain and Norway, which already have longstanding experiences in using modern media, ICT and e-learning as well as digital resources in the classroom and have used digital communications and project platforms in the planning and execution of school projects. In this pillar of the project we want to profit directly from the great know how and best practices. We expect the initialization of bi- or even multilateral school projects, which are supposed to use ICT and electronic communication in their organization and execution. Our colleagues as well as our students will have the chance to experience the European dimension of education and cooperation. Obviously, the results of this part of the project are to be presented and utilized within the school framework and will be made accessible for other colleagues, as well.\r\nWe have planned to send 10 colleagues to take part in 13 different mobility activities. As the project will be running in two separate school years, we will be able to send some teachers to participate in two different activities (training course as well as job shadowing), which is especially valuable for our relatively small staff.\r\nWe expect an immediate improvement of the quality of teaching, especially in the use and implementation of newly acquired technology in the classroom as well as new digital resources. We further expect the project to have a positive impact on our school program development resulting in a long term improvement of the quality of teaching and learning, especially in our catering for the gifted and highly motivated students in the various specializing branches.\r\nLas but not least, the furthering of the European idea and the international networking of the schools involved is a crucial focus of this ERASMUS+ project. We strongly believe that we can utilize experiences and best practices from other European countries and education systems for our future work and school development on the one hand. On the other hand, we believe that we, too, can contribute from our experiences and ideas, to give other European teachers and our partner schools valuable input. Another positive effect will be the development and initialization of bi- and multilateral projects which will give our students great opportunities to experience the importance as well as the chances of international cooperation.", "http://www.oundleschool.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DE03-KA101-035041_1"]]}}, "6HJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Fostering sustainable legume-based farming systems and agri-feed and food chains in the EU", "Pgro Research Limited", "The goal of LEGVALUE is to pave the road to develop sustainable and competitive legume-based farming systems and agri-feed and food chains in the EU. To this end, the project will assess both the economic and environmental benefits for the EU agro industry to widely produce and use legumes in a sustainable manner. Using a list of 20 value chains reflecting the market diversity, and a list of 20 farm networks covering the diversity of grain legumes and fodder legumes species, LEGVALUE will demonstrate the added value of various legumes value chains and will provide a range of solutions to improve the economic interest of each actor involved in the value chains to use legumes. The feature of LEGVALUE is an approach to research that takes stakeholder-driven objectives. The gap between research and practice will be overcome with close collaboration between non-academic actors and scientists. LEGVALUE will result in the first decision tool for farmers to choose the optimal legume species with their adapted crop management and to assess the economic and environmental benefits of legumes in the cropping and grassland systems. LEGVALUE will contribute to identifying the supply chains that are the most competitive to foster legumes crops so helping the EU to identify: i) the technological topics that must be supported in priority to enhance legumes development; ii) insights into how to support actors coordination for better added value sharing iii) the new standards that will help trade and process of legumes. LEGVALUE will provide accurate recommendations for the development of legumes in the EU.

This is achieved via: a true multi-actor approach that balances environmental, economic- and social-securities by minimising environmental impact; optimising diversity and resilience in commercial and environmental terms throughout the supply chain; and delivery of excellent nutrition to ensure the highest possible states of health and wellbeing for people and animals. TRUE will achieve this using a series of 15 farm networks and 7 supply chain focused innovation Case Studies to characterise key mechanisms and associated ecosystem services indicators. This will empower the production of popular and novel legume-based products on the basis of improved market perspectives and capabilities, including short supply chains.

It uses Medicago truncatula as a model to rapidly identify characteristics for introgression into elite pea varieties and a field test of their performance against existing commercial varieties. The project will demonstrate the advantages of applying advanced phenotyping methods for the generation of improved varieties of a commercial crop. Legumes have been chosen as the preferred study crop because they are susceptible to a combination of abiotic and biotic stresses. By increasing their cultivation, they offer the greatest opportunity to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases from agriculture and hence contribute to the efforts to control climate change. Therefore ABSTRESS aligns with the European Strategic Research Agenda 2025.

They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%.
