They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_157"]]}}, "7PA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Rozv\u00edjen\u00ed dialogu lok\u00e1ln\u00edch a evropsk\u00fdch p\u0159\u00edstup\u016f v oborech zam\u011b\u0159en\u00fdch na restaurov\u00e1n\u00ed a design od\u011bvu pro zkvalitn\u011bn\u00ed vzd\u011bl\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed", "Ian George Wall", 51949.0, 7, 11, "The project of the Secondary School of Art and Design and Higher Professional School Brno (HPS) supports professional foreign internships for:\r\na) students/graduates of conservation and restoration departments of HPS (Furniture, Painting, Ceramics; 8 persons) \r\nb) students/graduates of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design (7 persons)\r\nc) HPS staff members (professional instructors, school management; 6 persons)\r\n\r\nThe mobility program plans for internships of one month (students, graduates) or three weeks (staff, management) in four runs over the period from Sept. 2017 to Dec. 2018 in major European urban centres: Vienna, Berlin, Potsdam, Munich, London, Bologna and Houten.\r\nThe host organizations have been chosen with respect to their anticipated benefit for the project participants (e.g. focus on a specific field or technique, modern technologies and materials, professionally suitable destination, topicality \u2013 current trends in the field) while maintaining the aim that the placement corresponds with the abilities/knowledge of each supported person, so that the professional relationships thus established are mutually beneficial. The project complies with HPS\u2018s long-term policy regarding foreign internships (strengthening extant collaborations and further broadening of the host organization network) and with the ideas HPS holds concerning high quality professional internships. \r\nThe project follows previous successful projects, but it also responds to the current needs of the students/instructors at HPS. The feedback is performed through internal questionnaires, multi-level discussion (student/graduate-instructor-school management), in regular instruction, staff meetings and student assemblies. The school uses the EURES platform and organizes special seminars focused on foreign internships and/or employment opportunities on foreign labour markets. The school thus maintains its competitiveness with universities and thereby its attractiveness for future applicants. Another expected effect is broadening of the graduates\u2019 career opportunities, which is expedited by their acquisition of comprehensible European documents (Europass-Mobility, Europass-Diploma Supplement, Europass-CV) and the adoption of ECVET, which is a guarantee of quality for the potential employers. Simultaneously, general awareness about the school is spread through successful graduates, which helps its search for new professional partners. A secondary effect of the steady offer of foreign internships is high motivation for current students.\r\nSelected participants represent all departments at the HPS, i.e. Conservation and Restoration of Furniture and Non-polychromed Woodcarving, C&R of Painting and Decorative Techniques, C&R of Ceramics and Fashion and Textile Design.

Graduates are unfortunately rarely the target group of grant programmes, although it is them who attest to the qualities of their school the most. The education, however, would lose its purpose should the graduates fail to find work in their field. The support should thus be readily available in the most vulnerable stage of their career development, which is why their number is relatively high compared to the day students. \r\n\r\nThe content of the professional internships for C&R students/graduates corresponds with clearly defined units of learning outcomes for each separate department; i.e. the participant will examine, document, propose a restoration treatment and restore the assigned object. The student/graduate of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design will design an article of clothing based on the assigned criteria, justifying his/her choices, and realize it. Staff and management members will fulfil the obligatory Work Programme (job shadowing, exchange of expertise, practical work internship).
