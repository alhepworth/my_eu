This project will examine the Art Nouveau movement in its philosophical and historical context and will draw on its theories and extend them to make them relevant to today's young people. Beauty of function and design will be applied to the creative process and pupils will learn to use recycled materials and the natural form to produce an Art Renouveau house, reexamining the 'total' art style and applying it to the contemporary world. \r\nThe project aims to improve young people's attainment in the areas of literacy, numeracy and science. Transversal skills will be fostered and emphasis will be placed on the development of digital skills, linguistic competence and entrepreneurship. Promoting creativity and the arts in a world which is driven by the material and the technological will add to the personal development of all participants. A major aim of the project is to contribute to the construction of Europe by bringing young people together to learn, collaborate and socialise together.\r\nThere are six partner schools from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Romania, Slovenia and the UK (Scotland). Art Nouveau was an important movement in each country and pupils will observe common threads and local interpretations of the style. In each school, as many pupils as possible will be involved in the project through embedded activities. Teachers, parents, management and the local communities will all be involved. Each year a core group of pupils and staff in each school will follow the project more closely and will cascade to their peers after each Transnational Learning Activity. This core group will not necessarily be the same pupils each year; as pupils leave the schools, they will be replaced by younger ones. The participants come from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds and from differing geographical locations. \r\nThe activities include local and European research into the Art Nouveau movement; exploration of the natural within the local environment with the aim of designing new objects using recycled material drawing on influences in the natural world and thus respecting the theories of the Art Nouveau movement; the development of multi-lingual Town Trails to help young people to discover Art Nouveau in the local environment; enterprise activities which will encourage pupils to design, produce and market stock for school craft fairs; production of a short film in Paris based on Art Nouveau locations; an e-book to showcase results and an itinerant exhibition at the end of the project. \r\nThe methodologies uses will be vary according to the activities. There will be some classroom based learning which will be teacher led. Participants will be expected to undertake individual research, which will be guided by staff. The creative elements of the project will be led by local experts in photography, stained-glass, wrought iron work, film. The hands-on elements of this will allow pupils to develop their creativity under the guidance of professionals and will give them an insight into the working environment of artists. Through blogs, Prezi and film, pupils will learn to work with digital technology and prepare output for a formal audience. \r\nBy the end of the project, pupils will have a greater understanding of their common European cultural heritage. They will understand the importance of art and artistic movements in our common history. Through planning and organising TLAs, they will learn about events management and improve their employability. Fine motor skills will improve due to the manual dexterity needed to make objects for the Art Nouveau house. Participants will have improved their literacy skills in their own tongue and in other languages and their presentation skills should be better. These will all improve their chances of accessing higher education and the world of work. Through the exchange of teaching material, observing each other work and discussions of teaching practices in each country, teachers will have reflected on and improved their own practice. By uploading teaching plans and strategies for this project to the web, they will have shared good practice with the wider community. \r\nIn the final year of the project, pupils will have the satisfaction of seeing the tangible results of their work over three years - an e-book, a film, an exhibition, a blog and website, Town Trails, Prezis, E-Twinning site, etc. Those who have taken part in TLAs will have started building their Europass portfolios. All participants should be more confident in working in a multilingual and international environment.

Today\u2019s science now believes that everywhere is the centre of the universe and that it is, in fact, constantly expanding.  Whatever your beliefs may be, astronomy is at the centre of everything.  It poses the biggest of questions which have fascinated humans throughout history. Where do we come from? Who are we? How can astronomy help us to answer these questions? How can we persuade young people to look to the stars for inspiration? How can we use astronomy to foster a love of maths and science and deepen understanding? Astronomy is a science discipline which changes rapidly, just look at everything we discovered in 2016 alone \u2013 gravitational waves and another ninth planet. How can we make young people aware that scientific knowledge evolves and develops quickly and prepare them for a future in a rapidly changing world? How can we demystify 'hard' science and make it accessible to all?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of our project are to harness our pupils\u2019 curiosity about the \u2018big\u2019 astronomy and physics questions and to use this to improve the delivery of science courses in our schools whilst developing a range of materials and expertise that we can share with colleagues across Europe and beyond. We aim to help young people understand the relationship between astronomy and other sciences and to give them the skills required to develop their knowledge in their future studies. Through working with young people from other countries they will improve their linguistic competence, develop communication skills, understand more about living and working in a multilingual world, celebrate diversity and respect their own culture and that of others. They will gain an enhanced awareness of our shared European history and a sense of themselves as European citizens. \r\nStudents and staff from eight schools from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Macedonia, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and the United Kingdom will take part in this project. A total of approximately 8000 young people will be exposed to the Erasmus experience through activities held in their schools. Within each school there will be a core team of Erasmus pupils and teachers who will lead the work. Activities will be developed to include pupils from the age range of 3-18 and, unusually, they will interact with each other during the project. \r\n\r\nThe range of activities offered will take a holistic approach to the study of astronomy. There will be high-level activities in astronomy and astrophysics aimed at advanced students and introductory activities for the youngest. Music, Art, Maths, Literature, Geography, History and Language departments will embed learning and teaching activities on the theme of astronomy in their programmes. There will be a balance between classroom-based learning and collaborative work. Pupils will work together in the classroom and also in the digital classroom, allowing them to collaborate with young people in other countries. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodologies uses will be chosen to suit the activity. We will use hands-on, experiential learning as much as possible and pupils will be encouraged to work in groups and to share their findings. Class teaching will underpin the material studied. To encourage interaction between the participants, eTwinning and digital resources will be used to share and store materials. Regular meetings and video-conferences will be timetabled.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, the tangible results will be a range of open access learning and teaching material which will be published on eTwinning and the web. These will be available in English and in the national languages of the project. The impact envisaged is deeper understanding of a range of scientific and mathematical principles amongst our pupils, a greater sense of European citizenship, improved linguistic competence and digital literacy and the development of lifeskills which will lead to greater opportunities in employment.
