The high level of social exclusion among young people from a public care background, coupled with some evidence of their heterogeneity and resourcefulness, makes this discreet group a valuable case for investigating the educational prospects for, achievements of, and barriers facing all socially excluded young people. The overall aim of the proposed project is to contribute to the knowledge and policy development and changes in practice that may lead to the retention of many more young men and women from a public care background in education after the end of compulsory schooling and to open up the prospect of further and higher education to them.  Specific objectives are to: i) map current knowledge about educational participation among young people from a public care background; ii) track and evaluate the educational plans and pathways of a sample of 19-21 year-olds from a public care background; iii) identify the conditions within the care and education systems that facilitate or inhibit entry to and continuation in post-compulsory education; and iv) explore young people\u2019s constructions of educational identities and trajectories in terms of class, gender, race, ethnicity and care responsibilities both from the perspective of young men and women themselves and of carers and staff in services designed to support them.

Yet, most learning systems that have been developed for mathematics education have two significant limitations: first, they are usually constrained to text-based interactions and are thus hard to use by young learners (6 to 11-year-olds) who are still perfecting their basic literacy skills. Second, support is rarely tailored to the children's needs in an adaptive fashion, even though depending on the current stage of the learning process, the support that children need varies between structured practice and more exploratory, conceptually-oriented learning.<br/>The Intelligent Tutoring and Exploration for Robust Learning project aims to facilitate robust learning by creating a platform for intelligent support that combines structured learning with exploratory learning activities and applies cognitive models of the learning behaviour of students in elementary education. Relying on state-of-the-art machine learning methods, intelligent components will be able to provide adaptive feedback -- e.g., praise or hints --and suggest subsequent tasks. The platform will enable learners to communicate and interact more naturally via rich intuitive user interfaces leveraging direct manipulation and, in particular, natural language user interfaces.

Without basic S&M knowledge it is not possible to understand many of the important issues that confront us, such as global warming or genetic modification. A general lack of S&M literacy makes the ideal of Europe as a participatory democracy an unattainable goal, and means that the new products required for thriving in a global knowledge economy will not be developed. To address this problem, this project proposes to explore the potential of social learning for S&M by providing a visual language to support online groups in designing their own learning together. To gain deep knowledge of any specific domain learners need to integrate learning experiences with shared reflection through dialogue, in a way that builds conceptual understanding cumulatively. To this end, the objectives of the proposed project are: to further our understanding of meta-learning within collaborative communities engaged in S&M learning; to design a visual language to support students' reflection on their individual and collaborative learning; to implement a platform integrating state-of-the-art argumentation tools with exploratory environments; to develop an adaptive diagnostic system utilizing AI techniques to support students and teachers during the collaboration and learning to learn process; to develop appropriate pedagogies to inform the design of the technical system; and to design new forms of assessment of the individual and collaborating learning exploiting the diagnostic system.

Current research reveals that NEETs often lack self-confidence and the essential social skills needed to seek and secure employment. Youth inclusion associations across Europe provide social coaching programmes, in order to help young people acquire and improve their social competencies.  However, it is an expensive and time-consuming approach that relies on the availability of trained practitioners as well as the willingness of the young people to engage in exploring their social strengths and weakness in front of their peers and practitioners.Digital technologies such as serious-games offer the advantage of repeatable experience that can be modulated to suit the individual needs of the young people. Additionally, such technologies are intrinsically motivating to the young and carry the potential of removing the many barriers that real-life situations may pose, in particular the stress associated with engaging in unfamiliar interactions with others.TARDIS aims to build a scenario-based serious-game simulation platform for young people at risk of exclusion, aged 18-25, to explore, practice and improve their social skills.  TARDIS will facilitate the interaction through virtual agents (VAs) acting as recruiters in job interviews scenarios. The VAs are designed to deliver realistic socio-emotional interactions and are credible, yet tireless interlocutors. TARDIS exploits the unique affordances of digital technology, by creating an environment in which the quality and the quantity of emotional display by the agents can be modulated to scaffold the young trainees through a diverse range of possible interview situations.

Second, it will provide field practitioners with an intuitive authoring tool for designing appropriate interview scenarios and for setting agents' behaviours without the help of computer scientists. Third, it will give practitioners a unique access to a systematic record of the specific difficulties that the users experience.

The training material produced by ADLAB PRO will be open, online and free, but also modular and fully customizable: it will be possible to use the modules all together as a comprehensive course, or separately in different constellations. This offers added value to the project (1) enabling anyone to access and be trained via this material, regardless of their professional or academic background; (2) offering its deliverables worldwide, thus enabling EU\u2019s know-how, access concepts and guidelines to be disseminated effortlessly across the globe; and (3) securing resilience, since the online material will have validity for many years. Since media accessibility and AD are still unknown to many countries, the curriculum and the training material produced by ADLAB PRO may seem dated in regions where accessibility and AD are well under way (UK, USA), but will be cutting edge for others (Myanmar, Balkan regions, etc.).", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA203-024311_1"], [2015, "EDUCARE", "ROYAL NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF THE BLIND", 13743.0, 8, 10, "EDUCARE is a European staff exchange programme where partner organisations have found a common interest in the theme of behavioural problems in connection with visual impairment.

This project makes a clear proposition: in order for early career artists to develop their artistic voice and entrepreneurial instincts they need the support of a producer and an audience from the very start of the creative process. In order to test this proposition we will develop:1. The shared practice of early career choreographers together with early career creative producers, inviting them to develop both the artistic and production process together. 2. A strategy for involving audiences in the process of making work, and not just the finished product. Audience development becomes a key way of sharpening the creative process.We aim to develop an articulated cultural entrepreneurship in choreographers and producers which encourages them to consider how partnerships both within the cultural sector and with a public audience outside it can add value to their process, as well as their product. We are proposing a shift in the dance industry for the next generation of makers and audience whereby they go on a creative journey together rather than meeting at the end. The three project partners are international leaders in supporting emerging artists and so are ideally placed to effect a significant shift in behaviour across Europe.
