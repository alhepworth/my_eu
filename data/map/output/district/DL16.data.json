It is not enough to remember given data and gain technical knowledge as learning is a difficult process which produces relatively permanent changes. \r\n\r\nOur working methodology aims at creating/developing practical experiments/ activities/real situations for theoretical knowledge given in kindergarten curricula. We aim to connect both types of knowledge and provide holistic learning.\r\n\r\nSince this is a kindergarten level project, there will be basic level of activities. Kids are our major target groups and  that is why clubs activities will be transformed into plays to make their learning more enjoyable and memorable. Teachers will be the main actors in the project. They will develop practical experiments and activities for kids and prepare a systematic education programme depending on our approach in the project.

Tallinn Tondi School is municipal school providing compulsory  education for children with intellectual and multiple disabilities. Teaching is given on  three different levels. Our goal is to provide the best conditions for learning considering the abilities. Our mission is to prepare the graduates to manage as independent life as possible in the future. The more different skills we manage to teach, the more easier our graduates can integrate to the society and feel full members of it. For the state it means less expenses to social support in future. We try to improve teaching  quality through  systematic training, in co-operation with colleagues from other schools in Estonia and abroad.  We are looking to Europe as their experience is decades ahead us. Teaching children with special needs in Estonia is mainly based on so called Russian (Soviet) school. Contemporary methods in Europe has been developed through the decades. Our approach to more European school has been random. \r\nFor choosing our partners we have used our old contacts from previous projects and training needs the management has set. We also have asked the opinion of our school staff. We have chosen for practical training two schools - The Oak Secondary School in UK and St. Augustines National School  in Ireland. One teacher will go to obtain practical skills as teacher's helper, the other will be as work shadow to get the skills how to manage environmental orientated school and how to co-operate with community.  \r\nChosen courses in Portugal and Italy help the teacher know how to increase the motivation to learn and improve the social skills of the children. Theoretical parts vary with practical workshops. In addition the program includes schools visits and introduction to local culture and traditions.  \r\nWe have appointed the manager to successfully lead the project. She will organise the registrations to the courses as well negotiations with partner schools. She also co-ordinates the program at partner schools and necessary safety agreements.\r\nThe participants should be chosen during the 1st semester. Depending on the need we could arrange the language courses.\r\nThe participant can be either from the management or other staff. The most important criteria is the ability to adopt in different environment and receive special knowledge. The participant should be ready to organise inner training for our other school staff.\r\nThrough the project the participant gains international experience and knowledge in work with children with special needs. In addition personal contacts with colleagues from other European schools. This allows the participant to evaluate the status of the teacher (to compare pluses and minuses). Spending time alone in foreign speaking environment positively affects the language skills.\r\nThe participant will receive the Europass certificate. This is the evidence of the level of skills obtained through training abroad. This could be needed while certifying the skills. \r\nAt the same time the school receives motivated employer, fresh ideas and inner training for the staff.  Considering the poor variety of teaching material, we hope to get some ideas on that ground as well. Besides above we strengthen the ties between the partner schools for future co-operation. The quality of education improves through international co-operation. \r\nWe evaluate the project through inner trainings. If the participant is able to forward the knowledge to the others, it means he or she has understood the content and is able to use the the skills in everyday work. We hope that the participants with their fresh energy will motivate the others to look for new approaches and see the world with open eyes.", "http://www.theoaks.durham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EE01-KA101-000059_1"]]}}}}
