This transition requires adoption of novel reactor technologies, greener reactions and the increase in the use of intelligent systems in processing industries. The latter means improving processes through use of real-time information and ability to affect processes in real time. The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO). The approach of COOPOL is to develop robust real-time optimisation-based control and sensing methodologies and through their application to achieve, in parallel, the intensification of (i) the existing processes, and (ii) the development of novel intensive \u2018smart-scale\u2019 processes.

This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through CrossCompetence, the VET school \"Caselli\" and the other three sending VET schools (IIS \"Roncalli\", the Technical Institute \"Bandini\" and the ISS, \"S. Giovanni Bosco\") aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (cultural heritage management, communication, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for 65 students/learners (including 5 disabled or with special needs students) and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the 4 participating VET schools. The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the sector of cultural industries and tourism, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level.

The development of ECVET began in 2002 after the Copenhagen Process emphasizing the need for a credit transfer system for VET. CrossCompetence is a project based on the concrete responses to the questions of developing ECVET in the European member States and corresponding to the 2009 EU Recommendations on the establishment of the European Credit system for VET. The project works in particular to realise an European area for Lifelong Learning in the field of cultural industries and the promotion and management of tourism.\r\nThe whole activities are implemented by regarding a strong European perspective which are reflected in all project activities and results.

Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages.

This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through this project, the VET school(Escuela Profesional de Hosteleria de Jerez) aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (hospitality, tourism promotion and management), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 strategy is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 4 weeks for Level 1 students/ and a 3-month internship for 60 recent graduates from the Level 2 and 3 . The training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the sector of Hospitality industries and tourism, to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and compare the various professional techniques, and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the students, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a permanent network of transnational public-institutional organisations and not only, therefore, is one of the main objectives of the project and allows the exchange of experiences and best practices at various levels (technical excellence, best practices in educational policies and governance of the system). The Consortium, with this proposal, therefore, aims to give momentum to the internationalization of institutional relations and cooperation at European level. The opportunities for economic and social growth cannot be separated from the desire to create strong interdependence and synergy between educational and training institutions and strong partnerships with local and foreign business realities.\r\n\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic approached such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\". The development of ECVET began in 2002 after the Copenhagen Process emphasizing the need for a credit transfer system for VET. CrossCompetence is a project based on the concrete responses to the questions of developing ECVET in the European member States and corresponding to the 2009 EU Recommendations on the establishment of the European Credit system for VET. The project works in particular to realise an European area for Lifelong Learning in the field of cultural industries and the promotion and management of tourism.\r\n\r\nThe whole activities are implemented by regarding a strong European perspective which are reflected in all project activities and results. The project aims to increase the knowledge of ECVET and its technical specifications and ensuring that the added value of ECVET is understood and perceived all over Europe.", "http://www.theritzlondon.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA102-002802_10"]]}}, "9HF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1393632000000, 1504137600000, "Open Water Management - from droplets of participation to streams of knowledge", "Waterwise Project Ltd", "Efficient water management is a challenging issue with the potential to affect the long-term well-being, economy and security of society. Policies for sustainable water management have been established in the EU. However measures to support efficient water use for citizens are currently lacking. Consumers have limited means to accurately monitor their water consumption and thus stimuli to modify their behaviour towards a sustainable lifestyle.A potentially groundbreaking approach for efficient water use and reuse lies within the empowerment of consumers. The principles of open knowledge and participation have provided solutions and driven innovation in similar challenging and complex issues. We believe that a similar bottom up method, in which citizens can voluntarily adopt low cost water monitoring services, self-induce behavioural changes, and accordingly demand better services, can be a catalyst for large-scale changes in efficient water management.The DAIAD  project constitutes an innovative approach for addressing the challenge of efficient water management through real-time knowledge of residential water consumption, bringing together leading members of the water and ICT domains. Our goal is to research and develop innovative low cost, inclusive technologies for real-time, high granularity water monitoring and knowledge extraction. We will devise multi-modal feedback interfaces, recommendation, and analysis services to communicate knowledge and incur behavioural changes to consumers in residential settings. We will apply big data management and analysis technologies to provide efficient management and analysis of real-time water consumption data, as well as multiple relevant data sources. This will enable water stakeholders to gain novel insight and explore the hidden correlations of the parameters that shape water demand strategies and water pricing, thus leading to more efficient water management.", 379457.0, 3459156.0, 5, 7, "DAIAD", null, null, null, "fp7_189046_986502029"], [1351728000000, 1446249600000, "Improved Water efficiency through ICT technologies for integrated supply-Demand side manaGEmenT", "Waterwise Project Ltd", "The aim of iWIDGET is to advance knowledge and understanding about smart metering technologies in order to develop novel, robust, practical and cost-effective methodologies and tools to manage urban water demand in households across Europe, by reducing wastage, improving utility understanding of end-user demand and reducing customer water and energy costs.The main scientific challenges for iWIDGET are the management and extraction of useful information from vast amounts of high-resolution consumption data, the development of customised intervention and awareness campaigns to influence behavioural change, and the integration of iWIDGET concepts into a set of decision-support tools for water utilities and consumers, applicable in differing local conditions.In order to meet these aims and challenges, iWIDGET will investigate: (i) how best to provide the dynamic accurate measurement and data transfer of useful information about end-user water consumption, (ii) how best to use consumption data to improve the operation of utilities and influence end-users to modify their behaviour, (iii) how to arrive at the best business model to convert a promising technology into a useful and cost-effective product, and (iv) how to demonstrate and validate the new methodologies on two case studies in the North and South of Europe.", 142195.0, 4024767.0, 5, 10, "iWIDGET", null, null, null, "fp7_105822_986502029"]]}}}}
