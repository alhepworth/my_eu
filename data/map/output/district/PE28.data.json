These are attractive diseases for gene therapy since they compromise a diverse family of rare genetic diseases typically caused by single gene defects that often provoke significant morbidity and mortality due to skeletal muscle, cardiac and/or diaphragm dysfunction. There are no effective cures and current treatment is suboptimal. MYOCURE focuses specifically on overcoming the key bottlenecks that hamper muscle-directed gene therapy by (i) boosting gene transfer using muscle-specific adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) generated de novo by directed molecular evolution (ii) increasing expression by using robust computationally designed muscle-specific promoters that are 400-fold more efficient than the state of the art, allowing the use of lower and thus safer therapeutic vector doses (iii) minimize undesirable immune reactions against the vector, gene-modified muscle cells and therapeutic proteins. The efficacy and safety of this advanced therapy medical product (ATMP) will be validated in preclinical MTM and GSD II animal models. A scalable manufacturing process will be developed for subsequent toxicology studies and an orphan drug designation will be applied for. MYOCURE will consolidate a roadmap towards clinical development and economic valorisation and maximize dissemination to the relevant stakeholders. The outcome of MYOCURE will constitute the basis of a Phase I gene therapy clinical trial in MTM and GSD patients consistent with the IRDiRC objectives to provide 200 therapies for rare disease by 2020.

Viscogel has excellent adjuvant properties: strongly immunostimulatory, stable, easy to manufacture, pronounced depot effect and possibility to obtain products of GMP quality. In addition Viscogel is mucoadhesive and in combination with LTX cell penetrating, making it suitable for mucosal administration. The target applications to be demonstrated in the ViVac project are i) prophylactic vaccination against common infectious diseases, and ii) therapeutic allergy vaccination.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in other countries and gain valuable experience. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields remains difficult in Iceland and students have had problems finding apprenticeships. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring, upholstery and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to ensure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to keep up with the development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, 14 students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for one to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Lithuania and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nStudy trips for groups of students serve to introduce to them the opportunities available in working and studying abroad. Vocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad. TCR emphasizes collaboration with schools in other European countries, making sure to keep students informed of the possibilities of studying abroad and encouraging them to make use of the possibilities. On their return students give presentations about their trips to teachers and other students  and lately, video presentations have gained popularity with the students which has led to an increased interest among other students. \r\nGetting to know how study programs for specializations in certified trades are set up and carried out in other countries offers students a valuable experience and after going on group trips former students of TCR say that they gained confidence and courage to apply for work or schools abroad. In the spring term of 2018 graduated students of TCR are studying at schools they visited on their trips and others are applying for work with companies they visited with their groups. \r\nThis application is for groups of students to go on 14-day study trips or courses with accompanying teachers. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers during the first few days of their trips. During and after group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades.\r\nThis application is for 11 student groups to go on14-day trips, a total of 89 students and 11 teachers.\r\nThe opportunity to get to know how study programs for specializations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad is invaluable for teachers. Many of the schools to which visits are planned are larger and offer a wider range of study programs than Icelandic schools. TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programs that meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. The study programs and courses at TCR are in constant development to ensure that students are ready for the requirements of the international job market when they complete their studies. Schools from other countries have also been very interested in visiting TCR to work on collaboration and student exchange. By visiting schools abroad teachers and the staff of TCR get a better and deeper insight into their operations before sending students abroad to study. \r\nThe grant application includes an application for grants to 16 members of staff for 5-day trips.\r\nPast trips have made a great contribution to school work, and as an example, the project manager of studies and two students at the School of Web development recently received recognition for their work, the project manager for the development of studies in web development and the students for their work in web design.
