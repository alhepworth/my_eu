International activities aim to enhance knowledge, skills and competences of the students and staff. Mobility includes both student mobility with supporting staff and Luovi\u2019s staff mobility.  New partnerships and possibilities usually are opened throughout the staff exchange, which is a vital part of regenerating the international activities.  \r\n\r\nErasmus + VET Mobility Charter makes long-term planning possible. We aim at promoting equal opportunities to participate in mobility. We want to offer possibilities in all the VQs and to link internationality in all the learning by implementing international paths. \r\n\r\nStaff exchanges are a part of staff development and included in annual development and competence discussions between employees and superiors. The objectives are based on the Luovi priorities and exchanges enable sharing of good practices and methods of teaching and promoting employability. Work experiences of staff enhance the professional competence and knowledge of European world of work. We aim to pilot the international path model for staff as well as learning badges to recognize and validate international competences. We are committed to enhance the quality of international activities and we develop processes together with European partners in KA2 strategic partnerships project Premier. In addition, we participate in a pilot project funded by European Commission and coordinated by Kainuun Ammattiopisto in order to enhance long-term mobility. \r\n\r\nWe aim to develop students ' skills in working life and to promote students' professional growth, social skills, as well as everyday living skills. The participants are second or third year students with special needs in initial vocational training. They are studying for vocational qualifications in the following fields of education:  tourism, catering and domestic services,   natural resources and environment, technology, communication and Transport sector and Social sciences, business and administration and culture.  The placements will be carried out in small groups and there will be at least one accompanying person from Luovi to support the students.  The on-the-job-learning is carried out either in the units of partner organizations or in local enterprises.  \r\n\r\nThe role of accompanying persons is crucial in implementation of student mobilities. Accompanying persons support the students at work places and during the free time e.g. encouraging students to speak in a foreign language and motivating them by coaching the students.\r\n\r\nWhat is new?\r\n\r\nWe have included new partners and countries in this application in order to attract more students and staff to participate. We have created new partnerships in international projects funded by Finnish National Agency for Education. The new partners are from United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. We plan to have reciprocal mobility with Wolverhampton and Dutch partner. We will go on cooperation with reliable partners in Germany, France, Slovenia and Estonia. \r\n\r\nWe have created a common platform for blog writings for students and staff, Luovi.fi/international and it serves for reporting. The feedback has been very positive and we go on developing the blog further. We also aim to update the student mobility process and build the application process in electronic format.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate each mobility and international activities are evaluated according to Luovi\u2019s annual plan.", "http://www.wvtc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046890_8"]]}}, "2LH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Making the parts \u2018whole\u2019 \u2013 developing observation and assessment in transdisciplinary classrooms.", "Ashmore Park Nursery School", 102839.0, 4, 9, "This project will be between early childhood educators in four European countries, UK, Sweden, Spain and Romania. It has a clear focus on the development, evaluation and dissemination of innovative classroom approaches for children from birth to 7 years old and the educators who work with them. \r\n \r\nThe project title is; Making the parts \u2018whole\u2019 - developing observation and assessment in transdisciplinary classrooms. This focus arises from the pedagogical approach of all of the schools involved and is an evolution of ongoing school improvement research between some of the schools.  \r\n\r\nWe will develop, test and evaluate school environments that not only recognise and promote cross-curricular learning, but also define conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and translational innovations that integrate and move beyond discipline-specific approaches to curriculum. The objective includes a focus on creating, observing and assessing how transdisciplinary environments can be developed to promote young children's pro-social and self regulation behaviours, essential to being an effective learner in school and how they promote inclusion by changing classroom culture to recognise and value diversity as enhancing education for everyone.\r\n \r\nThe objectives for all schools are:\r\n1) To develop innovative classroom environments for children that support transdisciplinary pedagogies.\r\n2) To create descriptions and analysis of how children learn in transdisciplinary classrooms that show the creativity generated through interactions between concepts and curriculum areas.\r\n3) To create new observation and assessment materials that support transdisciplinary classrooms and which are relevant for children in the pre-primary and primary phases and in different national contexts.\r\n4) To increase the development of pro-social skills and self-regulation in children through transdisciplinary classrooms.\r\n5) To increase the inclusion of children from vulnerable groups by revealing the strategies that all children use to express ideas and make meaning in their learning through reports, case studies and pedagogical documentation arising from the project.\r\n6) To develop the knowledge, skills and confidence of educators to describe, understand and communicate children's learning and adults teaching in the transdisciplinary environment.\r\n7) To include the participation of parents in their children's early education during the project.\r\n \r\nThis project will be built around transnational training / study weeks in other schools in other cultural, social and historical contexts. Through previous project work we have found this to be a dynamic strategy for change, both with the practitioners visiting other schools and for those receiving visitors. \r\n \r\nThis professional exchange is more powerful in a transnational context for three main reasons; as our observations are less focused on the singular, dominant language, we will be observing the holistic communication of children and not relying so heavily on their verbal skills. Also we focus on the relationships of teaching and learning and are less likely to feel restrained or hindered by preconceptions of limitations imposed by local or national curriculum frameworks and educational regulations. Lastly, the active presence of educators from other countries within a school also has many benefits for promoting positive cultural relations with parents, families and the wider community of the school, supporting the development of participation, tolerance, value and understanding in the wider community of a school.\r\n\r\nIn the framework of the Erasmus+ project, we are going to develop our project based in formal and informal education methodologies. We\u2019ll start with an introduction of the new transdiscplinary methodology and also with a theoretical approach based on the work of Gregory Bateson that challenges us to see the connections, relations and intra-actions in our methods of teaching and children's learning arising from Loris Malaguzzi's proposition of a Hundred Languages of Children.\r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level the desired impact will be:\r\n- Increased awareness of how children learn.\r\n- increased confidence to promote and engage in classroom innovation.\r\n- increased use of innovative methods of observation, evaluation and assessment that result in rich, engaging classroom environments and curricular opportunities for children.\r\n- increased commitment, confidence and actions to promote inclusion and equality.\r\n\r\nAt a national and European level the desired impact will be:\r\n- used in learning from the project through pedagogical documentation and case studies and open access observations and assessment tools that will be shared through professional networks through organisations involved in the inspiration of working with Reggio Emilia values and principles and other early years organisations such as Early Education, Sightlines Initiative, BEECERA The Reggio Emilia Institute, Stockholm and Modern Childhood magazine.", "http://www.ashmoreparknursery.co.uk", "Madeley Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036796_8"], [2015, "'We Think Everywhere' - New Pedagogies - Embracing the Digital World of Children", "Ashmore Park Nursery School", 80288.0, 2, 9, "This project will investigate and develop innovative pedagogical methods in which digital media is used to generate thinking, knowledge and learning in very young children. Initial research revealed a dominant discourse where digital media was conceived as a set of tools to acquire and represent information; or as a place to use games to practice skills.\r\nWe challenge this view and will develop teaching methods and learning strategies that use digital media as part of a multi-disciplinary approach involving communication, mathematics and science, humanities, social and civic competence, cultural awareness and creative expression supported, enriched and made visible to others using digital media. It will become part of the everyday life of Pre-School.\r\nThis project is part of a professional development alliance that started in 2011.

These will be enhanced through face to face meetings and through transnational exchange and evaluated against DIGCOMP: A Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe. \r\nOur outputs include a range of inspiring and informative on-line and hard copy resources in 2 written and spoken languages. \r\nThe project will challenge traditional ideals and ways of seeing learning referencing Delueze and Guttarri\u2019s Rhizome Theory, Bateson\u2019s The Pattern that Connects and Reggio Emilia\u2019s concept of 100 Languages.  These conceptual frameworks have influenced the development of pedagogy in each of the partner schools in both countries. \r\nThe project is conceived as a series of case studies which will draw upon semi-structured focus groups (identified shared network days and leadership meetings), personal reflective journals of each teacher, the documentation of process and shared analysis of pedagogical documentation produced within and as an outcome of the project.\r\nThe structure of the project invites international confrontation of multiple perspectives upon episodes of children\u2019s meaning-making in group contexts using digital media as a tool of creative expression and enquiry.  This shared analysis will identify the patterns of development in children and pedagogical practice that can be articulated and shared through the website, publishing, video and training materials and replicated in other ECE contexts and beyond into Primary phase.\r\nDuring the project we will be developing new pedagogies that exploit the potential of ICT which is a key issue addressed in the Communication on Rethinking Education (in particular, chapter 2.2), and the enhancement of digital competence which is one of the main pillars of the Digital Agenda for Europe [71], and also one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. \r\nWithin the participating schools digital resources of all types will be used during lessons by children to support learning as digital media to be a part of the everyday life of preschool as an expressive language to facilitate and support enquiry. \r\nTeachers will have increased complexity of understanding and increased confidence in using digital technologies in meaningful, necessary ways that support children\u2019s learning and communication and be able to train and mentor others within and beyond the participating school at a local, regional, national and international level. The new methods will be transferrable for use with different digital platforms and digital hardware. It will have relevance to a wide audience that can be readily shared across national contexts and used by educators in ECE and beyond into primary phases of school.
