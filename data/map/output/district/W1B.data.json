Entrepreneurship meant as a basic skill is the leit motif of our strategic plan and it will be the goal of the whole plan of activities. Other objectives are:\r\n- offering quality and variety to our teaching offer; offering job opportunities; orienteering to career; improving a sense of European and global identity; promoting innovation at school; improving linguistic competences to overcome linguistic and cultural borders; promoting mobility in Europe and in the world and allow success into the more and more fast-moving and demanding job market   \r\n- creating an updated learning environment to enable self-discovery and fulfilment, to create interest and awareness implementing CLIL methodologies; implementing a EU dimension in the school curricola and of the credit transfer system like  ECVET e EUROPASS\r\n- developing competences and skills in using new media in students and staff to fill in the gap between the teachers' and the digital natives' worlds, by creating a common language; facilitating learning with diversified paths, overcoming borders and obstacles.\r\nAccording to the VET Mobility Chart, the number of  beneficiaries will be 60 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing) and recent graduates of our school. The group includes disables, disadvantaged students and with learning difficulties. First learners will improve their competences in foreign language used abroad and will attend a pedagogic/professional training; after they will do a 4-week work placement to develop their field competences with a focus on fusion food and catering/tourism trends and social marketing. We will take advantage of ErasmusPro to offer 3-month mobilities to 2 recent graduates to give added value, develop job specific skills thus boosting their employability.   \r\nGiven the large number of mobilities, they will be no more restricted to excellence but offered in a systematic way to all students with good behaviour, increasing motivation and promoting school success as planned in our school mission. Our school will gain an international dimension and will convey good practises in the area. \r\nStudents will be accompanied by 1teacher given the large number of minors and disadvantaged students+ 1 extra for fluxes with  students with special needs.  \r\nThe staff mobilities will be 25 (management and school staff) to offer wider opportunities to develop competences, overcome disaffection and spread passion for teaching. The mobilities will be concentrated on jobshadowing, workshops, courses about foreign languages,  new teaching tecHniques, CLIL and exchange of good practises.\r\nOn the return, the students will organise an event to put into practise the new skills gained: the cooking team will prepare fusion dishes, the bar/service team will serve fusion cocktails and arrange new setting up,  the hospitality team will think about a suitable welcoming while the marketing staff will plan a marketing campaign to launch the event on the social media. The guests will be local authorities and representatives of local associations to give visibility to the project. The staff  will spread the new methodologies learnt in their department and in the whole school and will put into practice their new skills in their classes. Everybody will  update learning paths and will spread an international dimension at school, a dynamic, motivating climate to get success and personal fulfilment\r\nAccording to the internationalisation process, the network has been reinforced: we have chosen to keep the partners we trust and that are located in strategic markets  as well as to keep the prestigious cooperation we have with overseas partners, especially due to the project topic. We have added 3 prestigious partners: a 5-star hotel a London icon, a starred restaurant in Copenaghen and a refined restaurant in the heart of London.\r\nIndeed we believe that training should be opened to an international market to mirror the multicultural, global composition of our society.

Let's Go is a \"multi- sectorial\" project because it involves young people from different professional backgrounds (33% catering, 20 % mechanical, 17% agro-alimentary transformation, 7% of electricity, 10% of thermo-plumbing, 10 % well-being, 3% graphics). The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing). Lets'Go project also provides for the use of ECVET tools (learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding) for the personalized design of transnational mobility, in view of the enhancement of learning outcomes, acquired in the individual experiences of mobility. The mobilities include the realization of internships in enterprise, being this a true learning context (Work-based Learning). The expected impacts are of long-term and  they are related to the design of mobility as an active investment of the promoter in social and employment integration policies.

NFV leverages commodity servers and storage, including cloud platforms, to enable rapid deployment, reconfiguration and elastic scaling of network functionalities.With the aim of promoting the NFV concept, T-NOVA introduces a novel enabling framework, allowing operators not only to deploy virtualized Network Functions (NFs) for their own needs, but also to offer them to their customers, as value-added services. Virtual network appliances (gateways, proxies, firewalls, transcoders, analyzers etc.) can be provided on-demand as-a-Service, eliminating the need to acquire, install and maintain specialized hardware at customers' premises.
