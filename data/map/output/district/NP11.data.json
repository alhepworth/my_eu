It is the outcome of a joint vision by the two major European engine manufacturer Groups MAN & WARTSILA, which together hold 90% of the world\u2019s marine engine market.\nThe present proposed HERCULES-C project is the Phase III of the HERCULES Programme. In order to take marine engine technology a step further towards improved sustainability in energy production and total energy economy, an extensive integration of the multitude of the new technologies developed in Phases I and II is required. HERCULES-C addresses this challenge by adopting a combinatory approach for engine thermal processes optimization, system integration, as well as engine reliability and lifetime.\nThe first Objective of HERCULES-C is to achieve further substantial reductions in fuel consumption, while optimizing power production and usage. This will be achieved through advanced engine developments in combustion and fuel injection, as well as through the optimization of ship energy management and engine technologies supporting transport mission management.\nThe second Objective of HERCULES-C is to achieve near-zero emissions by integrating the various technologies developed in the previous research Projects, in Phases I and II.\nThe third Objective is to maintain the technical performance of engines throughout their operational lifetime. This requires advanced materials and tribology developments to improve efficiency and reliability, as well as sensors, monitoring and measurement technologies to improve the controllability and availability of marine power plants.\nThe project HERCULES-C structure of RTD work comprises 47 Subprojects, grouped into 10 Work Packages and 5 Work Package Groups, spanning the complete spectrum of marine diesel engine technology.\nThe HERCULES-C Project has duration of 36 months, a Consortium with 22 participants. and a total budget of EUR 17 million.'", 53629.0, 14002959.0, 10, 23, "HERCULES-C", "http://www.hercules-c.com", "http://www.ep-coatings.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112127.jpg", "fp7_102006_952785702"]]}}, "7NP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Assistant trainers sharing knowledge", "UK YOUTH CIRCUS NETWORK", 211837.0, 11, 11, "The project Assistant trainers sharing knowledge (ASK) focuses on a group that has not received much attention before: the assistant trainers in youth circuses.

During different meetings and projects of representatives of the umbrella organizations in Europe it became clear, that they face similar tasks. One of the most important is to develop a system of teaching the trainers. And to find out how learning should be organized in youth circus as a part of nonformal education. All involved countries expressed the need of improvement in the pedagogical education of circus trainers.\r\nCircus as part of youth work promotes empowerment, participation and active citizenship. And it is used increasingly in neighboring fields of youth work. Because it helps young people trust themselves, to find a place in society and even find a job it is supported by the governments more and more in the work with disadvantaged youth.\r\nOut of that experience with the expertise of the partners and of pedagogical experts we want to\r\n\u2022\trise quality of teaching through implementing innovative curricula in all countries.\r\n\u2022\tthrough this and practical tools give an understanding also to other youth workers who use circus as a means, what the learner centred method means in reality and how it can be used together with teacher centred methods.\r\n\u2022\tfind a way to be aware as a trainer to always reflect the role as a instructor, to be objective, to know how to step aside from the role and look from distance.

There is a strong need for more well-organized circus activities in the youth field all around Europe as circus is an activity that can support and connect together young people from all kinds of backgrounds. There is a lot more young people wanting to participate in youth circus than there is possibilities for participation. This is very much due to the lack of skilled teachers and functioning youth circus organisations and the lack of knowledge in the youth sector about the ways to involve circus as a method in youth work.The project is conducted by nine organizations. All partner organizations are national umbrella organizations in the youth circus field or have a similar, unofficial position representing the wider youth circus field in their country. This provides the partners with a good overview of the whole field in their countries as well as the needs and demands that the youth circuses have. The organisations also have good networks in their countries which means that the project results will not only stay within the participating organisations but touch a very large group of young people and youth organizations.
