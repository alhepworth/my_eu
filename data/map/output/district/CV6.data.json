With the spirit of appreciation for the individual, fellowship, learning from each other and imparting guidance and values while living and working together in nature, treehouse projects offer young people a multifaceted opportunity to gain valuable experiences and to develop personally \u2013 thereby empowering them to reach their full potential. It is also inclusive for disadvantaged youth and raises the awareness for questions connected to sustainability and the environment. That is why we would like to introduce and multiply the YMCA\u2019s treehouse concept within Germany and Europe as an innovative method of youth work in the partner countries, to qualify youth workers to lead treehouse projects, to connect the existing projects and to get to know and reflect on educational training and safety concepts, and to propagate the idea and practice of Treehouse Camps in Europe. Thus, we will invite 39 participants from 15 partner organisations in 13 countries to participate in the European YMCA Treehouse Leaders Trainee Camp in Michelstadt. The participants are employed and volunteer social workers, outdoor and experiential learning specialists, camp managers and YMCA secretaries from different European countries. During the Treehouse Leaders Camp we will develop and convey leadership skills, training expertise and program implementation skills. The participants will learn, exchange and reflect on training and safety concepts as well as educational and value oriented concepts together and will create spaces of learning of living together in nature. At the same time, participants will get trained in pioneer-techniques, techniques of tree climbing, handling robes and other materials, making nodes, etc. Specialists working with young people in the area of child and youth welfare can further develop their skills in outdoor and experiantial learning pedagogy with the innovative specialisation of Treehouse Camps on a European level, which will further strengthen the quality development of child and youth care in Europe.", "http://www.ymca-cw.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE04-KA105-012283_12"]]}}, "5DP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Pom\u00f3\u017ccie nam pom\u00f3c im.

Art Therapy as a key to disabled communication \u201c is directed to SOSW teachers and therapists, who work with special needs children on a daily basis. The main objective of the project (and an answer our biggest needs in everyday work) is to create tools and condition for a verbal and non-verbal communication improvement among our pupils. Because of perceptive difficulties, children show difficult behavior that disturb their relation with environment. Despite our experience, sometimes we are not able to understand our pupils\u2019 emotions and needs. We try to effectively communicate with them and respond to their needs. In education and therapy we are looking for new solutions that address these needs and abilities of children. Art Therapy is this innovative method for us. Application of Art Therapy method is going to provide us with effective implementation of kids function: diagnostic, recreation, education, correction, therapeutic, personality developing, expressive, pragmatic, compensate, cognitive, stimulate, regulating. Art Therapy gives therapists an opportunity to know a child better \u2013 his abilities, needs, experience, emotions. Art is one of the first means of expression for a child. This method can be implemented regardless of age and health. People who decide to implement an Art Therapy don\u2019t have to have an art capability nor prior experience. Art Therapy is a very capacious field and because of it, it gives therapists huge opportunities. Art Therapy example is music, picture, dance. Teachers and therapists who participate in this project have got experience between a few and thirty years \u2013 they are specialists (speacg therapists, therapist s for the blind, teherpaists for children with special needs). Every one of them work with children that have got difficulties with communication and with receiving external stimuli. Participating in this project let them gain theoretic and practical knowledge of Art Therapy. At the same time because of practical observation at certain partner schools, they can see for themselves how each and every Art Therapy technique is being used with children with special education needs. Partner schools have got quite big experience in implementing Art Therapy. Different partner school profiles give us capabilities of checking how these methods and techniques affect improvement of communication with a special needs pupil.\r\nGained knowledge and skills are going to be used by us in everyday work. We'll use lesson plans of Art Therapy, pedagogical innovation and program Art Therapy in education in kindergarten, support early child development and primary school. We will implement them to our work in our school and we will provide those interested. We want our pupils to be main beneficiaries of this project. We want to share our Art Therapy knowledge in our work with children, at our school with our employees, as well as with families of our pupils and other interested persons from outside.\r\nWe want to learn, through European cooperation, how to use knowledge and experience in implementing Art Therapy to help our students function better in day to day life. By participating in this project we want them to communicate with us on many levels, with different means of expression through art.\r\nDissamination will be continued after the end our project.
