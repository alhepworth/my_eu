Our projects aim to address the emerging skills gaps across a variety of sectors by providing direct support to unemployed people, and facilitating work placement opportunities in Europe and the UK as well as wider strategic work to address emerging skills gaps within projected areas of economic growth. We actively pursue projects to support those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe E.M. project aims to address the labour market needs within the UK's Event Management sector.  The project will address the existing skills gaps and raise standards of training in order to meet projected levels of expansion and replacement demand within the sector. The project provides an experiential learning opportunity for participants and an international experience for young people who have not previously had the chance to travel, developing their professional and personal competences and better equipping them for entry into the labour market. \r\nREY Europe will be working with several UK based FE colleges to recruit young people who are working towards a Level 3 Event Management NVQ. These students will typically be between 17 - 19 years of age and it is very unlikely that they will have lived overseas or lived independently (away form their family home), prior to their involvement in the project. REY Europe has proven experience of working with this target group and providing a structured and supported Mobility experience. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to run for 24 months, from January 2015 to December 2016, with 10 planned flows of participants. Each flow will recruit a cohort of 10 learners who will spend 6 weeks in their overseas placements. \r\nThe Mobility will take place in Tenerife, and learners will be hosted in the area of Arona. The learners will be placed in small groups in work placements within Tenerife. The placements are all local tourist focussed organisations whose daily activities involve arranging and delivering a variety of small to medium sized events, predominantly targeting holidaymakers and corporate events, but also includes some that are focussed towards the local community.\r\nThe work placements will provide the learners with first hand  experience of the process of organising events within a company. The events are varied and as well as understanding operational planning, event set up/breakdown, health & safety requirements etc. the learners will also gain customer service experience and develop their confidence working in a cross cultural environment. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to their departure; once abroad the learners will receive an in-country orientation by a REY Europe representative who will be based in Tenerife throughout the Mobility to ensure that there is full pastoral support available to help with any learner needs. An Accompanying Person form the partner VET colleges will also stay with the group for the first 5 days of the Mobility. \r\nPrior to the Mobility, learners will be supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of Learning Outcomes, which will be shaped by the job description that they have been given by their placement host. These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  The learners will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with the learners to chart their progress; the line manager will verify the achievement of Learning Outcomes that have been achieved during the Mobility and will demonstrate these within a Europass Mobility certificate. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal\r\ndevelopment that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the students will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the European labour market and a set of transferable skills that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment and an international outlook. \r\nIn the short term, this will be evident through the successful completion of Learning Outcomes.

Countries as well as individuals executing poor financial management steps contribute to global economic instability. The need for higher financial literacy of the EU population was expressed by the European Commission in 2008 when the Expert Group on Financial Education was set up. The rising indebtedness on both individual and national level within the EU is only a one of the facts proving the need for more joint effort concerning improvement of financial literacy of the EU citizens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FLY project has several objectives. In the most general perspective, the project aims to contribute to the following European development strategies:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Europe 2020 Strategy \r\n\r\n     o Target 4 \u2013 Education \r\n\r\n     o Target 5 \u2013 Fighting poverty and social exclusion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial education was articulated by the European Commission to be a necessary part of the process of lifelong learning. The goals of the FLY project are: \r\n\r\n\u2022 corresponding with the goals of the Erasmus+ programme also in the field of sustainable development of higher education and in education of adults, as the project aims at a spectrum of target groups. \r\n\r\n\u2022 in line with the Erasmus+ programme\u2019s objectives through its European level and in its focus on development of new, modern and sustainable open educational resources and tools. \r\n\r\n\u2022 increased levels of financial literacy. \r\n\r\n\u2022 raised awareness of risks of poor personal financial management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium of partners consists of consulting, training and educational private companies and non-profit training and educational centres and universities. The partnership possesses the required expertise to cover all phases and aspects of the project. The consortium is composed of partners from the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania and the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FLY project will be performed through activities covered within the Project Management and Implementation budget and the budget for Intellectual Outputs. Two Intellectual Outputs will be produced. The first Output is the E-Course on Financial Education, being the interactive e-learning tool to be used by the target groups for assessing and improving their levels of financial literacy. Two activities will be performed within this Output \u2013 in the first phase, participating organisations will develop the content of three independent e-learning modules of the E-Course, each designated for one target group (secondary education students, higher education students, adults). In the second phase, the E-Course on Financial Literacy will be delivered. The second Intellectual Output is the Raising Awareness Campaign, comprising of activity focused on identification of target groups to be involved in the Raising Awareness Workshops and in the Campaign. Workshops are the last activity in this Output, preceded by activity on forming the content of the Workshops. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology used in the FLY project address the needs of the modern trends in education, including digitalisation of learning and the preference of personal approach in teaching. The main output \u2013 the E-Course on Financial Education - is a free distance learning tool, designed and produced by experts on financial literacy and IT. Personal approach to target groups during the Raising Awareness Campaign complements the complex methodology used for this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results desired to be achieved include:\r\n\r\n\u2022  creation of the E-Course on Financial Literacy\r\n\r\n\u2022  identification of target groups for the purposes of the Raising Awareness Campaign\r\n\r\n\u2022  advertisement materials of the Campaign areproduced and distributed\r\n\r\n\u2022  a series of Workshops conducted at schools and in companies\r\n\r\n\u2022  Raising Awareness Campaign is carried out\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks to these results accomplished, the following impact is envisaged. On European level, countries will benefit from more responsible consumer behaviour of citizens which would support also the economic development of EU. The field of financial education will be better understood on both international and national levels. The project will contribute to implementation of national strategies on financial education in the project countries. On individual level, the level of financial literacy of participants will increase and they will also be more aware of the risks of poor financial management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of longer terms benefits, the FLY project will extend its impact beyond the time schedule of the project thanks to its linkage to the national strategies on financial education.

Realtime online seminars are called also webinars. Although the webinars could be used in all education sectors for seminars, lectures, communication of groups, they are still not very common in Europe. There is a lack of online-trainers, who are able to conduct webinars and there are no guidelines for the pedagogy of webinars, increasing the attractiveness and efficiency of such learning activities. Additionally many learners, including disadvantaged persons,  cannot estimate how useful and efficient webinars are and how easy it is to participate without the need of  high digital skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWebinars are per se cross sectoral. The  seven project partners  from Bulgaria (New Bulgarian University, Sofia), Germany (VINC Learning UG, Rastatt), Greece (Hellenic Regional Development Centre, Patreos), Hungary (Pannon University, Vezprem),  Italy (Associazione Acquamarina) and Portugal (Technical School of Image and Communication) are  active in high education, further education and adult education, being national and transnational networkers between education sectors and companies, focussed also on rural development, reflect the huge range of potential users for webinars. Thus the project contributes to the internationalisation of education in all sectors,  the growing use of digital learning and better access to education for all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the cooperation through transnational Blended Learning could function is practically shown in the 2-years-project: 14 common transnational webinars are conducted in the implementation phase of the project. All project partners  participate in the webinars - sometimes as participants and sometimes as online-trainers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe topic of learning and cooperation is \"HDR-Photography\". This highly efficient technique is a rather new technique in photography. Already penetrating the imaging world, it is still discussed very controverse, the technique is not mature and the people are still not aware about the huge potential this technique provides. Although HDR (High Dynamic Range) was already developed in the nineties in computer animation and film,  a broader usage in photography starts in the last four years. With a trainer, the basic technique can be learned quite easy. The technique is one of the most interesting innovations of the digital photography. With HDR-photography, the digital photos can show nearly all contrasts. That was never possible with analogue photography.  The image branch is well aware about this point. A common digital camera  and computer software for the processing of HDR photos are necessary to make HDR-photos.  If professionals, students or amateurs, they all can profit from this creative and highly potential  technique very much. It's huge range of application possibilities (photographers, artists, graphic design,  documentation, press and media) makes it an ideal topic for transnational Blended Learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material results of the project are an essay about online pedagogy of transnational webinars and blended learning . Complementary information will be provided by a film that shows the conduction of a pedagogical well structured webinar . The film is available on Youtube.  An E-Book about the state of the art in HDR-Photography with practical informations for applicants and for newcomers, experiences and new ways of usage is worked out. All outputs are available as OER, the essay is translated in 8 different languages and will be published online and in printed journals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe online-trainer and learners as well as the users of HDR-photography increased measurable  in all partner countries.  Both, the skills about realtime online-trainings as well as the skills in HDR-photography will have a snowball effect in the partner countries.

The Institute was created on September 1st, 2013 and brought together four existing secondary schools located in Castelnuovo: the VET institute (IPSIA) \u201cSimoni\u201d, the Institute for commerce, accountancy and surveying (ITCG) \u201cCampedelli\u201d, the Technical institute (ITI) \u201cVecchiacchi\u201d and the Scientific high school (Liceo Scientifico) \u201cGalilei\u201d. Currently approximately 1000 students are enrolled and 141 staff members are employed.The project aims at expanding the opportunities offered to students in terms of education and training, professional practice, individual learning and development, so to boost school achievement and success and improve one\u2019s own employability. The international mobility experiences contribute to increase individual autonomy and the acquisition of knowledge and competences that will make up the \u201ctoolbox\u201d for students. They will be then able to take informed decisions concerning their training and work conditions, fully playing their \"active citizen\" role. EXMO 2016 plans mobility programmes for 50 students to be spent in French, British and Maltese companies.The Garfagnana Institute considers the EXMO 2016 project as an opportunity to enhance its quality training and education supply and to take a step further:- To experiment a rotation system which complement study and work at international scale, so to adapt and improve its training programmes and curricula consistently with students\u2019 and companies\u2019 needs.- To have an impact on students\u2019 motivation to achieve learning goals and overall school success, fighting back early school leaving phenomena and other forms of youth vulnerability.- To develop the competences of the Institute\u2019s staff with respect to administration, finance and organisation of European mobility programmes, building on the hands-on practice resulting from EXMO 2016.- To enrich the in-service training opportunities for the Istitute\u2019s staff with particular regard to soft skills (e.g. problem solving, group work).- To raise awareness among the Institute\u2019s staff about the opportunities that \u201cEurope can offer\u201d .- To implement the tools to recognize, validate and certify competences, e.g. by means of the ECVET system and the Europass Mobility and CV tools.- To improve the capability to create meaningful networks with local and international partners. The ability to \u201clisten to\u201d requests expressed by economic and social actors allow to design innovative training programmes that are aligned with the needs of the labour market and of the local contexts.As regards students\u2019 needs and expectations, the EXMO 2016 project meets the following necessities: - To improve their professional and technical backgrounds putting their knowledge to the test in novel and challenging working settings which also require adaptation to different cultures and working approaches and the use of a foreign language.- To acquire or refine relational skills and the so-called soft skills, considered as key competences in the EU. The experience of living and working far from home determines great changes in each participant, in terms of individual flexibility, adaptability, ability to work in team, problem solving skills, stress and time management, management of intercultural relations. It is indeed a crucial and valuable stage for an individual\u2019s development process.- To open the Garfagnana area to broader, EU-wide dynamics, fighting back isolation and enhancing the possibility to get to know in a direct way new ways of living, studying and working.- To further study a EU language to be used as working language in different contexts, so to improve one\u2019s own employability.The project, lasting 24 months, will be carried out in the school years 2016-17 and 2017-18.", "http://www.watermangroup.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004955_4"]]}}}}
