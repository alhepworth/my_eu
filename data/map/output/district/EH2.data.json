Unfortunately the placements did not come to our expectations and as a public school it did suit us to pay a placement organization. \r\n\r\nSo the coordinator asked the European colleagues to become partners for the placements abroad. In each school, a referent teacher places in her/his country our students in the companies they know. In turn, we do the same and place their students. This partnership works really well and today we send at least 25 students every year in 10 different countries: Germany, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Turkey, Finland and Italy. These students come from both departments, administrative and industry to respect the balance. \r\n\r\nThe impact on the students is very positive.

This is not an exception in climate action movement. We believe that through utilising popular education and youth empowerment tools it is important to advance youth work for better inclusion of marginalised community members into campaigns, activities and strategic work planning of environmental youth organisations, as well as wider civil society movements in Europe and ensure that we involve voices of those who are least heard in decision and policy making spaces.\r\n\r\nThrough mapping exercise, the project has identified the substantial gap between well established youth climate justice groups and front line communities in Europe which are directly impacted by environmental injustice. Project Youth and Communities for Environmental Justice (YCEJ) will bring together 10 youth climate justice organisations across Europe and will aim to link them with local front line communities affected by environmental injustices.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, 3 key thematic issues, affecting key target groups in 10 project countries, will be developed throughout the partnership:\r\n1) Communities affected by development of large scale projects and large-scale land deals \u2018land-grabbing\u2019 (including mining and big energy projects); \r\n2) Rural communities whose livelihoods are being threatened by changing climate patterns locally; \r\n3) Communities impacted by the energy transition, such as workers and communities with cultural and economic links to the fossil fuel industry.\r\n\r\nPartner organisations have been strategically clustered by where one of these issues is particularly pertinent with the expectation that learning developed in these areas can be spread to the wider climate justice youth movement in Europe. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, capacity of partner organisations will be built through transnational trainings on community organising, anti-oppressive organising and inclusion in groups, as well as 3 theoretical mini-trainings on each issue. 79 participants of the project and learning opportunities will have extensively built their capacity and gained transferable skills for inclusive organising, running campaigns, working with groups and advocacy.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a 20-months partnership, youth organisations, which are based in the major European cities and often outreach youth which has access to education and democratic participation, will be encouraged to involve marginalised people into their campaigning and strategic planning, extremely amplifying their voices in the national decision and policy making frameworks as well as raising awareness on the issues, which are often unnoticed by the general population.

The two organisations, even if geographically distant, both work to promote youth participation and active citizenship, and the recognition of non-formal ways of education and learning such as volunteering. Both IVS and INTERRA have similar goals and previous experience of successfully participating in EVS exchanges, and on this occasion want to work together to enhance each others' practice.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe project aims to broaden the horizons and change the attitude towards volunteering of the locals in Krasnoyarsk through the active participation of young people from a foreign country in the local youth activities and events. The project also aims to increase the knowledge and understanding of the Russian and Siberian culture of the EVS volunteer who will take part. Furthermore we want our EVS volunteer to promote European citizenship, awareness and democracy; learn about Erasmus + and EVS, project management and international exchanges, so to gain professional knowledge and experience useful to their future career and - within the realms of this project - help and encourage the local youth to embark on new local and international adventures.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe project sees 1 EVS volunteer from the UK going to volunteer at INTERRA, in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, for 6 months. \r\nThe individual we were looking for was a young individual between 18 and 30 years old, open-minded, proactive, and with a strong motivation for volunteering in the field of international youth work. We agreed that preferably the volunteer would have a good knowledge of English and a basic knowledge of Russian or German because these are the languages spoken by the local youth and service users.\r\nOn this occasion the volunteer has already been recruited and is a young female student coming from a multicultural background as she grew up in the UK from migrant parents. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nThe EVS volunteer will be involved at many different levels in the delivery of all the current projects carried out by INTERRA in the field of youth education and cultural promotion. She will carry out a variety of tasks to support the preparation, implementation and management of youth and bilateral international exchanges, youth educational projects, foreign language clubs, lectures/discussions on culture, art, and urban life development. Additionally, the EVS volunteer will have the possibility to participate in sports and cultural events organised by INTERRA's partners, such as the local council or other NGOs in the Krasnoyarsk region and international partners. Furthermore, the EVS volunteer will contribute to the projects by delivering presentations about her personal experience as a volunteer, and will promote the EVS programme. Additionally, the volunteer will support the INTERRA staff in the administration of the charity and will learn about funding applications, reporting, preparing press releases and advertising material, and manage websites and social media. Lastly, during her placement the volunteer will be given the possibility, encouraged and supported to create and implement her own projects, depending on her skills and interests. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nINTERRA's methodology is based on the core principles of the experiential learning theory and insists on the importance of non-formal education. These methods will be introduced gradually to the volunteer: at first she will help to implement current events and little by little INTERRA will support her to act more independently and take ownership of personal projects. \r\nFor INTERRA the involvement of international volunteers in the local community is crucial to ensure that mutual understanding and positive cooperation between different cultures is achieved in the region and also exported as a modus operandi in the volunteer\u2019s home community.\r\n\r\nResults, impact and long-term benefits\r\nWe expect this project to benefit first of all the young people of Krasnoyarsk, broaden their horizons and encourage them to embark in international and multicultural experiences.

The programme will provide for each fellow: a) in-depth training by research at the host site and on industrial secondments; b) sound multidisciplinary and intersectoral scientific training and understanding of industrial environments via courses and secondments; c) a programme of complementary skills training and network events to develop the researchers competencies and career options.

Apart from its financial and social effects on personal life, long-term unemployment negatively affects social cohesion and, ultimately, may hinder economic growth. In total, 4.5 % of the labour force in the EU-28 in 2015 had been unemployed for more than one year; more than half of these, 2.8 % of the labour force, had been unemployed for more than two years. \r\n\r\nIt is widely accepted that when European labour markets emerge from the current economic crisis they will be profoundly changed. If those who are long-term unemployed are to have any chance of finding quality employment they must be given the tools to successfully adjust to this new reality, as even \u2018old\u2019 jobs now require \u2018new\u2019 skills. Support agencies working with the long-term unemployed are struggling to come to terms with the situation as many of their target group have been removed from E&T years. \r\n\r\nEducational qualifications and adequate skills are still the best insurance against unemployment. The New Skills Agenda for EU (2016) reflects a common vision about the role of skills for jobs, growth and competitiveness and  social cohesion. People need a broad set of skills to fulfill their potential both at work and in society. Acquiring skills is a lifelong process and starts very young, and continues to be strengthened throughout life, and allow people to thrive in fast-evolving workplaces and society, and to cope with complexity and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nEurope faces a basic skills challenge. People need a minimum level of basic skills, including numeracy, literacy and basic digital skills, to access good jobs and participate fully in society. These are also the building blocks for further learning and career development. \r\nParticipation in LLL is needed more than ever before. Access to LLL opportunities remains uneven across socioeconomic groups, and some groups of the working-age population, in particular third-country nationals, have less access. It is a commonly experienced phenomenon that those who could benefit most from E&T are the ones less likely to engage. \r\n\r\nThe current project comes to support the efforts of Member States to offer high quality opportunities to low-skilled, unemployed men and women to upgrade their digital and employability skills, so that they can be better empowered to re-enter work, address skills mismatches and exclusion, while promoting the digital agenda for Europe.\r\n  \r\nThe direct target group is adults with a focus on women  (low-skilled, long-term unemployed) who will first record their current digital skills (through self-assessment), second acquire or upgrade their digital skills related to employability in order to bridge the skills gap and meet the digital needs of the labour market and third validate their new digital skills through the open badges.\r\n\r\nThe indirect target group is Adult Educators, leaders and providers  of Adult Education, as all products to be developed will be provided open for use for the benefit of adults. Surely the Adult Educators will also be supported in their efforts to raise the quality of Adult Learning thus increasing participation to meet the ET2020 Target of 15%.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, the e-SKILLS4ALL project focuses on low-skilled unemployed adults with a focus on women heavily affected by the recent crisis and adult education organisations and their staff. While it is more than likely that the proposed products to be developed will be relevant to learners of all ages the project is specifically targeting the unemployed and will ensure that the learning tools are customized to suit the learning needs and learning preferences of this target group. A significant emphasis will be placed on developing the digital and employability skills. From partner experience it appears that the majority of long-term unemployed are less likely to have good ICT skills which are essential in almost all employments today, whereas the Digital Initiatives reinforce the need of all to help meet the high demand for digital skills in Europe which are essential in today's job market and society.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of 6 organisations from 6 EU countries which cover a wide range of expertise.

To solve these issues, born from the idea of Current2Current founders \u2013experienced project managers in subsea oilfield for BP Ltd. projects, we have been working on SUBPORT project since 2007. We have developed a compact and simple tidal turbine that can work with flow from any direction, with current speeds < 0.5 m/s, and stable under any water depth and current speed. It can provide up to 20 kWh /day for up to 25 years without the need to change a battery.\nWith SUBPORT project we aim to disrupt into the offshore Oil&Gas market by providing a standalone supply power tidal turbine that will enable our customers to save up to \u20ac 15 Mill.

Particularly social media is an arena where visual messages of potentially high impact can go viral among peers and have the influence without an opportunity to read between the lines: while being under the direct influence of film / clip it is hard to stand back and reflect which could cause provoked actions.

R. Stefanik in Ivanka pri Dunaji is a big school for more than 800 pupils (at the age of 6 to 15) near Bratislava. The build was extended twice in recent years, as the number of pupils has been growing. Along with that, the number of teachers has been growing as well. Luckily, most coming teachers are enthusiastic. We want them to educate themselves and feel happy and loyal part of our institution \r\nThe school is oriented to foreign languages, ICT and environmental education. Our pupils have achieved many successes in various competitions, including English and German language competitions. Many students continue in bilingual secondary schools. However, we still have to work hard to develop quality of education, bring new methods and more entertaining activities into classrooms. \r\nWe have participated in some European projects, such as eTwinning Schoolovision, European Languages Day, ENO Tree Day. We cooperate with our twin school in the Czech Republic. A British teacher comes every year to our school with amazing presentation about Britain and with information about studying in the UK. \r\nNevertheless, there is yet much to do if we want our students to think in European dimensions. It is even more important now, when media are full of negative news and conspiracy websites spread lies. \r\n\r\nAims:\r\nThe first aim of our project is to improve our teachers' language competences, which will mean better quality of foreign languages teaching at our school too. Along with that we also want to widen knowledge about European, British, and specifically English and Scottish culture and life. Teachers should be able to promote and support European values, such as peace, cooperation, human rights, tolerance and solidarity. They will become better in teaching critical thinking and how to distinguish reliable sources of information from the fake ones.\r\nA crucial challenge is inclusion of the pupils with special needs. Therefore we are sending our employee to Special Needs and Inclusive Learning course. \r\nAll participants will bring inspiring information about education system and methodology in other countries. They will meet new colleagues and possibly start international projects with them. \r\n\r\nParticipants, mobilities and expected results:\r\n- Eight employees are involved in the mobilities. They are all teachers and also have other important roles in the school. \r\n- Seven participants will attend Pilgrims courses in Canterbury. We have only the best experiences from 2015 Pilgrims summer courses, when three teachers brought new enthusiasm and many interesting activities to school. We are still in touch with some Pilgrims teachers and collegues from Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Germany...  \r\n- They will study at one or  two weeks courses, in compliance with their needs and our school needs:  \r\nMethodology & English Language for Primary Teachers \r\nMethodology & English Language for Secondary Teachers\r\nEnglish Language Improvement Course\r\nSpecial Needs and Inclusive Learning\r\nDrama Techniques for Creative English Teaching\r\nPractical uses of Mobile Technologies in the Language Classroom\r\nBritish Life, Language & Culture.\r\n- One teacher will participate in Teacher Training in Inlingua Edinburgh. The course consists of two main components (Teacher Training and Spoken Performance) plus an extensive Scottish culture programme.\r\n- Studying English in an English-speaking country and intensive contact with teachers from around the world will surely bring efficiency to our teachers' communication skills and widen their intercultural knowledge. The courses will empower them with the tools to communicate effectively in English and to apply their knowledge to the classes too. The participants will refresh the oral and listening English skills, apply a modern, communication-oriented teaching methodology, benefit from the exchange of best practice.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nOur school has participated in two Erasmus plus KA1 projects so far and the mobilities and results were amazing. Therefore we know we can expect great benefits for our school, our pupils and our teachers. We hope to promote students' deeper interest in learning, and not only English. Our teachers will inject life into lessons and make them more attractive. \r\nWe are also convinced that the chosen courses will contribute to giving European dimension to our school. The students will gain a better understanding of European life, culture and values in its various aspects.\r\nWe believe our participation will promote cooperation of our school with other educational institutions abroad.\r\nOur school is part of local community.
