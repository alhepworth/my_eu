The project will aim to develop frameworks that reflect the level of understanding and ability required in the relevant occupations, are concerned with core capability rather than the specifics of job roles, and are resilient to changes in legislation, technology and techniques.  Intellectual input will be provided by the UK partner, supported by an expert associate with experience in the German system and of VET instruments at EU level.

The project will also meet particular needs in specific industries, for instance to support talent management in the Irish training and development profession, extend competence-based approaches to \u2018Meister\u2019 level in German chemical engineering, and help formalise the occupation of innovation management in Poland.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s main transferrable output will be a guide to researching and developing practical and usable descriptions of professional competence, explaining how different methods can be used to develop frameworks that capture high-level occupational roles, along with an associated short training programme to aid its application.  Approaches will be tested through application to the five fields, and refined to produce a highly usable, methodologically sound manual.  This manual will be designed to be usable in any occupational field to produce competence standards and frameworks that: are eminently suitable for work roles where significant judgement and contextual interpretation are needed; avoid assumptions about work practices, organisational cultures or roles that lead to obsolescence or build in cultural or gender discrimination, and; support outcomes-based qualifications and credit in line with the EQF, ECVET and ECTS.

We are aware that this is a very large application, but at the same time, we believe that the application is extremely realistic. Tradium is one of the largest combination schools, and internationalization is very integrated into our organization. This was also the reason why, Tradium got the Danish award as being the International School of the year 2012.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, we enhanced the international work by sending out even more students and employees, while we have participated in several international projects. In previous mobility projects we have send out whole classes with approximately half grants, so everybody had the opportunity to receive a grant. In the 2014-project  we have given a full grant for all participants, with the result that we don't have more than 26 student mobilities left.\r\n\r\nWith this project we apply primarily for grants for mobility in the year 2015/2016, but we have also added some elected classes for 2016/2017. This application is the result of an internal application process, where the departments of Tradium have fulfilled an internal application based on their needs for future mobilities in their department.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the year 2016/2017 are for the classes that have integrated the mobilities as a mandatory part of their training and the mobility project to Glasgow (which has been completed the last many years). This type of mobilities we are 100% certain will be realized, and that is why it would be right to inform all the relevant stakeholders about the economic conditions earlier on. For this reason we have applyed for 2016/2017 mobilities for these special classes as well, a total of 101 mobility grants for students + 3 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in continuation of Tradiums strategy of having a global vision, and thus to the desire to integrate internationalization into all of the programs offered by Tradium. The Mobility project is a very important element in this strategy.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we wish to send out 188 VET students, 92 HHX students and 35 employees. VET students are primarily basic course students at either GF1 or GF2, but there are also individual students from the main program (school training students). We are applying for grants to accompanying persons to our basic course students, as these students are relatively young (some are under 18), and many times they are not strong linguistically / culturally. HHX students are all first-year students from the school's two international study programs. Staff members come from all parts of the school: Managers, teachers and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the mobility project will be in extension of the enclosed MoU / LOI. There will be an increased focus on getting participants' learning outcomes described in a better way (ECVET), partly by using Learning Agreements for the description of the individual's learning outcomes, and assessed by the host partner. At the same time we will maintain the Europass Mobility as a recognition of the skills that the participant has achieved during the mobility.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for students:\r\nThe project will help to increase students' linguistic, international and intercultural competencies. Particularly VET students often have a limited global vision, which makes it difficult for them to operate in an international environment. With this project, they will be better to compete with other groups of students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX / HTX participants, they also need a practical approach to their theoretical education. The work placements for these students will add this dimension. It is expected that most students will have a better chance of employment in the global labor market. They can also act as a pioneer and inspire other students to study abroad.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for employees / organization:\r\n\u2022 Employees / managers achieve linguistic, international and intercultural skills so that the organization will be able to support the students mobility.\r\n\u2022 Employees are provided with relevant professional qualification in their field, as well as greater power to integrate the international aspect in their training\r\n\u2022 Teachers get new inspiration for teaching and new pedagogical methods and tools\r\n\u2022 Management and administration gain new skills and inspiration (management, organization, planning, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe results of the mobility project will be evaluated and disseminated, internally as well as externally. The results will be discussed in the departments involved, at Tradium in general and together with other VET institutions, at Facebook and in press releases.", "http://www.somerset.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA102-004201_9"], [2014, "Continuing Internationalization at Tradium - Business & Technical, part III", "Somerset College of Arts & Technology", 137185.0, 10, 18, "Tradium is applying for 247 student and 35 staff mobilities to be used from 2014-2016.

According to the UN, an estimated 650 million people in the world live with disabilities. Together with their families, that means that about 2 million people are directly affected by disability, representing almost one third of the world's population. More people have access needs; for example, older and less mobile people or people with pushchairs have access needs. The European population is ageing: by 2050 the number of people over65 will be 3 times what is was in 2003. For all of these people, travelling can be a real challenge. They represent a huge market potential for tourism which today remains vastly under-served. Making places more accessible is a social responsibility but also acompelling business case to boost the competitiveness of tourism in Europe.The Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROWTH), has responsibility for helping turn the EU into a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy by implementing the industrial and sectorial policies of the flagship Europe 2020 initiative, fostering entrepreneurship and for the COSME programme (Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs) which recently called for proposals to facilitate transnational tourism for seniors in low season, recognising the substantial market availableIn July 2014, DG GROWTH held a conference and commissioned three reports detailing the current state of accessibility in tourism: the marketplace, skills and training needs and travel patterns. Two projects (TACTALL and TAFCITY) are mentioned; both aredescribed as innovative and useful; however, the awareness training they offered has not been made available on a wide basis, mainly because they were LLP 'pilots'. Some members of the project teams that created these projects feel that they have the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm to enhance, adapt and deliver sustainable training, with EU certification accepted by many member states.The unemployment rates in partners' countries is high, particularly in the under 30s. Setting up their own business is a viable option for many young people. Many rural areas have no work other than that provided by SMEs or micro businesses; many of these areinvolved in the tourist industry. The marketplace potentially is very large and growing. Recommendations in the 2014 report mentioned have been taken into account in this proposal, together with the consortium's now extensive knowledge and experience.This project will deliver accessibility as a new opportunity for the tourism market, creating a modular course using innovative methods: co-creation (Living Lab) and including disabled people in the curriculum design. Four modules will cover entrepreneurship, including social enterprise; accessibility awareness and comprehension; a standard that could be embedded into any curriculum with EU certification pursued; accessible tourism; marketing accessible tourism (in particular to open up the out-of-season market for older persons). It will also create  co-operation between education, business, social enterprises, NGOs and similar to raise awareness of accessibility. A business case for accessible tourism will be created, to ensure businesses recognise thepotential of the market available. In order to raise the profile of accessibility, via local, regional, national and pan-European networks, businesses associations, NGOs and similar, an online network/forum and quality evalation facility will be designed and delivered . An evaluation/review product, Acc Advisor (similar to the popular Trip Advisor) and an App are deliverables. It is certainly intended to make GROWMAT sustainable, seeking 'corporate' sponsorship, social enterprises or using crowd funding to maintain the profileThe partnership has a mix of skills: 3 VET institutions, 2 of them with experience of projects involving accessibility and elderly people and their needs; a University of Applied Science, with valuable knowledge of entrepreneurship and co-creation (Living Lab) methodology; a UK charity dealing with older people and knowledge of active ageing; a private training company who is also an entrepreneur; another entrepreneur who specialises in 'Design for All'; a European VET network with 1500 members.The project will run events and attend events to enable the partnership to find \u2018champions\u2019 (a person who vigorously supports or defends a person or cause.); the champions are considered very important to the project.The beneficiaries of this project include people of varying abilities, older people, anyone less mobile, students (particularly in hospitality and tourism), teachers and trainers, adults, unemployed persons, employers and staff.The potential long-term benefit of this project is for accessibility comprehension to be accepted as a basic transversal skill.", "http://www.learning-southwest.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA202-024934_6"]]}}}}
