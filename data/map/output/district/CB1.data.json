The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part.
