ADEPT will build on the expertise of software developers from high-performance computing (HPC) to exploit parallelism for performance, and on the expertise of Embedded systems engineers in managing energy usage. ADEPT will develop a tool that will guide software developers and help them to model and predict the power consumption and performance of parallel software and hardware.<br/>The strength of the HPC world lies primarily in software application parallelisation: concurrent computation is used to speed-up the overall time an application requires run to completion. As a result, HPC software developers are also experts in parallel performance analysis and performance optimisation. The Embedded systems sector on the other hand excels in its management of energy usage because they are often constrained by fixed power and energy budgets. The strengths of one sector are the relative weakness of the other: power management and power efficiency in HPC are in their infancy, but they are becoming increasingly important with HPC systems requiring more and more power; and while continuing to be constrained by energy and power budgets, recent advances in low-power multi-core processors have widened the choice of hardware architectures for Embedded systems and are increasingly forcing Embedded programmers to use parallel computing techniques that are more familiar to HPC programmers.<br/>ADEPT will investigate the implications of parallelism in programming models and algorithms, as well as choice of hardware, on energy and power consumption. It is important to gain a clear understanding of how factors such as redundant computations or algorithmic choices affect the power profile of a parallel application, or how this profile can be modified in a predictable way by off-loading compute-intensive parts of an application to low-power hardware. ADEPT will progress the state-of-the-art in application profiling, performance, and energy usage modelling in order to build a tool that integrates performance and energy consumption modelling for parallel Embedded and HPC systems.<br/>ADEPT will advance the knowledge on how parallel software and hardware uses power. Being able to reduce the amount of power that is required to run large-scale applications on a HPC system will have an significant impact on the total cost of ownership and on the carbon-footprint of such a system. ADEPT will also increase programmer productivity by creating a tool that will be able to rapidly predict both the performance and the power usage of parallel systems, greatly reducing the need for speculative implementations to answer 'what if?' questions during the software development process. This will enable developers to make informed decisions with regards to hardware and software implementation that are economically viable in terms of performance and cost.", 275963.0, 2813852.0, 3, 5, "ADEPT", null, null, null, "fp7_109695_951501228"]]}}, "5BL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "From Papyrus to Stonepaper and Beyond - the Questions behind", "The Edinburgh Academy", 167453.0, 9, 9, "Our project \u2013 From Papyrus to Stonepaper and Beyond, is planned as a journey in developing exciting teaching and learning within a European framework.    We aim to take a journey across our European past to explore our history, but use it to develop future good learning and teaching practice.   To do this we have identified a subject which is based on the progress of paper and written communication over the centuries and developed a framework centred around \"Five pillars of wisdom \" which will take forward the student learning.   This framework will encourage colleagues to take clear steps into cross curricular learning, innovative teaching,  developing new methodologies, (e.g. using questions for better learning), and also encourage the effective use of self evaluation and targets.   There will be significant focus on art and design as well as expressive arts.   The nature of the topic encourages wide publication and sharing of work from the published word to public performance and through expressive arts workshop experiences.  It fits well with all ICT and future thinking and has clear study routes through past European cultures.  The whole project  will be designed to encourage the development of healthy active minds and lives within our local communities and within our European community.Within our partnership we have a wide range of school types from small, isolated and rural to multi-stage / age urban models.   In this project  we will be nine schools and one associate partner in Belarus.   We consider this to be a key strength of our group and feel comfortable and relaxed about the fact that there is not one specific approach to delivering the project successfully in our own communities and as a group.  Over the years we have had a wonderful learning journey, and all of the partners have a strong sense of European Citizenship because of our work.  We have seen at first hand how education can be delivered in a wide variety of school buildings and circumstances. Our vision for the future, and for this project journey,  is one where being an active European Citizen is at the heart of our cultures and the lives of those in our school communities.   Our commitment as a group of European partners is to work together through shared aims, objectives and targets to increase the depth of the educational experience we offer to our pupils and staff.  In  doing this, we aim to raise attainment in learning through motivating our pupils and offering them exciting, real learning experiences.    At the centre of this vision is a wish to offer our students innovative learning, in a modern, exciting and supported group structure with a clear membership of European Collegiality for our staff.    Through committing to working together, we aim to unite and enhance the European dynamic of our curriculums and commit to delivering a project which will offer study routes to increasing our wisdom on the history, culture and ecology of our European past.  Central to this will be a focus on the future and how through understanding economy, the development of ICT, ecological and environmental issues, we can work together to build a better future.    Through offering our stakeholders clear European membership we believe that working positively together will increase the empathy and support for a united future.   The project will offer many opportunities for the effective use of modern technologies and ICT to enhance communication, encourage the development of our European identity and to support the learning of a foreign language.Through the work of this project as a working European group of schools, we aim to develop:1. Exciting and innovative teaching and learning2. A sense of European unity and purpose3. Real and worthwhile staff development opportunities to take forward learning innovation4.

Researchers have noted a worrying decline in public interest in and understanding of plants, at the same time as others are calling for greater public awareness of biodiversity, conservation and the value of plants. Botanic gardens, as institutions that hold documented collections for the purposes of education, scientific research, conservation and recreation (Wyse Jackson, 1999), have the potential to be places wherein our disconnection with nature is re-established. Dodd & Jones (2010) point out that if botanic gardens are to stay relevant to the 21st century world they need to examine their role within a framework of social and environmental responsibility. Common to most botanic gardens is the desire to broaden their audiences, and to undermine the perception that they are just for a particular elite of white, middle-class, older people. But as Dodd & Jones (2010) point out this also requires skills that many botanic gardens professionals may lack. The LearnToEngage Partners will design and pilot a modular blended-learning course. The units of the course will be Working with Diverse Audiences, Interpretation, Science Communication, Research and Evaluation. This will offer botanic garden professionals a flexible Professional Development opportunity that will promote equity and inclusion in botanic garden education and encourage the delivery of high quality, well researched, innovative public engagement.

Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", "http://www.edenretail.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_8"]]}}, "7JA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1349049600000, 1475193600000, "Increasing Industrial Resource Efficiency in European Mariculture", "The Scottish Salmon Company Limited", "The proposal IDREEM will create smarter greener growth for one of Europe\u2019s most important industrial sectors: the aquaculture industry.

She is a current Spanish teacher at our School, who comes from Spain, and who wants to develop her linguistic competence in French, in order to get full registration as a French teacher with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. \r\n\r\nThe project here presented could be considered as the final stage of a the participant's continuous professional development. It started with the participant's personal training with the Open University, with which she has been learning French for 2 years. In order to develop her speaking skills and to improve her confidence when teaching French to our pupils, we would like to give her the opportunity of developing her knowledge of French abroad, which, at the same time, will meet the residency requirements to become a fully qualified French teacher with the GTCS. \r\n\r\nThus, the project will take the form of a three-week immersion course in Tours (France) as part of the participant's lifelong learning. The programme we have in mind develops the participant's French linguistic skills together with her intercultural awareness, while providing the participant with a new range of activities and an insight of current language teaching methodologies in Europe. The participant will afterwards build these newly acquired methods into her lessons, so as to enhance our pupils' learning experience and motivate them to continue with their language learning in the future.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the outcomes and results of this project, they can be organised into two main categories: the impact on the participant's personal development and, secondly, the impact on our School and the wider communities. On the one hand, the participant's knowledge of the subject she is studying will improve considerably, developing her confidence and self-esteem. As a result, her motivation and satisfaction in her job will improve and her language lessons will present a better quality, after adapting them to the current methodologies and language teaching practices acquired by the participant during her participation in the project.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this project will also have a very positive impact on our whole school, starting with the improvement of the Modern Languages Department and continuing with other departments within the school. Firstly, the Modern Languages Department will benefit from this project by having a fully trained, committed and confident Spanish and French teacher who is aware of current European language teaching methods. This teacher will share  with her colleagues her experiences and everything that she has acquired by participating in this course. Consequently, the rest of the department will be able to integrate successful language teaching practices in their curriculum and in their lessons. This will develop our students' intercultural awareness, motivation and interest for language learning. With the modernisation of the language teaching programme at our school, we hope to increase the intake of students who continue to learn one or more languages in the last two years of their secondary education.\r\n\r\nFinally, a long term outcome we would like to achieve from this linguistic project is the creation of strong connections with other European schools and entities, which will allow us to promote exchanges or intercultural activities for our students, in order to develop their social and cultural awareness, and which will become a fundamental part of our future relation with Europe. The Modern Languages Department will not be the only one involved in these connections, but the opportunity of developing learning relationships with Europe will also be extended to other departments who wish to develop their teaching practice and to give students the opportunity of taking part in learning programmes outside the school grounds. These prospective projects will open students' minds to the world and will show them the importance of language learning and cultural diversity, making of them successful global citizens.
