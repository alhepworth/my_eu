The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.st-huberts.sandwell.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_3"]]}}, "8LR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Options for Volunteering", "Options for Life", 19082.0, 5, 5, "Options for Life is a not-for-profit voluntary organisation based in Sandwell in the West Midlands.

We therefore plan to look at 'What makes the difference' with a real focus on how schools have developed the most effective curriculum, pupil independence, critical thinking and teaching strategies of feedback, metacognition and peer learning.ContextRecognising the high Pisa scores of schools in Scandinavia the project aims to research what makes the difference in supporting teaching and learning particularly in the basic skills. This linked to international research on the most effective teaching and learning strategies we aim to research what makes a difference in each of our partner countries.It will also look at how best practice can support transition between phases of education from primary to secondary and ensure continued progress and learning for pupils.ObjectivesOur objectives are to observe best practice at a transnational level from outstanding schools and develop our own practice with pupils based on observation, shadowing and training.Our objective is to develop new and enhanced pedagogy and practice based on our learning activities and research.Research will measure impact on the improved quality of teaching and acquisition of basic skills by pupils as they engage in learning.This practice will be shared through a range of intellectual outputs and dissemination activities.ParticipantsAre from the UK, Iceland, Finland and Spain.All participants have experience in collaboration and a range of transnational activity,Birmingham City University in the UK and the Key in London will support the projects research activity, measuring of impact and publication of results and outcomes.ActivitiesTeachers will take part in training and shadowing opportunities to enable them to reflect and evaluate on practice and develop projects to undertake with pupils in their own schools,Teachers will visit each country for training and shadowing and then trial project activities in their own schools the outcomes of which will be shared and case studied.  4 activities and projects.Project meetings each year and at the end of the project will allow project work and activities to be collated and give time for evaluation and reflection and share impacts.MethodologyMain activities will include training and work shadowing followed by project activities in each school.The project will involve Birmingham City University who will develop  research instruments, monitoring and evaluation systems designed to support assessment and evaluation of the project annually to ensure quality.
