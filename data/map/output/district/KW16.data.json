Similar systems are being used in other sectors (e.g. automotive) but have not been applied to ocean energy.

ME has the potential to deliver electricity to 350 million households globally by 2050. The NWE region leads the way in ME development and is uniquely positioned to become the global industry leader. However, efficient growth is hampered, as the sector is regionally oriented and fragmented. Foreseeable errors in technology development are being repeated, making the development of ME technologies unnecessarily inefficient and expensive.\nThe Marine Energy Alliance (MEA) unites regional expertise and capabilities of leading organisations with a track-record in ME development. The main objective is to progress the combined technical and commercial maturity level of 40 SMEs developing ME Concepts (TRL 3-4), reducing the risk in the subsequent capital-intensive demonstration phase by 20%. This is achieved by delivering a tailored suite of integrated technical and commercial services, which is innovative and new to the sector. To ensure long-lasting impact, an after-care module is put in place in which after-care plans of the ME Concepts are carefully monitored. Concept Booster Hackathons will be organised connecting maritime and offshore companies to ME Concepts to lay the groundwork for future collaborations.\nA ME Investment Portfolio enabling investors to diversify risk by investing in multiple ME Concepts simultaneously will be developed. These activities support 120 companies in bringing new products to the market and leverage \u20ac8 million of additional funding. To sustain MEA, lessons-learned in the service delivery to individual ME Concepts are used to develop a Technical & Commercial Service Offer, which will be jointly implemented after the project lifetime. This Service Offer aims to support another 40 ME Concepts in the years after project finalisation contributing to the creation of 300 new jobs and 500 maintained jobs in the NWE region.", 1514764800000, 1672444800000, 611943.0, "nweurope_36_2"], ["Aquatera Ltd", "LOGIC - Low Carbon off Grid Communities", "Issue\nThe NWE region is en route towards a low-carbon energy future. Decentral energy production is a key element of the EU strategy: \"\u2026 a new configuration of decentralised and centralised large-scale systems needs to emerge \u2026\" (EU Energy Roadmap 2050). Important sources of decentral systems (wind, solar, tidal) are intermittent by nature and cannot guarantee security of supply in a single source approach.\nRemote areas depend stronger on decentral supply because they have no or limited access to the existing power grid. 4 remote areas in NL,DE,FR,UK are real-life testing grounds for new energy systems. For the implementation partners from local governments, industry and academia form the LOGiC consortium.\n\nChange\nLOGiC aims to develop and build a blueprint for renewables-based decentral hybrid energy systems (DHES) by implementing an architecture combining renewable sources. There are currently no such systems. Within the project 3 systems are implemented, and further 10 are assisted. Industry partners aim for additional 50 DHES implementations. In total there are 30,000 communities with less than 20,000 inhabitants in the 4 countries.\n\nOutput\nThe project will test, demonstrate and evaluate 3 DHES with solid business cases and develop a blueprint for other areas. Ten more regions will be assisted in adapting the blueprint.\n \nLong term effects\nThe consortium includes private companies (Tocardo) and an industry association (ARE) that have a keen interest to further build the value chain of DHES. IfaS (university) and OGTC (test center) develop a DHES model. Aquatera (research company) will assist follower regions to adapt and implement the blueprint. Peer to peer mechanisms will be put in place between the three pilot and the follower regions.\nLOGiC focuses on 'Energy Remoteness'. This term considers availability, quality and cost of grid connections (power, gas).", 1489622400000, 1584230400000, 124095.0, "nweurope_33_5"], ["Corpower Ocean Ltd (Subpartner of PP1 - GBER Art. 25)", "FORESEA - Funding Ocean Renewable Energy through Strategic European Action", "This project will help North West Europe (NWE) SME\u2019s test ocean energy (OE) technology in real sea environments and prove power can be economically generated from the ocean.\n\nLocated in the peripheral regions of Northern Scotland, Western Ireland, Western France and Western Holland, the partners in this project represent the areas of highest ocean energy resource in Europe. The development of a world leading OE industry in these regions represents a fantastic opportunity to stimulate economic development in these more peripheral, economically disadvantaged areas that are not able to rely on the variety of industry found in the traditional 'motor regions' of NWE.  Combating climate change and securing energy supply are also major issues for Europe and OE represents a substantial and as yet largely untapped asset which will help reduce GHG emissions by bringing highly productive renewable technologies closer to market.\n\nThe cost of pre-commercial testing and demonstration for OE is high and investors are reluctant to invest until the technology has been proven in the sea at scale.  The NWE area possesses world leading OE testing infrastructure and this project will connect sites in the Netherlands (tidal), UK (tidal and wave), France (wave and floating wind) and Ireland (floating wind and wave) to create a network which will place NWE at the heart of this emerging industry.\n\nTo date most EU R&D for OE has focused on technology, not testing. The FORESEA coordinated test sites will encourage longer term testing and technology de-risking.  FORESEA will result in a minimum of 26 OE technology pre-commercial demonstrations, over 60,000hrs of operation, work with over 60 SME's, sustaining 60+ jobs and helping to secure \u20ac30M investment into OE companies.
