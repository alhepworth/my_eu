They have between 5 and 25 times the risk of having a fatal crash compared to car drivers, depending on the country. The number of PTWs on European roads has more than doubled over the last two decades. The recent MAIDS (Motorcycle Accident In-Depth Study) study of PTW crashes in Europe found that behavioural and ergonomic issues were major contributing factors to PTW crashes: the primary accident cause for PTW crashes was the failure of drivers to perceive two-wheelers; and human error was a major contributing factor to most crashes, for both PTW and car drivers. The majority of PTW crashes involved a collision with a car. Many large-scale research programs have been undertaken to understand the behavioural and ergonomic factors that contribute to crashes involving 4-wheeled vehicles. These have been effective in informing countermeasure development, which has led to significant reductions in crashes.

Maintaining a driver's licence is an important issue of independence today, both for males and females. Also technological developments like the introduction of e-bikes enables access to other means of transport.\nThese demographic and behavioural changes are of growing concern to mobility and road safety. While accident data show a decreasing number of fatalities and serious injuries on EU roads, recent data from the ERSO show an increasing proportion of elderly in the fatality statistics.  This trend is a serious threat to the achievements of recent decades and poses a challenge that must be addressed to meet goals set for further reduction of road fatalities. Furthermore, there is an increasing rate of obesity in EU populations, which introduces changes in injury patterns and risks. The SENIORS project focuses on the protection of elderly and obese road users also by transferring nowadays younger generations\u2019 safety standards. The objective is to develop the required understanding of accident scenarios, injury mechanisms and risks and to implement these findings in test tools and test and assessment procedures. An integrated approach considering the elderly in multiple transport modes is applied to reduce the portion of elderly fatalities. The small-scale project focuses on providing tools to encourage wider adoption of advanced restraint and pedestrian protection systems improving the protection of older and obese vulnerable road users.

Whilst first advances have already been made in the technology of tyres and braking systems, at the time of an accident or near-accident one of the major underlying factors is the condition of the road. The awareness of such issues varies widely across the EU. In the United Kingdom, which has one of the best road safety records in Europe, the importance of skidding resistance, as safety indicating parameter of the road surface, has been recognised for decades. It is interesting to note that it is on the roads where such skidding resistance policies are applied where there are the lowest accident records. The reasons why such policies are not adopted more routinely across the EU are various.  The project will address the three most fundamental factors. These are the lack of awareness of the importance and contribution of skidding resistance, the lack of harmonised systems of comparing skidding resistance (even within member states), and the concern over conflicts with other important characteristics of road surfaces (like rolling resistance and noise emissions). Very often policies are only focused to optimise road surfaces for only one parameter, whilst disregarding the other characteristics. That often led to negative impact on other related parameters.

TRUSS will make knowledge of structural safety grow by incorporating these emerging technologies (hi-tech monitoring and manufacturing, computing, etc.) into the training programme and it will support job creation by enabling a wider talent pool of skilled and accredited engineering graduates with business, entrepreneurship, communication, project management and other transferrable skills. The training programme will be structured into taught modules combined with original research supported by secondments that will expose 14 fellows to both academia and industry. While developing tools that will reduce uncertainty in structural safety and improve infrastructure management, TRUSS will lay the basis for an advanced doctoral programme that will qualify graduates for dealing with the challenges of an aging European infrastructure stock, thereby enhancing their career prospects in both industry and academia.", null, 3041549.0, 5, 16, "TRUSS", null, "http://www.trl.co.uk", null, "h2020_193916_999475585"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 275423.0, "Support activities to the European transport policy and passenger rights including communication activities (06.02.05)", "fts_2016_34806"], [2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 121601.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2016_44422"], [2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 113481.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2016_45439"], [2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 93278.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2016_47487"], [2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 81078.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2016_49214"], [2017, "TRL LIMITED*", 74133.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2017_51429"], [2016, "TRL LIMITED*", 40371.0, "Reducing Union greenhouse gas emissions (34.02.01)", "fts_2016_58864"], [2017, "TRL LIMITED*", 17423.0, "Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services (02.03.01)", "fts_2017_67441"]]}}, "3JL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1377993600000, 1440979200000, "Development of an innovative translucent concrete sandwich panel with dynamic control of light transmission", "Polymer Optics Ltd", "The BrightWall consortium \u2013 comprising a value chain of three European SME manufacturers and distributors of light guide technology, building materials and technology embedded concrete, together with an architecture SME and an SME specialized in sustainable construction \u2013 aims to pursue a major market opportunity through the development of an innovative concrete material tailored for building applications, which allows for controlled transmission of daylight into buildings.
