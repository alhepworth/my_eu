The refugee problem is new in Turkey therefore the government bodyand personels have a wide area for improvement. An important part of the regugees in Turkey are formed up of adults.According to the International agreements and the constitution \u2018\u2019the right to live\u2019\u2019 is one of the essential rights that provides other rights to be put into practice. The Human rights agreement and the BM Economic, Socail and Cultural rights agreeement laws (ESKHS) backed by Turkey protects the adults rights to live. In order for refugees to continue their lives, they must improve their level of language. Because of the lack of their language the individuals can\u2019t communicate with their social environments causes problems also shown in statistics. The adults lacking Turkish creates unsolvable problems in health, education and all areas. According to the research done, refugees who do not learn the language are under more of a risk of being taken advantage of and badly treated.The study has resulted in two main problems: 1 Teaching the language; 2 Problems with refugees adapting the courses.From these results, our aim is for teachers from the community education centres to develop the refugees skills towards problems that they face related to language teaching, conflict, resolving and conciliation. Also by doing in-the-job observation in educational topics will support work experience development.Our special aims;To support 15 teachers against the struggle of discrimination within the classroom through a 5 day theory, 2 day on-the-job observation and a 1 daySTK visit at the York International Academy.20 teachers to a 5 day theory, 2 day on-the-job observation at the August Sander Schule in order to enhance their skills in teaching language.After the activities in Europe 6 teachers who participated in the education, a 10 day teachers training was organised in Gaziantep where participants were chosen within the community education centres that the refugees attended.Attendees are selected among the community education centers which refugees take courses at. Attendees are 15 teachers (Turkish - Turkish Language and Literature depts.) from 3 community education centers. Attendees are selected according to the project criteria plus the internal dynamics of each institution. 45 Percent of the attendees must be women. By these courses, attendees will be able to develop their capabilities of cross occupational skills, problem solving and conflict resolution handling. Europass certificates will be issued after the courses. With this certificate, they will be able to serve in in-service trainings.In order to increase the quality of the project, the project council is configured. The council is consisting of a project leader, 2 traveling leaders, 2 education leaders and 2 group leaders. There will be a Gaziantep Municipality officer involved in the project team. Project action committee is responsible for providing the project to proceed as it is planned. Also one of the consortium members must attend to the action committee meetings. Meetings are held quarterly.Studies to be done to spread the project; all of the activities will be shared in websites of consortium members and hosting organizaiotns. The parties which has refugees within, will be visited. Facebook page will be held publicly, so that the outputs of the course will be easy to reach. Since there is an ex-minister of Public Education involved in GED, outputs of the courses will be given to PEM (MEB). There will be an innovative model introduced especially for the operations done within PEM (MEB). In Gaziantep, 4 groups each consisting of 20 attendees will take educator courses. There will be tests conducted before and after courses to measure if the project is proceeding to the desired result. Principal of each institution will supervise the operations to check on the studies.Project results; teachers will develop cross abilities of \"differential methods of language teaching\". As soon as this applies to the educations, language learning efficiency of refugees will be attained. By mediation courses, teachers will also develop efficiency at solving conflictions which distract the class ambience. This will also help the institution increase the qualification of the education. Knowledge will be transferred reciprocally across EU on the subjects of language teaching and conflict resolutions.", "http://www.yorkia.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-TR01-KA104-033523_2"]]}}, "5UP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1420070400000, 1546214400000, "Driving innovation in pharmaceuticals: integrated studies of physical dissolution properties of crystalline and amorphous forms using enhanced orthogonal monitoring techniques", "Paraytec Limited", "The CRYDIS exchange programme will establish and support international and inter-sectoral transfer of knowledge and expertise in pharmaceutical and instrument science between several EU research institutes and industrial companies.

Access to this key technology and the further development of its capability offers the potential for breakthroughs in development of process understanding and of robust and widely applicable protocols.\nAdditional value is brought to CRYDIS through close working with synergistic European networks, leveraging a greater knowledge input and impact outreach. \nRunning parallel with the science programme, an innovation management work-package analyses effectiveness of the exchange mechanism in building a shared culture, transferring knowledge and developing understanding of processes that drive a product to market.

Not only pharmaceutical industry, but also researchers and their organisations, ethics boards and scientific journals are actively contributing to the general failure to come close to a 100% publication rate. An obvious reason is the complexity of the system as well as the limitation of resources, giving ample space for all stakeholders to avoid appropriate changes and draw attention to deficiencies outside their responsibility.\nThis project is based on the assumption that the existence of broad publication bias with seriously harmful impact has been accepted by all stakeholders and does not require further evidence.

Surveys, case studies and analyses of policies to reduce publication bias will be conducted to describe the current views and practice of stakeholders who are involved in knowledge translation.
