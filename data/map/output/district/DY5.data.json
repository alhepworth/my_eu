On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language. As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria.

Lack of perspectives, discrimination, unemployment, rural isolation and lack on role models among others do not need to last  forever if we work on it.We set up a series of exchanges to allow young people to have a positive European Experience - either away or in their home country.We may even may need to call it an INCLUSION PROJECT (Within project responsibles)as it offers opportunities to all young people.

Many adults have a hard time understanding or appreciating digital skills youngsters have, and their motivation to be constantly online. This often leads adults to ban digital devices during educational activities, closing themselves from getting to know new digital tools and very likely getting into conflicts with youngsters.As youth workers, we must be ready and open to learn and use tools youngsters know and additionally find creative ways to include them in our work  and dig it up our methods.
