Focusing on passenger ships, ferries and mega-yachts, the results will to a large extend be applicable also to other ships. A holistic life cycle performance assessment on ship level will guide the technical developments on system level, clustered in System Groups. The results will be integrated in 3 virtual show cases (ship concepts) demonstrating technical solutions as well as life cycle impact compared to current designs. Optimization tools will be developed and applied in a cooperative process proving feasibility, adaptability and efficiency to future commercial applications. The estimated overall impact of BESST will result in a reduction of life cycle cost of about 120 M\u20ac per PanMax ship and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 12% per ship and year, just to mention a few key figures. The key areas of technical developments include: \u2022 Space Optimisation and Easy Maintenance \u2022 Improving Payload to Gross Tonnage Ratio \u2022 Cost Efficient Building Processes and Refurbishment \u2022 Improved Energy Efficiency and Reduced Emissions \u2022 Noise and Vibration \u2022 Improved Reliability through Model-Based Design and Condition Monitoring \u2022 Optimization of Logistic Chains \u2022 Improving Safety and Security The consortium is formed by 8 leading EU shipyards. A global market share of 96% for cruise ships and 31% for ferries ensures the critical mass for applications on EU level. In addition, 20 research institutes and universities, 5 classification societies and 31 ship equipment suppliers (17 of them SME) are part of the research network of BESST.
