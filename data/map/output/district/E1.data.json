These interconnected global challenges call for far-reaching changes in how we think and act for the dignity of fellow human beings. It is not enough for education to produce individuals who can read, write and count. Education must be transformative and bring shared values to life. It must cultivate an active care for the world and for those with whom we share it. Education must also be relevant in answering the big questions of the day. Technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone cannot achieve sustainable development. It requires transforming the way people think and act. Education must fully assume its central role in helping people to forge more just, peaceful, tolerant and inclusive societies. It must give people the understanding, skills and values they need to cooperate in resolving the interconnected challenges of the 21st century.  In last years the public debate and discourse as well as the policies in different countries leaded to youth work field and especially youth workers to be more aware and engaged in development and global topics (climate change, sustainable development and life style, responsible consumption, etc.). These topics are often in various contexts on the public agenda and civil society is engaged in having a say in it. However there is a large group of youth workers whom themselves although aware and concerned about these topics are lacking competencies in how to engage and reach young people in their communities on these issues.\r\n\r\nAIM & OBJECTIVES\r\nThe project aims to increase the quality of youth work by equipping youth workers with tools and advanced competencies in global education.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this aim the project sets of group of specific objectives:\r\nOb1: Provide a space to the participants for sharing best practices in the field of youth work regarding global issues\r\nOb2: Increase the knowledge level of the participants in sustainable development and global topics\r\nOb3: Increase the knowledge level of the participants in global education methodologies (theory, concepts, steps, philosophy);\r\nOb4: Increase practical facilitation skills of participants for global education;\r\nOb5: Develop participants practical skills to design and implement global education activities and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be involved in different sessions through the methodology of non-formal education such as simulations, role playing, open space discussions, brainstorming, ice-breakers and reflection groups. By using non-formal education methods the team of trainers will facilitate the development of  practical skills of the participants to design and implement global education activities and workshops..\r\n\r\nThe development of such competencies will be helpful for youth workers/ leaders to stimulate and engage youngsters from their local communities with the global challenges. As a result, the participants of the project will strengthen their capacity to become better citizens and global educators and will be able to organize local initiatives and/or activities to engage young people with global citizenship.", "http://www.eschange.org", null, "erasmus_2016-3-NO02-KA105-000840_9"]]}}, "0RH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Together", "Sir John Cass and Red Coat Church of England School", 51062.0, 3, 3, "This project named \"Together\" has been planned among partners who have experience with fruitful cooperation and who can share their experience even in the future.

The London Sir John Cass and Red Coat Church of England School has 93% of students from minority ethnic groups and 82 students with refugee status, with Somali as the dominant ethnic group. About 80% of students are classified bilingual with Sylheti as one of the main languages spoken. The school supports 40 students in the early stages of learning English so the school staff is very experienced in integrating those children in the educational process and helping them to become successful in their new home country and master the English language as well. Istituto Comprensivo Statale Melanzio-Parini in Castel Ritaldi is located in a rural area where the families are usually not very openminded to immigrant families and whose sense of traditional way of living is very strong. On the other hand, there are a lot of foreign immigrant students in the classes and they sometimes have difficulties to introduce their culture and traditions and be accepted and respected in that environment.The objective of this project is to find and test various ways how to help minority/refugee/handicapped students or students with fewer opportunities or poor/outstanding school performance integrate in the mainsteam educational process and be respected and help other members of the school community to open their minds and be tolerant and cooperative. and not to look for simple solutions. We will use various activities and methodology to achieve the desired objective and would like most of them to become an integral part of our school curricula. Those activities include the creation of teaching/study material to be used with students with fewer opportunities, students with poor/outstanding school performance or students whose mother tongue is different from the national language. These materials (worksheets, cards) will be created, tested  and reviwed during the two years of the project duration and should become a common aid after the project is completed. There will be project days organised to give migrant/refugee students and their families a chance to introduce their culture, traditions and way of living to other members of the community. Other project days will be there for the school students and teachers to spend time with children from socially excluded areas or handicapped students to learn ad practice mutual respect and cooperation. We hope to establish new friendships not only between the participants from our schools but also between different students within the school, between students and teachers from our schools and their counterparts from other educational institutions and establish a fruitful relationship between our school and local/regional/national authorities which could serve as the basis for future cooperation and support which is necessary to succeed in working out the solution to the problems Europe and the world are facing today.", "http://www.sjcr.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA219-023855_2"]]}}, "1BB": {"nhs": {"data": [["R1H", "The Royal London Hospital", "nhs_R1H12"]]}}, "1DU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1485907200000, 1548892800000, "Big Data for Better Outcomes, Policy Innovation and Healthcare System Transformation (DO->IT)", "Health iQ LTD.", "The overall goal of the Big Data for Better Outcomes (BD4BO) programme is to facilitate the use of \u2018big data\u2019 to promote the development of value-based, outcomes-focused healthcare systems in Europe.

There have even been experimental 48-core ``single cloud computer' chips giving peak performance that would exceed that of a 100GHz single processor.

In order to share the best practices and to expand results, workshops are planned in the countries where staff mobility will take place and in Portugal. The involvement of the young people and staff who participated in the mobility in the promotion / dissemination activities will be encouraged. For the selection of students, an interview will be conducted, with defined criteria (see attached documents), and a jury will be created. A motivation letter, CV and a work plan are requested to the staff, giving preference to the course coordinators and valuing the motivational level. In terms of flows, more participants will be involved within two years, as provided in the European Development Plan (EDP). The partnership will be extended to other countries (e.g. Malta) and entities, to strengthen relations of stability and mutual trust with companies, facilitating the transition to the world of work and promoting employability / career promotion. The scope of partnerships will be broadened, as we have seen, in particular, to the participation in other projects. Another aim is to increase the sustainability of the projects through the extension of partnerships, fund raising actions and the sharing of public / private entities and dissemination with the environment. The path towards a School that strongly advocates Action in Europe has been pursued by promoting international initiatives, with the impact of long-term results growing both inside and outside the institution.

This project will bring together nearly 6000 students, teachers, families and local people from participating countries during the mobilty activities and during the planned activities. Teachers from different disciplines (Foreign Languages, Art, History, Geography, Literature, ICT, Religion and Ethics,  Literature) and students will work collaboratively to study the topics defined and train the participants on preserving culturral heritage, improving  desired basic personal  skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, reasoning, analysis, interpretation, synthesizing information, research skills and practices, interrogative questioning, creativity, artistry, curiosity, imagination, innovation, personal expression, perseverance, self-direction, planning self-discipline, adaptability, initiative, oral and written communication using discussion, survey, brain storming, drama, group work, seminar, collaborative pair work, out of class activity, exhibition, demonstration, observation trips, project based learning and similar  teaching and learning methods maximising the use of  multi-disciplinary components within creative processes to  allow us to identify some common elements.

The broad scope of our project enables all pupils including those from different ethnic backgrounds, to participate in an active and creative way.We wish to combine raising awareness of European citizenship and cultural heritage with an ideal for preserving our traditions and folk narrative for the next generations while focusing on preparing ourselves for a future in which technological and linguistics skills will be essential tools.

The students will gather information, evaluate it, and integrate it into the project. These are skills which will be useful in many contexts and are also basic principles of lifelong learning.We expect we could increase respect and tolerance towards all kinds of diversities. Students will realize their own qualities and learn to empathize, improve problem-solving skills and prevent the possible conflicts, find remedial solutions for major obstacles in communication. Participants will get to know their own qualities and could find solutions for big problems and will develop and apply personal and corrective studying techniques and increase their academic success at their schools so that they can choose jobs suitable for them. The outcomes or final products such as presentations, videos, working with social media tools will improve  ICT skills.

This will be in addition to local dissemination through school newsletter, school websites + communication through assemblies and local press/radio/TV.We believe that when the project finishes the students, teachers, parents, local people and authorities, will raise their awareness to the importance of preserving local traditions and culture, will learn about new ones to be aware of the diversities in different cultures through first hand experience.

By September 2019 French will be taught from years 2-6.\r\n\r\nAt the present time pupil progress in French is limited due to both teachers and teaching assistants having a limited knowledge of both the language and current language-learning methodology, none of our teachers being specialists in  MFL education. Teachers lack the knowledge and skills needed to plan lessons which consolidate and extend pupils learning.  In particular teachers find it hard to provide for the more able linguists within their classes and to ensure that their lessons are differentiated for all learners.\r\n\r\nOur key objective in undertaking this project increase our teachers and teaching assistants skills so that they are able to deliver the French curriculum across the school. Six staff members will participate in this project. They have been chosen by the MFL leader based on her knowledge of individual teachers; their linguistic skills, motivation to develop their skills and their middle leadership role within the school. The Senior leadership team has overseen the selection process.\r\n\r\nThe project will run over the course of one year with two mobilities of 5 days each. Our LA advisor has recommended a language certified school in Antibes, France based on the positive learning experiences of other teachers within the borough. Participants will take part fully in daily French targeted to their prior levels of attainment. Additionally, time will be taken to become familiar with the region and local customs. Participating staff will attend preparatory twilight French lessons, delivered by the borough Advisory Teacher before the first mobility. After the language course in Antibes teachers will put into place their new learning with their own classes when delivering the MFL Primary Curriculum. The school MFL leader will work alongside the LA MFL advisor to set up an e-twinning profile. She will use links established whilst on the language course find a partner school in France  with whom to work on a project beginning January 2019. \r\n\r\nThe project will have a significant impact on our French curriculum . Teachers will be inspired and motivated by their learning. This enthusiasm will be contagious and result in high pupil engagement. Teachers will discuss their experiences of learning a language with pupils which will result in a whole school ethos which actively promotes life-long learning.

The use of solid materials to culture adherent cells constitutes an important hurdle for the scale up, automation and speed up of cell culture and recovery. Our recent results show that bulk solid substrates are not necessary to promote cell adhesion, growth and fate regulation as adherent stem cells spread and proliferate readily at the surface of ultra-soft materials, even liquids. In such cases, cell adhesion is enabled by the formation of a mechanically strong layer (nanosheet) of proteins at the interface between the oil (liquid substrate) and aqueous medium. This key discovery opens the door to the engineering of protein nanosheets enabling the use of liquid, free-flowing substrates sustaining cell adhesion, expansion, isolation and recovery. \n\nProLiCell will design the biochemical and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein nanosheets that can sustain the formation of adhesion protein complexes and support cell proliferation and culture on materials with very weak bulk mechanical properties (liquids).

What makes it radical is that it plans to do this in situations (common for critical risk assessment problems) where there is little or even no data, and hence where traditional statistics cannot be used.  To address this problem Bayesian analysis, which enables domain experts to supplement observed data with subjective probabilities, is normally used. As real-world problems typically involve multiple uncertain variables, Bayesian analysis is extended using a technique called Bayesian networks (BNs). But, despite many great benefits, BNs have been under-exploited, especially in areas where they offer the greatest potential for improvements (law, medicine and systems engineering).  This is mainly because of widespread resistance to relying on subjective knowledge. To address this problem much current research assumes sufficient data are available to make the expert\u2019s input minimal or even redundant; with such data it may be possible to \u2018learn\u2019 the underlying BN model. But this approach offers nothing when there is limited or no data. Even when \u2018big\u2019 data are available the resulting models may be superficially objective but fundamentally flawed as they fail to capture the underlying causal structure that only expert knowledge can provide.\n\nOur solution is to develop a method to systemize the way expert driven causal BN models can be built and used effectively either in the absence of data or as a means of determining what future data is really required. The method involves a new way of framing problems and extensions to BN theory, notation and tools. Working with relevant domain experts, along with cognitive psychologists, our methods will be developed and tested experimentally on real-world critical decision-problems in medicine, law, forensics, and transport.

Our understanding of how these extremely thin and flexible objects are processed in flow is however inadequate, and this is hindering progress towards true market applications.

This can lead to poorly-oriented, crumpled sheets of small lateral size and therefore of low intrinsic value. Orientation is also a major issue, as ultra-flexible materials are difficult to extend and align.  In this project, I will develop nanoscale fluid-structure simulation techniques to capture with unprecedented resolution the unsteady deformation and fracture dynamics of single and multiple sheets in response to the complex hydrodynamic load produced by shearing flows.

Nevertheless, our ability to efficiently synthesise molecules is mostly limited to targets of low structural complexity. Traditional synthetic strategies require the presence of reactive functional groups that are used as handles for further functionalisation. This requirement is one of the factors dramatically enhancing the difficulty of syntheses. The last two decades have seen the emergence of a more straightforward alternative: the direct functionalisation of C-H bonds. Through this strategy the typically inert C-H bonds, ubiquitous in organic molecules, can be activated by transition metal catalysts and subsequently functionalised. This approach has allowed us to dream of a future where any organic molecule could be synthesised in a direct manner by simply replacing the C-H bonds of a substrate with the required functionalities, as if building a ball-and-stick molecular model with our hands. The development of a full set of C-H functionalisation methodologies will impact on all applied areas, such as the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and new materials. Furthermore, their atom efficiency and low waste generation ensures a privileged position among the green chemistry methods.\n\nFor this strategy to succeed, numerous challenges are still to be overcome. In this research proposal we aim at addressing one of them: the C-H functionalisation of aromatic compounds. We will build up a toolkit of complementary methodologies to functionalise aromatic C-H bonds under mild conditions (energy efficient), with broad functional group tolerance (general), and with absolute control of the regioselectivity.

Furthermore, at the end of the project the consortium will have developed four new and innovative inter-disciplinary curricula in small state studies based on the four teaching and research themes. The ten universities participating in this strategic partnership were all chosen based on their unique and outstanding academic standing in the field of small states and European integration. Their academic expertise lies within different disciplines but converges on their focus on the contemporary challenges and opportunities of small states in the international community. The consortium has developed four interlinked teaching and research themes (TRTs) that are built on the specific expertise of the partners and jointly create new cross-border synergies fostering the interdisciplinary development of small state studies at the European level. Together they form an integral part of the objective of developing expertise in teaching in small state studies while moving the discipline forward into new fields. The TRTs are:TRT 1:       Small states: Foreign policy and economic securityTRT 2:       Small states addressing the migration crisis TRT 3:       Small states in international law TRT 4:       Small states and the challenges of good governance The objectives of this project are linked to the following activities that will be developed in relation to the four TRTs: a. Two-week intensive summer academies open to the project\u2019s target groups of advanced Master's students, Ph.D. students and post-doctorate researchers b. Intensive study programmes (one week duration) focused on training new and upcoming teachers c. Multiplier events targeting an audience from a wide range of disciplinesd. Transnational meetings held in conjunction with the multiplier eventse. Blended mobility for students and young researchers/teachersf. Development of four new and innovative inter-disciplinary curricula in small state studies based on the four teaching and research themesThe methodology applied in the project is based on elaborative consultation and communication between the partners during the preparation and implementation of the planned activities as well as during the dissemination phase of the project. All the partners have jointly developed the four teaching and research themes and will contribute to the execution of the project according to their specific field of expertise.The project is expected to provide advanced Master\u2019s students, Ph.D. students and post-doctoral researchers  with greater skills and experience in teaching, and thus answers to the lack of training of teachers within higher education in Europe. All partner organizations will benefit from better trained teachers, which ultimately will have an impact on the quality of the education provided by the participating organizations. Furthermore, the expected impact of this project will be the integration of small state studies into new disciplines, as well as further strengthening small state studies in IR and Political Science. By training new teachers in incorporating a small state angle to their curricula the partnership ensures a wider impact of the project through its cross-disciplinary approach, with participants coming from disciplines outside of IR. This in turn will broaden the scope of small state studies given the impact from other disciplines on the study of small states.", "http://www.qmul.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IS01-KA203-017096_2"], [2016, "The EU and International Economic Law", "QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON", 35491.0, 1, 1, "This Jean Monnet Chair aims to enhance EU studies and research at Queen Mary University of London in the area of European Union (EU) International Economic Law.

The youth participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe,  Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\n\r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is the beginning of a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people through creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of non formal learning, combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists.  There are 56 participants in total from a range of youth centres and youth theatre groups, 32 of whom are socially disadvantaged young people with 9  less-abled young artists.  Together we will also explore a 5 year plan of youth activities.  OC is delighted to welcome its first Romanian partner. This is highly significant for OC as in 1995 the company was invited to tour Romania with the British Council.  \"Shameless\" their current music theatre production, directed by David Glass, was a great success in Bucharest, Cluj, Brasov and other cities in Romania.  More importantly the OC artists gained immense respect for Romanian artists and their culture and at the time said that it was in Romania that they grew up as artists.  With Romania becoming a full member of the EU, whose people can now travel freely, it is important that we can contribute to the spread of knowledge, culture and history that surrounds this beautiful country, helping to combat the current spread of  racism connected with their people.  Our programme partners in Serbia and Bosnia have also taught us about their countries and we have learned a great deal from our active engagement with their cultures since 2004.  Cultural awareness, tolerance, inclusiveness, deeper learning, understanding of the other, is at the heart of this creative process.  \r\n\r\nThe activities in this project include:\r\nWays of creating change through culture and the arts- democracy and the global citizen\r\nThe use of music and the creative arts to develop understanding and tolerance through cultural awareness\r\nRespect for the environment and public space\r\nBuilding confidence and the development of  youth leadership skills\r\nRacial and ethnic tolerance\r\nInclusion - understanding of difference - disabilities, gender, race, class, wealth/poverty\r\nGive and Gain - what you get out of life if you give\r\nPartnership development\r\nAlternative methods of finding employment, a new society - skills development, cultural activities - creating the social entrepreneur?\r\n\r\nMany highly regarded cultural commentators have written about the importance of culture to us as  human beings, \r\nFrancois Materasso, \"To put it simply, culture is the expression of human values\" \r\nhttp://www.missionmodelsmoney.org.uk/sites/default/files/24446185-Many-Voices-by-Francois-Matarasso-2006_0.pdf\r\n\r\nComment from a young Bosnian participant in a previous Opera Circus EU Cultural Project:-\r\n\"The project had a profound impact on my life, ideas and thoughts in regard to the future of me individually and my responsibility towards the healing of my society.

Considering that domestic heating and hot water provision accounts for nearly 40% of total energy demand it is clearly desirable to increase market penetration of renewable heating systems. On a domestic scale solar thermal systems are increasingly common and are, to the general public, the most visible renewable energy technology. Moreover, compared to biomass they have distinct user benefits when it comes to domestic heating or hot water provision as they do not need physical feedstock. However, despite significant market growth their market penetration only accounts for 0.05% of our total energy consumption. This is mainly due to the high initial investment required which is a function of equipment and installation costs. Conventional collectors rely on high value materials such as copper and aluminium, which are essential to achieve acceptable performance. However, these materials are also relatively expensive and it is unlikely that component costs will decrease in the future. Moreover, supply of these materials is limited and not large enough to cope with expected increases in demand. Alternative materials such as polymers have been investigated and can theoretically offer significant cost savings due to potential weight reductions, mass production techniques and increased freedom of functional design. However, they are generally not suitable for domestic type solar thermal installations. This is mainly due to their low heat deflection temperature and thermal conductivity. In PolySol we aim to develop a novel polymeric collector that can substitute a metallic solar thermal collector for domestic heating and hot water applications.

Examples are catastrophic ship accidents with a tremendous pollution of the maritime environment or fatal explosions during the use of transport vehicles. Although evolving defects have to be identified in time to enable appropriate repair, preventive maintenance activities are usually carried out on time driven basis. As example transport products for cargo like crude oil and pressurised gases have to be taken out of service for visual inspection and sub-sequent non-destructive tests (NDT). Findings have to be repaired later on. This procedure is time consuming and expensive, especially the lost service time decreases the competitiveness of the European transport industry. Despite this high effort the risk of not detecting the onset of a defect is still implied in this maintenance process and thus failure within the next service period may occur. The proposed maintenance process is based on monitoring the status of the structural integrity in terms of developing fatigue cracks and active corrosion using the Acoustic Emission (AE) technology. It is proven, that AE detects active cracks, and based on the results of EU-funded project \u201ccorrosion detection of ship (EVG1-CT-2002-00067)\u201d, it is evident, that AE is able to detect and evaluate active corrosion.

Therefore, the BSZ was taking part in the newly launched Erasmus Plus Programme in 2014 and 2015. Due to the great success of these two projects, the Erasmus Plus Learning Mobility has to be continued in an optimized way. As a consequence, the BSZ is sending selected students, mainly from the areas of wholesale, office administration, industry, banking, insurance and logistics, to a three-week education and vocational training programme at the College of Central London (CCL) in London.

The 14 trainees are doing an apprenticeship at an advanced stage in the German Dual System.\r\n\r\nWe intend to conduct the mobility projects in several stages. In the first strand, we primarily intend to prepare the theoretical backgrounds in the College of Central London and, building on these, develop bi-national educational modules. In a second strand, we intend to involve apprentices and test, improve and extend these modules in cooperation with the SRC in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the project, the staff of the three colleges involved will mutually enrich their professional expertise. Further pieces of the training we aim for are information on the British vocational educational system, comparison of methodical and didactic approaches, job-shadowing and industrial placements in local companies, comparison of national educational laws, rules and regulations, and comparison of national standards as to tests and examinations. This expertise will find its way into the bi-national (English/German) educational modules, which are based on the different national curricula.\r\n\r\nThe testing stage of the created educational modules will be put into practice in the course of the planned IVT project with Northern Irish \u2013 German student teams at the SRC.\r\nThe mutual educational goal in this extraordinary learning environment should be considered a pattern that can be transferred to larger educational modules. The training project also aims at the possibility of an English final examination that might be acknowledged by the British Chamber of Commerce. That is, in this case, the participants should take an examination in the course of this particular learning module. The results of this examination are expected to show whether students are able to participate in the final examination of the British Chamber of Commerce in the course of a subsequent longer and more time-consuming training project.\r\n\r\nThis particular learning module is about planning, assembling and controlling a conveyor belt, using also pre-machined and pre-manufactured components and assemblies. Further details are the principle of operation of the conveyor belt, including the chosen equipment such as drives, sensors and actuators. In the course of the project, it is also necessary to apply respectively transfer basic knowledge in the field of PLC programming, deepen that particular knowledge and control the conveyor belt with a PLC. The option of networking several conveyors in a successive stage is also integrated in the module.\r\nFurthermore, the students will become acquainted with country specific technical systems and different approaches. As the target hardware and the target software platforms of the colleges vary, it is necessary to adapt them to further a common international standard.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the participants will acquire intercultural and social skills and lose the fear of close contact with citizens of other countries. Also the general language skills of the participants and especially the practical use of technical terms will improve. The opportunity of experiencing actual applications of the teaching and learning content in the course of industrial placements will enhance the participants' motivation in the vocational training and their willingness to work abroad.\r\n\r\nInvolving educational personnel in the training project brings about enhanced motivation among this personnel and consequently also among the students and their companies. It is also innovative, enhances the quality in various fields and prepares the basis for a better European understanding.

Therefore, improvement of health care of HMs is an unmet medical need. Thus, it is important to define and align standard and efficient sets of HMs outcomes to measure and evaluate HM data for clinical decisions, long term risk/benefit profile, reimbursement, value analysis, and clinical trials design. Improving outcome measures and endpoint definitions by taking into account 'real-life' data and differences in cross-national healthcare practice will undoubtedly result in an optimized, sustainable and effective treatment delivery, as well as in desirable and innovative accelerated pathways for novel drug availability. All these challenges will be addressed within a pan-EU perspective by HARMONY (Healthcare Alliance for Resourceful Medicines Offensive against Neoplasms in HematologY), a comprehensive public-private European consortium of excellence.\nHARMONY consortium is made up of 51 partners: 44 participants from 10 European countries and 7 pharmaceutical companies from the EFPIA. HARMONY aims to assemble, assess, connect, and analyze heterogeneous HM patient derived Big Data sets to define sets of outcome indicators that can be used for decision-making by key healthcare stakeholders. The consortium will orchestrate leading experts and working cooperative groups in HMs, European study alliances, pharmaceutical market leaders, patient advocacy groups, HTA and regulatory agencies, to: (i) optimize Europe-wide data collection and create a high-quality HM data repository for further explorative studies; (ii) establish a clinical data-sharing platform that empowers clinicians, patients and policy stakeholders to improve decision-making procedures and identify appropriate treatments to patients with HMs (iii) foster the design of innovative clinical and pre-clinical studies; (iv) define meaningful and harmonized clinical endpoints and outcomes in HMs in order to facilitate clinical decision-making; (v) identify specific biomarkers, which better define outcome parameters (vi) provide novel resources and algorithms to more rapidly advance innovative concepts of patient management in HMs; (vii) involve the patient perspective; (viii) provide a framework for legal, ethical and governance issues. Moreover, the consortium will integrate molecular markers to improve patient outcomes and personalized health management processes.\nRegarding governance, HARMONY has a multi-level organizational structure, which includes representatives from all stakeholders, and which ensures efficient and effective management, decision-making, and control of work package (WP) activities. This will be accomplished by creating well-defined management and decision-making structures with clear accountabilities and decision rules. The Consortium Management Bodies will be the Executive Committee, the Steering Committee, and the General Assembly. The management of Big Data is one of the key-features in the consortium. Therefore a Data Quality Supervision Committee will define the quality criteria for 'valid records' and perform the review of the quality of the patients\u2019 data provided by different sources (beneficiaries, Associated Members and Co-operative Working Groups).\nHARMONY is covering seven HMs (multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes and pediatric HMs) structured in eight WPs, including: i) the most important key opinion leaders in each disease; ii) several European institutions involved in the study of HMs; iii) the EFPIA lead companies in HMs; iv) institutions experienced in studying 'omics' data; v) a large panel of stakeholders (regulatory agencies, HTA, and patients organiza", 133186.0, 34655002.0, 11, 51, "HARMONY", null, null, null, "h2020_209464_998135433"]]}}, "8PY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Social Innovation&Inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals", "eRevalue ltd", 92617.0, 7, 9, "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy inclusion, peace and prosperity. To address and tackle social, economic and global issues, and help countries, governments and societies in combating them, SDGs define global priorities and aspirations for 2030 for the planet to \"eliminate extreme discrimination, poverty and put the humanity on a path of sustainability\". In order to help companies contribute to the realization of the SDGs, UN created ''The SDG Compas\", as United Nation stated \"it presents five steps for companies to maximize their contribution to the SDGs\".

Since there is a lack of education of adults when it comes to this topic, especially unified educational tool that would facilitete the learning, consortium is established of nine renowned partners that all enjoy great reputation in sustainability and education of adults, entrepreneurs anad managers. All partners have a wide network of stakeholders in this area and the possibility to affect their communities. Project will also include nine different companies and nine decision makers with experience in social SDGs. \r\n\r\nThe project SociSDGs will include several types of activities. Three two-day transnational project meetings (TPM) will be held in order to evaluate the project progress, depening on a phase: one in the beginning to officially begin the project, one in the middle to follow the current projects progress and one in the end to evaluate the overall project and present the results. Learning activities (LA), five short-term joint staff training events will be 5-day education activities for exchanging practices when it comes to measuring companies social impact and inclusion, and measuring the integration of socially-oriented SDGs in their business models that are build upon the UN guidelines, in order to achieve better understanding of this issue and help companies improve their work and active participation in the sustainable development. Methodology used in every activity will be twofold: in the first part consortium will focus on the presentation of examples, which will be followed by the discussion, interactive workshop and working on the creation of nine webinars and a social SDG handbook. In order to successfully disseminate the project, project partners during 24 months will organize and participate in different multipier events, as well promote the project through various on-line tools. \r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to the realization of strategy Europe 2020 on EU level because it will result with increased adult, companies and decision makers education about measuring their social impact when it comes to SDGs as well as measuring the integration of socially-oriented SDGs in their business models in order to actively participate in assuring sustainable development and social inclusion in business sector. \r\n\r\nParticipants and their organizations will through exchange of practices increase the knowledge of the mentioned topics, meaning that they will gain precious knowldge of trends in sustainability that will facilitate the development of their work and  educational competences, as well as adaption to current and future working conditions.
