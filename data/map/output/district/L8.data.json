Over the last years it was strongly viewed that our students where passing a big amount of time in the Internet 2.0 environments. This need passed over the educational community, where there was the necessity for each classroom to continue their educational  community in the 2.0 environment.\r\n\r\nRegarding the fact that we wanted to keep this joy of participating in a educational community and to empower it to a more knowledge creation procedure, we estimated that there was a need for new tools in which we could address our needs as an educational community. \r\nWe needed to find a new way to keep up and empower the joy of participating in a community and especially in an educational community and also to transform it to a joy of learning and inquiring for students real needs in a creativity procedure. \r\nAlso there was a need of visibility. Due to social conditions (immigration, unemployment) some of our beneficiaries where socially invisible. So they needed to develop a sense of belonging and also to built up again their identity telling their story.\r\n\r\nBeginning from these needs, we decided that  Digital Storytelling  was the tool to cover them. DST refers to a short form of digital film-making that allows everyday people to share aspects of their life story. DST is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of ordinary people who use digital tools to tell their personal 'story' (digital narratives). Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats.\r\nOne can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse people share their life story and creative imaginings with others, over the Internet and other electronic distribution systems. In DST students take an active role in learning, rather than passively receiving information from instructors. With Digital storytelling and the use of an educational platform, in a more interactive and learning environment, students can become knowledge creators, producers, editors, and evaluators and knowledge inter- actors.\r\n\r\nBelieving that this tool meets the needs addressed before, we designed a project that will:\r\n-create of a methodology guide for the Digital story Telling (DST) methodology\r\n-train the consortium's educational organisations, on DST\r\n-implement the DST in the educational procedures of the partners, in order to meet their needs. On national level there will be organising thematic workshops, on the topic of work. The workshops will be for two generations or for people from different nationalities working together\r\n-develop the tool with the feed-back from the implementation procedure, in the topic of work in a transgenerational and transnational aspect and the create  an educational tool-kit\r\n-create a learning e-platform, that will offer the e-public-space for the creation of the educational community and the exchange of the educational materials\r\n-promote  the e-platform and the Digital storytelling as new tools, by the dissemination of the tool-kit and the realization of a multiplier event addressed to education facilitators.\r\n\r\nDigital SELF 's objectives focuses on:\r\n-The fostering of the use of ICT into educational and social initiatives\r\n-The promotion of interaction, communication and collaboration in a knowledge community, where the joy of learning, the inquiry and the creativity are the base for the knowledge creation\r\n-The empowerment of learning responsibility and autonomy of our students\r\n-The social visibility of vulnerable groups\r\n-The transgenarational and transnational transfer of knowledge and skills\r\n-The contribution in investigating the link between work and one's identity\r\n\r\nBeneficiaries of the project activities are:\r\n-The educational staff of the consortium's educational organisations.\r\n-Learners that will participate in the national workshops.

This training will directly reach 400 teachers across the UK, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.  These teachers will facilitate \u2018difficult conversations\u2019 with over 12,000 pupils.  The results of this project will be shared with 150 teacher training institutions and 1050 trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nThe project will be delivered in five phases.  Phases 1 and 2 will result in a five day training in dialogic teaching.  The main focus of this training will be Philosophy for Children as a technique for supporting teachers to facilitate \u2018difficult conversations\u2019.  This will be attended by all partners, and will also involve them sharing their teaching experiences and approaches to developing critical thinkers and challenging extremist views.   Phases 3 and 4 involve these partners delivering cascade training to 100 teachers in each of countries.  This will then allow teachers to work with their pupils on a projects called \u201cHolding Difficult Conversations\u201d.  These projects will take either a current or historic event, and look at it through different media perspective, considering the arguments, evidence and ethics.\r\n\r\nThe classroom projects using dialogue techniques, will be collected in a Teacher Toolkit.  This will be the subject of the dissemination phase \u2013 the project\u2019s fifth and final phase.  This phase is crucial as it will share the learning of teachers in schools, with trainees who will become the teachers of tomorrow.  Each partner will work closely with providers of Initial Teacher Training to disseminate the Toolkit to over 1050 trainees.  This partnership is key to the sustainability of the project, as partners and universities will seek ways of embedding dialogue techniques into teacher training.\r\n\r\nThe activities will result in teachers having increased skills to teach critical thinking, and an understanding of how this can be used to challenge extremist views in the classroom.  Pupils will become more critical, caring, creative and co-operative in their learning, as teachers introduce aspects of the Philosophy for Children approach.  Trainee teachers will become aware of the need for critical thinking and have access to a relevant Teacher Toolkit resource.   Partners will have increased their capacity to train others, and developed networks to share their learning.\r\n\r\nThese chain of activities and results will support children to engage with the wider world around them, in positive and thoughtful ways.

Among BI's objectives are youth support, particularly disadvantaged youth, and accompanying them in finding employment in arts, show and the cultural field.Rich of our mutual experiences, this project's goal is to put young people whose primary motivation is to share their passion for their artistic practice in a position to cooperate with each other, and for the structures that support them to accompany them in their self empowerment.These actions include the building of framework for exchanges that legitimate their goal to live these exchanges at an European level, to give them opportunities to sustain these exchanges and to develop their capacity building, both personal and professional, on their way to adulthood.These young people with learning disabilities will experiment different periods in which they will be the actors of non-formal formation, in which they will pass on their musical skills and their creativity to others, by giving them the possibility of being the musical teachers. This situation scenario will take place with the help of professional presenters and the department of research for the sciences of education of the university of Liverpool, partner of BI.

So great is the uncertainty about the political direction of travel in Europe that on a daily basis we continue to see a rolling back of personal freedoms, a threat to democratic values and human rights. We now see the mainstreaming of far-right, anti-immigration anti-Islam homophobic extremists, validating hate speech and encouraging discrimination and hatred against people with \u2018protected characteristics\u2019. \r\n\r\nHow do we respond to the challenges facing young people with 'protected characteristics' ? Our response is to challenge the direction of political travel, through firstly developing and delivering an arts engagement mobility experience that brings people together from different backgrounds and perspectives to explore create and present collaborative work at large-scale cultural events which encourages people to celebrate the richness and diversity of a multicultural multi-faith contemporary European society. \r\n\r\nWhat we want to carry out: The main aim of the youth exchange is  to develop collaborative performing arts work that  promotes, develops and conveys the key message of \u2018Our diversity shapes our Creativity\u2019 as well as presenting collaborative work that offers a counter narrative to migration and immigration. Through collaborative workshops supported by professional artists and within peer led sessions our project will see creative work carried out that assist in developing key skills and competencies, enabling young people to successfully develop carnival arts work that offers audiences different views on what is happing in Europe in order to expose some of the myths being presented as 'real news' (for example issues around migration and immigration). \r\n\r\nCollaborative performance work will be presented within our annual festival events in Dublin with the projects messages reaching hundreds of people as well as workshop sessions delivered within cultural and community venues across Dublin. Our arts learning methodology will be used as a tool to modernize youth work and unlock and make relevant the sub priorities of  Erasmus+ for young people from backgrounds of less opportunity. \r\n\r\nObjectives: In general our mobility project will see the participants gain the knowledge and skills needed to develop and present collaborative digital and performing arts work to the public; deliver arts learning workshops as well as engage in exploring ideas for new projects within the Erasmus+ programme priority areas. \r\n\r\nThe specific project objectives: \r\n\r\nTo provide quality international mobility opportunities for young people from diverse backgrounds;\r\nTo gain new competences and experiences of the use of the arts as a tool for making positive contributions to society; \r\nTo deepen knowledge, skills and attitude in order to better organize international youth arts engagement projects;\r\nTo build participant skills through practical workshops, peer to peer work and partnership building activities;\r\nTo develop best practice models of arts development that act as key tools and drivers for combating racism, xenophobia and discrimination; \r\nTo use digital capture and social media platforms to create and disseminate key messages within the project.\r\n\r\nA1: A Youth Exchange/mobility of youth workers and young people will take place in Dublin, August  2017.

Each partner will bring 8 participants with fewer opportunities and/ or disadvantaged backgrounds (school drop outs, unemployed, delinquent) between 16-20 years. Within the 12 days at the EP Summercamp they will try out various creative and sportive disciplines, e.g. media (digital storytelling), theatre (theatre of oppressed), music (beat production, songwriting, recording), dance (Streetdance, Clipdance) and sport (Basketball, Volleyball, Kaos-Football, Football-Golf). Like this youth with fewer opportunities will get access to a safe intercultural learning environment where they can try out ways of team cooperation, creative expression and develop faith in their own abilities. Main aim is to recognize own personal resources, to step beyond assumed personal limits and widen the social and creative competencies. \r\n\r\nThe EP Summercamp includes an advanced planning visit that will be happening May 14th-16th 2015 in Jugendakademie Walberberg.

These activities reinforce pride in cultural roots, encourage a sense of place and belonging as well as aiding in the development of social, technical and creative skills. Creative programming enables and allows us to explore aspects of our cultural heritage and aspects of our changing identities. \r\n\r\nAll partners in this project strongly believe that creativity is a strong tool to activate and empower youth, to (informally) teach them how to communicate with others, including those with different cultural backgrounds and ultimately how to contribute to the development of an equal and diverse society. These are strong statements, but we carry with us the experience of several years in the field of youth and creativity and we know how creative projects can change the minds of youth in a positive way and we know how it can open new future opportunities. This is the main reason we will continue to bring youth from several deprived neighborhoods in different European cities together, on location in Amsterdam Nieuw-West\r\n \r\nIn earlier years the focal point of these exchange projects was working towards a carnival parade, to celebrate diversity. The Erasmus+ participants joined local people in this parade. We managed to involve the hard to reach local target groups better every year, but we sensed that we could enrich the program and the experience for the Erasmus+ participants and to give them even more influence and tasks in setting up and executing the activities. For that reason we also started to collaborate closely with the Shokkin Group (affiliated partner).\r\n\r\nSo Celebrate Creativity - more than previous projects - focuses on social inclusion of vulnerable youth through meeting, sharing, co-organizing and giving community- workshops. We focus both on international youth, who can meet in the framework of the exchange we organize and the local youth that will benefit from working with international peers.  It will expand the horizons of both the international as well as the local participants and it will encourage intercultural communication on different levels. \r\n\r\nWe take creativity in the broadest sense and do not limit ourselves to a specific discipline. The youth joining the project bring in their own creative skills, passion and energy. As they are the core of the exchange, they will completely determine the content of the activities. The partners and the project coordinator just offer the framework, including contacts with organizations working with local youth. \r\n\r\nWe want to address the following issues and needs:\r\n\u2022 Inclusion of local youth in the project through workshops\r\n\u2022 Developing the participant\u2019s abilities to work on an intercultural project.\r\n\u2022 Producing creative outputs that celebrate European diversity and active citizenship.\r\n\u2022 Developing group work skills.\r\n\u2022 Developing the project management skills.\r\n\r\nWe set ourselves the following objectives by the following means:\r\n\r\n-To give the participants (more) life skills: by exploring and sharing skills through creative workshops, and celebrate creativity and diversity, through collaborative performance work; \r\n-Open up the minds of the youth participants: by exploring and celebrating the diversity of young people\u2019s histories, traditions and cultures through creativity; \r\n-To develop and strenghten the partner organizations in their creative work in their communities: by exploring the processes used to build and present creative work that celebrates European cultural diversity and impacts on ideas of European citizenship; \r\n-to improve the skills of the participants of working collectively in an intercultural environment;  \r\n- to develop their social, personal and group work skills: by giving them the opportunity to work in mixed nations and mixed gender groups;\r\n- to develop their ability to act as an active citizen in their own community: by giving them the experience of having taken part in peer led skills sharing workshops in local community contexts.", "http://www.brouhaha.uk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001609_3"], [2018, "United Sight & Sound of Diversity \u2013 Fighting Hate crime through Cultural Action", "BROUHAHA INTERNATIONAL", 31642.0, 6, 6, "Project context:\r\nBetween July-December 2016, some 245 reports of racist crimes were made through the State\u2019s tracking system, the European Network Against Racism (Enar),  marking a significant rise on the previous six months.  The racist crime monitoring system received 190 reports in the first six months of 2016. As a result of this increase, experts in hate crime and victims of homophobic and racist crimes appeared before the Oireachtas in March 2017, calling for the introduction of hate crime legislation \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. The National Steering Group Against Hate Crime (which includes organisations representing minority ethnicity, LGBT and traveller communities, elderly people, disabled communities and experts in the area of hate crime) presented a Private Members\u2019 Bill to the Oireachtas, calling for all political parties to support the introduction of the law. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na recorded a hate crime nearly every day. Research suggests that these figures are unrepresentative of the true prevalence of hate crime, and that the real statistics are likely to be much higher. Contributors to a recently published collection, 'Critical Perspectives on Hate Crime: Contributions from the Island of Ireland', address the manner in which hate crime presents itself in the \u201cRepublic of opportunities\u201d. The contributors to the book have documented the experiences of individuals and communities in Ireland who have been victims of hate crime, the work of the advocacy groups who support them, and the State\u2019s response to the phenomenon. The book presents contributions from academics, activists, policy makers and practitioners, and perspectives from a range of disciplines including sociology, law, social policy, criminology and equality studies. The range of identity groups whose experiences the book addresses includes racialised minorities; disabled people; Traveller and Roma communities; lesbian, gay and bisexual people; the trans community; sex workers; and communities affected by sectarianism. The evidence presented makes it clear that violence on the basis of difference continues to be a real challenge for both parts of this island in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nWhat we want to carry out: \r\nThe main aim of this Project is to develop digital products and performing arts work that deal with hate crime.

Media has a large impact on how these wars are perceived by the public in Europe; especially concerning the Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Palestine situations, there seem to be wars of images and interpretations. When is it justified to go to war? When are military interventions justified in the name of human rights? When are human rights used to propagandise military intervention that actually serve economical or power interests? These are crucial questions in the current public discourse.\r\n\r\nBoth mass media and independent internet sources may be susceptible to spread propaganda of war. It is vital for a peaceful future of Europe and the world, that young people from both societal minorities and majorities develop a critical and analytical view on media discourses on war and peace; neither taking mass media news reports automatically for truth, nor developing conspiracy theorist attitudes taking all mass media communication for lies.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will invite 42 young people from The Netherlands, the UK, Romania, Greece, Italy, Lithuania and Germany to Cologne; many of which have ethnic minority/ migration background in their countries of residency. They will jointly develop creations on the topic of war and peace from their perspectives as young people and citizens of future Europe: Films, media installations and art works that will be presented to the public in the context of 24Hz festival, a new festival for media, arts and cultural diversity that will run for the first time in Cologne in August 2015.\r\n\r\nThe participants will meet in a creative process involving the strengths of every individual participant, and they will experience cultural diversity as a source of wealth and joy, deconstructing propaganda of war as well as ethnisation and culturalisation of conflicts. They will be coached by media professionals well-experienced in work in non-formal education processes with international groups, fostering social and intercultural learning as well as participation of every individual.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be given the chance to join workshops by professional experts to increase their competencies in arts and media. Those who are on a advanced competency level already will also be given the chance to offer own workshops for other participants and for the general public visiting the 24Hz festival.\r\n\r\nThey will have the chance to present their creations in the professional framework of 24Hz festival to a large audience, during a vernissage on Aug 24th with subsequent exhibition, and the cinema premieres on Aug 28th.\r\n\r\nAfter the exchange, results will be published on the project website and on Youtube and disseminated via Facebook, Twitter and other social media tools. There will be a crew evaluation meeting in Cologne. Also, project and evaluation results will be discussed with the international partners. The group will stay in contact through a closed Facebook group.\r\n\r\nAims and objectives of the project include:\r\n\u2013 to support self-empowerment of young people to develop critical views on the public/media discourse on war and peace, and to develop ideas and visions for a future peaceful and open Europe\r\n\u2013 to bring together young people from various European countries, to give them a chance to live and work together \u2013 and to learn from each other as well as from professional artists and coaches\r\n\u2013 to give room for intercultural learning, for exchange of views and cultural backgrounds, for appreciation of cultural diversity\r\n\u2013 to empower young people to express their feelings and wishes and to articulate their ideas and demands on the subject of war and peace by means of media and arts\r\n\u2013 to create a films, media installations and art works on the topic in transnationally mixed groups; and to share them in public presentation and via social media\r\n\u2013 to help each participant to grow as a person, an artist and a citizen of Europe, to get a wider cultural horizon and to develop her or his talent, maybe even towards professionalism, thus facilitating social inclusion\r\n\u2013 to promote the project results and the ERASMUS+ YOUTH IN ACTION programme to a wide public\r\n\u2013 to raise public awareness of the talent and motivation within current European urban youth", "http://www.brouhaha.uk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DE04-KA105-001481_6"], [2016, "Festival of Cultures - A Celebration of Diversity.", "BROUHAHA INTERNATIONAL", 26887.0, 7, 7, "Context/background of project: Across Europe the arts and cultural industries make valuable and significant contributions to the social and economic wellbeing of society as a whole.

During these two weeks, participants will receive an intensive full time workshop program which is based on the concepts of learning by doing and peer education.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 we will work with the theme: Heroes. Heroes play an exemplary role, this is something people need, so they can learn from others. Europe also needs heroes and positive role models to create more cohesion and less division. The participants will be asked to choose their own hero. The underlying story connects participants and gives a direct cause to start talking to each other. It is important to think, especially in this era of negativity, exclusion, prejudice, discrimination who our heroes are and what we can contribute ourselves to the world.

Personal contact between young people from different countries is the best way to make them aware of it and start a dialogue between them. By connecting a social theme to artistic content R & R aims at stimulating and inspiring European youth to form an opinion and to express themselves. The international dimension allows their artistic-cultural but also their social-political horizon to widen. At least 30 young people from 6 countries and appr. 5 coaches and 10 guest teachers contribute to this project, resulting in a jointly-created final performance by the youngsters.\r\n\r\nImpact \r\nFrom our extensive experience with international exchanges, we know that it has a considerable impact on social, personal, social and artistic & intercultural development of participants. Participants often talk about a life-changing experience. We illustrate a few important effects: The participants during the Experience learn to share their opinions or ideas in front of a group and feel that their opinion matters. Many gain friendships and build their professional network. Participants learn a lot from the coaches but more importantly, also from their peers. Some participants during the Experience meet people from other countries for the first time and gain more experience in working with people from different cultural backgrounds. Reflecting on and discussing a relevant social theme is also for many participants something they have not done before (in this way). With the Experience we create a safe space in which participants discover who they are and what they stand for, surrounded by peers and role models. At the same time we encourage \u2018thinking-out-of-the-box' that bring participants into contact with people, views, cultures, flavors etc which they otherwise would not easily encounter.

Yet, the current European context sees an increase in youth unemployment (more than 50 % in some countries) and where the cultural sector has a image problem in its capacity to give \" a real work \" to the young people.The organisations committed in this youth exchange project, all from the artistic and cultural sector, wish to lead an experiment around a exchange project for young people from 5 countries: France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal, particularly in direction of groups of young people in a disadvantaged situation but whose artistic commitment proves that they are in a positive approach in the construction of their practice, their project and their future as an adult.This project is a cooperative alliance between experimented structures which wish to meet the challenge to strengthen the skills of these young people and the youth workers who accompany them, to create the best conditions for the delivery of non-formal training, for peer led collaborative teaching, and for the creation of new cooperations that will create new actions and job opportunities at the European and international level.The project is divided in periods of artistic and technical workshops, public performances, visits of companies, cultural industries, meetings with professionals of the cultural and arts sector, the sessions of coaching and capacity building, through informal and peer led learning teaching techniques, to allow the young people, particularly the disadvantaged youth, to feel legitimate to live an intercultural experience at an European level and to strengthen their confidence and self-respect.thanks to these cooperative works, this exchange project will allow the partner organizations to pursue their works on the questions of certification of the young artists and the emergent cultural operators, by dealing with the possible label and award harmonisations at the European level.This project will take place in Toulouse from 2 till 9 April 2016 and will see the participation of 60 young people and 12 youth workers coming from the 5 countries of the partner organizations.This time of learning mobility will be organized around the following activities:Works on forward planning and preparation;Artistic and intercultural workshops;Sessions of capacity building;Group sessions between peers;Networking sessions;The construction and the presentation of the workshops' results through a performance;The development of multimedia products;Research, documentation and evaluation;The development of follow-up collaborations and the reflection on new cooperative projects.The used methods will be:Discussions and exchanges;Peer-led collaborative collective workshops;Informal training sessions;Practical sessions around specific artistic and/or technical skills;Conferences;Group Meetings;Evaluations;Networking actions;Intercultural activities.This exchange project is a project of intercultural immersion where the methods, the tools and practices which are implemented there, are an experiment to create a support plan for the youth in the creative sector and a rehabilitation of the image of the artistic and cultural sector, a sector which attracts numerous young people but which has to organize itself to facilitate their job integration and demonstrate its unexpected capability to be a major player on the economic field.", "http://www.brouhaha.uk.com", null, "erasmus_2015-3-FR02-KA105-010609_1"], [2014, "Carnival: Create and Celebrate  (Creative urban diversity in public spaces)", "BROUHAHA INTERNATIONAL", 19338.0, 6, 6, "Project: Carnival: Create and Celebrate (Creative urban diversity in public spaces)\r\nMultilateral exchange exploring cultural diversity through carnival arts (music, dance & costume making). \r\nDuration: 8 days of programmed activity.

These activities reinforce pride in cultural roots, encourage a sense of place and belonging and aid in the development of social, technical and creative skills. Carnival enables and allows us to explore aspects of our cultural heritage and aspects of our changing identities. Carnival is the largest culturally diverse celebration of a contemporary Europe and geographically traces the migration and immigration people through continents and countries, with roots in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, North and South America.

Many of the groups are from minority or culturally diverse communities and have not had the opportunity to be involved in international work before. \r\n\r\nThe project will use intercultural activities, workshops and performance as the main tools for young people from culturally diverse backgrounds to explore issues around cultural diversity and citizenship. The project will host a number of intercultural arts workshops delivered by professional facilitators and peer led skills sharing sessions in diverse community contexts.

What are the precise skills these young people develop in this frame? How can one measure the impact of mobility programmes on youth career paths? What assessment tools do we have? Is it possible to model these qualification processes ?\r\nIt seems interesting to explore these reflections during a four day meeting, that  will aggregate organisations from different European countries. All involved in the mobility of young people, partner organisations address these projects under different approaches, related to their national specificities (social, cultural, political, economical...)... \r\nTo meet best the different expectations, we will favor participatory methods such as the World Coffee or Delphi.

One lesson from those 4 days of collective reflexion, was the difficulty to measure personal and professional impacts on life trajectories of our targeted group ( young artists or creators, and especially those with less opportunities, for social, geographical or educational  reasons or sometimes because of their artistic identity. Thus, the need emerged fallowing this seminar to organize a meeting dedicated to feedbacks expression and \u201cstorytelling\u201d about  these young life path marked by mobility in order to formalize mobility added value.

Many of our students at Key Stage 4 go on to study languages at Key Stage 5 and university level and the chance to correspond and work with students in other countries would help us increase these numbers further.Based on the analysis of our needs, we have planned a project that will last for two years and will involve sending 16 members of staff on structured immersion courses in Spain (Santander) and France (Rouen) to; \u2022 develop participants\u2019 skills and confidence in the methodology required for the effective teaching of languages \u2022 improve delegates\u2019 competence and confidence in using Spanish/ French, leading to increased use of target language in their lessons on their return to the UK\u2022 allow participants to fully immerse themselves in another culture and develop their cultural awareness and understanding\u2022 give participants a bank of effective and engaging ideas to encourage active learning and facilitate excellence in the languages classroom \u2022 encourage the effective use of ICT resources to improve the teaching and learning of languages\u2022 familiarise them with key documents and resources enabling them to become more effective language teachers\u2022 encourage lasting links between schools and future partnership work.We expect these results;a stronger European dimension across our own school and our partner schools,staff with more skills offering more flexibility, and  improvements in teaching methodologies,improved resources and learning environments,impact on the broader curriculum with better cross curricular links and more links with literacy,the creation of tangible outputs such as new materials, better planning formats and improved systems in our school, improvements in our documentation such as Schemes of Work and policies, a robust series of dissemination activities which will help to multiply the impact of these activities beyond our school.All of these will lead to improvements in pupil choice and timetabling, increased uptake of languages, particularly at higher levels, and improvements in attainment.Staff from other departments will have the opportunity to communicate with their equivalents in Spain and France, build professional networks and share ideas with them. Other schools within our area will share our outcomes leading to an impact on their practice. They will be encouraged to develop the European dimension and take part in similar projects themselves in the future with our support. We will use the new skills and knowledge we have gained to develop activities that parents and the community can be involved in, for example cultural events and celebrations.There will be an impact across the EU as we will support the Erasmus + objectives through our project and will also focus on encouraging other schools to participate in the programme in the future.", "http://www.belvedereacademy.net", "The Belvedere Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023256_coordinator"]]}}, "7LF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RW4", "Windsor House", "nhs_RW506"]]}}, "7NN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1420070400000, 1440979200000, "Smart Ambulance: European Procurers Platform (SAEPP)", "Ambulance Today Ltd", "The objective of this project is to create and collate a consensus of agreement from Ambulance Users and Procurers on the core technology-centric features which, if correctly integrated into a suitably re-designed ambulance, would allow them to demonstrate, evaluate and deliver new models of in-community healthcare delivery, with the primary objective of avoiding unnecessary hospital attendances (& thus admissions) and the associated patient distress and hospital costs.

This situation is undesirable from both the perspective of European integration and of human rights. The right to health obliges governments to ensure that \u201chealth facilities, goods and services are accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, in law and in fact, without discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds\u201d (General Comment 14, 2000) paragraph 12 (b).\u2022 Good mental health is crucial for the successful integration of migrants in a new country. A rare quantitative survey of women internally or internationally trafficked for sex work or domestic service in selected European countries found that 70% of women had experienced both physical and sexual abuse during trafficking and that the majority exhibited severe physical and mental health symptoms such as back and abdominal pain, headaches, dizziness, gynaecological infections, depression and anxiety (Zimmerman et al. 2008).\u2022 There are variations in health among different migrant categories. For asylum seekers, research has focused on the physical and mental impact of conflict and war in some countries of origin; trauma associated with migration and settlement processes including isolation, loss of social status, poverty and insecure legal immigration status; and impact of government policies such as detention and dispersal in the receiving society. Systematic reviews of studies across European countries point to higher rates of depression and anxiety among asylum seekers and refugees compared to the national population or other migrant categories (Raphaely and O\u2019Moore 2010)The Create project will develop learning resources which support the professional development of new and existing Creative Therapists through the development pf approaches for professionals working with migrants experiencing from mental health issues. Create will develop 2 training modules which promote partnership working among Arts Therapists (Art Therapists, Dance/Movement Therapists, Drama Therapists or Music Therapists), existing packages of support for refugee and migrants to EU countries. It will also produce a training module specifically aimed at the supervisors of Arts Therapists working with Refugees and Migrants.", "http://www.solaarts.blogspot.co.uk", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024526_3"]]}}}}
