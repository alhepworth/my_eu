According to the last General Population Census the share of children and adolescents in the total population of the Nigde/Turkey region is above country averages. In Nigde the age group 14-25 constitutes a larger share of population (44.0 %) relative to the country average (16.6) makes it necessary to develop special policies and set targets for children and adolescents. Unemployment is one of the basic problems of the region. At present, according to records of TUIK Nevsehir region administration record the rate of unemployment in the region is 6.5 %. This is 12.2 in Europe. Second big problem for youth is early school leaving. However average  schooling rate in middle and high school 70,06 % in country it is 64,49 in our region in Turkish Ministry of National Education records. The young population of the region is affected negatively by such factors as limited opportunities of both formal and vocational education and training, high rates of unemployment and absence or insufficient means of social, cultural and leisure time activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffecting one in seven young people, early school leaving is one of the greatest educational challenges in Europe, and reducing its levels is a shared objective of EU countries. The prevention of early school leaving (ESL) should be built on a comprehensive approach of the young people, taking into account the family environment, the neighborhood, and his/her life in and out of school. The role of parents his/hers a key element to reduce the rate of ESL. Currently it is a target of European policies to prevent young people from leaving education and training with only a lower secondary education degree or less. Objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy include reducing the rates of early school leaving below 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Europe For Youth (UEFY) is a strategic partnership project for youth which aims to develop a social learning tool for youth workers-institutions to provide mentoring programs for middle and  high school youth in Europe to prevent early school leaving and regain the ones who are out of system. The project will form partnerships with local school districts, education counseling authorities, probation services and directorates of youth politics in partner countries. Our project's goal is to foster a commitment to young people that will promote pro-social friendships, strong interpersonal skills and reassert a sense of hope in future. Only through personal relationships can a sense of individual responsibility be reestablished that will give youth the commitment to follow through on path to adulthood with a sense of pride accomplishment. Through repeated failures in the classroom and the development of destructive habits, at-risk young people have lost faith in possibilities that await them if they are successful putting their lives together. To accomplish this goal, young people should be in a caring, inclusive learning environment that promotes their best effort and reinforces personal respect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Europe For Youth (UEFY) project will develop a social learning tool (one-on-one mentoring system) and test it for seven months on  324 middle and high school youths and the ones who are out of system from different countries of Europe. Because this age group is particularly problematic and it is a perfect time for mentoring to be effective. Project's mentoring programs will pair a youth with a mentor for 7 months.  During that time   the two will participate in weekly planned activities to strengthen the relationship between the two and improve the young person's confidence and hopefulness. Mentors (youth workers) will receive continuous training throughout the activity and will participate in monthly meetings to report the young person's progress. During project partners will create a learning environment that will be an invaluable resource to young people, aspiring mentors and the community at large. At the end of project activities we will publish a social learning methodology book for youth workers and will create and publish a social learning tool software UEFY Software which will be an free and open source for youth workers all around Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically our project contains two main goals; \r\n\r\nA-) Setting a strong local and international network between education system - youth support system - youth NGOs and local youth authorities called United Europe for Youth (UEFY). \r\n\r\nB-) B-1 : Creating, applying, testing and disseminating a one-on-one mentoring system (social learning tool) to regain at risk young people who are close to early school leaving, out of education system already and met with probation system or police.

The model is referred to as Assessement for learning. This way of working has been part of all teaching at Rudbeck the last few years. Now we feel that it is time to move forward to assessement as learning, a model aiming at making students even more metacognitively aware of their learning. We are interested in finding out how to outline a plan to develop teaching in this direction. We have become aware that Maidstone Grammar School for Girls in Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom has already come far in teaching according to assessement as learning and therefore we would like to visit the school to learn from their experience. We are two teachers from Rudbeck, Lena Nor\u00e9e, lead teacher in Swedish and Nina Andersson Kvist, lead teacher in English, who intend to job shadow  teachers at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls during a few school days. We want to learn everything about how they have gone about to educate the rest of the teachers at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls and how they have implemented the way of working at the school. We also want to see how they are working in the classroom with Assessment as Learning.  \r\n\r\nBefore leaving for England, we will have discussions with our principal and our colleagues about the needs of assessement as learning at Rudbeck to become aware of what we need to focus on specifically when at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls. We will also study current research on the subject . We will also speak to students  to find out in what way they feel that they learn more from having to reflect upon their work in a metacognitive way. \r\n\r\nAfter visiting  Maidstone Grammar School for Girls, we will inform our principal and our colleagues everything we have learned about assessement as learning, at meetings and other pedagogical conferences. \r\n\r\nActivity B:\r\nFor over twenty years Rudbeck has developed a partnership with this school in northern Spain. Last year, a group of teachers, also in the context of job shadowing, visited our partner school in Bologna where the teachers followed the lecturing in MFL and explored how target language is used in teaching and text editing.\r\n\r\nWe want to continue studying teaching methods in other European countries and see whether the Common European Framework Reference for Languages (CEFR) is used as assessment tool and the importance of modern languages in the different school systems.\r\n \r\nOur partner school in Spain uses the same technological working tools as used in our school. One of our overall goals is to improve student achievment by using the formative assessment strategies. Also important for this achievment are oral and written textual editing, students feedback and awareness of the learning. How do our colleagues in Spain use the students  own results? How do they use these as resources in the classroom? Is CEFR an important element in their assessment?\r\n\r\nWe also want to see how integrating new technologies in the classroom affects students learning in other cultural environments. \r\nWith this and the previous visits to the other european countries, we would like to create a common method in which our students work as a network inbetween different countries beeing a resource to each other in their learning. We want to find a common model so that students can assess cross-border work and contribute with their own examples that could be used as a model.", "http://www.mggs.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038894_2"], [2015, "School European Professional Development", "Maidstone Grammar School for Girls", 6039.0, 1, 1, "Our school has identified several needs which Erasmus training could greatly help with.  Firstly, some of our language staff need to improve their language competences and would greatly benefit from attending languages courses abroad.  Secondly, our school as a whole needs to improve its international dimension and make links with other EU schools.  Finally, our school has invested a lot of money in a wireless network which is currently under-used and we really need some training and support in how students can more effectively use mobile devices in the classroom to facilitate their learning.  We therefore would like to send 4 members of the MFL department on language training courses in France, Spain and Germany and 4 school-wide staff to observe excellent use of student mobile devices at a school in Sweden.  \r\nThis would have a huge impact on the school:  language staff would feel more confident in their languages and would be able to provide for some of the very able students we have at our school. The ideas and advice we would get from visiting the school in Sweden would enable us to effectively re-write our schemes of work in all subjects and be pioneers in this field for the local community to learn from.  The links we would make would also allow us to boost the international dimension of our school and promote students to be internationally thinking and curious to find out more about other cultures.", "http://www.mggs.org", "Maidstone Grammar School for Girls", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013297_coordinator"]]}}, "8AH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "School European Professional Dev Project", "Oakwood Park Grammar School", 1421.0, 1, 1, "Our management team has identified that we have strong existing international links however these opportunities are not always accessible to all students within the school and our students would benefit from becoming much more internationally aware in the particular context of Europe. \r\n\r\nThe Languages Department would like to increase the confidence and further increase the proficiency in French, German and Spanish of all five experienced staff within the department. In particular, native speakers would like to increase their proficiency in their second or third languages and non-native teachers would like to increase their fluency in their first teaching language and increase their second language skills.  We hope that this will increase flexibility of staff and enable us to increase language provision across the school. Furthermore, we anticipate that there will be more opportunities for collaboration and the sharing of good practice between Languages Department staff; as a larger number of staff will be able to teach a wider range of key stages. We hope that the upgrading of department members' language skills will  mean that staff return with improved language competencies, incredibly enthused and more knowledgeable of their respective target language cultures.  It is hoped that this enthusiasm will be transferred to pupils via improved classroom practice and therefore, create more enthusiastic language learners of the future. \r\n\r\nThe Languages Department is also undertaking a three Associate Department project with the Prince's Teaching Institute with the aim of increasing awareness of target language culture to improve the motivation in MFL learning .

They are long-lasting conditions, which require regular treatment, administration, management and care, posing staggering socio-economic burdens on societies and health systems around the world. In this context, the use of arts for individuals suffering from long-term  conditions can improve their health and mental health outcomes and their quality of life, and ultimately reduce healthcare costs. \r\nWhile a wide range of creative arts initiatives have been employed to improve the health and mental health outcomes of individuals, little attention has been paid to the training of the facilitators delivering these programmes. Staff training is essential in order for these creative arts programmes to render positive health outcomes and follow ethical guidelines. Thus, the innovative nature of this project relies in the development of a formally recognized training framework for the artists, health staff, care staff, educators, and voluntary organisation staff involved in the development and delivery of Arts-based health promotion and wellbeing programmes.\r\nThe main motivation for this project is to fulfil this gap in arts therapy education of professionals working with people with long term conditions, and particularly mental health problems. The objective of this project is to develop a new online e-learning package to enable staff to  learn new skills to be able to offer patients arts-based therapeutic activities. This will be achieved over 3 years by staff visiting each other's organisations and learning from the individual experiences of all the partners in this field, drawing these together and working on producing the online learning package.\r\n \r\nThe project offers a broader perspective to experience and compare health care systems among different countries and learn how arts techniques are used for the integration and effective treatment of clients with long term conditions. The project will place a strong emphasis on the particular problems of the target group of patients with long-term conditions and its connection with the community, addressing the social stigma they often experience. It will encourage learners and the target group to feel at home with all the media channels of personal expression available and show them how to participate in arts activities. The project will ultimately train staff in techniques to help people with diverse health problems understand how to accept, overcome and take advantage of their way of living.\r\n\r\nThe project will lead to an improvement in the quality of education available to professional care staff and, through them, to the range of services offered to patients. Long-term, it is anticipated that the project will lead to a greater number of staff from health care organisations across the EU using the online package to train themselves in the use of arts as therapy.", "http://www.kmpt.nhs.uk", "Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013436_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["RWF", "Maidstone Hospital", "nhs_RWF03"]]}}}}
