Staff in all partner schools are very interested in how personalized learning can fit into the education of children with severe and profound learning difficulties across Europe.   The students in our partner schools do not have equal access to a wide curriculum, due to their SEN.  In all our partner countries inclusion is a very important issue, which can be interpreted very differently from school to school.   We will study and learn from these different European educational systems and pedagogic approaches for the benefit of the SEN children in our schools. Also , our  children which until now had their horizon limited by their disability will have the opportunity to travel, to meet their peers outside their own country, to widen their knowledge on European culture, to gain autonomy and new life skills   etc \r\nThe main project  objectives are for staff to learn and implement innovative approaches to personalized learning from partner schools; to improve student's learning outcomes within their schools, through personalized learning, to be supportive in the work of the special needs schools, to increase understanding and awareness of different education systems in partnership countries, and learn from these various approaches, to develop and explore cultural awareness, to include SEN students of  in collaborative project work e.g. art display, improving the use of ICT within all the partner schools for both staff and pupils. \r\nThe participants in this project will be the staff from all 7 partner schools and 450 SEN children involved in the project. The project will also benefit parents and school Governors (will be invited to attend host schools activities and social events),local schools ,local community (by means of this project, the local community will have the opportunity to be known in the partners\u2019 countries, to participate in different Project events (conferences, workshops, lessons, meetings, etc.)  \r\nThe main activities in the project will be the training/learning activities organized by each school  :  a work shop on multiple sensorial disability approach and  early intervention techniques (in Romania) a workshop on self-dependence training and another in autism   (in Belgium),a training in Intensive Interaction (a communication approach for students with very early development communication skills) and Outdoor Learning (in UK), a work shop on biofeedback usage and therapies in SOSW (in Poland) , another training  on logopedical Management in voice and fluency disorders and the Montessori method(in Bulgaria) , the work-shop ways of working with SEN students (in Spain) , horse and dog therapy for children during students visit to Poland  etc.\r\nThe main results of the projects (in terms of attitude, knowledge and skills) will be that staff will be trained in European innovative teaching methods for SEN students and they will be able to train staff in their home schools in this area and will be able to trial new methods with their own pupils after producing them or learning about their use at training sessions. They will gain attitudes of tolerance, understanding and mutual respect generated by the work in an international group:   the students will gain new life skills which will improve opportunities for future enterprise initiatives, they will improve their cultural awareness and expression. \r\nThe project will also produce intellectual outcomes created jointly (a sensory book, a joint guide on innovative approaches to personalized learning from partner schools) or by each school individually (brochures, power-point presentations, DVD-s etc)\r\nThe project will have also multiplier events one during the Blended Student Mobility of students from partner schools in UK( a SEN Festival - celebrating and exploring a wide range of creative arts in the outdoors) and a conference  in the final visit to Turkey as a form of final evaluation and dissemination of project results. \r\nThe impact of the project will reflect on different levels : pupils will develop their skills and knowledge about arts, music, food, sports, cultures, customs, life styles etc. in different European countries, organization and communication skills with new friendships  , increased self-esteem ; staff will improve their professional knowledge by learning through training of  new approaches of personalised learning ,different experiences and concepts of teaching SEN pupils ,different pedagogical methods of active learning and therapeutic approaches ; the schools  will benefit from  an extended curriculum of new adapted methodologies and a portfolio of best practice - including approaches, methods of active learning, they will tighten the relationship with family and local partners , the wider community will gain tolerance and respect towards SEN children.", "http://www.lakeside.herts.sch.uk", "Lakeside School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013706_coordinator"], [2014, "\u00d5pir\u00e4nne Inglismaa erikoolidesse", "Lakeside School", 6399.0, 2, 4, "K\u00e4o Elementary School offers education, various welfare and care services for 36 students with disabilities (severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disability). K\u00e4o Elementary School has been running for the past three years, therefore getting important information from other schools\u2019 experiences could be necessary. Even though it is possible to find similar schools in Estonia, teachers still need to further their knowledge in other countries where they have longer history in that field. K\u00e4o Elementary School works closely with K\u00e4o Day Care Center \u2013 it enables students to get different therapies (occupational therapy, music therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc.). K\u00e4o Day Care Centre educators help students during their schoolday and in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe main goals for the project are:\r\n- examine the use of intensive interaction and ABA, which are essential part of working with autistic children. According to K\u00e4o Elementary School, these methods are not widespread in Estonia.\r\n- examine different augmentative and alternative communication opportunities that are used in UK special needs schools\r\n- examine different opportunities for sensory rooms\r\n- get knowledges about planning a lessons and schoolday for students with severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disabilities \r\n- get knowledges about how teachers cooperate with other professionals (social workers, occupational therapists, music therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists etc.).\r\n\r\nThere will be three teachers participating in the job shadowing in special education schools in England. All the teachers have their own (home)groups. Additionally, they teach following subjects to all studens: cognition and perception; art and fine motor skills; social relationships and group work. Therefore teachers need to use augmentative and alternative communication and intensive interaction every day. Even though all the partner schools have students with severe with severe cognitive/ developmental disabilities, each school has an individual approach that the teachers from K\u00e4o Elementary School would like to familiarize with. \r\n\r\nDuring the job shadowing, teachers can broaden their knowledge and get practical experience working with similar study methods. Gained knowledge could raise the competency that again would help to create better environment for a personal growth in obtaining secondary education according to ones capabilities. With this current project, K\u00e4o Elementary School is also hoping to find long time partners from abroad with whom the partnership could continue even after the project. \r\n\r\nThe main communication between partners will take place via email (through the contact person of the school). Schools in England offer suitable dates for the job shadowing.

We actively support these international mobilities, not only in Europe but also in developing countries.  The objective is to create more awareness of the growing globalisation and the  impact it has on our lifestyle and the economic development in Europe and beyond. We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  A very actual en critical situation with the number of refugees entering Europe.We aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence abroad for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but we also look for possibilities for developing the talents of our students with a socially challenged background by offering them a life changing experience abroad. More specifically : 1. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial  attitude and  behaviour:Our students of level 4+EQF are more and more aware of the fact that they need to make their own choices in life in order to be economically and financially independent in an early stage of their life. The situation in Europe requires a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals. Our objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region . Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies as start-ups or pop-ups while studying.  As part of that process we will also focus on Job-carving, former jobs defined in a new way and transferred into  new settings. That requires new curricula and new training methods which will be , developed  in collaboration with our international partners.Our partners will be triggered to implement the newly developed methods in their own region in order to inspire young  people starting their own businesses.2. Quality of  workplacements. Our continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of qualilty of our placements abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . 3. Special attention will be paid to placement for our level 2 students, the socially challenged group of youngsters who we offer an experience abroad in order to improve their position in the labour market. 4. ECVET and EQF :   Description of Learning Units and Learning Outcomes by the educational team at Friesland College in collaboration with our international partners remains one of the objectives of this project.  The MOU, Europass and other European instruments for agreements on content, on monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad are still in progress of developing. They are the key for a succesful study period abroad. 5. Focus on professionals in training in view of our Programme of Excellence which had been developed this year. Excellent students require excellent professionals. Extra material will be offered in the programme and therefore professionals will go abroad in order to find new teaching methods The exchanging of teaching methods,  training,  job- shadowing and intercultural sensitivity with foreign colleagues will contribute to a broader view on cultural values. The teachers are in their turn  enabled to pass these values on to their students.
