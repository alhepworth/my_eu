A strong collaboration has started with ROC of Amsterdam and this is now bearing fruit. Two international coordinators were appointed for Lelystad and Almere in 2016, and policy developed from the management platform is expressly implemented systematically. From the deployed implementation to embed an internationalization @ home in 2020 in all educational curricula, the awareness of the relevance of internationalization within management and education teams has been increased. This has a huge impact on the interest in physical mobilities of both students and teachers. After a successful year in which students and teachers have gained foreign experience, the question is even more at this moment. The quality of the students and teachers is visibly improving and this year more students will go to level 3 and 4 to different countries within Europe. The clear structure that has arisen within the two MBO Colleges works very well for both the management and lecturers and students. Students know where they need to be when they want to do an internship abroad. The classrooms and regional companies are also very impressed by the interest in this foreign experience. The activities of the two international coordinators of ROCvF consist of setting out a broad policy on mobility in collaboration with coordinators of the ROC of Amsterdam, vision policy and mission, the implementation of internationalization within the framework of the new qualification structure aimed at sustainable contacts and cooperation with foreign partners or companies. The collaboration creates new sources and opportunities for the ROCvF, such as the cooperation with the Amstelveen branch for Sport and Wellness, where we set up a project with each other to London and Rome / Reggio and students go on a 2-week internship and professionalize teachers. Another example is through the joint platform Rocva / vf and The Dutch Alliance we come into contact with a Vocational School in Finland where teachers and officers from the professional field will go for a research with issues surrounding crossovers in the neighborhood-oriented work on well-being, care and sport. The cooperation that has been established between the Entrepreneurship department and two schools from Austria is an example for other departments, which means that many departments are now crossing the border. This year, 151 students and 22 teachers will cross the border. That is considerably more than in previous years. With this we indicate that the ambition is to grow to 6% mobility for the entire ROC. In terms of quality, as described in the project, we will also make improvements in the preparation, execution, monitoring, contact maintenance, dissemination and evaluation in various areas. Students will gain the experience this year, which they will continue to play next year to the new students. They will stay abroad for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of 20 weeks. There are many new mobilities to create new places that are sustainable in the long term, investing in relationships also costs a lot of energy and attention from the coach. The ROCvF van Flevoland explicitly chooses to invest in this project, through coaching visits and study trips by teachers. For lecturers, research in particular will be central to their own professional development, with the explicit task of looking at how the knowledge can be incorporated in the new curriculum to be developed and to further disseminate this knowledge both within the organization and outside the organization. the professional field, thereby expressly entering into a dialogue with the professional field in order to coordinate policy and implementation of the updated knowledge.\r\nWith regard to the 20 week internships of students. In a longer internship it goes alongside the professional skills, with emphasis to take personal skills such as independence and initiative. Business that takes time to grow. Here, too, attention is paid to the ROC during the preparation by coaching students and activating awareness processes. In more short internships, a lot of attention is paid to increasing direct professional skills in combination with global citizenship, and intercultural skills.", "http://www.westbourne.sutton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038680_7"]]}}}}
