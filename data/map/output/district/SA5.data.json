Nevertheless, there are still many companies in the sector that do not export, mainly due to the small size and the lack of aggregation. Moreover, tha labor productivity rate is lower than the EU27 average.\r\nTherefore, there is the need for interventions to facilitate innovative processes in favor of productivity and competitiveness of agricultural and forestry enterprises, promoting production and market processes that can create greater added value.\r\nThe TastER project stems from a deep knowledge of the Emilia-Romagna territory and its needs, with an integrated approach aimed at the promotion, enhancement and protection of biodiversity, food and wine excellences and regional agri-food companies, with pragmatic references to operational tools that, through the European comparison will allow participants to acquire professional skills that are immediately usable in the labor market.\r\nIn order to fully represent the Emilia-Romagna agro-food supply chain, responding to the specific needs expressed by the various areas of specialization present in the regional territory, TastER intends to expand its area of intervention to all regional secondary schools and vocational training institutions within the agrofood sector, for a total of 23 sending partners, further enriching the Consortium with a high level partnership with FICO (Italian Farming Factory), the largest agri-food park in the world.\r\n\r\nAIMS\r\n- give a concrete answer to the needs that the Emilia-Romagna Region considers fundamental for the development and internationalization of the economy linked to the agro-food industry\r\n- compete with Europe by importing new elements to promote organizational and marketing innovations aimed at conquering new markets and promoting and protecting PDO and PGI products\r\n- respond to the needs of raising the quality of individual Consortium members and mobility, to facilitate the creation of a European labor market that is increasingly accessible and able to guarantee recognition of the skills and qualifications held\r\n- measure, recognize, validate LOs through recognizable and transparent procedures in line with ECVET indications through the adoption of a MoU\r\n-favor the creation of consortiums that strengthen the networks of EU companies, national intermediaries and companies with roles of welcome today, with a view to stimulating reciprocity on the one hand and any commercial relations on the other\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n1) 135 STUDENTS (IV classes) attending courses of \"Agrarian, agri-food and agro-industry\", \"Agriculture, rural development, enhancement of local products and management of forest and mountain resources\" and \"Food and wine and hotel hospitality\".

Mainly the objective of this network meeting is to provide an European scope by offering  high quality transnational fair play street soccer events and educational tools by a clearly identifiable and sustainable concept, born by the work of organisations from across Europe and mainly driven from the the successful executions of the Fair Play soccer tour events in Germany and from the first European Fair Play Soccer Event in 2015. The idea is that the \"Fair Play Soccer Tour\" secures the general objectives of street soccer in the different countries. The methodological approach understands soccer as a tool for social integration, especially between young people. Therefore the focus is on community soccer as non-formal activity.  An opportunity for the creation of new group and collective identities in its organizational and mobilizing dimension for building a new concept of citizenry and public life in a local, regional and international (European) dimension.The street, and public areas in general, are developing as new settings in which to learn how to cope with the tough demands of everyday life. Public space turns here a place for non-formal education. Youth exchanges, seminars and youth initiatives are some of the possibilities for a sustainable cooperation between the network partners.The EU-identity is strengthened within a shared life world, providing EU legitimacy to a broader set of European citizens from different European countries. The amount of socially vulnerable participants and their voluntary engagement in the different countries' projects indicate the degree of success of social inclusion through the street soccer events. This knowledge is shared within the network.Another core objective of this network is the aim to thoroughly connect youth from all European countries and regions in a network, fostering youth mobility and natural friendships.Securing the general objectives of the project, the network partners provide training of volunteers to execute the events as a core activity, which happens through the building of local teams of street volunteers with the practical and some conceptual responsibility for the execution of local events.

Communication, cooperation and the exchange of experiences and expertise between the various organisations at the international level play a major role in this. \r\n\r\nAll of the organisations involved in the \"Peer Aktiv education & cross mentoring\" expert exchange use sport as a platform to facilitate access to the target groups. In this regard, all of the participants exhibit a high level of expertise in the field of educational social work, which allows for a high quality exchange of ideas that can in turn form the basis of a successful practical action plan in the future. Sport plays an important role here as it appeals to all social strata and target groups and has the ability to break down obstacles, such as language barriers.\r\n\r\nAs one of these specialised social organisations and host of the expert exchange, this is the area the Deutsche Soccer Liga [German Soccer League] would like to address. Besides exchanging experiences and networking, the focus of this project should be on forging a plan to deal with out-group hostility. This two-day seminar, involving four partners from Spain, Wales, Romania and Hungary, is the first step in the process. It will involve ten multipliers from each partner organisation, who will then be instrumental in devising, executing and following up on theme-related projects in their respective countries. The discussion will focus on the following key aspects:\r\n\r\n\u2022 swapping personal experiences, approaches and actual cases  \r\n\u2022 reflecting on how hostile attitudes in sport has been reacted to and dealt with in the past and\r\n\u2022 developing viable courses of action and selected training modules that the organisations can use for the purpose of internal training on perspectives. \r\n\r\nThis will be performed using a variety of methods (that have proven highly successful in the past). It's important that all the project participants play an active role is this. Interactive exercises, work in small groups and whole-group discussions will be held to present the topic in an interesting and practically oriented manner. The centrepiece of the project will be a sports module, to be run by the participants, which will provide them with the perfect change in perspective and thus facilitate access to their target groups who find themselves in just this position.\r\nThis is where the German Soccer League's Street Soccer Module comes in, as it makes this change in perspective easier by providing a specially designed set of rules. In this way, it represents realistic exclusion and discrimination scenarios that can be of great help to the multipliers when it comes to designing future projects or becoming involved in existing projects. The practical module has already proved highly successful on many occasions with young people, teachers and parents.\r\n\r\nThe project has the following objectives:\r\n- Further training in the area of fair play and respect\r\n- To accumulate information based on the experiences gathered from similar projects in other countries\r\n- To become familiar with the action plans developed to tackle \"out-group hostility\"\r\n- To achieve an increased level of confidence when it comes to resolving conflicts in the field of youth social work\r\n- To utilise the action plans for one's own training purposes with multipliers\r\n- To serve as input for one's own project work with young people or other peer groups\r\n\r\nThe results of the expert exchange will be documented and made available to participants in the follow-up phase.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefit should not be lost sight of in the process. All partners will continue working together and endeavour to swap their experiences on an ongoing basis. The established network also allows the content and results of the expert exchange to be shared with other partners at the national and international level.\r\nIn so doing, this expert exchange represents a further step towards establishing a transparent and constructive working relationship between specialised social organisations at the European level, and whose results will become incorporated into multiple projects of the participants.", "http://www.streetfootballwales.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE04-KA105-012251_3"], [2014, "Network meeting: Fair Play soccer tour", "STREET FOOTBALL WALES (SFW)", 11853.0, 15, 17, "International youth work is one of the milestones of the BSJ (Sportjugend Brandenburg). Over the years they gained a lot of experience in international youth work using the tool \"street soccer\" and using the EU-funding opportunities. Meanwhile many organisations do use the street soccer for their youth work. Each of them adapted the rules to their local opportunities and needs. The German Soccer League studied the different approaches and finally made up a Fair Play street soccer tour. This tour is very successful implemented in 9 of 16 federal states already. Together with the BSJ they want to share this successful and meanwhile mature tour with international partners and invite them do discuss the different approaches. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims to strengthen the European network based on shared experience with non-formal and informal learning using street soccer activities with a sustainable European mobility as a core feature. In this perspective , the network wishes to deliver experience beneficial to future EU-actions within the field of \"Youth in Action\" and beyond. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMainly the objective of this network meeting is to provide an European scope by offering  high quality transnational street soccer events and educational tools by a clearly identifiable and sustainable concept, born by the work of organisations from across Europe and mainly driven from the the successful executions of the Fair Play soccer tour events in Germany. The idea is that the \"Fair Play Soccer Tour\" secures the general objectives of street soccer in the different countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodological approach understands soccer as a tool for social integration, especially between young people. Therefore the focus is on Community soccer as non-formal activity.  An opportunity for the creation of new group and collective identities in its organizational and mobilizing dimension for building a new concept of citizenry and public life in a local, regional and international (European) dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street, and public areas in general, are developing as new settings in which to learn how to cope with the tough demands of everyday life. Public space turns here a place for non-formal education. Youth exchanges, seminars and youth initiatives are some of the possibilities for a sustainable cooperation between the network partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU-identity is strengthened within a shared life world, providing EU legitimacy to a broader set of European citizens from different European countries. The amount of socially vulnerable participants and their voluntary engagement in the different countries' projects indicate the degree of success of social inclusion through the street soccer events. This knowledge is shared within the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother core objective of this network is the aim to thoroughly connect youth from all European countries and regions in a network, fostering youth mobility and natural friendships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecuring the general objectives of the project, the network partners provide training of volunteers to execute the events as a core activity, which happens through the building of local teams of street volunteers with the practical and some conceptual responsibility for the execution of local events.

We aim to ensure an innovative project where each partner country \u2013 Wales, Poland, Denmark and Italy - contributes valuable learning experiences that our pupils will enjoy and aspire from using as techniques to enhance their learning. Through working collaboratively together as schools teachers, schools, local schools and the wider community will benefit from  sharing good practice and as practitioners, learning new techniques and strategies from each other to ensure more effective learning experiences for our pupils which will motivate our learners to learn and succeed at work in the 21st century.  Working together we will allow us to strengthen the delivery of education on an European level.The aim of the project is to combine collaboration of expertise from around Europe with the use of ICT to develop our pupils into Global Citizens who are open-minded, critical thinkers who are not afraid of the challenges which they face in the 21st century, instead they face them with confidence. We aim to develop an open and innovative delivery of education in our schools for pupils between the ages of 3 \u2013 11 year, which is embedded in the digital era. Our priority will be sharing and developing a program that addresses under-achievement in the basic skills of mathematics and literacy through more effective, innovative teaching methods which we will develop together. TThere are a variety of activities planned for the three years, but the main activities will ensure the following outcomes.Year 1 - Problem solving - By the end of the first year we will  develop our pupils as independent mathematicians with strong problem-solving skills as we know how important problem-solving skills are for 21st century life and work. An end product will be a book on problem solving techniques to use, examples of problem solving questions and posters to help pupils solve problems independently. Year 2 - Reading - During year 2 we will tackle developing basic skills in reading. Reading is a basic skill that is essential for our pupils to learn to live and work effectively in the 21st century. They need to be independent readers who identify: why they are reading; what they want to get out of the material, and how thoroughly they need to understand it. The end product will be a collection of the pupils favourite short stories from each country. Year 3 \u2013 Oracy \u2013 develping critical and open thinkers - We will use books to discuss issues and develop their roles as active and thoughtful global citizens. This will ensure that pupils develop to be critical thinkers through being taught how to create their own philosophical questions which they then explore together to open their minds so they can live interdependently in the 21st century and face any obstacles or challenges thrown at them in life by having an open mind and ability to discuss with appropriate vocabulary.  This will allow pupils an opportunity to create their own philosophical story to promote thinking and discussion based on The Unicef Children's Right's Charter. The final product will include a published ibook of stories.The project will have a great impact not only on professional development our own schools, but also on local schools in the surrounding area and local authorities  as we will share the practices with them. It will raise the quality of teaching and learning and impact on the future of our pupils by raising standards of attainment in basic skills as well as developing them as ethical and informed young Global Citizens. The long term benefits will be far reaching! The opportunities that our pupils will have faced will be invaluable to supporting them to become global citizens who realise their roles and responsibilities.

Throughout this time, they have demonstrated their capacity and willingness,  achieving  such good results that they have allowed us to do without intermediary agencies.\r\n\r\nWe maintain the 4 mobilities for teachers in a vocational training centre in France, in collaboration with the Red Cross. The participants will be teachers of vocational training, interested and involved in the European dimension of education.\r\n\r\nWe intend to add an incoming mobility, inviting an entrepreneur from one of the partner companies (Air Assistance Ambulance)  to come to our school  to inform and train the students of the Emergency Health Care programme  about issues related to their professional profile in France. This will undoubtedly enrich the training of our students, allowing the participation of all of them, motivating them in the project and of course, strengthening   our partnership with this company.\r\n\r\nAs a novelty we are going to introduce a series of diffusion activities in collaboration with \u201cErasmus Student Network Cartagena , under its project \"Erasmus in School\" in order not only to continue making our project known both within our school and the city of Cartagena, but also to motivate the students in previous courses since they can be future candidates to participate in our  projects.
