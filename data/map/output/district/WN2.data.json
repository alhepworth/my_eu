Its layered structure allows for separate but also synergistic function regarding high thermal and acoustic insulation, excellent mechanical properties, up to standards flame retardancy and photocatalytic activity. Employing nanofillers such as CNTs, TiO2 and perlite nanoparticles and cellular nanofibers, will lead to reduction of facade panel weight and thickness by at least 40%. Furthermore, individual components have a definite environmental orientation, taking advantage of recycled materials and biomass foams, low energy and low toxicity processes. Finally, project viability and sustainability will be ensured by performing a Life Cycle Analysis in order to optimize individual processes. Hygrothermal behaviour and thermodynamics will also be simulated and modelled to ensure the high performance of the panel.\nThe project\u2019s advancements will be\n1. Customization possibilities: Apart from panel thickness which can be easily tuned, integrated encapsulated nano-PCMs will be tailored along the customer needs regarding temperature of phase change.\n2. Easy and fast to install: It is calculated that 10m2 can be installed in less than 3 hours by 2 workers\n3. High acoustic and thermal insulation: The three internal layers offer varying degrees of insulation, with an ultra-light aerogel middle layer boasting thermal coefficients lower than 0.012 W/mK, thus allowing insulating layers 3 to 4 times thinner than conventional ones.\n4. Photocatalytic activity offering self cleaning and antimicrobial behaviour, virtue of the surface coating. In addition, the surface coating will also contribute to flame retardancy due to nanofillers.\n5. Reduction in weight and volume by 40%, as a result of applying polymeric and light-weight materials reinforced by nanofillers, therefore improving the panel mechanical properties", 274550.0, 3986644.0, 7, 10, "MF-RETROFIT", null, "http://www.tremco-illbruck.co.uk", null, "fp7_108536_952013679"], [1375315200000, 1485820800000, "Smart elements for sustainable building envelopes", "Tremco Illbruck Coatings Limited", "There is a vastly growing demand for increased energy efficiency, safety and improved health of the buildings we live and work in. These demands need to be addressed by a mostly SME oriented building industry, which traditionally responds sluggish to technological advancement. This is partially due to restrictive building codes, which all too often delay new developments but also because the cost and time pressure on the building sector gives SMEs not much room for technological development and the implementation of innovation. The SESBE consortium, consisting of three SMEs, four industrial and five research partners, addresses this and will provide new solutions for lightweight, energy efficient and safe fa\u00e7ade elements. For the first time nanomaterials and nanotechnology are suggested for this type of application. It will be used as a tool to custom design functional and performance properties of fa\u00e7ade sandwich elements for new constructions and half elements for refurbishment of existing buildings as well as a new type of sealing tape and intumescent coating for fire protection. It is highly expected, the new solutions will have a significant impact on the building sector, not only commercially and societal but also giving impulses to SMEs to invest more in innovation and to partner-up with competent research partners whenever possible. This approach could be a role model for the partnership of research, industry and SMEs in achieving the mutual goal of making housing sustainable, energy efficient, affordable, safe and healthy.", 69829.0, 3917858.0, 5, 12, "SESBE", null, "http://www.tremco-illbruck.co.uk", null, "fp7_109188_952013679"]]}}}}
