In Britain it is restricted to sites in the west of the country, many of which have been subject to management - including forestry practices - which have degraded their nature conservation interest. Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.\n\nThe project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.\n\nAt each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken. Another important activity would be controlling grazing - particularly by sheep, deer and feral goats through a mixture of stock fencing - over 60 km - and deer culling. The effectiveness of the various measures was to be monitored and assessed and the results disseminated on a web-site.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=251", null, "life_32"]]}}}}
