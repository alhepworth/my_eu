Because of the high water content of this material, energy can only effectively be gained through biochemical conversion. The approach best suited to this is anaerobic digestion where yields of 400-450 m3 methane per kg ODM can be achieved. The research explores the ways in which this energy potential can be realised through effective collection, pre-processing and optimisation of the fuel conversion technology, and considers how integration of these aspects with improving conversion efficiencies can maximise the net energy gains. It expands our rapidly-developing fundamental knowledge of syntrophic anaerobic microbial interactions, and applies this to the manipulation of reactor conditions in order to achieve stable operating conditions at high loading rates and volumetric efficiencies. It considers methods of upgrading the gaseous fuel product to extend the range of end user applications and the scales at which this technology can be exploited. It takes into account issues of biosecurity when using this material, and quantifies the environmental benefits associated with nutrient recycling which contribute significantly to indirect energy gains. The research combines techniques of waste audit, feasibility study, laboratory scientific investigation, technical-scale trials, plant monitoring, process modelling, life cycle assessment and energy footprinting in order to deliver recommendations for the valorisation with maximum benefit of this energy source as a second-generation biofuel.", 177129.0, 3942798.0, 5, 13, "VALORGAS", null, "http://www.greenfinch.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146204.jpg", "fp7_94057_990367964"]]}}, "2YP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1443657600000, 1569801600000, "MASS Spectrometry TRaining network for Protein Lipid adduct ANalysis", "Mologic Ltd", "MASSTRPLAN will train the next generation of interdisciplinary research leaders in advanced molecular analytical techniques to detect oxidized phospholipids & proteins in biological & clinical samples, evaluate their biochemical roles in inflammation, and translate these findings to develop new diagnostic tools. \nChronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) & cancer are major causes of mortality and cost the EU economy dearly in healthcare and lost working time; CVD alone is estimated to be responsible for 47% of deaths and to cost the EU \u20ac196 billion a year.

All over Europe occupational therapy shows itself to be a profession in an ongoing dynamic change. In Germany there is a reinforcement of the dualism of vocational college and university studies.

By this they should realize as well as recognize their own competences and value as well as extend them.
