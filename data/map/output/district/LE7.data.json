At the same time, citizens are becoming more vocal in monitoring and influencing policy decisions. Future scenarios are likely to show greater complexity and citizens' involvement. Current ICT tools for collaborative governance and policy modelling start to show great opportunities for decision-making in a complex world, but they still remain an exception rather than the rule, and research is fragmented between academic fields, application areas, and approaches to innovation (theory vs. practice led).CROSSROAD will deliver a research roadmap on ICT for governance and policy modelling, in order to orient towards a common goal the different communities of research actors, domains and sectors. It will create a shared vision and an operational tool to support research policy and research implementation in this field. The roadmap will be based on a cross-analysis of present research directions and future scenarios of collaborative governance, including possibilities for disruptive scenarios of extreme collaboration. It will be presented as a self-standing report and as an online, dynamic knowledge base.The CROSSROADS partners, with unparalleled experience in e-government and e-governance, web 2.0 and roadmapping, will involve a wide pool of expertise through an open, iterative, multi-method approach including in depth desk research, restricted workshops and large scale web consultations, in order to reach out to specialist research activities beyond the traditional e-government stakeholders and beyond Europe.", 144897.0, 448598.0, 5, 5, "CROSSROAD", null, null, null, "fp7_93842_996699542"], [1317427200000, 1372550400000, "Bridging Communities for Next Generation Policy-Making", "Tech4i2 Limited", "In an increasingly interdependent, unstable and complex world, as the financial crisis has shown, policy-makers lack the tools to anticipate emerging problems and the impact of possible solutions.

Emerging ICT tools for governance and policy modelling show great opportunities for decision-making in a complex world, through the dramatic and combined growth of data availability, analysis and simulation tools, participative and behavioural change technologies.

Thus, more citizen-centric governance arises more pressing than ever.The proposed project aims at bringing together two well established domains, the mashup architectural approach of web 2.0 for creating web applications (gadgets) and the methodology of system dynamics in analyzing complex system behavior. The objective is to design, develop and deploy a prototype toolset that will allow policy makers to graphically create web applications that will be deployed in the environment of underlying knowledge in Web 2.0 media. For this reason, the project introduces the concept of Policy Gadget (Padget) \u2013 similarly to the approach of gadget applications in web 2.0 \u2013 to represent a micro web application that combines a policy message with underlying group knowledge in social media (in the form of content and user activities) and interacts with end users in popular locations (such as social networks, blogs, forums, news sites, etc) in order to get and convey their input to policy makers.Through the proposed platform any policy can become a reusable and communicable web application to be used in relation to underlying content and social activities over the web. Policy makers will be able to set up such applications on their own and use them to communicate their policies to the public. People can use these applications as they use everyday services and policy makers can track the results of this interaction back to their policy making process to assist them in reaching solid decisions that represent society's input and aspirations.", 67703.0, 2014896.0, 6, 12, "PADGETS", null, null, null, "fp7_93840_996699542"], [1317427200000, 1356912000000, "GoldenWorkers", "Tech4i2 Limited", "Longer life expectancies and low birth rates together impacts on the demographics of the workforce.

In these cascades, new artifacts are inextricably linked with transformations in social organization and the generation of new 'needs' for individual and society.  Besides desired effects, these cascades produce disruptive changes in the environment and in society itself, ultimately leading to sustainability crises. The usual, but inadequate, response to these is more innovation, unleashing new cascades, and new crises.  The core challenge in improving our responses is to link current, reductionist, models of past causalities with novel approaches to increase the number of dimensions in which phenomena are perceived, so that we may get better at anticipating the unanticipated consequences of innovation cascades. INSITE will pave the way for novel ICT approaches that will do so, since only through ICT can complex dynamics be 'grasped' in sufficient detail to allow us to do the reverse of customary science: anticipate and complexify, rather than reduce and simplify.To further INSITE's main objective to build a community dedicated to meeting the challenge described above, we will recruit people from a variety of fields to join us in working groups to (1) prepare case studies that illuminate the dynamics of innovation cascades involving ICT, from printing to the internet, (2) develop a roadmap indicating the kinds and uses of models to understand and guide these dynamics in the direction of sustainability, (3) devise experiments to elucidate innovation dynamics, in the context of multiplayer online computer games, (4) envision practices and technologies to enable networks of innovators to engage in experiments in 'participatory policy', and (5) explore the implications in theory and practice of reconceptualizing technology to include its social dimensions, leading to a notion of 'generalized ICT' that includes such diverse things as cities, urban systems and museums.", 9319.0, 905104.0, 9, 14, "INSITE", null, null, null, "fp7_98118_996699542"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "TECH4I2 LTD*", 216231.0, "Definition and implementation of the Union\u2019s policy in the field of electronic communications (09.02.01)", "fts_2017_38158"]]}}}}
