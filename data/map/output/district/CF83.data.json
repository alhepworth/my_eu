Nant Y Parc Primary school which is located in a 'Communities First' area in which the majority of learners hail from disadvantaged back grounds and unfortunately have an ingrained insular outlook on their place in the European community. The project will help / support communities, parents, teachers, and pupils broaden their horizons - about European citizenship as well as cultural and geographic issues in particular. Children and the wider community will be exposed to cultures, languages and traditions of participating European partners. It will help teachers deliver key curricular skills across ICT, Literacy and MFL in an innovative and stimulating way. Pupils will be better equipped for the modern demands of the labour market with enhanced confidence with ICT, literacy and language skills. \r\n\r\nThree teachers from our school, led by our Head teacher will participate in key European in-service training opportunities to enhance the pedagogy, resources and overall attainment of learners across the whole school. Participants will visit Norway to develop approaches of using iTechnology to raise levels in Literacy and Languages. This visit will also provide an insight into how future technology budgets should be best spent and to bring the latest relevant technology to our classrooms. Levels in foreign language and Welsh will be developed through the introduction of 'Triple Literacy' learnt from our Spanish partners in both Murcia and the Basque region. Teachers will be exposed to best practise in Triple literacy and immersed in an intensive Spanish course to promote the launch of Triple literacy at Nant Y Parc. Attendance and Literacy levels will also be targeted by a mobility to Iceland where participants will be exposed to best practise from Outdoor learning experts. \r\n\r\nOn each mobility pupils will join their class teachers digitally through video conferencing, blogs and e-mail. Learners and the wider community will share these European mobilities experiencing the a huge variety of cultures, language and tradition. Community groups will be welcomed into the school with after school language clubs offering basic Spanish language to parents and pupils. Learners will gain key entrepreneurial skills through home work research projects in collaboration with their European class counterparts. Pupils will manage their learning through child led tasks which investigate each of the European partner's school, culture and geography. \r\n\r\nBaseline data will be collected to inform the impact of this project; levels will be collected in Literacy and Welsh and compared as will attendance figures of pupils at the end of the project. Results will be disseminated across the whole school, wider community, local Universities and local authority through social media, INSET's, cluster meetings and designated pages of our school website. We have outlined a 2 year duration for this project however as our project title suggests we aim to set the foundations for the future with this project.
