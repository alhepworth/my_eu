However, the silver segment remains underserved despite being the biggest opportunity in the market. Products and services are not designed to meet older people\u2019s needs and despite being worth half of the market, only 10% of marketing spend is aimed at this group. \r\n\r\nThus the aim of our Age Friendly Communities project is clear; to support individuals working in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to develop entrepreneurial, innovation and digital skills through innovative WBL that support their professional development but also innovate the products and services demanded by older people. As result, older people will benefit from improved and more appropriate products and services, and regions will benefit from increased economic activity and development.\r\n\r\nThe Objectives for the Age Friendly Communities project are as follows:\r\n1, Develop and implement a Work Based Learning Toolkit for each Region\r\n2, Develop a  set of Open Education Resources Digital Skills Training on Digital Technology Skills for SMEs, and train 60 SMEs in its usage.\r\n3, Develop am Innovating New Products for Seniors: 2-day Bootcamp, and test it with 60 SMEs. \r\n4, Create an Open Online Collaborative Knowledge Exchange Platform and engage 250 users in its implementation.\r\n\r\nImpact \r\nAs stated previously, this project is transformative in three main ways, directly tackling key challenges associated with growing the Silver Economy and deficits within the VET industry. First, it updates the skills of businesses\u2019 staff; ensuring companies have capacity to adapt to changing consumer demand and behaviour. Second, it improves competitiveness through innovative work-based and lifelong learning programmes.  Third, it promotes the commercialisation of innovative products and services to meet growing demand. \r\n\r\nOur Age Friendly Communities project delivers tangible impacts that directly tackle the key issues. It seeks to create deep and sustainable impact at different geographical levels, having a transformative impact on VET, (regional) economic development and innovation policy and practice. Age Friendly Communities will influence the key organizations and institutions that shape the VET ecosystem, finding innovative ways of drawing them together through establishing enduring local learning and employer networks and through Strategic Road Maps for Regional WBL and promoting wider impacts across the EU and beyond.  \r\n\r\nOn a local and regional level, the project will have a very tangible and immediate impact on the acquisition of new skills of SME staff through their participation in WBL which our partners will develop, including: open education WBL modules, Innovation Boot Camps, and collaborative platforms.  Increased numbers of participants will enhance their potential through the acquisition of new knowledge, digital skills and understanding of key trends within the Silver Economy, unleashing their creative potential to innovate. This will lead to improved productivity and increased commercialisation by SMEs.", "http://www.lisburncastlereagh.gov.uk", "LISBURN AND CASTLEREAGH CITY COUNCIL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036729_coordinator"], [2016, "Mainstreaming Student Entrepreneurship", "LISBURN AND CASTLEREAGH CITY COUNCIL", 179153.0, 6, 7, "Europe needs more entrepreneurial citizens: creative, confident individuals who innovate to solve problems and convert ideas into value across enterprises, organizations and the public sector.  Recent years have seen substantial growth in the number of VET institutions offering entrepreneurship education, but engagement levels are very low and programmes still focus on the  \u201chow to run business\u201d aspects of entrepreneurship whereas entrepreneurship is now understood as a mind-set, a set of transversal competences of value to ALL individuals. The problem is that most of today\u2019s cohort of teachers and trainers are unequipped to teach entrepreneurialism as a transversal skill across all subjects. In addition, the entrepreneurship support system is increasingly complex and those VET teachers/trainers whose students have promising start up ideas are often unsure how to cultivate this, or refer students for further support outside their own institution.  The failure to widen and improve the scope of entrepreneurship education for young people in VET has immediate consequences, of import to all countries but especially those emerging from economic crisis, such as Spain and Ireland:  it undermines the ambitions and employability of students, perpetuates youth unemployment, and limits opportunities for value creation for local and regional economic development.  For these reasons, MASTER has been designed with a clear objective: increase the proportion of VET students acquiring an entrepreneurial mind-set and engaging in early stage entrepreneurial activity.  We will do this by raising awareness and improving the pedagogic capacities of VET policy makers and educators, and facilitating improved collaboration with other actors in the entrepreneurship ecosystem.  In order to achieve this we will carry out the following project methodology. will be involved in the each activity: - Develop a needs and opportunities analysis stating the case for an integrated, cross sector approach to student entrepreneurship education in the VET sectors. - Create 5 Regional Alliances to bring together 60+ stakeholders from VET, private and public sector to state the need and opportunities for student entrepreneurship in their particular region, map existing hard/soft entrepreneurship supports, learn from emerging best practice and devise individual and collective Regional Action Plans.- Develop and pilot test a multi-channel communication and capacity building campaign with 1500 VET teaching staff to provide them with the knowledge and skills needed to integrate aspects of entrepreneurship education into all subjects and disciplines. - Jointly develop a Student Entrepreneurship Support Toolkit and pilot at least 10 innovative entrepreneurship support activities across 4 HEIs. (Eg.  Business plan competitions, one stop shop, mentoring, apprenticeship style entrepreneur training etc.) - Widely disseminate project outputs and findings to approximately 10,000 individuals via a multilingual project website and comprehensive dissemination strategy.The unique structure of the MASTER project provides a reliable means of ensuring ongoing, systemic improvements to increasing the proportion of VET students acquiring an entrepreneurial mind-set and engaging in early stage entrepreneurial activity, region by region. Thanks to improved entrepreneurship education in their colleges and institutions, more students will  acquire entrepreneurial mindsets, making them more employable and  students with start ups will be better linked to the wider entrepreneurship support system to gain focussed support to help push their startups forward upon completion of their course. VET institutions will gain new leadership positions in the entrepreneurship ecosystem and collaborative relationships with the business and VET entrepreneurship sectors thanks to the Regional Alliances. Overall, their teaching programmes will be strengthened, performance enhanced and they will enjoy increased reputation to recruit future students .  On a local and regional level, the project will make a significant long-term impact to strengthening the local economy as student start-ups often stay connected to the VET College / region when their business started there. In addition cohorts of more entrepreneurial students will enter jobs in the region and drive intrapreneurship and innovation in the organisations they work forThe project has been designed to respond to a genuine need experienced by partner organizations and their counterparts in the vocational education, entrepreneurship support and economic development, all of whom have a vested interest in using the outputs and sustaining the impacts in the long term.", "http://www.lisburncastlereagh.gov.uk", "LISBURN AND CASTLEREAGH CITY COUNCIL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024563_coordinator"]]}, "nweurope": {"data": [["Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council", "SuNSE - Support network for social entrepreneurs", "SuNSE is an ambitious project to support social enterprises and to help identify and then nurture, potential future social entrepreneurs - both in urban and remote sub-Regions.

This exchange is based on many years experience of undertaking exchanges to different parts of the world but the particular focus of this exchange is to allow young people from disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland and Poland to work together in the different jurisdictions to help low income people build housing for themselves. We have selected Poland not only because we have a strong relationship with Habitat Poland but because we want to expose young people in Northern Ireland to the culture of Poland and help counter some of the negative views held by some in Northern Ireland in relation to Poles and east Europeans generally. This negativity has recently been most manifest in attacks on Polish people in disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland where the participants for this programme will come from. \r\nThe participants in both countries will generally have less formal education qualifications and less employment opportunities when they leave school and this project is designed to help boost their confidence and skills. The key activity in this project will be the respective teams helping to build a home for low income families which as well as helping provide housing will give them a keen awareness of the needs of people without homes or in inadequate homes. Our experience is that the team building involved in this process can be life changing for young people.\r\nWe want to use this project not only to increase the skills and leadership potential of individuals but as a demonstration project to show what can happen when young people get together to do something  positive in their communities.
