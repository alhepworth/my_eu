Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such \u2018narrative knowing\u2019 is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.\nWhat do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the \u2018how possibly\u2019 narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists\u2019 narratives have played in modern science.

The beliefs that different groups of people have about members of other groups should be central to any theory or empirical investigation of this topic.

A main winner from monetary policy expansions in most countries is the government, which sees a reduction in the value of its debt and typically, better borrowing terms. We will investigate how public spending, revenues, and debt management react to changes in monetary policy; the extent to which the response of activity is driven by the public sector; the interactions between public and private sector responses; and the (intra- and inter-generational) distributional effects from monetary policy interventions.

More recently research in economic geography following Krugman (1991) has highlighted the importance of trade costs in determining the spatial inequality in economic activity. The central idea behind this research area is that economic activity may endogenously concentrate in some regions leaving other regions to be peripheral. Such concentration of economic activity occurs because of the interaction between increasing returns to scale at the firm level and transport costs. While there has been a substantial amount of theoretical research on the implications of economic geography models empirical work is still in its early stages.\n\nIn this project we will build on recent work of Redding and Sturm (2008) and Redding, Sturm and Wolf (2009) and exploit natural experiments to test the empirical predictions of the recent advances in the economic geography literature.

First, social exclusion can explain barriers to accessing health care due to disrespectful, discriminatory or culturally inappropriate practices of medical professionals and their organisations, within the context of poor accessibility and quality of care. As a consequence, removing financial barriers does not necessarily guarantee equitable access to care. Second, social exclusion can explain barriers to accessing the health financing mechanism itself.

Among the voices arguing most strongly for a change in the way that young macroeconomists are trained are those coming from employers in the private and public sector. Strikingly, many employers are also arguing that a knowledge of economic history might be particularly useful.  A knowledge of economic and financial history is crucial in thinking about macroeconomic problems and the financial sector in several ways. It forces students to recognize that major discontinuities in economic performance and economic policy regimes have occurred many times in the past, and may therefore occur again in the future. Additionally, economic history teaches students the importance of context.

This process is commonly termed 'globalisation'. As a result of an increasing lack of balance with regard to the prospects of independent action, social, political and cultural strategies altered dramatically. These strategies have given rise to a discussion concerning the most suitable paradigms with which to analyse global processes. The M.A. in Global Studies is not restricted to a single method of interpretation but is designed to equip highly-qualified students with the ability to contribute to this forward-looking debate, an essential qualification for enhancing one's prospects in the contemporary labour market. The programme, despite its various approaches their necessary combinations, takes global connections as a starting point for the understanding of globalisation. It views globalisation as follows: 1. Globalisation is not only a phenomenon of past centuries but requires a greater historical perspective. 2. It cannot be merely reduced to economic processes and social consequences but must also investigate the approval and disapproval of political and cultural developments. 3. It cannot only be analysed as a global process of homogenisation but also from the perspective of Regional and Area Studies. 4.  It is also subject to interpretation, perspective and intellectual environment. Depending on the individual mobility track it is possible to specialise in particular areas of globalisation research e.g. historical as well as comparative analysis of global entanglements, methods of global history, economic and social history of globalisation, global political economy, global governance, analysis of transformation processes in Central and Eastern Europe and development studies.An international experienceA number of EU-funded scholarships are offered to the best qualified candidates.Career prospectsUpon successful completion of this researched based Master\u2019s course, students qualify for PhD studies and for a variety of job opportunities in practice e.g. in cross- national and supranational agencies, non-governmental organizations, as intercultural mediator or in the field of development cooperation, economy and management. Diploma\tSuccessful students of the European Master 'Global Studies' will receive a Master of Arts in Global Studies. Depending on their mobility track a double degree (in case it contains Roskilde and/or London School of Economics) or joint degree (in all other cases) will be issued.

Cooperation between the players is established by the fact that each character will have a restricted set of skills in the setting whereas for success to be accomplished several skills will be required. In the end of each day during the event, every player will participate in reflection meetings supervised and guided by the coordinators in order to discuss their views on the challenges and the European shared values they corresponded to.\r\nApart from the understanding of the European Union shared values, one of the project's main goals is the development of a strong European identity among the participants and the creation of a core group that will act in the youth sector at a local, national and international level. This core group will try to evolve into an active, multinational and multicultural European community that is interested in passing European Union shared values and ideas to new people in the rest of Europe. The core group creation goal will be achieved during the event as the coordinators will use team-building techniques to make sure that all participants are collaborating in a friendly, pleasant environment. Besides these, several social, communication and English language skills will be practiced and knowledge of several mythologies (primarily the Greek one) will be acquired by participants. Last but not least, the project aims to further develop the teaching method that will be used during the event.\r\nThe project will be completed in 3 phases: in the first, preparatory phase, all practical amendments will be taken care of (flights reservations, accommodation etc), research on several ethnic mythologies will be undergone and in general all necessary action will be taken to ensure the event runs smoothly, without surprises and with the expected learning outcomes. Phase 2 is the actual youth exchange in Athens, while in phase 3 coordinators will contact participants to write down their impressions and assist them to take initiative at a local level to expand the community and multiply the benefits of the event.\r\nParticipants will be chosen through informal youth groups that act in the youth and role-playing games sectors.

To this goal, an OPS node suitable for intra- data centre connectivity services will be developed and prototyped during the project, together with an enhanced Top of the Rack (TOR) switch seamlessly connecting servers in each rack to the hybrid OCS/OPS inter-cluster network. As an additional achievement of LIGHTNESS, the OCS/OPS inter-cluster network will be empowered with a control plane entity able to dynamically provision both OCS and OPS transport services in response of either the data centre management plane or the enhanced ToR switch. Such a control plane will also be developed and prototyped for integration in the final LIGHTNESS demo throughout the project.The LIGHTNESS project, joining partners with broad expertise in all data centre, optical data plane and optical control plane worlds, will bring innovation to the realization of data centre networking solutions meeting the real needs in such environments.", null, 2677436.0, 4, 7, "LIGHTNESS", null, null, null, "fp7_105841_954762077"]]}}, "3LH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1257033600000, 1367280000000, "The effects of antibiotic administration on the emergence and persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans and on the composition of the indigenous microbiotas at various body sites", "Helperby Therapeutics Ltd", "The objective of the HEALTH-2009-2.3.1-2 call is to study the impact of different antibiotics on the prevalence of resistant bacteria in the human host. In ANTIRESDEV we will achieve this objective using the approaches suggested in the call as follows. We will use culture-based and culture-independent approaches to investigate the impact of four different types of antibiotics (with different modes of action, antimicrobial spectra and pharmacokinetic properties) on the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms and their persistence at several body sites. Disruption of the indigenous microbiota is recognized as an important factor in the persistence and transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms, therefore we will also study the ecological impact of the antibiotics on the indigenous microbiotas of several body sites using culture-dependent and -independent techniques. We will then identify, using state-of-the-art microarrays, the genes responsible for resistance in the antibiotic-resistant organisms isolated. The genetic elements involved in resistance transfer by a number of these organisms will also be determined as knowledge of these elements is essential to fully understand the mechanisms underlying resistance transmission. By using state-of-the-art 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the full complement of resistance genes (the \u201cresistome\u201d) present in cultivable and not-yet-cultivated members of the oral and faecal microbiotas and the effect on these resistomes of antibiotic administration. Another important aspect of the dynamics and transmission of resistance is the fitness cost associated with resistance acquisition by an organism and we will investigate this in a variety of clinically-important organisms. We will ensure that the results of this study are made available to appropriate governmental and healthcare agencies so that they can be used to help in the formulation of measures designed to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance.", 408226.0, 6019399.0, 6, 11, "ANTIRESDEV", null, "http://www.helperby.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725438.jpg", "fp7_92468_997848507"], [1391212800000, 1580428800000, "European Gram Negative Antibacterial Engine", "Helperby Therapeutics Ltd", "The intensive use and misuse of antibiotics has resulted in some level of antibiotic resistance in essentially all human bacterial pathogens.  There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery.

Each Testbed has been selected because it highlights unique challenges.SCAPE will develop scalable services for planning and execution of institutional preservation strategies on an open source platform that orchestrates semi-automated workflows for large-scale, heterogeneous collections of complex digital objects. These services will be able to:* Identify requirements for preserving all or parts of a repository through characterisation and trend analysis;* Define responses to those needs using formal descriptions of preservation policies and preservation plans;* Allow a high degree of automation, virtualization of tools, and scalable processing;* Monitor the quality of preservation processes.The SCAPE consortium brings together experts from memory institutions, data centres, research labs, universities, and industrial firms in order to research and develop scalable preservation systems that can be practically deployed within the project lifetime.Through a project extension in the final year, SCAPE will broaden its scope with respect to the utilized deployment models and infrastructures available to the project. New activities include the development of new scientific use-cases, advanced preservation services, and installations of the SCAPE environment in high performance computing (HPC) data centers. These use cases will further demonstrate the generic nature of the SCAPE approach and its applicability in the new Data Center Testbed.SCAPE is dedicated toward producing open source software solutions available to the entire digital preservation community.
