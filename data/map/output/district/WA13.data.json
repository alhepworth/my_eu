This has been a long term project that has been running for almost ten years and we have successfully obtained funding from what was previously called the Leonardo Programme on a consistent basis. Students will be supervised by Lymm HS teaching staff with 3 teachers supervising the first week and 3 different teachers supervising the second week. Students involved in the project are aged 16-18 studying the BTEC National Diploma in Sports Coaching, Development and Fitness at Level 3. The programme also has Spanish language learning embedded within it in the form of an NVQ Level 2 qualification. A focus area within this course is the development of core coaching and teaching skills, effective delivery of developing such qualities forms the foundation for successful assessment. The project specifically targets those students who have the aptitude to realise their learning potential in an environment of current outstanding practice. The aim to develop and enhance these competencies will be met through the expertise of the professional coaches in a variety of sports at La Manga Club (LMC). Students will observe professionals and then experience quality mentoring and guidance when under-taking the role of the professional coach delivering in various sports academies. Mentors will provide continuous qualitative feedback for all participants. Lymm HS PE staff will have primary responsibility for the welfare of the students outside of working hours and will monitor recording of daily learning experiences and the impact they have. Students will utilise their newly acquired competencies in the host language as a practitioner in the sports sector. This experience provides us with a centre with the tools to develop motivation and methodology for language learning and to enhance the capacity for potential employment. Participants will follow dynamic learning programmes in sector specific learning environments, gaining work related experiences that will be reinforced through professional guidance and evaluative post learning features. It is hoped that the outcome will be an increased deployment on return of students delivering their skills. The project will include students who find some theoretical components challenging and will require at times emotional support and mentoring to ensure they overcome their vulnerability. The long term outcomes  of the project are to ensure that our students develop life skills, as well as employment skills that will be a vital experience for our students. This is an area which in previous projects has seen significant value added for certain participants.", "http://www.lymmhigh.org.uk", "Lymm HIgh School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012695_coordinator"]]}}, "9EH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Oughtrington Language Link", "Oughtrington Community Primary School", 7444.0, 1, 1, "Located in an affluent area of Cheshire, ours is a high achieving Primary school catering for the needs of 423 pupils who range in age from 4yrs to 11yrs. \r\n\r\nNew legislation (September 2014) regarding compulsory language teaching in KS2 highlighted the need to provide greater language support to our teaching staff (who all deliver languages to their classes) and to ensure our pupils are provided with every opportunity to embrace language learning and make substantial progress. Our project objectives are:\r\n1. To improve French language skills of teachers\r\n2. To establish a Link School in France\r\n3. To develop cross curricular links\r\n\r\nFour staff over a period of two years will participate in an eight day Language and Methodology Immersion course in France. Upon their return, each will have the skills, enthusiasm and commitment to make a positive impact on our school\u2019s teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nDesigned to meet the meet the needs of  primary school teachers the content includes: \r\n\u2022 14 hours of French language skills/methodology and pedagogy \r\n\u2022 Task based learning \r\n\u2022 Cultural activities \r\n\u2022 Job-shadowing at a primary school \r\n\u2022 Visits to local areas of significance \r\n\r\nThe results and impact of the project on the teaching and learning within the school will be significant. Language competencies of teachers will be improved enabling greater confidence to team teach and support others which will positively impact on the teaching  and learning of pupils. Embracing a school link and the use of ICT to communicate with peers will inspire our children, giving them greater purpose to develop their language skills whilst increasing their cultural awareness and understanding. Incorporating significant historical and geographical features of the area through cross curricular topic work will further enhance children\u2019s knowledge of the area.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will come from sustained communication with a link school. This will impact on the language skills of teachers and pupils; furthermore it will bring renewed cross curricular opportunities to enhance our curriculum.
