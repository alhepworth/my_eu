The concept is to use hydrofracturing for stimulation and bioleaching for winning of ores. The final process will consist of a so-called doublet, which is two deviated and parallel wells.\nIn order to avoid high costs for drilling from the surface, the BioMOre approach is divided into two phases. Phase 1 will be research on the intended bioleaching process whereas phase 2 will aim at a pilot installation to demonstrate the applicability of the process in large scale including hydro-fracturing and access of the deposit from surface.\nThe first phase should cover the intended work of the current BioMOre approach without drilling from surface.\nThe BioMOre project aims at extracting metals from deep mineralized zones in Europe (Poland-Germany, Kupferschiefer deposit as a test case) by coupling solution mining and bioleaching. Selected sustainability indicators based on regulatory requirements of the European Commission will be applied for feasibility considerations.\nThe main objective of the BioMOre first phase is to design and build an underground test facility for testing the concept of combined hydro-fracturing and bioleaching. The test facility will comprise a 100 m\u00b2 ore block, where boreholes will be drilled horizontally using standard equipment. All necessary equipment for testing different parameters of the intended bioleaching process will be established underground.\nThe intention is to test the bioleaching process in high detail in an in-situ environment at the same time avoiding time consuming and risky permission procedures. On the other hand, the application for the permission of underground test operation must contain detailed information about monitoring of tests and all material controls.

Key element of the project will be the development and validation of design methods for low emissions combustors to reduce NOx and CO emissions by an optimization of the combustor aero-design process. Preliminary combustor design tools will be coupled with advanced parametrisation and automation tools. Improved heat transfer and NOx models will increase the accuracy of the numerical prediction. The advanced representation of low emission combustors and the capability to investigate combustor scaling effects allow an efficient optimisation of future combustors targeting a cut of combustor development time by 50%. IMPACT-AE is split into four technical work packages: WP1\u2018Development of smart design methodologies for clean combustion\u2019 as central WP to deliver the new methodology for combustor design, WP2\u2019Modelling and design of advanced combustor wall cooling concepts\u2019 for combustor liner design definition as key technology area, WP3\u2019Technology validation by detailed flame diagnostics\u2019 to substantiate fuel injector design rules implemented into the design methodology and WP4\u2019Methodology demonstration for efficient low NOx combustors\u2019 will validate the combustor design.

For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies.

Participants orient themselves by the GUIDE they themselves have created and, in addition, complete their project \"A DIFFERENT DAILY ROUTINE\". The contents of the trip are organised so as to complement and augment the mostly theoretical education provided by the College.\r\n\r\nAims of the Project:\r\nThe study trips are founded on the three elements of the foreign language and culture, and the world of business, and are designed to achieve goals relevant to the students' education. The knowledge students have acquired of the foreign language in the classroom can be tried out and deepened in another European country. Students are given the opportunity to undertake operational tasks while gaining an insight into the business life of the foreign country and familiarising themselves with its work culture and lifestyle. The encounter with the country's culture takes the form of their daily routine combined with visits to museums and the theatre.\r\n\r\nProcedure and Implementation:\r\nWe remain in continuous contact with our partner institutes, so that we can involve students, parents, teachers and the college as a whole during the course of the year leading up to a study trip. As soon as assurance of support has been granted, the project managers contact our partner institutes in order to co-ordinate the details. Host families are selected by our partner institutes.

Accordingly, we will: \n\u2022 Define a programme strategy that ensures quality, consistency and sustainability of health outcomes related activities across individual BD4BO projects.\n\u2022 Integrate, synthesise, and manage knowledge from all BD4BO projects, making it easily accessible via a single knowledge exchange platform.\n\u2022 Act as pivotal point of collaboration, stakeholder engagement and communication for all BD4BO projects.\n\u2022 Provide transparency and enable the use of patient health data and human biological samples for research purposes by developing minimum data privacy standards for Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) and supporting materials for use by individual BD4BO disease-specific projects and more widely in the Research and Development (R&D) sector.\n\nCONSORTIUM\nThe multidisciplinary composition, uniting public and private sector stakeholders is the essential feature of the DO->IT consortium. The public membership spans world-leading expertise in health systems and policy, with specific expertise in the definition and use of validated outcomes from real world data sources. It comprises partners from large and small European countries as well as from pan-European and US organisations, disease-specialists from across the range of vertical programmes, including relevant patient organisations for existing and planned BD4BO projects, and representation from all relevant big data stakeholders, for example national decision makers, regulators, registries, healthcare providers, and researchers. The private consortium members include 22 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, national and pan-European pharma industry organisations, EFPIA Partners in Research with significant data management expertise including SMEs and organisations with a pan-European and global footprint. The public and private partners will also contribute their vast experience and networks to build on learnings and best practices of other real world evidence data or big data related IMI projects such as ADAPT-SMART, GetReal, EMIF, EHR4CR, OpenPHACTS and eTRIKS. In addition, DO->IT will leverage regular contact with its carefully selected International Advisory Board (IAB) and the  Data Privacy and Ethics Committees (DPECs) to inform activities and maximise the impact of BD4BO outputs. \n\nDO->IT will combine its full range of stakeholder knowledge with an holistic approach to address legal, ethical, methodological and practical issues in the collection, storage, and use of personal data across the medicinal product life-cycle.\n\nWORK PLAN\nThe work plan for the CSA is structured in four Work Packages (WPs).

Parenting and family education is offered on the unit as well as additional family visits such as Kids Club,Homework Club and family days. Supporting the Unit, Oakwood has introduced a new family intervention department to develop and take forward the family agenda.\r\n\r\nThe idea of  a mobility to Denmark has arisen due to the success of previous Grundtvig projects attended by a staff member who has recently joined the prison. The concept of working with the whole family as evidenced in the Danish Half-Way family house has been  an inspiration to Oakwood's team but the vision is yet to be realised. \r\n\r\nOur intention through S.O.F.T. (Strengthening  Oakwood's Family Ties) is to take a group of 6 people to visit a variety of family projects delivered by  the Danish Prison System.  The team will be made up of staff, ex-prisoners and/or family members - providing not only a voice for all members of the prison community- both inside and outside the walls, but the opportunity to work together to bring back at least one feasible initiative to fully implement at Oakwood.\r\n\r\nThrough a variety of meetings, family forums, surveys and newsletters we will keep our prison community updated on our progress. We will use the numerous peer-support groups and service user groups we currently run as well as staff and visitor forums  to ensure that the whole prison has an input and when the team returns with the ideas and initiatives we will disseminate and formulate an agreed plan.\r\n\r\nThe project will initially support the 80 prisoners on the Family Unit as well as the residents who take part in family courses and specialised family visits.  During the 12 months of the project, we hope to have included at least 200 active participants in developing or participating in the plan. \r\n\r\nIn the longer term it is anticipated that the new working model of including families in SOFT will be fully embedded in Oakwood so that further projects can be developed in the future.", "http://www.g4s.com", "G4S Care & Justice Service (UK) Lmited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA104-046848_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "G4S SECURE SOLUTIONS (IRAQ) LIMITED", 189895.0, "Preparatory and follow-up measures (19.03.01.06)", "fts_2017_39103"]]}}}}
