Project ECLECT is designed to do exactly that. To create the conditions for the development of self directed and responsible learning, teamwork and leadership. Qualities that UNESCO have put at the heart of their goals in education for sustainability.\r\n\r\nAs changemaker schools of the Ashoka network, we found our common interest to encourages positive change. As a worldwide network Ashoka has the ideal of every young person to become an adult changemaker, capable of taking creative action to solve a social problem. In our visions this social change is crucial to face the problems of the 21th century. And as innovative educators in traditional, Montessori and Democratic schooling, we have a wealth of experience to bring to the project. Project  ECLECT brings these experiences together and weaves  national/cultural and communicational complexity into the work, Our aim, to create a \u2018best practice\u2019 of coaching techniques, exercises and measurement of this new collaborative learning and personal leadership course.\r\n\r\nIn the project, pupils are actively encouraged to work together. Within that team work, individual skills and potential may develop more deeply. Mutual support and constructive feedback will create the platform for children finding their self motivation, help them see failure as opportunity. \r\nThe project is about using teamwork as a platform for the development of self directed and self motivated learning. The project is designed to allow all children to find their capability as leaders. Each project will only be successful if it encourages each team member to develop their own particular mastery of one part of the process. We are looking for leadership through cooperation and not a traditional approach to vertical leadership. The development of self esteem through leading others and the development of humility by being led is at the heart of the design. This is what we mean by personal leadership.\r\n\r\nParticipants of project ECLECT are high school pupils from 15-17 years old who are familiar with innovative education. The project consist of two cycles which are iterative. The first year a group of 32 pupils (4 nationalities) are working on a self-chosen European topic. The second year the process is repeated, but improved and  reinforced by the experiences of the first year. Not least by the coaching of the pupils from the first year. While collaborating and evaluating, pupils search for their own qualities and strengthen their personal leadership.Mentors offer the scaffolding.and encourage reflection and evolution of each group and individuals practice. Meanwhile the team process deepens and is brought to a higher level. Eventually the output of project ECLECT will be a collection of student designed  presentation, reflecting  eclectic best practice of exercises and methods in coaching and  collaborative learning and personal leadership.\r\n\r\nEurope needs a generation of young people able to recognise and empathise with our common challenges and we need them to be able to cooperate and, where necessary ,find the qualities of leadership and communication to empower others to help make the change.", "http://www.sands-school.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA219-035236_2"], [2018, "Kooperativn\u00ed u\u010den\u00ed a projektov\u00e1 v\u00fduka: Evropsk\u00e9 perspektivy", "Sands School", 34934.0, 6, 7, "\u201cCooperative and Project-based Learning: European Perspectives\u201d is a 2-year-long project which aims at strengthening professional qualification of teachers of S\u0160, Z\u0160 a M\u0160 da Vinci (hereafter Da Vinci School) in innovative methodologies and approaches, in particular in cooperative and project-based learning. 18 teachers and 1 administrative employee of the school take part in the project, including 5 members of the school management. \r\n\r\nDuring the project, 34 mobilities (19 structured course and 15 job-shadowing mobilities) will take place.

School Development plan planned activities which will have impact on various functional areas of the school. Within each of these areas the school sets various goals and tasks which arise from the need to meet many diverse needs of both the school as a whole and to its individual components: teachers, executives, students.\r\n1.

Our service rests on the capability, skill and dedication of our staff members who on a daily basis provide a hospitality service which is highly appreciated by hundreds of guests who visit the hotel each year.  Like any other prestigious hotel, culinary excellence is one of the things we constantly strive for and it is for this reason that we believe strongly in the need to continuously invest in our human resources. Patisserie is one area  in our culinary offering which is constantly evolving and thus it is essential that our staff is provided with the right opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge in this area by partnering up with one of the leading culinary schools in the UK. It is to be pointed out that there are no training facilities in Malta offering specific culinary training in the field of patisserie including the Institute of Tourism thus this mobility experience meets the needs of the participant to excel in this area and the need of the employer to have highly skilled individuals in this area. \r\n\r\nAs clearly pointed out in the European Commission's Communication ' Investing in Europe's Youth' we strongly believe that 'Learning, studying and training in another country provides a unique experience and opens up new horizons' and how 'Vocational education and training learning mobility brings benefits to both the participant and the employer'.
