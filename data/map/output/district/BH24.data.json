Raising and maintaining standards in key skills and foreign language learning is embedded in the school development plans of all partners and we are constantly striving to develop our methods and find creative and innovative ways of engaging pupils. Pupils who have strong links to their learning community (class and school), who have teachers with the resources, creativity and freedom to respond to their individual learning needs in a practical way, are less likely to become disenchanted with education. \r\n\r\nObjectives: To share and develop planning and teaching practices which build learning communities where each individual can feel fully integrated. With this as our guiding principle, we have planned activities which will aid raising standards in literacy, numeracy, foreign languages, social integration and employability skills.  We will develop a portfolio of lesson plans with hands on activities and practical outcomes,  and demonstrate lessons and outcomes in our international joint workshops.\r\nThere are 6 partners involved in this Project: The schools in the UK, France, Germany and Hungary are coeducational Waldorf Schools for children aged 3 - 18, and the two schools in Turkey are TED schools, one for children aged 5 - 13, the other 14 - 18.  The High School in Turkey and the Waldorf School in France have not been involved in a transnational project before. All schools give a high level of support to pupils with fewer opportunities, and we intend that the ratio of participants with such needs is the same or higher than that ratio throughout the partner schools.\r\n \r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nInternal project activities (not mobilities) will take place in each school throughout the project years, during regular lesson times. Preparation in lesson time will lead to demonstration and practice in joint workshops, then feedback and evaluation will further inform lessons back home, making them more relevant to project objectives.\r\n\r\nPlanned activities:\r\n\r\n- 3 project management meetings throughout the project, including a final meeting to discuss and plan dissemination of results and sustainability activities.\r\n\r\n- 10 short term joint workshops (7 days each) involving a total number of 343 grant funded and about 70 additional mobilities. Three of these will be language workshops in French, English and German on different themes, which pupils will have prepared in their foreign language lessons leading up to the mobility. The other workshops will take place in English and the themes are taken from the key skills areas: Literacy, numeracy, communication (friendship), employability and entrepreneurship. All workshops will build on, and demonstrate elements of, lessons which took place at the schools prior to the international meetings. In this way, reinforcement and sharing of our work in individual schools takes place on an international level.\r\n\r\n-7 exchanges for 6 weeks each, involving a total number of 40 pupils, with the objective of raising standards in foreign language learning, self confidence, ability to live in a foreign country, and employability. Teachers who accompany the students will themselves engage with teaching assignments which they will take back to their schools at home in order to introduce foreign language teaching into other subjects across the curriculum.\r\n\r\n-Staff training event: In the third year of the project we will put together our research, insights and new practices to create training resources for teachers, addressing areas such as classroom management, creative planning for lessons with practical outcomes and catering for individual needs within a class community. There will be 15 participants on the initial training event. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n- Videos produced by students on the themes of the foreign language workshops. \r\n- A portfolio of lesson plans for the teaching of literacy, numeracy, foreign languages and sciences where pupils work towards a common goal and produce a practical outcome. \r\n- A collection of internal and external resources to support teachers in making better provision for all pupils, including those who lack connection to their work and peers and/or are in danger of early school leaving; staff training resources for the wider teaching community beyond the partner schools on these areas.\r\n\r\nPotential long term benefits : new methods integrated into practice throughout the partner schools which will produce better engagement from pupils with low ability in key skills; more understanding for pupils with disengagement issues, and confident use of resources to support them better.

It is probably best known as an area of ancient woodland and swathes of 'open forest' grazed by roaming herds of New Forest ponies. Its EU nature conservation interest lies in its 13 habitat types (including the priority habitats bog woodland and alluvial forests) and 3 species of the Habitats Directive and the 5 Annex I Birds Directive species present.  Situated in the densely populated south of England, the New Forest is a magnet to visitors - estimated at 20 million annually. This popularity brings with it problems: recreational pressure causes erosion and disturbance. Afforestation with non-indigenous species leaves a legacy of conifer plantations that are out of keeping with the natural character of the area. Other invasive species like bracken and rhododendron threaten its integrity. \n\nA Strategy for the New Forest, which was published by the New Forest Committee in April 1996, recognised the European importance of the New Forest and identified a strategic framework for its conservation and enhancement. The LIFE project grew from this initiative.\n\nA consortium of 10 organisations - from graziers and foresters to conservationists - put together an ambitious programme to undertake a wide range of habitat management and restoration measures designed to tackle the key threats to the New Forest. The main targets were to produce a management plan to cover the entire pSCI; to increase the land owned and managed for nature conservation purposes; and to restore 4000 ha of the pSCI habitats to favourable conservation status. Much of the habitat restoration work would involve clearance of rhododendron, removal of planted and invasive conifers, introducing traditional broadleaved woodland management (like pollarding), and repairing/controlling erosion. One of the more innovative elements of the project was the action to secure the long term viability of grazing animals in the New Forest. Since much of the nature conservation interest is bound up with traditional grazing practices - ponies, cattle and pigs - it is important that these should not decline. New Forest pony grazing is thought to be most at risk and project activities thus focused on stock improvement through incentive payments linked to competitions and stock management by pony owners.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=249", null, "life_302"], [2002, "New Forest - Sustainable Wetland Restoration in the New Forest", "Hampshire County Council", 3721928.0, 1488771.0, "Southern England\u2019s 'New' Forest\u2019 covers around 290km2 and is considered a biological 'hot spot'.
