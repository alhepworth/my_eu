BWK, educates young people in both practical skills and theoretical knowledge in close cooperation with employers. FBA has a long experience in producing professional development activities for schools, with an international dimension. Migrants and refugees have been in focus as a specifically vulnerable group of students and an area of special interest. AVCT works to create opportunities for learning, development and change for the most disengaged, disadvantaged and disaffected members of the community. The project organisations have been chosen to create a solid knowledge foundation and to be able to illuminate the problem from the different views of perspectives on education for equity \u2013social, cultural and linguistic inclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though all three partner organisations have competence and experience in working towards social, linguistic & cultural inclusion and school success for marginalised groups, additional knowledge is urgently required. The target group is, apart from the staff of the project organisations also professionals in education; teachers, school leaders, career teachers, school health service and welfare officers, in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general aims of the project are connected to the aim of the EU; to reduce early school leaving and contribute to a positive long-term development with an increasing number of students at risk fulfilling their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives are\r\n\r\n\u2022 Developing innovative methodologies which can be used to increase educational success in school and/or vocational training\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mapping out and analyzing good practice in social, linguistic and cultural inclusion, with special attention given to migrant children\u2019s situation\r\n\r\n\u2022 Creating sustainable networks and finding successful strategies for cooperation between schools, communities and labour market on national and local level\r\n\r\n\u2022 Producing guidelines for good practice, dissemination activities and professional development events for professionals in education\r\n\r\n\u2022 A digital platform for information and communication.

Through this the project will generate a sustainable impact on the work of the partner organisations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Well-functioning networks and sustainable strategies for cooperation between partner organisations and schools, communities, local employers and other stakeholders. The issue of NEETs and early drop-outs is a huge challenge for the future and a matter of vital importance in the EU.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Intellectual outputs, most importantly the digital platform, but also publications and other products, will be used by professionals in education all over Europe.
