Howitt with the academic, linguistic and cultural background to successfully implement Spanish within the school but, alongside her experience of the Graduate Diploma with the University of Dundee, will enable her to achieve registration with the General Teaching Council in this subject area. \r\n\r\nAfter training, the project would have an impact on the whole of the school community from the existing languages staff who will benefit from access to new methodology and resources to the pupils currently studying languages who will have increased language learning and European awareness activities; it will also enable us to develop a link with a Spanish school with the aim of forming a partnership with them in the future. Pupils who don't currently study languages will also benefit from increased awareness of Europe and European countries as we will be able to embed Languages and Europe into the whole school curriculum through the daily 'House Time' program. \r\n\r\nThere is also potential to involve parents through the Cowal Family Learning network.", "http://www.dunoongrammar.argyll-bute.sch.uk/", "Dunoon Grammar School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035366_coordinator"]]}}}}
