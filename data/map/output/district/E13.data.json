ARSP works for reconciliation and peace, with a special interest in the meaning of history in contemporary society, together with individuals and organisations from countries that particularly suffered  as a result of National Socialism and during the Second World War. \r\nARSP also organises four seminars for each generation of volunteers, offering the opportunity to meet and enjoy peer support, reflect on their inter-cultural experiences in a relaxed environment and to learn about and discuss active European citizenship and democracy, as well as how to develop a common vision of future European society.  \r\nThis particular project aims to develop inter-cultural understanding, promote awareness of anti-racism measures and the importance of defending human rights, whilst also providing support for those often excluded from society. The activities of each partner organisation, regardless of their differing foci, enable each volunteer to connect issues of racism, discrimination and prejudice through providing support for people with fewer opportunities. Each organisation also has historical links, or is influenced by European history, helping volunteers to appreciate the effects of racism, discrimination and what can happen if people are excluded from society, a theme that very much remains relevant in contemporary Europe. \r\nVolunteers at the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum and Wiener Library contribute to pedagogical programmes, often with local, European and international school classes, contributing their own historical perspectives and views on contemporary Europe. The diverse range of groups involved with these three hosting organisations brings the volunteers into contact with young people from different social and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to demonstrate that a voluntary service is a very productive activity, regardless of where one comes from. The volunteers at the Jewish Museum and Wiener Library will also regularly work with and support Holocaust survivors, furthering their understanding of the effects of social exclusion and hopefully strengthening their commitment to civil society, tolerance and inclusion.\r\nThe themes of the voluntary services at the Southwark Day Centre for Asylum Seekers and Roma Support Group are very similar with the volunteers supporting refugees, asylum seekers and Roma on a daily basis, all people who have to endure very difficult circumstances, generally as a result of discrimination and racism, leading to exclusion from mainstream society. The volunteers can provide these people with invaluable support, helping them to integrate into life in the UK as smoothly as possible through providing language courses, preparing cultural activities or simply offering a hot meal everyday, amongst many other activities.\r\nThree German volunteers will be involved in this project, all will be based in London, at either the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum or Wiener Library.\r\nThree Polish volunteer will also be in involved in this project, all based in London, with two at the Roma Support Group and one at the Southwark Day Centre for Asylum Seekers. All volunteers will stay for 12 months.\r\nThe bilateral nature of the project brings together young people from Germany and Poland for a period of 12 months, encouraging inter-cultural dialogue and exchange, in the process demonstrating many ways in which young people can become active in civil society and promoting tolerance and social inclusion. This project will use non-formal learning methods to aid the personal development of all volunteers, training them in inter-cultural learning methods designed to produce a lifelong commitment to participating in European civil society upon the completion of their voluntary service.", "http://www.romasupportgroup.org.uk", "Action Reconciliation Service for Peace", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA105-014108_2"]]}}, "8SG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "PIMEN3", "Newham Sixth Form College", 447364.0, 8, 13, "PIMEN 3 is a Lille-based education authority consortium involved in vocational training placement in Europe. First created in September 2011, PIMEN_aan is a collaborative work platform dedicated to promoting and offering apprentices, students and staff from the Acad\u00e9mie de Lille the chance to experience a vocational training placement or professional development in Europe. The acad\u00e9mie of Lille first applied as a consortium in 2013 and 2014, contributing to meeting the demand and needs from training organisations in the acad\u00e9mie. This new consortium project, bring together 17 VET organisations in the acad\u00e9mie of Lille, all members of the PIMEN_aan platform. \r\nThe project aims at the participating schools by:\r\n1- assisting the new members of the consortium referring to existing skills developed in former projects in order to reach a greater  number of leaners and staff members - 2- building and developing the opportunity for the authority and the members of the consortium to bring an international and European dimension into education and training - 3- adding value to the professional pathway and helping vocational schools reduce dropping - 4- taking part in school guidance activities run by the consortium members and aimed at promoting professional education and the mobility programme within their sector - 5- creating and /or sustaining partnerships between vocational schools in Europe and partnerships with the business sector \r\nThe project aims at the learners by: \r\n1- developing autonomy, entrepreneurship, and will for success - 2- developing cultural, language and professional skills\r\n3- building European citizenship - 4- making new sense of professional and language learning\r\nThe PIMEN 3 project has collected the mobility calls of 480 participants from the 17 schools within the authority of Lille. Most of them are under age (16-17 aged youngsters). European mobility is offered to young students who have never been away from their families or have never travelled abroad but are really determined to improve their work and language skills in a European company. Preparation activities are carried out by the mobility coordinating teacher in the sending and hosting school.\r\nThe GIP (Groupement d\u2019Int\u00e9r\u00eat Public:) is the applicant organisation in charge of the administrative and financial management of the project. It manages and coordinates the ERASMUS+ funds within the acad\u00e9mie, signs conventions with the partners, writes balance sheets, takes part in the steering group. \r\nThe DAREIC (Department of  International Education Affairs) writes and submits the application e-form aligning to the needs expressed and mentioned by the sending schools , it coordinates the project with the GIP(steering groups managing, team working, educational reports writing \u2026). It ensures that the consortium PIMEN3 project building and developing process will match and contribute to meeting the objectives of the project and the authority, the educational objectives of the schools.\r\nThe role of the sending partners in the project managing:\r\nRelaying information to the GIP and DAREIC, preparing the participants, supporting and following up the mobility activities, evaluating and enhancing the project, taking part in the reports, updating the website www.pimen-aan.eu. The supervisor in the hosting company will check and monitor the work programme and progress during mobility. An accompanying person will be in charge of validating the skills mastering with and in the company. \r\nResults sharing and dissemination will take place within the school: commitment to quality of the partnership, skills mastering, feed-back on benefits from mobility experience, communication activities within and towards the educational community and the authority organisations (GIP and DAREIC). Influence and valorisation outside the school: promoting the ERASMUS+ programme through activities and results to be enhanced and disseminated within the authority.\r\nThe expected impact and results: \r\n1/ For the participants: skills mastering in an international context and validation process (language, professional, social and cultural skills, analysing the situation abilities, communication skills, European citizenship development). For mobility recognition, the participants will be given incentive to present and fulfil achievement of the optional mobility unit -  2/ For training staff: mastering organisation skills, language and cultural communication skills. Improving team, cross sectors and schools work - 3/ For the authority: developing PIMEN_aan platform influence at the regional and national levels by sharing and collecting data with and towards training schools inEurope, by increasing the number of staff training abroad and partnerships between European VET. The dissemination of the PIMEN3 project results will be performed via PIMEN-aan platform website.
