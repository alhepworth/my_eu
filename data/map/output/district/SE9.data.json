The project aims to introduce young people from Sweden to new cultures and new methods of interaction using sport as a platform. Through dialogue, practical activities and informal l learning the project aims to combat racism, gender exclusion and tolerance for others. Play Maker Project implements innovative methods of informal  learning which use physical exercises to lift important issues and aid the learning experience.\r\n\r\nPlay Makers Project aims to give participants the chance to explore the differing levels of social tolerance throughout Europe and in turn increases their own tolerance toward others. We also want to encourage participants to play a greater role in their own  community and the European community through building connections with other young people in Europe and sharing experiences. \r\n\r\nOur objective is to give young people in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s and South East London the chance to explore other cultures, embrace their own and and become more understanding toward others. We want to develop unity and encourage tolerance amongst our young people, promote multiculturalism in Sweden, diversity and reject discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe Project will take place in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Sweden for a duration of 8 days with 6 Activity days and with a total of 60 young people taking part, from the 28th of October till 1st of November 2015. The partners involved are V\u00e4smanlands Idrottsf\u00f6rbund (V\u00e4stmanlands Sports Federation), Charlton Athletic Community Trust, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s IK, Gideonsbergs IF and here4U \r\n\r\nParticipants in the project will be selected from the following football organisations, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s IK,\r\nand Gideonsbergs IF and the Charlton Athletic Community Trust. V\u00e4stmanlands Sports Federation are responsible for the organisation and management of the project. Here4U youth leaders will lead discussion groups and are responsible for non-sports related activities\r\n\r\nThe implemented activities will provide a variety of informal learning opportunities for the participants, as well as a variety of working methods. The group of young people will have the opportunity to participate in a variety of sports activities, along with cultural excursions and\r\nexplorations of the different environments levels and of tolerance towards others.\r\n\r\nParticipants will have the opportunity to compare their cultures and attitudes towards race, gender and tolerance for others exploring both the differences and the similarities. They will document their findings through photography, and share this with a wider audience of young people in both countries through social media. \r\n\r\nThe methods applied will include: sports activities; cultural visits; informal discussion; team building and communication activities; casual group interaction; social networking and use of digital media; sharing events, non-formal learning through entertainment and evaluational activities.", "http://www.cact.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-SE02-KA105-001208_3"], [2014, "Otwieracz - pracownicy m\u0142odzie\u017cowi przeciw rasizmowi", "South of England Foundation T/A Charlton Athletic Community Trust", 5841.0, 2, 2, "UK has a long history of waves of  immigration and corresponding tensions in community relations.  These have had their expression in many areas of social life including social unrest, football hooliganism, bullying, racially motivated criminality, cases of institutional racism to name just a few.   At the same a growing recognition  of the needs of multicultural society has resulted in  changing legislation with regards to discrimination, in  introducing   anti-discriminatory policies in all areas of public life and  have generated much good practice and experience, including shaping citizenship attitudes towards multiculturalism and inclusivity which begin with schoolchildren.  \r\nIn the last few years, Wroclaw, and  Poland generally,  have seen a growth of nationalist attitudes, and  increased numbers of recorded  hate crime  (Nigdy Wiecej, 2013).  The context for nationalism and  racism in both countries is different yet there is a good case for sharing experiences, learning from each other\u2019s good practice and learning more about each other\u2019s communities.   Importantly, nationalist and racially motivated crimes tend to be perpetrated in both countries by young people who might be at risk of social exclusion themselves  by a lack of  opportunities,  disillusionment with formal education and  the prospect of  unemployment, and  a breakdown in  trust in  the political system which they see as failing them and their communities.\r\nThe overall  aim of this exchange programme will be knowledge transfer partnership with a view  to developing specific local programmes targeting young people at risk of adopting  nationalist and racist \u2018solutions\u2019 to their immediate problems.   Both sides in this exchange partnership have things to learn from each other: the Polish side is keen to examine the experience of  immigration, racism and multicultural education in UK in order to learn models of good practice as developed  there.  They are  keen to learn about and from British experiences of multiculturalism and anti-discriminatory practices in order to develop their own expertise. They are particularly keen to develop suitable models of anti-racist initiatives for working with football fans.   The UK side, Charlton Athletic Community Trust has recently become involved with young  East European  immigrants, including those from Poland and are  therefore keen to gain  insight into the specificities of Poland\u2019s diversity issues, young people\u2019s attitudes towards minorities and problems of hate crime. They thus want to  learn  about Polish migrants\u2019 cultural background  in order to better cater for their needs.    This insight would be beneficial for planning their specific outreach work  in UK.  Both sides are also keen to see how work with young people, football clubs and school pupils can be improved to foster tolerance, openness and the values of democratic citizenship.  It is hoped that this exchange programme will  also open up opportunities for further collaboration  in particular in terms of projects involving youth.  \r\nEight people  are expected to travel from UK and there will be further eight participants from Poland taking part; 16 people in total.   Individuals working for CACT have experience in training youth workers, working with young people in schools, and those disadvantaged or socially excluded groups, and their experience is in projects aiming at crime reduction,  raising educational achievement, creating pathways to employment, building healthier lifestyles, bringing communities together and reducing crime.  Individuals from Stowarzyszenie Edukacji Krytycznej have experience in local outreach projects which include antidiscriminatory initiatives,  equal opportunities for women in higher education, human rights, action against domestic violence, support for social enterprise, democratic education, disability, environment, promotion of healthier lifestyles,  European integration and closer cooperation among different communities, among others.\r\nThe exchange  programme will include a visit in Wroclaw, Poland and specific planned activities.  During most of these activities there will be a chance to meet and  talk to new people, practitioners  and young people.\r\nOur program includes: workshops about stereotypes, situation of minorities in UK and n Poland, racism and sport, lectures about multicultural education, meetings with socal workers and youth workers, participation in the important events connected (historcally and more directly) with racism and minortes persecutions. Addicionally participants will visit the Quater of Mutual Respect (other name: the Quater of Four Temples) and have an opportunty to experience diversity in Wroclaw.\r\nThe results of the exchange programme will include much information collected by the participants of both groups, prepared scripts for multicultural education aimed at anti-racist and anti-nationalist initiatives and local policies advices for authirities.", "http://www.cact.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA105-002053_1"]]}}, "3LE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1467244800000, "Advanced Cockpit for Reduction Of StreSs and workload", "Tony Henley Consulting Limited", "Outstanding safety level of air transport is partly due to the two pilots standard.

Or do you live in the city and long for the peace and quiet only rural nature can give you? \r\nAnd do these (subjective) merits really outweigh the often hidden advantages of the respective regions? \r\nFor the Erasmus+ - project \"Living in the City and living in the Country\" two schools in Germany and the United Kingdom have affiliated which could not be more different in regard to internal setting and external environment: The rather monocultural Geschwister-Scholl-Gymnasium (GSG) in Daun in the rural Eifel region united with the multicultural Eltham Hill School (EHS) in Greenwich in the metropolitan area of London to find out which place young people consider the best to live in. \r\nThe project will invite more than 100 members of the school communities to actively take part in diverse project activities to give them the opportunity to have a close look beyond their own sphere and, through exchange visits, allow them to step into another world. Since they are usually uninhibited,  inquisitive and enthusiastic, the students from years 7 and 8 at GSG and years 8 and 9 at EHS were chosen to take part which also ensures the students have the same age. Peer teaching and learning is promoted since all of them study English or German as a foreign language and yet the language skills vary because of the different amount of lessons being taught. Students of all socio-economic and cultural backgrounds are encouraged to join the project activities. \r\n\r\nThe thematic objective of the project is to draw comparisons between the different ways of life, to identify, discuss and propagate merits and to present the students' suggestions for improvement to policy makers . All this will be done in both languages and very often in mixed groups greatly improving the linguistic and intercultural competence of the learners. \r\n\r\nThe various project activities will also advance the students' media and presentation skills: The participants will try to answer the questions on the (hidden) merits of living in a rural or urban environment by taking a close look at their own life and habits. After having reactivated the relevant vocabulary by collaboratively creating wordnets online, their findings will be published in blog entries and discussed in different groups. By conducting online surveys in peer groups data will be collected to validate or rebut their own impressions. The evaluation of the survey results is followed by transnational discussions with many members of the school communities like teachers and parents. The local public will be informed about the project's proceedings and findings through articles written by the participants themselves. Apart from those press releases the students will, in a next step,  develop advertising material for the respective regions and/or output to convince policy makers of the necessity to improve the situation of young people in their area. \r\n\r\nTo address and motivate a large number of students the methodology will vary in the different project phases: Besides working in local project clubs the participants will largely cooperate via the internet, e.g. eTwinning's twinspace including forum, chat and video conference tools but also using relatively new websites like wisemapping or survey monkey to cooperatively develop wordnets and surveys online. International project meetings of student groups ensure the development of the learners' linguistic and cultural competence through total immersion. Throughout the project the teachers will mainly take a guiding and supporting position giving the right impulses at the right time to promote learner autonomy and motivation. The feedback received at various dissemination events (e.g. presentations to the transnational peer group, colleagues, parents or the public) and following press releases will serve as a corrective to the project. \r\n\r\nSince the project addresses different groups, the results vary in scope and form: The blog entries, the surveys on the attractiveness of living in a rural or urban environment and the discussion of the results might give an impulse to regional pride and/or suggestions for improvement directed at local policy makers. Presentations, leaflets, audio and video clips will be produced by the learners to make their point of view known to different audiences. \r\nThe manifold longer term benefits for the learners include an enhanced linguistic and (multi-)cultural competence and the possibility of long-lasting connections to and friendships with their partners surviving the Brexit. The discussion, presentation and media skills fostered in project activities are of course transferable to other contexts. The policy makers can refer back to the findings of the project and compare the results to those of similar studies in the future. The outcomes of the project may well be transferable to other regions in Europe.", "http://www.elthamhill.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035578_1"]]}}}}
