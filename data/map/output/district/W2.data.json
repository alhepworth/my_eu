Yet, most learning systems that have been developed for mathematics education have two significant limitations: first, they are usually constrained to text-based interactions and are thus hard to use by young learners (6 to 11-year-olds) who are still perfecting their basic literacy skills. Second, support is rarely tailored to the children's needs in an adaptive fashion, even though depending on the current stage of the learning process, the support that children need varies between structured practice and more exploratory, conceptually-oriented learning.<br/>The Intelligent Tutoring and Exploration for Robust Learning project aims to facilitate robust learning by creating a platform for intelligent support that combines structured learning with exploratory learning activities and applies cognitive models of the learning behaviour of students in elementary education. Relying on state-of-the-art machine learning methods, intelligent components will be able to provide adaptive feedback -- e.g., praise or hints --and suggest subsequent tasks. The platform will enable learners to communicate and interact more naturally via rich intuitive user interfaces leveraging direct manipulation and, in particular, natural language user interfaces. The pedagogical and technological outcomes of the project will be evaluated in two proven application scenarios in two European languages.<br/>The project proposes to perform interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research in a multidisciplinary team with members from fields as diverse as artificial intelligence/machine learning, user modelling, intelligent tutoring systems, and natural language processing, as well as educational psychology and mathematics education.", 221343.0, 2448088.0, 4, 8, "iTalk2Learn", null, null, null, "fp7_105872_954763920"]]}}, "1JU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "E.A.S.Y.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.

The project idea originates from the constant contact and confrontation with students, recent graduates, VET staff, companies, stakeholders and public and private Institutions.The strong information activity on the learning and mobility opportunities offered by European Programs, carried out at national level, through seminars, infodays and meetings, permitted  Essenia UETP srl to understand the needs of the job market and the education world as well. Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension. In the project Portugal has been identified as one of the Countries with which to activate sinergies, according to the internationalization strategy.

Cytological tests are performed in number of millions/year in Europe, with an objective need of standardizing quality levels. The necessary training of the professionals involved (Cytotechs, Cytoscreeners, Biologists, Pathologists) in the different European nations is based on Courses and Masters at University level, which employ texts, fixed images of reference patterns and sessions at microscopes, in order to guarantee a reproducible recognition of structural features typical of malignant/cancer cells.\r\n\r\nDiplomas of Competence in Cytology are released by single European Nations, but a single European Accreditation Test, certifying a diagnostic ability at a standardized level would no doubt be the preferred option. In order to meet these requirement, the European Federation of Cytological Societies (EFCS) established QUATE (Quality Assurance, Training and Examination) Aptitude Test but the complexity of its organization make this test practiced by a relatively low number of applicants (approximately 50 in year 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST System aims both at delivering a training course accomplishing the needed criteria to successfully afford the QUATE test and at generating the e-QUATE, the electronic version of the QUATE test, thus reaching a more popular, cheaper and efficient impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST Project is based on the exploitation of the Virtual Slide (VS) technology permitting a telematic transfer and navigation of scanned images of reference cytological slides. Images are stored at very high resolutions and can be viewed via Internet with proper Virtual Microscope software (eg Zoomify). These images can be used \u2013with specific tools-to realize highly interactive self assessment exercises that will improve the competence of cytotechnologists. For example exercises will show details of cells in an image, or ask to search for particular \u201cclues\u201d that can lead to diagnoses. These training cases will be accessible through the Cy-TEST system, an open access (with free registration) e-learning platform developed upon the existing open source system Moodle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project starts with the definition of the requirements for the system, the identification of suitable training methodologies and the organisation of the training contents answering to QUATE criteria and target user needs. All partners will contribute to the collection of images. \r\n\r\nAt least 1000 cases/examples will be collected, managed and stored in a dedicated repository, wherefrom to organize both an inter-active training Course and Internet-based QUATE (e-QUATE) sessions. This will allow to make training, quality assessment and continuing education of Cytologists easier, standardized and accessible.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the release of the preliminary versions of the system and of the training cases, a continuous assessment cycle (development-assessment-refinement) will be performed with real users in order to monitor usability and reliability. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least 200 cyto-technicians will be involved in the project in the pilot phases; also 200 residents in Pathology in partner\u2019s universities will be reached.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

There is a need to gain knowledge and insight into the disciplines that future businesses will require. The project has therefore placed emphasis on developing interdisciplinary group mobilities. It will increase the expertise and networks across different sectors, enhance value creation and innovation, facilitate better use of regional advantages and enhance restructuring to greener jobs. An example involving technology is a group from Nordhordaland (vocational school, business and municipality) that intends to visit Denmark to further develop the industrial foundation in Mongstad in a greener and more progressive direction.In this, and future projects, HCC will work more systematically to increase the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. HCC is applying for 37 mobility projects which count 173 pupils and apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 4 training offices, and 68 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 29 mobility projects which count 178 staff from 28 businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, agriculture, electricity/electronics, and tourism. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as entrepreneurship, green and blue growth, innovation, progressive healthcare, school administration, assessment, and cooperation between VET and businesses. As a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they are accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries. The accompanying persons will assist the pupils while traveling and make sure the pupils settle in at both their place of accommodation and the work place.", "http://www.nbccuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA116-021918_38"]]}}, "3AN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "GESTI\u00d3N ADMINISTRATIVA: FORMACI\u00d3N PR\u00c1CTICA EN EMPRESAS EUROPEAS", "HENRY VIII HOTEL", 12289.0, 2, 2, "The IES Izpis\u00faa Belmonte presents the project \" Administrative Management : Practical training in European companies \" led two students in the intermediate level training Administrative Management and collaboration with a partner.

Connectors Malm\u00f6 leads the project in collaboration with the city of Malm\u00f6, MKB (local housing agency) and RGDTS.  The Residency and Hub is a physical and social space within the community of Persborg in Malm\u00f6.  Persborg faces a high level of unemployment, single households and segregation, leading to a high level of clinical depression among residents and low sense of community. The Residency and Hub seeks to break this mould by providing a platform for residents to creatively reconstruct their community.  It serves as a social innovators residency, where social entrepreneurs from all backgrounds will live collectively--working on their own projects and jointly on community projects.  The Hub is a drop-in office and workshop where residents of the local community can develop their skills through a system of skill exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to become a solution that can be scaled to other cities with similar demographics and challenges.  Most cities, for example, have vacant lots that could act as the physical space for this solution.  The project seeks three volunteers to work with the ongoing development of the concept.  The volunteers will all be independent thinkers who have proven to be diligently competent of taking initiative. The tasks and activities range from physical development and construction of the 3000 m2 physical space to community outreach; from creative PR campaigns to event curating; from volunteering and interacting with local actors to administrative tasks.\r\n\r\nThe methodology carried out throughout the practice will be twofold.  Firstly, we will focus a lot on Human Centered Design as defined by Ashoka International.  Since much of the work involved in this process is problem-solving and solution-finding, we use human-centered design to ensure that the solutions are sustainable and relevant to the problem.  Secondly, we instill a customized team-workflow based on team-building, mutual trust and work efficient methods including Pecha Kucha and Pomodoro technique. We have found this hybrid method of working to be very effective with our current team.\r\n\r\nThrough this project we hope to see physical changes to the community of Persborg.  The hub aims to be used as a workspace for locals to craft the physical construction of the community, with the approval of the municipality and housing agency.  If locals agree, for example, that all benches in Persborg should be painted blue, we aim to act as a platform and intermediary to ensure that this can happen.  This will promote direct democracy and will begin to give the neighbourhood an identity. This project also aims to bring social change.  In the interaction between neighbours over the physical changes to the neighbourhood, community begins to form.  We hope a sense of ownership over the neighbourhood will unite neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, we hope this project will strengthen and empower the diverse sustainable and relevant change occurs.  If this project does prove to be a success, we would like to spread this concept to other neighbourhoods in Northern Europe, before scaling to the rest of Europe and then globally.

One of these challenges is skills needs. At the same time, it is difficult for today's providers in vocational education & training to recruit students & many programs lack quality. The project GoEUVET 2 has been initiated to address some of these challenges:Vocational training less valued by young peopleIn a recent survey, McKinsey & Company found that nearly 2/3 of the young people who participated in the study agreed that vocational training was less valued by society.  Fewer than 40% of those who said they preferred vocational work actually sought out this type of training. In Sweden, only 28% of young people apply for vocational education. At the same time, youth unemployment in Sweden is 25%.Many companies can't fill their vacancies There are a large number of young, educated people available for work, but many companies still can't fill their vacancies. In the above mentioned McKinsey & Company survey, 43% of the employers stated that candidates don't possess the skills they need. Yet 72% of educators believe new graduates are qualified to land jobs in the real world. In conclusion, educators don\u2019t seem to be aware of what employers are looking for & students may have skills, but not the right ones. For instance, international experience is highly appreciated by the employers. Still few VET students are provided a transnational learning opportunity as part of their education.ECVET \u2013 still a well-kept secretFew VET providers in Europe have discovered ECVET as a mean to quality assure non-formal learning (eg work placement) & for VET development. Few projects utilizing ECVET in practice have been conducted making it difficult to communicate the \u2018real\u2019 added value of ECVET. ECVET needs further investigation, eg it remains a challenge for training professionals to describe & assess learning outcomes (knowledge, skills & competencies) achieved in the workplace and/or live projects in cooperation with the outside world. ECVET is a suitable tool for this.Aim & objectivesAccording to the European growth strategy EU 2020, the EU member states should aim to deliver high levels of employment, productivity & social cohesion.  In order to respond to this strategy, a new framework - Education & Training 2020 - has been created including strategic objectives, two of them concerning mobility opportunties & VET quality.The aim of the GoEUVET project is to organise transnational mobility & develop a common concept for quality-assured transnational mobility so that the non-formal learning experience becomes transparent, transferable, and possible to communicate to potential employers. In this way, the project contributes to the fulfillment of a number of priority objectives at local, regional, national as well as European level.Overall objectives- Transnational mobility of students in vocational education- Concept development & quality assurance utilizing EQAVET, EQF, ECVET & EuropassActions- Introduction to the EQF, ECVET & Europass for involved personnel- Recruitment of vocational students for trans. mobility- Preparation for trans. mobility- Transnational mobility- Evaluation of trans. mobilities- Recognition of learning outcomes achieved during trans. mobility- Concept development for trans. national mobility- Project coordination- Communications & disseminationExpected results, effects & long-term benefits of the project- Upskilling (acheving extended VET competences), improved linguistic and intercultural competence, and personal development for VET students - Increased number of VET programs offering increased number of transnational VET mobility opportunities- Improved outcomes & increased motivation for VET students- Reduced youth unemployment & increased mobility regionally, nationally & at European level between VET programs/systems & labor markets- Increased attractiveness of the VET programs involved- Increased experience & preparedness for international cooperation among staff involved in vocational programs- Improved quality of the VET programs involved- Dissemination & continued experimentation on the European frameworks ECVET, EQF, EQAVET and Europass.In conclusion, the GoEUVET 2 project will contribute to the fulfillment of the aims & objectives at local, regional, national, & European level.

Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\nThe impact on the partnership\u2019s VET schools will be:\r\n- Improving qualifications and competitiveness of youngsters, enabling them to adapt to the digital era\u2019s demands and to a global knowledge-based economy, enhancing , at the same time, the increase of the youth employment and a sustainable growth.\r\n- Consolidating and increasing contacts with European entities to modernise education, to share good practices and to develop new projects in the field of European cooperation\r\n- Improving the quality of the training, delivered in the school, and adapted to linguistic, social and cultural diversity. This will allow schools to meet disadvantaged people\u2019s needs in a more efficient way and to understand better what active European citizenship is.\r\n- Improving knowledge and the use of evaluation and certification tools (ECVET and EUROPASS). \r\n- Increasing the attractiveness of vocational training education, to make it the first selected option for students and enhancing the prestige of the participating VET schools.\r\n\r\nThe project is strictly related to the 2020 Strategy and the New Skills Agenda for Europe 2016; it is consistent with the strategic priorities for contributing the increase in employment, productivity and social cohesion in the EU and its member states.", "http://www.interopa.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037020_28"], [2014, "Going far with European VET", "INTEROPA HOLIDAYS LIMITED", 119178.0, 5, 10, "Background\r\n\r\nMany European businesses & industries face great challenges in order to remain competitive players in the global arena. The Going far with European VET (GoEUVET) project has been designed to meet some of the challenges: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVocational training less valued by young people\r\n\r\nIn a recent survey, McKinsey & Company found that nearly 2/3 of the young people who participated in the study agreed that vocational training was less valued by society.  Fewer than 40% of those who said they preferred vocational work actually sought out this type of training. In Sweden, only 28% of young people apply for vocational education. At the same time, youth unemployment in Sweden is 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany companies still can't fill their vacancies \r\n\r\nThere are a large number of young, educated people available for work, but many companies still can't fill their vacancies. In the above mentioned McKinsey & Company survey, 43% of the employers stated that candidates don't possess the skills they need. Yet 72% of educators believe new graduates are qualified to land jobs in the real world. In conclusion, educators don\u2019t seem to be aware of what employers are looking for & students may have skills, but not the right ones. For instance, international experience is highly appreciated by the employers. Still few students are provided a transnational learning opportunity as part of their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECVET \u2013 still a well-kept secret\r\n\r\nFew VET providers in Europe have discovered ECVET as a mean to quality assure learning opportunities abroad & for VET development. Too few projects utilizing ECVET in practice have been conducted making it difficult to communicate the \u2018real\u2019 added value of ECVET. ECVET also needs further investigation, eg is still a challenge for VET teachers to describe &  assess learning outcomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAim & objectives\r\n\r\nAccording to the European growth strategy EU 2020, the EU member states should aim to deliver high levels of employment, productivity & social cohesion.  In order to respond to this strategy, a new framework - Education & Training 2020  - has been created including strategic objectives, two of them concerning mobility opportunties & VET quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the GoEUVET project is to organise transnational, transparent, transferable & recognisable learning opportunties for VET students in the Trade & administration, Hotel & turism, Car, trucks & Transport, & Restaurant sectors. The involved teachers will be introduced to ECVET & start to develop the mobility concept of the VET program utilizing ECVET. In doing so, the project aims to achieve the following important objectives in line with EU 2020, ET 2020 as well as local goals & strategies at Elof Lind\u00e4lvs gymnasium & Kungsbacka municipality related to these objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove VET attractiveness & offer more learning opportunties abroad\r\n\r\nProviding opportunities to study or work abroad as part of a VET qualification has proved to increase the attractiveness of VET. An immediate effect of the ECVET based European classes at ELG was an increase of student applications. Transnational mobility opportunities also proved to attract more motivated students with better grades & students tend to achieve better results if they are offered an opportunity to study or do work placement abroad as part of their VET program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove VET quality by international cooperation\r\n\r\nInternationalization is often used as a synonym to high quality when communicating VET. Still, few VET providers use this mean to increase VET attractiveness or for organizational development. However, experiences from the previous EURIAC & ECT projects proved that international cooperation indeed had positive impact on the involved VET programs, eg competence development, opportunity to benchmark one\u2019s own VET program, & increased understanding of the pros & cons of one's own & other educational systems in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduce youth unemployment \r\n\r\nThe job profiles of the involved VET programs are highly international & students could work anywhere in the world after graduation. To create transparent & transnational learning opportunities within these sectors would therefore blaze a trail to the European labour market for the 70 students that would be involved in the GoEUVET project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the expected results, impact & long term benefits:\r\n\r\n- Increased attractiveness of involved VET\r\n\r\n- Increased number of transnat.mobility opportunities for VET students\r\n\r\n- Increased teacher readiness for international cooperation in the involved VET programs\r\n\r\n- Increased knowledge of how to utilize ECVET to organize transparent & transferable transnational learning opportunties\r\n\r\n- Improved student results & higher motivation \r\n\r\n- Decreased youth unemployment & increased EU labor mobility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the GoEUVET project will contribute to the fulfillment of goals & objectives at ELG, Kungsbacka municipality, Gy2011, ET 2020, & EU 2020.

The icing on the cake is a two week internship in London or Edinburgh during which they will be able to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired during their course in a different but authentic environment and using a foreign language. This will present our students with the opportunity to push their boundaries and it will also motivate them to fully commit to their final year. Many vocational education students in Office Administration are starting to lose interest in school towards the end of their secondary school education and we feel this opportunity will give them an exciting final year to look forward to, work towards and complete successfully. \r\n\r\nIn order to be considered to take part in the project, students must show that they are motivated, social, open to experiencing different cultures, prepared to spend two weeks abroad and aware of the added value of the opportunity they are given.\r\n\r\nIn the lesson schedule of their final year provision will be made for one seminar lesson per week during which students will become acquainted with the language and culture of the internship locations.\r\n\r\nThey will study life in the United Kingdom, in particular in London and Edinburgh. They will learn about the language, the food, the location, the customs, the currency, tourist attractions, etc. In addition, they will also be prepared on a personal level and will be taught many life lessons: communicating effectively, living together, resolving conflicts, planning, organising, improving their independence by living and traveling in a foreign city and in a foreign language which in turn will strengthen their social skills. This will enable them to achieve many curriculum specific goals (giving a presentation, researching information, self-evaluation, peer-evaluation, etc.) as well as more overarching educational goals. Concrete examples include lessons in communicating (British small talk), budgeting, resolving conflicts. They will visit the British shop in Everberg and take a cooking workshop. They will research specific information about their destination, as well as suitable accommodation and transport options. They will complete a Europass CV and Language Passport. They will make a short video highlighting their motivation for the project and they will clarify this in an interview in front of a jury of teachers and external experts. They will write a weekly blog detailing their most interesting experiences. They will write an assessment of their internship experience and will present their experiences to the students who will come after them.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the school year is the two week continuous internship in either London or Edinburgh where students will apply and strengthen the knowledge and attitudes acquired at school and where they will execute the tasks of an administrative assistant in an international context: making telephone calls, welcoming visitors, classifying documents, handling correspondence, conducting sales consultations.\r\n\r\nThis will enable them to demonstrate a number of general and professional attitudes, such as punctuality, orderliness, politeness, adhering to dress code, self-reliance, self-confidence, motivation, pushing their boundaries. They will practise the language and experience the culture of their destination in diverse ways. They will become acquainted with company culture in the United Kingdom and will learn to execute the daily tasks at their internship in ways which refine and extend their job specific competencies. In this way they will greatly improve their future job opportunities, they will get a taste for moving around Europe, and they will become aware of their European citizenship. The teachers who accompany them will also benefit by updating and expanding their course specific knowledge, improving their English, strengthening the relationship with their students, establishing contacts with internship companies and expanding the project network.\r\n\r\nIt is our expectation that this will enable us to attract new students to the Office Administration course and to expand the foreign internship to all students in Office Management and Communication year 6. In addition, we are establishing by means of a poll whether some of our teachers are interested in either job shadowing or undergoing further training abroad with a view to making a fresh proposal next school year for teachers within school education.

It is located in the mountainous area called \u00ab The Vosges \u00bb. Our students mainly come from the department of Vosges and Haut Rhin. The pedagogy of the MFR is based on the alternation internship / school, so it is quite natural that we thought to organize internships abroad. Since 2008, our school has been involved in European mobility.\r\n\r\nWe were chartered in 2010 and our 2015 accreditation application has three goals :\r\n\r\n\u2022 Develop transferable skills through an off-border internship offer\r\n\r\n\u2022 Discover different cultures\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adapt and expand professional practices\r\n\r\nThese goals are what we would describe as our \u00ab compass \u00bb. Our core business is the mobility of our apprentice learners and that of the initial vocational trainees.\r\n\r\n2 classes are mainly concerned: the apprentices in CAP and the students in second year of the BAC PRO SAPAT curriculum. Since 2008, 80% of our CAP apprentices and 70% of the BAC PRO students have benefited from European mobility. This percentage corresponds to our goals.\r\n\r\nWe will carry on this perspective with a true selection of the learners who will benefit from this mobility experience. Thus, considering the profile of the current class of \u00ab Seconde BAC PRO \u00bb, we are planning a departure for only 10 of them next year.\r\n\r\n Since 2008, destinations have been diversified: Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Portugal and next year a cross-border region of Germany (Black Forest, Bavaria) in a perspective of cross-border partnership. This diversification is interesting but requires a real extra logistical supplement. This concerns transport, accommodation, people of confidence on the spot, nothing can be left to chance with students under eighteen. That's why we are asking for 4-day accompagnying scholarships to  make sure we can supervise the start of some of our mobility experiences and a 21-day scholarship for Stockholm. This supervision is clearly requested by families. The idea of \u200b\u200bmobility is anchored as soon as the apprenticeship contract is signed or when the BAC PRO students are enrolled. However, it is necessary to rework with families to prepare the quest for autonomy. A misadventure of this last mobility (1 mobility broken after 1 day of internship without possible negotiation with the young person and the family) makes us attentive to this part of the preparation.\r\n\r\nThe other side of our international strategy is mobility for professionals. As a reminder ; 1 \u00ab Training for staff abroad \u00bb mobility was organized in 2012 for 12 professionals from the catering sector and in 2015 for 10 early childhood professionals. In addition, there were 2 individual mobilities for 2 trainers of our school in 2016 and 1 is planned in 2018.\r\n\r\nFor 2018, we are therefore requesting the possibility of setting up a professional stay for all the employees of our MFR team to discover the cross-border region of Germany, Bavaria and especially Munich. The main purposes would be the discovery of the structure of the economy and training in this \u00ab Land \u00bb of Bavaria (see programme) as well as an immersion of 2 days in a structure. This internship part will be oragnized directly by the employees themselves. The restitution of this stay will be in the form of a team building video. We are also planning to create a kind of TV show report, which could be an excellent valuation tool.\r\n\r\nTeam building makes it possible to reinforce team cohesion, that is to say, the ability of employees to move forward together to achieve a project, with the same expectations and the same investment; but also help to develop team spirit, encourage employees to support each other in tough times, and finally to optimize the distribution of workload.\r\n\r\nRegarding the valuation aspects, we are in line with our forecasts and we succeed in communicating efficiently on the Erasmus idea. Moreover, we participated in the \u00ab Erasmus Day \u00bb in October 2017. Our institution was asked to testify mobility at the General Assembly of the \u00ab Grand Est \u00bb in April 2017 at the hemicycle of the Regional Council of Strasbourg. 8 young people were involves (annex on our latest valorization actions)\r\n\r\nDuring the intermediate evaluation of our project, however, we have redefined some parts of our strategy. Our willingness to participate in a strategic partnership is still present but we are in standby. We had been asked to join a project related to the kitchen trades, through the MFR Grand Est Consortium: a dossier that did not succeed. The creation of a partnership with a school in another country is still under construction.

Thus they find out about the realities of European markets, EU clients demands, and the percentage of persons who cannot adapt and generate negative image and perception effects  will be reduced.", "http://www.equity-point.com/", null, "erasmus_2014-1-RO01-KA102-001041_5"]]}}, "6QT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1243814400000, 1338422400000, "Water Detoxification Using Innovative vi-Nanocatalysts", "Innovative Research & Technology Ltd", "The concept of the project is based on the development of innovative nanostructured UV-Visible photocatalysts for water treatment and detoxification by using doped TiO2 nanomaterials with visible light response. The project aims at an efficient and viable water detoxification technology exploiting solar energy and recent advances in nano-engineered titania photocatalysts and nanofiltration membranes for the destruction of extremely hazardous compounds in water. To this aim, the UV-vis responding titania nanostructured photocatalysts will be stabilized on nanotubular membranes of controlled pore size and retention efficiency as well as on carbon nanotubes exploiting their high surface area and unique electron transport properties to achieve photocatalytically active nanofiltration membranes. This will be the crucial component for the fabrication of innovative continuous flow photocatalytic-disinfection-membrane reactors for the implementation of a sustainable and cost effective water treatment technology based on nanoengineered materials. Comparative evaluation of the UV-visible and solar light efficiency of the modified titania photocatalysts for water detoxification will be performed on specific target pollutants focused mainly on cyanobacterial toxin MC-LR and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) in water supplies as well as classical water pollutants such us phenols, pesticides and azo-dyes. Particular efforts will be devoted on the analysis and quantification of degradation products. The final goal is the scale up of the photocatalytic reactor technology and its application in lakes, tanks and continuous flow systems for public water distribution.", 129282.0, 2043621.0, 7, 7, "CLEAN WATER", null, "http://www.innovativert.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54561.jpg", "fp7_91019_998099931"]]}}}}
