However, socio-economic integration is difficult to achieve for a refugee and humanitarian migrant coming to Europe. In order to achieve socio-economic integration, an individual has to more than access public services, or gain entry into the Labour Market. \r\n\r\nThe Strengthening Employment, Education and Employment Skills for Integration \u2013 refugee, migrant and asylum seekers (SEESI) project will establish the frameworks and curriculum to create a role that enables first language support on key concepts of the local labour market, economic, social and civil integration whilst transitioning the individual refugee to be able to effectively access and benefit from available host country services. Socio-economic integration is a long term and holistic process, incorporating a wide range of different elements, including: refugees and humanitarian migrants application process advice; general Information, Advice and Guidance on benefits, housing and local support services; skills and education development; employment support and community engagement. Without one element in place, not only will have the socio-economic integration process have failed for the individual but it could also result in long-term instability, community isolation and general lack of social participation on a range of levels for the individual. A key reason for this failure is ultimately the language barriers that exist for refugees throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SEESI project\u2019s main objective is to resolve a fault to the socio-economic integration process through mobilising a unique 'Life(skills) before Language' (LBL) approach to the language barrier that refugees and migrants experience upon arrival in Europe. Through developing the skill-sets of \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Workers, who are often the first contact point, refugees and migrants meet in their new host country, the SEESI project aims to revolutionize the socio-economic integration process throughout Europe. The SEESI project aims to design a unique training LBL framework and curriculum which will change Support Workers role from helpful members of refugees/migrants own community into a new dynamic job role, responsible for an essential progression route for new refugees/migrants entering Europe and the local community and ultimately the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, currently provides advice and guidance to refugees and migrants, in their mother tongue language, which often provides key information to these groups. Furthermore, official Refugee Support Workers, Employment Advisers, Counsellors, Integration Advisers, as well as local municipality staff depend greatly on the work Support Workers do especially in interpreting and language support. By developing the skill-set of the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, from basic advice to targeted socio-economic integration service, the role will become more formalised, increase skill-set and will be able to offer targeted support which will ultimately support refugees and migrants integration.\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker will develop training, mentoring and teaching skill-sets alongside their wider community support role, which will ensure that refugees and humanitarian migrants also have the opportunity to develop their skills, knowledge, and wider competences from day one of entering their new host countries. This alternative strategy, Life before Language, will result in refugees and humanitarian migrants gaining the Labour Market skills they require, while learning their host countries\u2019 language on a parallel basis. Rather than the current format where a refugee and humanitarian migrant can only develop civic, social and labour market skills once they have gained a basic level of their host countries\u2019 language. This revolutionary strategy offers a fast track approach of Refugee integration and all through the development of the Support Worker role through the SEESI project.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI project will achieve this through the creation of 6 innovative intellectual outputs designed to increase the Adult Education sector\u2019s knowledge on integration issues, while formalising a unique training methodology aimed at developing the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker creating the future dynamic Refugee Support Workers.

International Monetary Fund confirms in its report from 2015 that \u201cInvesting one euro in welcoming refugees can yield nearly two euros in economic benefits within 5 years\u201d. \r\n\r\nHowever, this group is particularly vulnerable and require targeted support at the beginning. They generally arrive with weak, if any attachment or link to the host country and have gained qualifications and work experience in very different labour market conditions. On EU average, it takes between five and six years to integrate more than 50 % of humanitarian migrants into the workplace and as much as 15 years to reach a 70 % employment rate converging towards the outcomes for labour migrants (European Parliament). Long periods of inactivity also lead to demotivation and deskilling; deskilling in turns means that they could only accept low-skilled jobs, remaining trapped in a low socioeconomic cycle. This impacts on their willingness and resilience to effectively commit to their integration. Moreover, low-skilled refugees are even more negatively affected than other migrants and they are left to find their own way in societies with high labour market threshold (European Council). \r\n\r\nThe corrective action of ARIVE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 integration to boost levels of integration in communities, namely:\r\n- Lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;\r\n- Deskilling and social isolation;\r\n-Lack of working experience in the host country and peer networks at a suitable professional/ vocational level;\r\n- Language and understanding of the civic and social landscape.\r\n\r\nThe general objective of the project is to develop quality learning opportunities in order to encourage low-qualified and low-skilled humanitarian migrants to assess and upskill their competences in order to enter the labour market at early stages. This integration shall be facilitated taking into consideration the individual needs/capacities and labour market demand. \r\n\r\nTo this end the project will:\r\n\u2022 facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for integration skills assessment to enable signposting to suitable peer support groups; \r\n\u2022 transfer new qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored courses that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language and digital skills; \r\n\u2022 provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories facilitated by refugee support groups.\r\n\r\nThe target group of ARIVE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe.

Moreover, when they are granted protection, refugees often move to other countries and it is useful to have common tools and procedures for refugees\u2019 skills assessment and training methodologies.  The action is in line with the recommendations of the international community. In its \u201cNote on the integration of refugees in the European Union\u201d (2007), UNCHR states that host communities should facilitate the development of refugees\u2019 language and vocational skills and assist them in pursuing employment.

The corrective action of REVaLUE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 labour integration, namely:- lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;- deskilling;- lack of working experience in the host country;- language.Through a solid partnership, made of a combination of VET providers and migrant associations based in Italy, France, Germany, UK and Hungary, the project will:1. facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for migrants' skills assessment; 2. transfer new highly qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored VET courses, one for \u201cMigrant Service Providers\u201d and another for \u201cSocial Enterprise Manager\u201d, that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language; 3. provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories.The target group of project REVaLUE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe. Female migrants will be given special consideration, integrating a gender approach in the design and implementation of project\u2019s products. Although the beneficiaries of the action are constituted by humanitarian migrants only, the project\u2019s products will be applicable to other kinds of migrants as well.The innovative feature of REVaLUE lies in the creation of 2 VET courses that put together the best characteristics of VET teaching methodologies (use of audio-visual teaching material, work-based training) with the needs and requirements of adult education (acquisition and strengthening of basic skills) all bound together with an effective language methodology (CLIL \u2013 Content and Language Integrated Learning). This innovative combination will make an exceptionally complete learning experience for the beneficiaries and will constitute an important example for future training development. The courses, moreover, will provide training for accessing well remunerated, medium/high-skills jobs in two sectors that are generally receptive to the participation of non-native workers, creating real opportunities for the beneficiaries to escape the low socio-economic cycle in which they often find themselves. A second innovative aspect of project REVaLUE is that it creates a skills assessment tool designed to assess both informal and non-formal learning and the level of education attained in the home country. Informal and non-formal learning have to be properly assessed to determine the whole spectrum of competences and skills and to direct the person who is being assessed towards the most appropriate educational and professional pathways. However, especially in the case of humanitarian migrants, including innovative ways to assess formal learning is equally important, given that they usually lack certificates and proof of their previous studies. The tool will be designed to make it easier for refugees to describe their educational experience, and for service providers and job counsellors to assess their effective level of education.Finally, project REVaLUE will not limit itself to the creation of a skills assessment tool, but it will build on that experience to create two other products:- a CV certified by the project for all beneficiaries of the skills assessment process. To this end the REVaLUE CV will bear in the cover page a description of the project and the assessment process that led to the drafting of the CV. - The report \u201cWho migrates to Europe?

Employers are therefore strongly motivated to ensure their employees' H&S in the workplace, and an easy way for all employees to communicate urgent messages, particularly in high-risk situations, will help to do this.

(2) a database providing resources for SME managers that can assist them in employing people with disability. (3) A User Guide to assist them in navigating and applying the database (4) A curriculum for the training of mentors to support people living with disability in the workplace. (5) An e-Learning platform that can be integrated into the implementation of the mentor course. The work will follow in this order, with the work on each output informing the development of the next one. There will also be a set of learning activities that will be included in the curriculum element as an implementation of that curriculum for 12 furniture industry employees to train as mentors.The Partners will be making contact with over 100 different organisations from across the sectors where they are working and engaging with 350-450 participants in order to reach their objectives. The Participants will mainly, though not exclusively, come from the countries where a Partner is located. The participants will take part in surveys, learning activities, as well as other events. They will also be engaged with the work on the project's data-driven analysis of disability in the furniture industry, the gathering of available resources for SMEs and the development of the curriculum for the mentor training.For many SMEs, being able to have a defined strategy to deal appropriately with employees that may also have disabilities will be new. The SupportAbility Partners expect that within furniture industry SMEs, there will be a significant increase in their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in their approach to recruitment. The outputs will exist to enable SMEs to move past seeing the disability in a candidate for employment so they can engage with them as part of a team while having the confidence to deal with any special needs systemically.Beyond the project's lifetime, SupportAbility can become an example of a practical implementation of the ethical position stated within international directives like UNCRPD and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. In this context, SupportAbility can bring an increased inter-regional and transnational cooperation between public authorities in their VET commitment on behalf of supporting SMEs seeking to maximise accessibility to their world of work in all its forms.", "http://www.searchlighter.org", "BFM LIMITED", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024414_5"], [2015, "Art and Furniture Strategic Partnership", "Searchlighter Services Ltd", 262816.0, 3, 5, "Artistic quality will be crucial for the future success of furniture design.

The barriers had been divided into three categories: \r\n- Access: the physical and technological infrastructures in which the learning occurs and through which the material is presented; the availability of appropriate learning resources; the social infrastructure in which the material is presented.\r\n- Stakeholders: learners, trainers and Organizations;\r\n- Course: contents and Pedagogy\r\n\r\nConsidering this barriers' ensemble, 'Better-E' proposes tools and methodologies to diminish them, providing solutions both from a technological and a pedagogical perspectives, surely considering and empowering the necessary (and also the most fragile) stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe project Objectives are, among other:\r\n- to propose, to test and to create a user-friendly and pedagogy-centered e-Learning Platform for courses promotion;\r\n- to introduce and to incorporate e-Learning into Organizations (training provider NGOs, and other) usually not included into e-Learning practices;\r\n- to promote e-Learning as an inclusion device considering the fact that traditional Education and Training are regular social inclusion mechanisms but so far e-Learning is not;\r\n- to use e-Learning to encourage active citizenship and entrepreneurship through initiatives fostering green skills and entrepreneurial mind-sets and skills.\r\n\r\nThe Project will directly target two main groups (further applicable to an endless number and type of users): Training Provider NGOs and their targeted audiences. The philosophy sustaining it is the need to generate e-Learning best practices near Organizations into Adult Education and Training Systems but usually not into e-Learning. Engaging them into e-Learning will consequently benefit their target-groups by engaging them with the new set of social support offers available. The Project foresees the direct involvement of dozens of NGOs from the involved countries.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the scientific, pedagogical and technological scopes of the deliverables are prepared and will be applicable to the entire range of e-Learning stakeholders, namely Schools, Universities, Training Provider Companies, among other.\r\n\r\nProject promoters will engage into a Preliminary Research to upgrade the state-of-arts within their contexts (Organizations, people, policies, Countries). They will then conceive, test and launch the 'Better-E Platform', an online tool to fully conceive e-Learning courses embedded of technological solutions and pedagogical concerns. In order to test the Platform and engage final-beneficiaries (NGOs and people), the Partnership proposes the conception, testing and deliver of 2 e-Learning courses: 'Entrepreneurship', promoting active citizenship and entrepreneurship and failing social exclusion cycles, and 'Easily Moving from Learning to e-Learning', an instruction course also teaching, but not restricted to, how to use the 'Better-E' Platform. During the entire process the Partnership will be committed with Dissemination activities and internal and external incorporation activities.

From the effects of the radicalization and the extremism, to the crisis of the refugees and the asylum seekers or the discrimination of some migrant communities, the question about how to foster the social cohesion and to fight against discrimination is in the middle of the debates in an increasingly culturally diversified Europe.Religion has come to a prime site in the cultural and social conflict, but religion is only one aspect among a range of factors which make migrants and ethnic minorities appear different. Policymakers throughout Europe feel increasing pressure to adopt more effective approaches to secure inclusion but are uncertain how to bring people together to achieve this. Ensuring inclusive education for all children and young people and empowering teachers so that they are able to take an active stand against all forms of discrimination and racism, are among the recommendations made by the European Commission.Religious and moral values area highly sensitive area. The religious dimension of intercultural education and intercultural education itself require specific kinds of teaching and learning approaches. Unlike some traditional approaches to intercultural education, these methods focus not on the link between the dominant culture and minority cultures, but instead on learning to live together. Therefore, the teaching approaches must be coherent with this specific reality and requires specific methods and tools. Young people are a particularly vulnerable group. Young newcomers (refugees, asylum seekers and migrants) should also get access to intercultural education and benefit from the acquisition of social, civic and intercultural competences, independently of the educational programme in which the may be enroll. B.LIVING project aims to empower teachers and trainers to cope with religious diversity and boost intercultural education in Europe, developing a new European dimension on intercultural education in school education and VET by addressing the religious diversity inherent to our multicultural societies, from the human rights and intercultural learning perspectives.To do so, seven partner organizations (Educational authorities, Schools and VET providers, companies and social partners) from six countries (Belgium, UK, Austria, Turkey, Greece and Spain) will work together to develop B.LIVING project, in order to define common strategies to address religious diversity and intercultural education in Europe.

There is today a growing proportion of caretakers, who are of different ethnic background. It creates some challenges within a discipline where values, attitudes and communication are very important to the work environment and to the user-experience. Most European countries are lacking ways to strengthen employees' ability to manage multicultural workplaces. Furthermore, the project partners' experience that there are special circumstances in the care sector, which impedes the acquisition of new skills. Professor Dominique Bouchet from the Department of Marketing and Management at the University of Southern Denmark has for many years done research in cultural differences in workplaces, and he has developed educational material for employees in the integration sector. The material consists of videos, description of small cases and questions for group discussions etc. that supports a dialogue about the caretakers daily activities and these activities relation to more general values. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is intended that this teaching material will be the inspirational source to adapt training programmes especially dedicated for the employees in the Caresector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project's aim is to strengthen nursing staff skills in managing different value systems in so called \"Care Groups\" and also to strengthen the nursing staff ability to communicate with people, who receive Careservices. So the target group for this project is the nursing staff in nursing homes or engaged with nursing people in their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operational objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n1) Caregivers have achieved new key competences in connection with discussions of value systems in relation to their current and future needs\r\n\r\n2) Employees perceive that they have been presented with new methods employees experience that opens their readiness to learn in the future\r\n\r\n3) To adjust and evaluate new teaching methods to support improvements in formal and informal vocational education and training systems\r\n\r\n4) In general, to be better to deal with cultural differences and create a greater readiness in relation to changes in the cultural maps on their job.\r\n\r\n5) Facilitating adjustment within the care sectors vocational training through the transfer of knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n6) Improving the interaction between vocational training with learning in practice in different national contexts . \r\n\r\n7) Improve the effect in everyday work situations by putting together a curriculum with an interaction between workplace and school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium is structured so it involves a care organization and an educational institution from Germany, Italy, UK and Denmark. In addition, LederForum Denmark participates as coordinator and external facilitator of the project results. This external communication occurs through the European organization EDE, representing leaders and providers of continuing care for the elderly. This organizational form is chosen because it creates an opportunity to test the developed educational materials in four different contexts, and thus test the developed materials general applicability to the caresector.", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA202-000787_9"], [2016, "onlinE PrOfessional Development in Second chance Education", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 273834.0, 6, 8, "In 2014 the DIgital Second Chance Opportunities (DISCO) Consortium was established with support funding from Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership as digital technology and education are evolving at an increasingly rapid pace, both separately and together. For example, there have been significant developments in new digital technology platforms such as mobile technologies, cloud computing, social media, open educational resources (OERs), free and open-source software (FOSS), as well as the associated hardware (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, interactive whiteboards). Opportunities and demands of globalisation and technology are fuelling transformations of educational practices and school infrastructure quickly t. The evolution of educational systems and digital technology also provide additional challenges to framing our perspectives, including the emergence of virtual and networked schools that share courses and programmes within countries and across regions (Davis, Eickelmann & Zaka 2013). Utilising these technological advancements to support good-quality training and reflective professional development are fast becoming essential parts of a teacher\u2019s professional life. Supporting teachers in their professional development leads to improved outcomes for teachers, trainers and learners alike. In former projects many good tools were developed with great enthusiasm and piloted in the area of second chance education that supported teachers to become more confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. The tools include competence cards, quality cycles, assessment software, evaluation methods, mobility practices, teaching programmes and mentor trainings alongside a number of other tools that supports the education and employability for the NEET-group  in Europe.  In 2014 the Digital Second Chance Opportunities (DISCO) project began building the foundations of an online European infrastructure framework in second chance education. Now it is time to go a step further by moving DISCO onto the next level of development in terms of its content and service delivery.  The online European infrastructure in second chance education will be built on three pillars:1. SERVICES: under the SERVICES-umbrella existing quality tools will be made available and continuously upgraded. These quality tools are partly developed for a) quality assurance of international placements b) online community building  c) quality assurance of educational organisations and d) good practice testing.2. RESOURCES: under the RESOURCES-umbrella existing good practices/resources will be made available. Curricula, methodologies, teaser practices, studies and other tools will be provided as a \u201cpick-of-the-shelve\u201d-concept. 3. TRAININGS: under the TRAININGS-umbrella training offers and demands are connected.In E-PODS focus is put on the elements of resources and trainings in secondchanceeducation.eu. These two elements will be further developed for teachers/trainers working in second chance education.  E-PODS will be focussed on two objectives:+To promote European integration of professional development of teachers/trainers in second chance education+To set up an organic / growing database connecting tools, schools, teachers/trainers and beneficiariesFrom this perspective EPODS will be a European wide sustainable offer for teachers/trainers in second chance education. Local/national developments and networks will be integrated on a European scale offering innovation/digitalizing in further education of trainers/teachers working with NEET. EPODS will have as output and activities:1. Development of a European professional development service:2. Vitalise the online teacher/trainer community via providing e-content for teacher/trainers and webinars. 3. Development of at least 10 e-learning courses for the current professional development offers on secondeducation.eu. 4. Development of a tool to create your own e-learning courseEPODS targets three out of five objectives of the Europe2020-strategy:\u2022EU2020: 75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed (now youth unemployment over 25%): EPODS increases employment opportunities for youngsters at risk by offering e-learning tools and connecting experiences to their trainers/teachers. \u2022EU2020: Reducing school drop-out rates below 10% (now 15,3%) and at least 40% of 30-34\u2013year-olds completing third level education: EPODS invests, indirectly via teachers/trainers, in a vulnerable target group, who is at the highest risk of drop out and has the lowest chances in completing third level education.\u2022EU2020: at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion: EPODS offers concrete opportunities and develops tools for teaching and training in a community and network based integrated environment to avoid exclusion and to promote chances in the European society and labour market for NEETs.", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA204-022937_1"], [2014, "DIGITAL SECOND CHANCE OPPORTUNITIES", "Phoenix Social Enterprise Limited", 223966.0, 6, 7, "DISCO focusses on the quality improvement of second chance education, targeted at the NEET-group. The development of an online knowledge and quality centre is positioned centrally. In this centre digital assessment tools, good practices and trainings are available. In that way DISCO focusses on the quality of curricula/tools, the quality of teachers/trainers and the organizational setting in which the NEET-group education takes place.  Next to the second chance knowledge and quality centre a European online community \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently projects like EXACT, DEVOTED and LION contributed to the development of good teaching/learning practices and the development of competence based quality standards. This together with opening up of educational institutions towards employers and social service providers, made it possible to provide state-of-art opportunities for those in a disadvantaged position. Further in the guidance on the work place the projects EGUIDYA, EMYA, BEST and MOBILE were of high value to set standards that facilitate international placements and to sensitize employers and educational institutions regarding needs and opportunities on the work place.  World is changing fast: further impulses need to be given to the digital opportunities and the (European) community building in second chance education. With the (paper based) tools available and the network present, now a step is taken to fully digitalize the previous (quality) efforts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVia a state-of-the-art European wide online platform for second chance education a knowledge and quality centre will be built. In this knowledge centre all experience and expertise is bundled gathered from previous projects and updated to online available tools to invest in trainers, teachers and beneficiaries themselves on a European level. The developed tools (user-driven, online grading system for good practices; self- and peer-assessment system for organisations; tailor-made e-portfolio tool for (international) placements; self-assessment tool for teachers/trainers) will created the opportunity to think and act bordeless in European second chance education and upgrade national development to a European, transversal, setting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the development of the online knowledge and quality centre it is important that those involved in (the development of) training and taching processes contribute themselves and share ideas, knowledge and experiences. An online and offline European community of teachers/trainers in second chance education is targeted. In this community teachers and trainers can share, discuss, develop and value their  practices and ideas. In this way a bottom-up movement is started based on social network activity and user involvement.  The continuous  education of teachers and trainers is fostered making all teacher trainings in the second chance netwerk visible (connecting supply and demand) and by exploring good practices for joint (European) curriculum design and international guest lectures. In this way DISCO will impact beneficiaries of the NEET-group, the organizational/educational settings involved and the trainers/teachers active: local expertise and experiences will be transferred to open digital European quality tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCO targets three out of five objectives of the Europe2020-strategy:\r\n\r\n\u2022 In terms of employment (EU2020: 75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed (now youth unemployment over 25%) increases employment opportunities for youngsters at risk by offering them international work experience and making it possible to evidence this experience digitally. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Looking at education (EU2020: Reducing school drop-out rates below 10%  (now 15,3%) and at least 40% of 30-34\u2013year-olds completing third level education) DISCO invests in a vulnerable target group, who is at the highest risk of drop out and has the lowest chances in completing third level education.\r\n\r\n\u2022 In fighting poverty and social exclusion ((EU2020: at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion) LION offers concrete opportunities and develops tools for teaching and training in a community and network based integrated environment to avoid exclusion and to promote their chances in the European society and labour market.", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA204-001549_4"], [2017, "European Driver  Education in Road Safety", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 178990.0, 6, 7, "The ability to drive is an aspiration of most young people. It is a skill that not only enhances our social lives but also impacts on our employability either as a direct route into jobs e.g. distribution and logistics or by opening up opportunities to a wider job market through accessibility. To be able to drive legally and safely makes you more employable.  However young drivers typically represent between 18% and 30% of all killed drivers, although people in the same age group only represent between 9% and 13% of the total populations in their countries. Traffic crashes are the single greatest killer of 15-24 year-olds in OECD countries and within European countries, among 15-24 year olds, the majority of road fatalities are car occupants (59%) or motorcyclists (19%. Young drivers pose a greater risk than other drivers to themselves, their passengers and other road users, socially and economically excluded young people being highly represented in accident statistics.  Research has indicated that inexperienced drivers, particularly  young male drivers, tend to fall into the category of high risk threshold drivers. These drivers tend to have a particular set of attitudes that are associated with their lifestyles and driving culture. Risk taking  is  perceived  as  a normal part of driving as young people  tend  to  have  higher  sensation  seeking tendencies. This all has a huge economic and social cost on societies\r\n Improving traffic safety and reducing crashes and resulting deaths and injuries is a fundamental objective of the E-DRIVERS project as it aims to address the high levels of young driver risk by taking into account some of the highly complex root causes of the problem which include inexperience, age, gender , physiological and emotional development, personality, social norms and individuals\u2019 socio-economic circumstances. The E-DRIVERS  project will address risky behaviours of young drivers and pre-drivers through needs analysis, peer to peer learning and training programmes.\r\nE-DRIVERS will develop a  learner education and training programme using e-learning and new technologies (e-platform and i- phone application)  and providing  training for interventionists such as teachers, trainers, youth workers, probation officers- people who are not road safety experts but have direct access to the target group. 3 international training events will pilot and test the train the trainers programme , preparing the interventionists to deliver the learner training programme. E-Drivers will produce a trainer handbook, as repository of learning resources and a Handbook of Good Practices for policy makers and those responsible for road safety, community safety, police and justice systems at local and regional level. It is expected that the E-DRIVERS project will impact at 3 levels:\r\n1. on behaviour and attitude of young drivers and pre-drivers\r\n2. on the actions of interventionists who are working with young people, either those at risk of demonstrating risky behaviour, or those convicted of offending behaviour.\r\n3. on organisations at local and regional level which are responsible for road safety\r\nLong term benefits will be that organisations which are responsible for road safety, health and welfare and law and justice  will have an additional countermeasure to risky behaviour in their portfolio. E-DRIVERS is prevention(pre-driver), intervention (learner driver)  and curative (Convicted offender driver)measure, expanding the service offer of local and regional authorities to the local community at the same time as saving money on dealing with road accidents (police, ambulance, fire services etc).", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA204-035240_1"], [2017, "TIP - \"Transferring Innovative Practices in 2nd chance education addressing ELET\u201d", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 120109.0, 5, 6, "TIP - \u201dtransferring innovative practices in 2nd chance education addressing ELET\u201d is a strategical partnership project aiming to establish a practical learning partnership, as an open collaborative environment, between organizations and practitioners (artists, youth workers, trainers, social workers) active in social and educational work from 5 different European countries, developing processes of networking creative practices in second chance education and social inclusion work. With this partnership we want to share experience and knowledge, exploring the potential of non formal approaches in education, specially addressing young ELET (Early Leavers from Education and Training) and NEET (Not in Employment, Education and Training) but also connecting different target groups, disadvantaged low qualified youngsters and young graduates ready to integrate social and educational working places, both groups being mutually beneficial, both struggling for their first experiences for social and professional integration.\r\nThe partnership will furthermore improve the quality and attractiveness of partners\u2019 activities, developing along the 2 years of the project, a common strategy to create and deliver relevant and usable products that can help teachers and other professionals to extend their professional capacities and to engage as active agents of change in their educational settings. The 3 intellectual outputs that will be developed, a school-based staff training program, a toolkit of non formal creative practices and a documentary story telling film will be implemented concurrently in the participating schools, providing the necessary support for the introduction of these innovative practices through reflective supervisions with experienced trainers, most of them during the international mobility activities.\r\nThe innovative practices that prove their potential and efficiency in social educational work addressing early leaving of education and training and attracting adults back to education will than become available and easy accessible through the project communication tools, including a dedicated webpage.\r\nThe project will promote the public awareness on the importance of non formal alternative approaches in social and educational work, addressing marginalized groups, through public seminars and trainings in different countries as well as a web interactive virtual platform for sharing and dissemination of results.

It includes one international mobility - a Training Course for youth workers, trainers, project managers and youth leaders - from 16 organizations from 10 European countries, an event with local stakeholders organized as part of the training and a one local event with youngsters per involved community which will take place after the training course. The overall aim of the project is to promote participatory democracy through community building and civic initiative.\r\n\r\nThe project organized from June 24 until July 3 and will involve 34 youth workers, trainers, project managers and youth leaders coming who will represent 16 organizations from 10 European countries. It will be held in Epirus, in the remote village of Skoulikaria of the municipality Georgios Karaiskakis. The competition for a social campaign will be organized in the city of Arta and will include 50 local stateholders (policy makers, local media, NGOs, youngsters). Regarding local events, each session will involve 15-20 youngsters aged 15-25 years old.\r\n\r\nThe project stems from Inter Alia\u2019s continuous problematization about the future of participatory democracy in Europe and the role of youth in shaping it. It sets off from the observed inconsistency between the international reputation of EU countries with regards to the quality of democratic institutions (Democracy Index, 2016) and their apparent incapacity to uphold the values that have made these institutions effective and popular in the first place (more recently manifested in the face of the economic and refugee crises). Ongoing challenges such as recession, unemployment, extremism and xenophobia are seen as by-products of Europe\u2019s derailment from its constitutional values. Those challenges cannot be sustainably addressed by mere compliance with rules imposed from the top-down but necessarily through the demand of citizens for fairer, more inclusive and democratic, societies.\r\n\r\nThe role of youth work and youth workers in the process of augmenting, canalizing and communicating this demand constitutes the main concern driving FOLLOW THROUGH. The aim is to enhance the role of youth work in fostering local level solutions to pan-European challenges of democracy and collective action. More specifically, FOLLOW THROUGH aspires to provide youth workers with new, effective and up-to-date tools for inducing trust of youth in EU values. The emphasis will be placed on ways for enhancing leadership skills of youngsters for promoting social change through community building. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW THROUGH TC will make use of diverse non-formal learning tools including experiential learning, cooperative learning, peer learning, outdoor activities. Particular emphasis will be given to the activity \"Adventure in the Woods\" which was successfully introduced during Inter Alia's TC \"Game of Challenges\" in May 2015. The aim of the \"adventure\" is to facilitate the creation of a community able to cooperate and act collectively. It foresees that participants will be led to the woods in the rough terrain of Epirus  and then, unwarned, will be left alone. For surviving this challenge, they will need to build a community and show leadership skills. Then, they will share their experience as part of a collective learning procedure. Regarding the planning  of civic initiatives, participants will work in teams and will use the project cycle management method. During the local events in partner communities, youngsters will use brainstorming for coming up with potential areas of intervention and use team work and peer learning for building their idea and presenting it to the rest of the group.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to impact on participants and target groups both practically and conceptually. While the project aims at developing manifold skills of participants (section E.2), it also expects to contribute in shaping a shared conceptual framework for democracy and collective action in Europe. Specifically, youth workers involved in the training course will have the opportunity to develop their skills and broaden their area of expertise while putting their existing experience and new skills to effective use through the local events. FOLLOW THROUGH is designed and developed in order to have an immediate effect on involved communities through the development of partner organizations' knowhow and to cause a multiple impact on European and international levels through the dynamics of the network. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW THROUGH aspires to promote cross-sectoral contact by involving local stakeholders (policy makers, youngsters, youth professionals from formal and non-formal education) in a competition for social campaigning organized during the training course. In this way, the local population will benefit from the cognitive outcomes of the project while the involved youth workers will get a real life experience of negotiating an idea for social action.", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2016-3-EL02-KA105-002857_6"], [2017, "Alianco: Conocimientos Competitivos", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 16110.0, 5, 5, "Our project will be developed in Ciudad Real, where the organizing entity (Cocemfe Oretania) is located.\r\nCocemfe Oretania is a Non-Governmental Non-Profit Organization whose objective is to bring together, strengthen, train and coordinate the efforts and activities of provincial entities and associations that work for people with disabilities to defend their rights and improve their quality of life.\r\nWith more than 20 years of experience collaborating in projects of employment integration, training, leisure and inclusive sport, etcetera; we seek to continue expanding our knowledge in order to provide a better quality of service to our users.\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n-> Improve our capacities as an entity to enhance our improvement, offering a service in favor of the social equality by offering an improved service, with extended  knowledge and contrasted with other entities in the European Union.\r\n-> To offer our users the opportunity to improve, to eliminate the obstacles that are presented to them at a cultural and formative level, which in turn are reflected in a context that is economically and socially disadvantaged.\r\nThese will be done through:\r\n-An analysis of our weaknesses and strengths in our areas of work: employment integration, training, health care and inclusive leisure.\r\n-An analysis of the search for solutions to the problems faced by people at risk of social exclusion at an international level.\r\nAs the first project at European level that we present, we want to carry out a small collaboration between five countries of the European Union.\r\nWe will have the participation of five entities from different countries, thus promoting intercultural exchange between different entities of the European Union.
