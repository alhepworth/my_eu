All three participants are seeking to gain full registration in Spanish with the GTCS by completing the residency requirement. The LFEE course is fully recognised by the GTCS.\r\n\r\nThe three teachers will be training in language and methodology to allow the expansion of language provision in the school in line with the Scottish Government's 1+2 Languages directive. The objectives of the project are meeting the directives of the national policy on languages, developing the European dimension within the school and enhancing the teaching and learning of Modern Languages.\r\n\r\nThree members of staff are applying for the course and the associated funding (Andrew McCulloch, Tim Tuckley, Claire Robertson). All three staff members have completed at least two years of the Certificate of Continuing Education (Spanish) at the University of Strathclyde. Completing a three week residency in Spain will allow all three staff members to teach Spanish at the school, thus enhancing the school's 1+2 languages provision. In addition, the three members of staff could be involved in training primary teachers in how to deliver Spanish at primary level, thus ensuring that more people benefit from the course (including young learners at the forefront of the new 1+2 approach).\r\n\r\nThe participants will attend intensive lessons in Spanish language and will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the culture and traditions of the country. They will engage in professional dialogue with course leaders and other participants and will develop new resources to use upon their return.\r\n\r\nThe participants can expect to gain greater confidence and skill in the delivery of the Spanish curriculum. All new resources will be shared with departmental colleagues, the wider school and Local Authority. Pupils will benefit from the experience and resources acquired during this project. After attending the course, the participants will apply for full registration in Spanish with the GTCS.

This will in turn increase staff motivation and therefore encourage and motivate pupils into lifelong language learning, a key principal of the Scottish government\u2019s 1+2 initiative. \r\nIn order to further promote a European dimension within the school, the participant will be able to make contacts from different countries which will allow her set up projects such as e-twinning, so that the pupils will have the chance to put their language skills into practice in a real life context. The course may also be able to lead to introducing a Spanish residential, and to forge links with a Spanish school as there is not one in place at the moment at the school and it is something the Modern Languages department is very keen to do. \r\nThe participant will share ideas and methodologies that they have learned from the course with the rest of their department and also show how these can be used to raise attainment and increase the number of pupils choosing Spanish in their options. These ideas and methodologies will also be shared with cluster primary schools in order to better implement the 1+2 initiative and improve primary teachers\u2019 ability and confidence in teaching Spanish and French to different year groups in their school. \r\nThe overall aim is to improve the teaching and learning of Spanish within my school, increase motivation within the pupils, and encourage lifelong language learning.", "http://www.portobellohighschool.org.uk", "Portobello High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047179_coordinator"]]}}, "2PY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Partnership seminar \"Erasmus in Action\"", "U-GO", 11852.0, 13, 13, "Project \"Erasmus in Action\" will be a 5 day (2th to 6th October 2014) partnership leading seminar organised for 28 youth workers from 13 countries in Estonia by NGO HeadEst with a mission to enhance the overall capability of youth organisations and to increase the professional competences, personal motivation and satisfaction of youth workers.\r\n\r\nSeminar will focus on sharing, disseminating and exploiting good practices of experienced youth workers by bringing together quality organisations which as a \"side-effect\" enables reinforcing existent partnerships and building new ones.

Our project is based on our involvement in studies participating in EU funded projects, i.e. GEHA, IDEAL, Mark-Age, ENGAGE and EuroSpan. In these consortia the primary goal is to identify molecular profiles that monitor and explain complex traits with novel findings so far. Support for methodological development is missing. The state-of-the-art methodology does not match by far the complexity of the biological problem. Complex data are being analysed in a rather simple way which misses the opportunity to uncover combinations of predictive profiles among the omics data.\nThe objectives of MIMOmics are: to develop a statistical framework of methods for all analysis steps needed for identifying and interpreting omics-based biomarkers; and to integrate  data derived from multiple omics platforms across several study designs and populations. Specific steps include: experimental design; pipelines for data gathering; cleaning of noisy spectra; predictive modeling of biomarkers; meta analysis; and causality assessment. To enhance our understanding, systems approaches will be considered for pathways and structural modelling of biological networks. The major challenge in the joint analysis of omics datasets will be to develop methods that deal with the high dimensionality, noisy spectral data, heterogeneity, and structure of these datasets.\nTo perform these tasks successfully we bring together established EU academic and industrial researchers in metabolomics, glycomics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, scientific computing and epidemiology, with complementary expertise. A key feature of our project is the validation of novel methodology by performing a proof of principle (Metabolic Health) .

However, the ultimate hope to use all this information for personalized medicine, that is to tailor medical treatment to the needs of an individual, remains largely unfulfilled.\nTo turn the vision of personalized medicine into reality, many methodological problems remain to be solved: there is a lack of methods that allow us to gain a causal understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, including gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Similarly, there is an urgent need for integration of the heterogeneous patient data currently available, for improved and robust biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy outcome prediction.\nThe field of machine learning, which tries to detect patterns, rules and statistical dependencies in large datasets, has also witnessed dramatic progress over the last decade and has had a profound impact on the Internet. Amongst others, advanced methods for high-dimensional feature selection, causality inference, and data integration have been developed or are topics of current research. These techniques address many of the key methodological challenges that personalized medicine faces today and keep it from rising to the next level.\n\nDespite this rich potential of machine learning in personalized medicine, its impact on data-driven medicine remains low, due to a lack of experts with knowledge in both machine learning and in statistical genetics.
