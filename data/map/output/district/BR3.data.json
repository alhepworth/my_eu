Sport is increasingly seen as a powerful tool to combat some of the major challenges facing society yet it is still under-developed. It needs to change from a sector that has been fragmented and with systems that vary from country to country depending on the history and culture of those countries. At the heart of this change lie the sport federations, which provide the rules and structure for the governance and development of their sports, the thousands of non-profit sports clubs and the grassroots sport movement.\r\nWithin these sport organisations, the administrators in middle management roles are under particular pressure. They have the responsibility to translate the overall strategy of the organisation into action,  to turn the ambitions of the sport into real programmes that will attract more participants and bring success., to apply vital policies for good governance and to ensure the integrity of sport are in their hands to deliver. But, what skills do they need? Do they have access to appropriate training for these new challenges? The project will tackle these key issues.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT LINKS WITH EU POLICIES AND PRIORITIES\r\nThe project aims to enable the sector to contribute effectively to key priorities in EU policy that are aimed at creating jobs, improving health, promoting social inclusion, re-generating the economy and improving sport itself. In addition, the project uses an approach totally in line with EU education reform enabling the sector to create and deliver training and qualifications that meet an agreed employment and skills need and to link to the EQF and ECVET by delivering a new learning outcome based approach.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT USES AN INNOVATIVE AND PROVEN METHODOLOGY\r\nThe innovative 7 Step Model, developed by EOSE in a previous EU funded project, will be used to analyse the role and functions performed by sports administrators (paid and unpaid) in sports organisations across Europe and to define the knowledge, skills and competencies and the training needed for them to be effective in those roles.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT WILL CREATE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING \u201cCURRICULUM\u201d FOR SPORTS ADMINISTRATORS\r\nUsing the Model, a framework of training will be created based on the real skill needs of Sports Administrators to support their on-going training and development.\r\nNo such analysis has been attempted before at a European level for sports administrators. The outcome will be an agreed definition of the role and competences of the administrators which will act as a specification for the modular training to be developed and piloted as an exemplar during the project.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE REAL IMPACT AND LEGACY\r\nThis framework has huge potential to encourage and support learning and employment mobility for the administrators and to put transparency into qualifications developed in different countries and sports but to the same template (the common agreed standards in the framework) and linked to EQF and ECVET. It is aimed at an occupation at the centre of the future growth and development of sport and can therefore have real impact on the real world of sport\u2026 potentially impacting a growing sector (over 800,000 full time employees and 35 million volunteers in the EU) and in fine the life of the EU citizens.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT IS BUILT ON A STRONG PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe Project Partnership is strong, involving 12 partners from 10 countries: 8 national organisations and 4 pan-European Associations (EFCS, EOSE, ISCA and Tennis Europe). Each partner has strong national links with, and experience of, the sport sector. They include the members from EOSE, who are trained and experienced in the 7 Step Model methodology that will be used in the project.\r\nThe strength of the consultation to be carried out by the Partners will be key to success.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT IS BASED ON SOUND MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL\r\nFinally, the S2A Project is led by EOSE, an experienced project management organisation (Lifelong Learning Programme at European and National level (through its members) and on direct commission from the DGEAC, Sport Unit) and a respected adviser to the European Commission Expert Groups on sport. The application is supported by 3 key documents \u2013 a detailed Gantt chart, a Quality Management Plan and a Valorisation strategy.
