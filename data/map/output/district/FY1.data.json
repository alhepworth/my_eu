Across Europe traditional youth work arenas and practices are changing due to a variety of economic and political circumstances. \r\nThe main aim of Acting UP! is to explore theatre as an opportunity for youth participation and a vehicle for political change, while building a platform for networking, exchange of practice and identifying and understanding the opportunities for political theatre in working with young people. It will be realised through the implementation of two distinct activities. \r\nObjectives - CMS/Study Visit, for total 30 participants, duration 7 days (including travel) in The Netherlands:\r\nTo network locally, nationally and internationally with other practitioners working with young people through theatre and performance.\r\nTo experience a range of theatre and performance and collaboratively explore the opportunities for youth participation.\r\nA greater understanding of the cultural differences of youth participation and theatre approaches when working with young people. \r\nBegin to understand the political context and opportunities for using theatre as a tool for participation. \r\nObjectives - Training Course, for total 30 participants, duration 7 days (including travel) in The Netherlands: \r\nTo better understand political theatre and performance, techniques and practice.\r\nTo experience political theatre and performance methodologies and tools.\r\nTo share political theatre and performance practice and experiences with each other.\r\nTo better understand the benefits of youth theatre and performance as an opportunity for political education and awareness.\r\nTo identify collaborative opportunities within the framework of Erasmus+\r\nTo identify opportunities for practice development of political theatre and youth participation.\r\nThirty participants from six different countries with each partner organisation sending five participants. \r\nFor the Contact Making Seminar/Study Visit we will be looking to engage theatre group coordinators and project managers and for the training we see it being more focussed and beneficial to those working directly with young people. Methodologies will include group work, practical experiences, action research, team building, experiential learning and reflection and partner building approaches through getting to know each other and all based on the principles of non-formal education. \r\nA variety of results and impacts are expected and these range from the direct benefits for the participants gaining an increased knowledge and awareness of theatre practice to the local and international networks expected to grow from this project.

In preparing the final report and analysing the evaluation, interest and a commitment emerged for this network to continue, for us to build on the activities and learning that had started. Themes like quality, trust between partners, mutual support, shared values, working on concrete opportunities together and evaluating impact featured regularly. Partners confirmed the intention to continue to grow together, to strengthen the network and for existing and new collaborations to flourish.  Q.U.E.S.T. stands for Quality, Understanding, Evaluation, Support, Trust in E.V.S. Our partnership has considered the purpose of EVS and needs, aspirations and interests of young people and agree that this approach should be supported wherever possible, and so the network would not restrict or reduce the possibilities but focus on the network being a resource working towards improving quality and the EVS experience.\r\nThe Partners involved are actors in the EVS arena as Sending Hosting or Coordinating Organistions, as well as Supervisors, Mentors, Trainers and Facilitators.

From building a strong partnership, understanding the EVS concept and its importance and to improve the capacity of practical realisation of EVS projects in the frames of Erasmus+, until the support that mentors can provide to volunteers, is long process and with the activities planned we are sure that we can make it as safe as possible for the participants learning.

The ability to cope in a crisis, and someone with diplomatic skills is also beneficial as is a high degree of independence and the ability to thrive on responsibility.\r\n\r\nTheir volunteering experience will take place across both our sites - the day centre drop in and the night shelter for crisis accommodation.

For the participants the impacts include an increase in knowledge and key competencies, enhanced employability and career prospects and a greater cultural awareness and understanding of social inclusion issues.  For the partners, there is the benefits of improved youth work practice taking on board European approaches, a greater understanding of EU policy and practices and recognition of the importance of cultural diversity.  For our own youth homeless target group this project is an effective way of challenging any stereotypes and potentially discriminatory views they may have, providing them with an insight into other cultures and subsequently a means of raising their aspirations.", "http://www.wearestreetlife.org", "The Streetlife Trust Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA105-012433_coordinator"]]}}}}
