The tension is rising in the youngsters (especially the ones with less opportunities) and the inherent difficulties that youth organisations, youth workers, educators and trainers face in dealing with this. These subjects were considered priority by the partners and the idea of creating and developing boardgames that could help and provide a practical tool of education on these matters, raised leading to the creation of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objectives are:\r\n\r\n- create and develop pedagogical tools around the topics of financial literacy and around conflict resolution. Both pedagogical tools aim to be tailored specifically for young people with fewer opportunities. These pedagogical tools need to have following characteristics: durable, attractive and inviting, easy adaptable to specific characteristics of the target group, multi-purpose use.\r\n\r\n- provide tools for organizations to develop in the youth field and education\r\n\r\n- create 10 exemplars of the pedagogical tools for each partner, in order to use this in their local established networks. These networks include youth associations, schools, informal groups and local authorities.\r\n\r\n- train the organizations staff to be able to develop and implement the pedagogical exercises at local, national and international level, in order to guarantee quality use of the tools in perspective of a most effective and efficient implementation of both. \r\n\r\n- dissemination of both tools in order to promote also further recognition of non formal education, as complementary to formal education.\r\n\r\n- create an opportunity for employment for people that will manually produce the materials for both pedagogical tools\r\n\r\n- contribute to an increased employability for the groups targeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the project we will have 20 people at full time working on the development of the objectives and outputs, , being half staff from youth organisations and other half youngsters with fewer opportunities. Indirectly we count with around 100 other youngsters and staff that will cooperate and bennefit with this project.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be primarily the non-formal education, especially due to the fact that tools in this area will be created and developed. It will happen 3 transnational meetings, local activities, open conference for presentation of the outputs, sessions of facilitation of the educational games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impact expected will be  the involvement of the local community trhough the promotion of the project and the outputs; raise the awareness of non-formal educativo in schools, youth organizations, educators, trainers, youthworkers and teachers (though the promotion of the project, sessions in institutions and organizations, open conference); better connection with the local youngsters. Raise awareness of non-formal education and educational boardgames as tools, trough sessions of facilitation of the games, website, youtube, facebook page, newsletters and personal contacts. Strengthen the relationships with other organizations and institutions, promoting the project and it's outcomes and providing support to develop new games. Share educational resources that can be used by other organizations and institutions, strengthen the relationships between european and international organizations, empower others to create and develop new tools of non-formal education, better recognition of non-formal education and it's importance, spreading the values and methods in Europe for other countries (some partners have professional relationships with other countries in the world and will share their outcomes).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a long term bennefits will be reached by the development of sessions of facilitation of the game to give the best use to this output and in the same way gather support and funding to develop new kits and other. Even that the facilitations should guarantee the access to all, sometimes they can have a participation fee or financial support of entities and companies, having in this way a method to increase the financial resources for the development of other kits and tools. The involvement of the youngsters will be vital to the sustainability of this project, in the way that they can be empowered to develop themselves the next kits (all materials are handmade). \r\n\r\nAll participants in the project and in the dissemination and follow up activities will have a personal impact that can raise their knowledge and experience in economic/financial literacy and conflict resolution.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO02-KA205-000069_5"]]}}, "5PL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Inklusion und Diversit\u00e4t in der fr\u00fchkindlichen Bildung in Europa", "Selhurst Children's Centre", 52453.0, 5, 8, "The programme comprises a work placement with the European partners.

By considering these similarities in artistic processes as a starting point for new performances, participants will be able to develop a better understanding of expressive visual language and how observations and discussions can be melodized and developed through work in the studio and be exchanged across performing arts disciplines.The project will bring young people from the United Kingdom, Holland, Germany and Cayman Islands together with the aim of building their capacity to use the performing arts as a tool for building individual confidence, encourage cross cultural learning and interaction and building bridges of friendship and partnership across four countries within the contexts of a united global village.
