This approach of innovative learning of mathematics is a development of the ideas and beliefs of Professor Sugata Mitra of Newcastle University. Sugata Mitra showed by experiment in India that if motivated and suitably led pupils will in effect teach themselves. His 2013 TED talk showed his success and won first prize. During the 2015 British Council eTwinning Conference Sugata Mitra explained his ideas and beliefs by Video Conference and this Project results for that Video Conference. \r\n\r\nSixteen schools will take part in the Project, five in Glasgow, six in Valencia and five in Warsaw. Over the three years of the Project 486 Activities will take place in all 30 classrooms directly effecting over 3000 pupils. Glasgow will lead the Project.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Activities of the Project is to work in groups to answer a \"big question\" derived from the maths curriculum being taught. The teacher does not teach but helps the pupils with their SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment)    \r\nThe key competencies addressed by this Project include: teamwork, responsibility, commitment, motivation, decision making, communication, leadership, digital skills. \r\nThey will have to communicate and present their findings using digital technology to pupils in other countries.\r\nThe Project is entrepreneurial and develops self confidence and belief. \r\nThe acquisition of the above skills will make the participating pupils more employable, increasing their ability to make a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nThe \"big questions\" used in the activities of the Project will address  the mathematics curriculum requirements and specific Learning Outcomes. In this way the teacher will be able to measure the true impact and effectiveness of the Activities on  attainment during the evaluation process.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that the teaching of mathematics is still very traditional in the three cities of this Project.  The common practice is for teachers to stand at the front of the class and teach, then for the pupils to work. The pupils are fed knowledge and understanding and are then asked to use it. This project involves the pupils finding it out by and for themselves by employing critical thinking and using social skills. This innovative method of teaching mathematics can be considered open and in this digital age is dependent for its success on pupils fully using the internet to acquire knowledge and understanding and using social media to communicate and disseminate findings and conclusions.", null, "Glasgow City Council Education Services", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036777_3"], [2017, "LARP - Fantasy and adventure in Swedish nature #3", "Royston Youth Action", 49896.0, 13, 13, "H\u00e4stekasen Farm Association is in the process to found a self sustainable eco-community and learning centre.

(1 participants) (44 days)\r\n- A short EVS helping preparing an edu-LARP (10 participants) (10 countries) (34 days)\r\n- A Youth Exchange, involving 13 organizations. (56 participants) (8 countries) (12 days)\r\n\r\nThese activities will merge into and support each other.\r\n\r\nWe have become more convinced about the strength in Edu-Larp (fantasy, acting, storytelling) as an non-formal learning method. How it affects: team building, motivation, intercultural understanding and personal development. We created a lot of self confidence and strong emotions in previous YE.\r\nThis project has also proven to strengthen and widen our network quite radically, it has an impact and more and more people want to hear about it. It has also proven to have a local impact. We have made many new contacts due to this project. Also this project has a budget that is mainly spent locally and thus empowering the countryside and what we call \"ruralisation\".\r\n\r\nLarp means, \"live action role playing game\", in this case we create a fantasy \"Lord of the rings world\". This will be prepared in workshops such as:  Acting, Scout skills, Safety, Sewing, Building shelters, Rythm and music, Mythology of the world,  Simple handicraft, Moving in nature, Reflection time.\r\n\r\nThe Short EVS will arrive earlier preparing for the Youth exchange focusing on practical building and nature/camping skills.\r\nThe Job Shadow will be part of the whole project (arriving before the main activities) focusing on studying/evaluating quality management, and also working on possible future projects.\r\n\r\nWe will according to the Nordic larp tradition focus on inclusion. A tradition of \"seeing\" each other, reacting to each others initiatives within the game. An attitude that can spread into our social interactions also outside the acting part of the activities.\r\n\r\nEvery activity  will be linked to many of the key competences through the youth pass. One added competence to be explored is imagination. Not as a passive consumer of pop-culture, but as co-creator in a group. Bringing shared experience of historical events and fictional characters into real life. After the workshops the participants are both actors and audience in a spectacle that goes on for days - day and night. An adventure in Swedish nature in a fantasy world based on Viking fairy tales.  Imagination is a skill that can be trained and that is not only linked to entertainment or culture - it is a part of creative abstract scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about this project. There is an unknown factor we look forward to explore together with the youth. This is about creating a \"social game\" based on imagination where \"anything can happen\". The soft factors are: nature, weather and the participants personalities. \r\n\r\nWe believe youth need to be adventurous, even to the border of chaos. It is our role as adults to create safe venues for youth to be able to release energy and lust.  As youth leaders we need to explore new attracting ways of channeling hyperactivity, depression, frustration and teenage hormones - into something constructive  and positive.\r\n\r\nThe social skills that we want to explore is:\r\n- Self awareness.\r\n- Functioning in a multi cultural group.\r\n- Methods of decision making (discussion and votes).\r\n- Methods of learning, practical as well as social methods.\r\n- Leadership skills.\r\n- Storytelling, writing and verbal skills.\r\n\r\nWe would like to stress the activities concept of inclusion beyond language. Youth of the world share this imaginary world of fantasy (mostly known for \"The lord of the rings\"). Sharing interest and using imagination to create a world together is very powerful. The level of non formal learning will be high. On the surface we are playing a social game, where the participants together control the outcome - while we are developing the skills mentioned above.\r\nSo we will mix many groups, many cultures, many ages, many nationalities, many languages and with the power of imagination we will unify them in a fairy tale tale adventure in Swedish nature. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop the concept to its full potential and this time spend more focus on the participants \"ownership\" of the activities and on dissemination.\r\n\r\nSince we joined the Erasmus program in 2012, our association have tried to challenge ourselves by choosing new approaches to our main theme - using natures resources in a sustainable way.", "http://www.roystonyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-SE02-KA105-001957_9"], [2017, "Health and Equity for Europe", "Royston Youth Action", 29193.0, 5, 5, "Royston Youth Action (RYA) exists to enable young people from disadvantaged communities to broaden their horizons and to increase and develop their life aspirations.

The step up to hosting an international youth exchange is a natural progression and links to our organisational planning following attendance on numerous \"fact finding\" Youth in Action and Erasmus Plus programmes. The objectives of the project are; to offer a chance to young people with fewer opportunities aged 13 - 15 years from a diverse group of EU countries to come together to form new friendships; to learn about different peoples and cultures; to understand the benefits of healthy lifestyle, sport and exercise; to understand the part the EU plays in their lives and what part they may play in the future of the EU; to plan ahead to continue and improve upon the initial exchange experience and to grow the bonds between the respective organisations. These objectives link to those of the Erasmus + programme and specifically KA1 Youth Mobility by concentrating on young people with fewer opportunities highlighting social inclusion, by promoting active European citizenship through volunteering in particular, by embedding intercultural dialogue throughout the whole process and by \"internationalising\" an organisation that can only benefit and go from strength to strength as well as supporting priorities around healthy behaviours and healthy lifestyle.The exchange will be for 50 young people supported by 15 group leaders and support staff.  A lack of opportunities in general is the biggest problem facing the young people we and our partners work with, and becoming more international is part of the solution, so we are giving young people an opportunity to understand this and a motivation to start a \"European journey\" in their lives.

His experiment showed that if children are motivated and given the tools they will teach themselves and each other. This project results from discussions following Sugata Mitras video presentation and is to answer the question about how Sugata Mitras methods can be effectively adopted and applied in the mathematics, physics and biology classrooms.              Objectives: Sugata Mitras method of \"teaching\" is a significant move away from traditional classroom teaching. It asks the students to \"teach\" themselves. The ambition of this project is for teachers of Maths, Physics and Biology in the three schools involved to end up teaching as, or as close as possible to, the way Sugata Mitra envisaged in his Ted Talk and for these teaching methods to spread out from the classrooms in each of the three partner countries.  (A simple example of a child driven lesson would be to show the students a video clip of a Water Tank being filled up with a hose and simply asking how long it will take to fill up.) With this type of teaching the teacher acts as an adviser, coach, director, mentor, motivator.  It is believed that this student driven approach to teaching results in higher engagement of students in their education, resulting in better attainment and more mature and self confident individuals who are better prepared for the world of work and who can make a better contribution to their community and society after school.   Number and profile of participants: Three schools involved. Szkola Da Vinci on Poznan, Poland, Sagrada Familia in El Masnou, Catalonia, and Saint Roch's Secondary in Glasgow, Scotland. Students aged 12-15 will be directly involved. Eleven teachers will be directly involved.    Description of activities: Student activities will take place in the mathematics, physics and biology classrooms of the three schools. twice per year. Once before Christmas and once after Christmas. These activities will be for students to learn topics, which would be part of the curriculum and taught anyway, using the new innovative Sugata Mitra method, with the guidance and coaching of the teachers. As the project develops from activity to activity, over the three years, the  level of competence and sophistication will develop. By the end of the three years teaching in this new method should be integral to the schools and an accepted and normal way of teaching. The milestones of the project are the international student activities that take place in January of each year. In these activities students from the three schools will come together. They will receive team training then hold a  mini conference and workshops, giving presentations and discussing progress and develop their thoughts on how they should move forward.         Methodology use: At the start of the project the teachers of all schools will hold a three day meeting. Day1 will start with team training followed by learning Sugata Mitras methodology, receiving a presentation from a specialist, then discussion groups. Day 2 will be to practice implementing and using the new methodology in the classroom and giving and doing practice lessons. Day 3 will be to choose topics for activities in each subject. to prepare proforma reports, evaluations and lesson plans and for setting up eTwinning and Facebook. The teachers in each subject will be responsible for the content of the new student activities, staying with the Time table and ensuring completion of evaluations, reports and lesson plans. Coordinators will disseminate by inputting to eTwinning and Facebook. At the start of each year the teachers will hold a video conference to ensure everyone is lined up for the year ahead. At the end of each year the coordinators will meet to complete the yearly progress report and plan the next year.            Results/impact envisaged: The impact on all students (including local deprived, international refugee and asylum seekers, and deaf) should be that they leave school better qualified, more rounded and mature learners who will be more effective contributors to society and whose employment prospects will be enhanced. The continual professional development received by the teachers by doing this project should result in them becoming more effective teachers and deliverers, ahead of and leading other teachers in the use of this innovative teaching method.

In particular they are looking concrete tools for working with youth that use hateful language in youth spaces and concrete methods for hate speech transformation with youngsters with extremist attitudes. The objective of this project is to collect existing best practices and develop concrete means and tools to tackle hate speech in youth work. The project will increase awareness, information and know-how about hate speech and related phenomena. The project will develop and share concrete means and measures to tackle hate speech in youth work, and build the capacity of youth workers  to implement anti hate speech actions in their work. Through the transformative approach to tackling hate speech, the project promotes constructive participation in the society. This means that engagement with (rather than exclusion of) young people producing hate speech helps to avoid their becoming radicalized or joining extremist groups or gangs. If all relevant youth work organisations in our countries embark on the journey of hate speech transformation then these young people will benefit immensely as they will get the structured space where their manner of expression will be challenged, they will be challenged to reflect their positions, but at the same time they will not be excluded from youth work activities and they will get the chance to develop themselves into reflected and respectful human beings, even accepting diversity and ambiguity.

Today  in most of the partner countries youth workers  belonging to marginalised and minority groups  are not participating in any of the main established pools of trainers and their opinions and expertise is not heard when looking for solutions for the worsening hate speech phenomenon in our societies.

The Tool Kit is a collection of methodologies to be used in any group when hate speech occurs or when participants use discriminatory speech in their interactions with others and within the group. We will also create an Interactive Online Learning Platform which will serve as a complementary mechanism for the Tool Kit and will be an independent learning space and tool on the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe partners of the project comes from Finland, Portugal, Ireland, Slovenia and Scotland;  each bringing different working knowledge and experiences which include youth policy, LQBTQ, Religious interfaith, disability, peace education, professional training of youth workers, anti racism and discrimination. All partners work directly with youth and minority or marginalised groups. Having such diverse partners  enables an innovative approach to  addressing hate speech, from reaching the profiled participants from minority groups to, understanding the issue of hate speech and the tools/methods for transforming hate speech and discrimination in a safe and educational way. The project partnerships brings with it a unique approach  to equality and social inclusion, through supporting the exchange and new learning of each other's knowledge and sector experiences. Through this process the project will gather best practices to address and transform hate speech in youth spaces, providing tools for youth workers and the youth field beyond the project.", "http://www.interfaithscotland.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA205-034627_3"], [2017, "PROMOTE INTEGRATION BY ACQUIRING VET EUROPEAN TOOLS IN THE FRAME OF MOBILITY", "Bridges Programmes", 224547.0, 5, 13, "CONTEXT: In 2016, Italy has the record for number of arrivals in the Mediterranean ,on more than 361 thousand migrants arriving by sea in Europe, half of them landed on the Italian coast. Taking into consideration these data, the partners of the consortium  INTEGR8 working in the field of training and third sector has  the need to professionalize 60 graduates, providing them  professional tools acquired in a European context that must be  in line with the GENERAL OBJECTIVES contained in ET2020 strategy for fostering the employability and raise the level of skills in the VET sector. The project aims on the direct beneficiaries (participants in mobility) 1) improve professional skills needed to work with asylum seekers and migrants 2) offer participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies 3) provide additional knowledge necessary to the enforceability of the daily work 4) support professional development by improving training at European level in order to iincrease the quality in the services provided by voluntary associations and cooperatives 5) to enhance the language skills needed in the work with the target.

At the same time we have to acknowledge that the group of migrants currently entering the European Union as asylum seekers are a very diverse group concerning their education and qualification background. OECD studies show that about 40% of Syrian asylum seekers own a kind of upper secondary degree whereas the Afghan asylum seekers only 12-15% have this kind of qualification. Moreover, and this is certainly different to all experiences from the past, migrants are coming from totally different education systems, labour market conditions, work conditions etc. which are nearly impossible to compare with European standards. In front of this situation it is nearly impossible to simply recognise a certificate or diploma (if available at all), this would unfortunately be the easy and positive exemption. This developments and situation lead to two quite dangerous reaction for the European VET systems and labour markets: a) solutions are built on national level without taking into account European standards and instruments (like EQF and ECVET for recognition)b) approaches are diversified between several organisations (one responsible for recognition, one for training plan, one for guidance, one for labour market insertion, one for work placements etc.) Both trends need to be avoided and lead to the immediate need for a labour market integration model for refugees AND asylum seekers with a positive acceptance perspective which is: - based on European approaches and instruments in competence based VET (ECVET and EQF / NQF)- holistic, combining recognition of prior formal/non-formal/informal learning with language assessment, social assessment and elaboration of an individual, personalised inclusion plan for each person - easy to manage for authorities and carriers- efficient in terms of resources needed and outcome achieved - oriented towards professions and labour market sectors with clear labour demand - accessible for all and oriented towards the principles of equal opportunities.The main objective of the NCNA project is to develop an innovative and target group oriented model for the assessment, validation and recognition of prior experiences and informal learning of refugees and asylum seekers with positive perspective to stay, based on learning outcomes approach and using instruments, credits and descriptors from EQF and above all ECVET. The NCNA model will be European, target group oriented and holistic and is the necessary new solution for the upcoming challenges for the European VET systems as well as labour markets.

Therefore, in order to support the job insertion of disadvantaged groups (such as immigrants, unemployed, older workers) the EU is fostering the assessment and validation of their competences with a focus on learning outcomes, as well as their entrepreneurial education. Particular focus is dedicated to social entrepreneurship, as it creates sustainable jobs and help the people in need. \r\nCreating social businesses, through the assessment of formal and informal competences and providing guidance on social business start-up, therefore, could be a good option in order to overcome high unemployment rates. \r\nDuring the lifetime of the project the following activities will be implemented:\r\nINTELLECTUAL OUTPUTS\r\nO1 - Ca@Se Assessment Handbook will be a guide for professionals working with low-qualified people operating in the health and care sector in order to assess their competences acquired in informal or non-formal context.\r\nO2 - Ca@Se Training Handbook, based on the learning outcome approach and on O1.

Besides the humanitary aid ( need for food, housing and basic goods for refugees and migrant families and young people) , it is urgent to react in providing with basic skills and the first elements to a smooth integration in their EU receiving countries.Experience has shown in recent years that massive migration and refugees exodus has a big impact in receiving countries, leading to difficult integration and undesired side effects such as xenophobia from local population.  Xenophobia, social exclusion, discrimination and discontent with sudden awakening from the \u201cEuropean dream\u201d can cause marginalization and radicalization of migrants and their families with subsequent undesired side effects such as the terrorists attacks in Paris and recently in Brussels.The Paris declaration, adopted at the Informal Meeting of the EU Education Ministers in Paris on 17 March 2015, gave the strong signal that, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Ministers wanted to boost EU-level cooperation in the acquisition of social, civic and intercultural competences, by promoting fundamental rights, social inclusion and non-discrimination, intercultural dialogue in all forms of learning. Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education is one of EU priorities nowaday at ET2020. Many NGOs have a great deal of expertise in addressing these issues by providing non-formal education where the government lacks the capacity to do so, and are the relevant stakeholder that can be key to swiftly impact on refugees and migrants target groups for a better integration. Spain  and Italy are EU countries with EU external border with a long experience in facing massive legal and irregular migration from non EU and developing countries. How many in these flows are irregular labour migrants and how many are refugees? It is difficult to know. Refugee crisis has expanded the number of countries facing a really demanding challenge of receiving a big number of refugees and other migrants such as Germany and  UK.  Many best practices from the non formal and basic adult education provided by NGOs, charity organizations and social services at local governments are developed in different countries, but they are disperse and non complete, providing with some training directed towards migrant and refugees target groups, while there is not a well structured teachers or educators training or train the trainers in this field.

It is housed in an outermost island , characterized essentially by the remoteness from the European continent , which has a close neighborhood exclusively consisted of non-member countries of the EU; which, among other features, significantly limits the development of the teaching- learning process of their students due to the multiplicity of experiences. As a consequence of this fact, multiculturalism turns out to be scarce.It is in this context that the project \"United by Arts\" comes up directed at students of professional courses in instruments, theater and contemporary dance . It\u00b4s a project that is focused in the development of professional learning through the promotion of mobility among students of different schools in order to enable international and multicultural levels of experience by providing performance experience in different contexts and confronting the curriculum and the syllabus of different countries.Providing students a training / internship period in another country will allow the acquisition of new knowledge and experience , \"sine qua non\" for their training , since experiencing other professional experiences , contacting with other professionals and with other public , with different degrees of requirements, trying new methodologies and techniques , and acquiring new methods of primary analysis and interpretation of knowledge and the development of professional skills and performance, are essential to their training curriculum in the areas of classical music, theater and dance which goal is for students to continue their studies and enter the labor market.This project includes a total of 63 trainees, aged between 16 and 25 years old in the fields of music, theater and contemporary dance in professional education (professional qualification level IV), who are attending the 3rd and 2nd years, of which 33 are young people from families with few financial resources, 3 are with special educational needs; 6 were born in foreign countries; and as gender equality, CEPAM has guaranteed this premise.Mobility will last three weeks. For this purpose, the methodologies will be applied in three phases:1st Phase - Before the onset of mobility: CEPAM will provide a list with the identification and the degree of knowledge of each trainee to the host entity; the host entity shall prepare and send (in advance) the Training Plan for three weeks , as well as the subjects to be studied during the period of mobility. Regarding the dance and theater students, they should participate in the creative process of a show, demonstrating the mastery of technical and interpretative skills.2nd Phase - during the period of mobility CEPAM will execute the training plan; organize music, theater and dance performances opened to the general public; provide the respective records (Room programs, photographic records, and / or the respective recordings on DVD or audio); organize the program of social-cultural activities (language teaching, study visits, etc.); fill in the above mentioned documentation (for VET Mobility Agreement; Agreement for ECVET Mobility, Quality Comitment; Description of Skills and Competences acquired during theEuropass Mobility Experience, Training Report: Attendance Registration: Attendance Certificate Erasmus +); and organize social integration with local students.3rd Phase \u2013 After the mobility period: CEPAM shall validate the ratings assigned to learners through tests and interviews; and apply a survey of students about their appreciation of the training period / internship and on their learning (methods and techniques used throughout the training / internship).At the end the results will be announced for the whole school community and the new tools will be reflected on the improvement actions of the teaching / learning strategies.In general terms, CEPAM predicts that this mobility experience will contribute to the formation of active citizens, critical, outspoken , supportive and responsible and thereby seeking the achievement of the priorities defined in the educational project; and hence the level of educational attainment and further education.

Salpaus\u2019 strategic development programs for 2020 are designed to strengthen partnerships and networks with working life, implement changes in pedagogy and learning solutions, as well as created a solid economic foundation. As part of this strategy process is to define, a united operating culture.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Salpaus is to build a community-based culture. Salpaus is to develop organizational culture within the following areas: participation of students, strengthening of co-operation between education and professional groups, and strengthening communication between of leadership and work. Strategic development programs and areas for growth within the organizational culture are drawn up annually; these also guide the planning and implementation of Salpaus' international activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Salpaus Further Education was awarded the Erasmus+ Mobility Charter for Vocational Training (VET Mobility Charter). Based on the feedback from this accreditation and the Strategic Programs of Salpaus, the following priorities for the development of international operations have been selected: student participation, The standardization of international activities of different education fields and sectors and co-operation between the contact teachers, home-based internationalization, as well as in Spring 2018 planning an international part degree program for individual study paths.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the internal communication and marketing of Salpaus, our aim is to share international experiences with the use of social media. The goal is for the students to become the content creators of \"internationalsalpaus\" -Instagram and Facebook's \"Salpaus international participants\" accounts. The aim is to bring international experiences closer to all students and staff representatives. We have been striving for clearer and more open communication and it is still the goal. An active team has been gathered from eager students to develop more student oriented international activities.\r\n\r\nThe Salpaus Further Education is an international educational institution with ongoing internal and working life related development of international relationships. All our study fields have equal opportunities for studies and on-the-job learning abroad. Salpaus is developing international activities continuously. Development is increasingly focusing on student orientation which is one of our strategic goals. Involvement of students in the development of international affairs, together with the Salpaus staff, will be incorporated into our activities. Salpaus invest in home-based internationalization, for example, students are actively involved in presenting our organization to foreign guests. Through home-based internationalization, we also develop the skills of students who do not wish to be involved in an international study path or do not travel abroad.\r\n\r\nMonthly meetings with the contact teachers include the development, marketing and inspiration of students towards international activities. This activity is supported by planning meetings with different education managers in the various study fields. The regular group meetings of the contact teachers also support their networking and the sharing of good practice in different professional disciplines.\r\n\r\nInternational mobility at Salpaus is at a good level. The student mobility periods are mainly one or two months. Last year, 115 students completed a mobility period abroad most of which ranged from 2 to 15 weeks in either an on-the-job learning situation or in a study institute. The most popular target countries have been Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and other European countries. In addition, periods of study have been carried out in Asia and elsewhere outside Europe with project funding or by the institution's own funding. Numerous international projects are currently in progress within Salpaus, these are developing, among others, new areas of expertise and international learning environments. Students and staff also participate in international projects seminars and events abroad. \r\n\r\nStaff mobility has been well achieved.

Students acquiring music related vocational education will participate in concert projects that follow real work situations organised by partner conservatories and end with public concert and/or recording. Preparation and concert period lasts for three weeks. Mobility project will be carried out in partner conservatories and on concert venues chosen by them according to agreed plan.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide our students opportunities to practice musical performance skills by playing in the great orchestras and ensembles of our partner schools, to gain cultural experiences and to learn about life and culture in different countries. All this adds up to personal growth and abilities to take full responsibility for one\u2019s own life.\r\n\r\nAt the time our students get their diplomas, especially those who have participated in student exchange are open-minded young professionals with respect and understanding for different cultures. They also see the scene for their own activities, whether working or studying, much broader than just their own home country.\r\n\r\nAll our partners are committed to sending and receiving students, in the scope of granted funds.

ACTIVITIESStudents will participate in a work placement abroad.  The project will provide music students from the various colleges with an opportunity to work in partnership to learn skills in specific musical styles and organise and perform at concerts in the respective schools.  This will assist students to develop a number of skills in relation to music, partnership working, team work and event management.  The project will therefore provide valuable additional employability related skills gained in an international context.OBJECTIVESTo develop professional abilitiesTo develop an understanding of other cultures and also the business and work environment in other countries.To develop on the job learning opportunities, skills and experienceTo develop professional competences in their chosen music subject area and learn new skills in relation to other musical styles.EXPECTED RESULTSStudents will be able gain vocationally based outcomes, develop social, employability and language skills. Development of partnership working in an international settingImproved understanding of educational systems and qualification frameworks within another European country.Positive exchange of information and work methodsPOTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFITSThe project will provide participants to gain experience in the music industry in a different cultural setting, with different cultural norms and procedures.  Participants will be able to gain skills they can add to their CV and Europass and these will include language skills, personal development skills and personal promotion and networking skills.  This will be of benefit to participants in their career in the music industry.IMPACTThis project will provide a valuable work experience opportunity for participants to develop work related skills in an international environment.   Participants will have the opportunity to network with other participants in an international environment and will develop additional skills in IT development, for example, using the internet for marketing and dissemination.   We will also be using Skype, Facetime, etc as a mechanism of communication between the participants and the college whilst they are on placement.A key theme of this project is the utilisation of web based systems to market the project\u2019s activities and disseminate information.   This is relevant to the participants\u2019 training and professional development as it will provide a learning opportunity to develop specific skills in addition to those gained as part of the HND course.  Participating in the project will give participants a unique insight into their own field from another perspective.Participation in Erasmus+ projects raises the college profile.

The objective of this 4th project of VET mobility, called \"European Placement Mobility for Graphic Arts\" (MobilArtGraph 2015-2017), is to organize placement periods for our students and periods of formation for our VET personnel. Since 2010, this will be our 6th mobility project after 3 Leonardo da Vinci and 2 Erasmus Charters in a Placement Consortium.\r\nThe nature of our formations involves a real commitment towards mobility, whether it be intellectual, geographical or cultural, the various origins of our students (coming from 50 French departments) being a vivid testimony of that state of mind.\r\n\r\nThis project will concern 12 students and 4 staff over a peiod going from June,1, 2015 to May, 31, 2017.

The pupils are studying administrative management and have a European option to assess for their exam. They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her. Every year we have some pupils from the Euro section being on one of the three first ranks.\r\nOur expectations for the future :\r\nWe hope to motivate pupils to integrate our European section in the future years. Indeed, it is still new and pupils don't really know what it is. It stays too abstract for them. \r\nIf our current pupils can go on a work placement abroad, they could talk about it to the future pupils wishing to study administrative management and promote the European section when they participate in different students or professional fairs, or at our school when we organize our open day event.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036897_1"], [2015, "Learning, Youth and Innovation in European Trade Unions", "Glasgow Kelvin College", 3648.0, 3, 4, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\nThis project will explore trade union youth organization and the links to trade union education.
