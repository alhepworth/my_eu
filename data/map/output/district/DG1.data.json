We realized that the project team and the methods we use need development, testing and an upgrade in (other) new environments while we also look forward to new methods to better achieve (more) objectives from which entire communities can benefit. We've gradually started feeling the need to implement those methods outside our borders. We would like to learn about other youth organizations using similar methods, thus enhancing both the youth sector itself as well as organizations and individuals within it. Therefore we decided to link up with organizations from across Europe and invite them to participate in a partnership building seminar.\r\n\r\nWe decided to address goals such as good practice exchange of street-based youth work, strengthening the youth sector and better knowledge of street-based youth work within the sector, professional development and capabilities of youth workers locally and internationally, an upgrade of organizations with newly developed partnerships and a prepared plan for additional international cooperation. Therefore we invited organizations from all over Europe to cooperate;  this seminar involves twelve organisations from abroad who will send two participants (together 24) to the partnership building seminar, held in January 2017.\r\n\r\nWe expect participants, youth workers, experienced in outreach work, primarily from target group aged 17-29. Beside youth workers, partner organizations will be encouraged to invite participants with fewer opportunities \u2013 unemployed youth volunteering in the field of or interested in working with street based methods.\r\nThe main activity of the project is a partnership-building seminar. Participants will exchange experiences, good practices, methods we use and obstacles that we can together overcome more easily. Within the activity we expect to form several new partnerships and for each partnership a plan for further cooperation will be formed together with the planned activities to find project application opportunities. Project applications will ensure partnerships.\r\nIntroduction of participants, organizations, projects and methods, used by participants, partnerships building activities with work plan after this seminar and step by step plan to project application are all parts of the seminar. An important part of the seminar will be evaluation which will ensure learning opportunities even to those participants and organizations that might not decide to cooperate further.\r\nThere will be different methods used, mainly working in bigger or smaller groups, with an addition of activities to encourage creativity and idea generation. Each sequence will be moderated by a chosen moderator (participants can freely enter this role), enabling equal cooperation, involvement and participation of all. The facilitator will also be responsible for following the schedule and goals of each sequel. The seminar will be held in unchierarhical mode and with clear structure.\r\nResults of the project will be formed partnerships and a well established network of youth organizations, using street-based work within the youth sector.

The current generation of farm operatives must develop the skills to operate increasingly sophisticated fish farming equipment and ICT systems, according to specifications, as a matter of urgency. The lack of job applicants with evidence of the competence and skills potential employers are looking for is a shared concern.  Many do have relevant knowledge and skills which have been gained during fish farm employment informally or within a technically related sector, that go unrecognised, compounding the problem. Sophisticated systems for the recognition of prior learning (RPL) are needed, so as learners with some experience can \u2018fast track\u2019 the completion of fish farming qualifications that employers respect and trust. Profile of participants:The partner countries VET providers and employers will work in partnership to develop and pilot learning technologies and methods that can improve the delivery of VET to work based learners through the application of RPL methods and technologies. All learners involved in the pilots will have gained some relevant and/or transferable knowledge and skills, informally, during their employment, but will also have significant knowledge and skills gaps to address. Such gaps in knowledge and skills result in heterogeneous VET classes, which are a serious challenge many VET teachers are faced with when they try to optimize learning outcome for work based learners in distance learning solutions consisting of a combination of e-learning and (some) face to face training.The introduction of RPL will leads to individualised learning, allowing teachers and instructors to focus on the most challenging topics and concepts with individuals or groups of learners. The RPL tools and methods can be applied to synchronous distance learning, overcoming the geographic barriers that often prohibit them from travelling to join conventional face to face classes and training sessions. Objectives: The ultimate goal of Optimal, is to develop a RPL system that enables an individual\u2019s informal competences and skills to become recognised and accepted, within fish farming qualifications and built on through individualised learning.  This will be achieved by: - Evaluating alternative RPL processes and technology being applied within innovative VET delivery systems within the partner countries, identifying best practice for sharing. - Piloting new, cost effective and user friendly RPL methods/ ICT tools that can determine and document evidence of a learners\u2019 existing knowledge and skills, for acceptance as formal competences within respected fish farming qualifications.  - Evaluating the learners\u2019 experiences of the RPL process and the subsequent delivery of their individualised learning plan, to inform the development of improved RPL systems. - Developing new specifications for improved RPL tools and methodologies, informed by learner and employer feedback during the piloting and evaluation phase. ImpactsMethods and technology supporting RPL and individualised learning will be developed and improved, fully involving VET providers, industry and learners within the process, addressing industry\u2019s skill needs priorities for key occupations, such as the cage farming operative.More VET teachers will be enabled to apply improved and proven RPL methods and technology to the delivery of their VET courses,  to make them more flexible. Consequently, VET will become driven by individual learning plans and supported by flexible and accessible learning resources, including e-learning. A 90% reduction of face to face teaching is anticipated, improving the accessibility of VET qualification based courses by work based learners, gaining time efficiencies and reducing costs without reducing quality in comparison to conventional face to face delivery. By focussing on individual knowledge and skill gaps, the quality and effectiveness of learning support and VET provision as a whole will be raised. Long term benefits:Access to workplace training in fish farming industry is increased, while training costs are reduced without reducing the quality of the training.The proposed new RPL-TOOL has the potential to be used in many sectors outside VET education, for instance in higher education to make an \"instant mapp\" of students knowledge and skills.

This is based on the creation of dynamic social communities related to the user and digital asset context (e.g. profiles, preferences or devices).
