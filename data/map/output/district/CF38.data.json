Education plays an important role in promoting the personal development of our pupils and is the basis for self-determined and active social participation. The project \u201cEurope on a plate\u201d is aimed at fostering social participation and equality of opportunity and at developing human resources. All of the three countries involved in the project consider education a lifelong process. The young people we work with are, despite their mental disability, able to learn and develop, and learning processes are possible for them throughout their lives. \r\n\r\nThese are the main goals of the project:\r\n\r\n- Pupils practise organising and implementing a project.\r\n- Pupils strengthen their key competencies such as the willingness to learn and perform, creativity, resilience, openness, perseverance, concentration. \r\n- Pupils are motivated to actively shape their lifestyles and to acquire the skills that they need for entering a profession. \r\n- Pupils eat healthy.\r\n- Being in an intercultural community enables pupils to acquire the ability to stick to rules, to develop social skills and to experience being in that community as a stimulating learning opportunity. \r\n\r\nAchieving these goals will have a positive effect on pupils\u2019 lives and on partner schools. The young people develop competencies such as the willingness to learn and perform, creativity and intercultural skills. \r\nThanks to the project, pupils will understand themselves better in their living environment and be able to master future challenges of a European model more successfully. \r\nThe pupils involved in the \u201cEurope on a plate\u201d project will learn how to eat more healthily and control their weight. They improve their mobility and their physical fitness. They learn how to cope with stress and disappointment, thereby also strengthening their sense of self-esteem. This can be achieved by teachers involved in the project reducing the complexity of Europe to action-oriented contents and methods in their teaching approach. The topic \u201cEurope on a plate\u201d addresses the basic need of \u201ceating\u201d, which is a motivating topic for all pupils throughout Europe. In terms of methodology, different worksheets and recipes at various levels of abstraction are developed and put to use (text, text-picture, picture) and pupils at the respective skill level can practise reading in a concrete situation, with the teachers demonstrating the action steps that need to be performed. The pupils\u2019 joy in moving and physical activity will be stimulated by different excursions that offer motivating opportunities for physical activity.\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the projects for pupils with a focus on \u201cmental development\u201d are mainly in the areas of knowledge acquisition and the development of communication skills. \r\n\r\nPupils will go food shopping and prepare a meal together, thereby learning more about new food products and methods of processing them. The outcome of the practical activities will be a buffet. In addition to healthy nutrition, physical activity and fitness will also play an important role during the entire project. \r\n\r\nIn the field of communication, pupils will broaden their vocabulary and will have the opportunity to actively use it abroad. Simple words of welcome and rules of politeness will be applied in Portuguese, English and German language. This will boost the self-confidence of our young pupils.\r\n\r\nThe final products of our project will be a cooking book, an image film, t-shirts and ceramic bowls carrying the project logo. \r\n\r\nThe most important potential long-term benefit will be for the European idea and concept to remain present at the schools even after the end of the project. Through the experiences and memories that were made during the project, the knowledge about the European Union and the opportunities and possibilities the EU offers will stick in the minds of both pupils and teachers.", "http://www.ysgoltycoch.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035537_2"]]}}, "2LT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1304208000000, 1414713600000, "Nanostructured energy-harvesting thermoelectrics based on Mg2Si", "Babrow Consultants Ltd", "The core concept of the ThermoMag project revolves around developing and delivering new energy-harvesting thermoelectric materials and proof-of-concept modules, based on nanostructured bulk Mg2Si solid solutions. This class of TE material would have the following attractive characteristics: (i) ZT value >1.5 for both n-type and p-type doped material, (ii) operational in the temperature range 300-550\u00baC, (iii) very low density of 2 g/cm3, especially suitable for transportation applications, (iv) high melting point of >1000\u00baC, and good thermal stability up to 600\u00baC, (v) good oxidation and corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, (vi) isotropic thermoelectric properties, (vii) non-toxicity of elements, (viii) widely-available pure materials with very large EU supply chains and (ix) low raw material cost <15 Euros/kg, combined with low manufacturing costs. A number of methods will be looked at to achieve 3D bulk nanocrystalline Mg2Si including low-cost combustion synthesis, mechanical alloying and high-temperature solid-state synthesis in inert crucibles. Various ball milling approaches will be used to produce doped Mg2Si nanoparticle constituents that can then be compressed via rapid spark plasma sintering or hot pressing in vacuum. 3D nanocomposite material will also be produced with the addition or in-situ production of inert nanoparticles, as well as thin films using multilayer approaches. Doping using various elements will be predicted by ab-initio density-functional theory modelling. These methods will lead to the safe production of nanostructured n- and p-type legs for further thermoelectric and materials testing. In order to prove the concept works, demonstrator modules will be assembled that integrate the new energy-harvesting nanostructured material. Such modules have widespread applications in automotive, aerospace and manufacturing sectors, where waste heat can be usefully recovered, with clear environmental benefits.", 36315.0, 5302922.0, 10, 17, "THERMOMAG", "http://thermomag-project.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112712.jpg", "fp7_98971_985858434"], [1306886400000, 1401494400000, "Next Generation Nano-engineered Thermoelectric Converters - from concept to industrial validation", "Babrow Consultants Ltd", "Global energy uncertainty and the limited recourses coupled with increased energy needs fuels the search for improving the efficiency of energy conversion technologies. Although the EU policies target increased use of renewable energy to 12% of gross energy production by 2010, this commitment has also highlighted the urgent need for improving the energy utilization of fossil-fuel based power-plants to allow continuation of the energy intensive lifestyle of EU countries.\nThermoelectric (TE) devices can play a very important role in efficient energy harvesting, and recovery. TE devices are \u2018fuel-free\u2019 solid-state devices with no moving parts and therefore are extremely reliable. TEs can harvest residual low-grade energy which otherwise is wasted. To date, their use is limited by low conversion efficiency. The key factor for improving the performance of TE applications is mainly through the development of TE materials as well as corresponding TE module/device technology and design, based on the material types, which can ensure better performance. Recent advances in nanotechnology offer unprecedented opportunities in designing and fabricating increasingly complex material architectures with controlled and hierarchical microstructures. Theoretical predictions showed that low-dimensional TE materials with figure of merits (a measure of the goodness of TE materials) can be spectacularly enhanced from currently ~1 to extremely high values of 5 -10 (up to 20). The present proposal is concerned with applying modern nanotechnology principles to the design and creation of novel material architectures with enhanced TE properties, with close feedback with theoretical studies. The material architectures considered in this proposal are chosen based on suitability for the development of next generation TE modules and devices, designed for a few specific promising applications including harvesting waste energy from automobiles and environmentally benign, efficient cooling systems", 14531.0, 5334367.0, 5, 12, "NEXTEC", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163216.jpg", "fp7_99282_985858434"]]}}}}
