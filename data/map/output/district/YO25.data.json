These \u2018self-alerting\u2019 safety jackets (SASJackets) would be used for local alerting and rescue by maritime and inland waterway employees, passengers, and recreational sailors. The proper integration of PLB technology into PFDs will allow users to have the maximum level of protection at all times.  The separation of these safety tools require numerous procedures and manual processes to be adhered to in order to attain a consistent level of safety.\n\nThere could be wider potential to extend the use of the technologies developed in the project for other health and safety alerting and locating applications, e.g. for lone workers, and for remote operations in difficult environments.", 329543.0, 1256228.0, 4, 7, "SASJACKET", null, null, null, "fp7_106209_953682370"]]}}}}
