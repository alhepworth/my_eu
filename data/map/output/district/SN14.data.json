It brings together major European groups currently working on planetary robotic vision, supported by NASA-JPL from USA. Most robotic planetary space missions performing in situ exploration of the surface and atmosphere for any planetary object outside the Earth involve a means of mobility provided by either a surface vehicle (\u2018rover\u2019) or by aerial vehicles (balloons, aerobots etc.). Mobile systems are among the most critical of all space missions in requiring a rapid and robust on-site processing and preparation of scientific data to allow efficient operations for a maximum use of their limited lifetime. In future the number and variety of such platforms will require more autonomy than is feasible today, particularly in the autonomous on-site selection of and access to scientific and mission-strategic targets. ProViScout will provide the robotic vision building blocks on board of such future autonomous exploration systems. Therefore ProViScout aims to 1. build a framework for planetary robotic on-board vision processing, 2. develop the technology to autonomously select scientific sites of interest during future planetary robotic missions in order to maximize the mission value for scientific research, technology and education 3. develop a unified and generic approach for robotic vision on-board processing, namely the combination of navigation and scientific target selection 4. demonstrate the synergies and complementarities of existing solutions, and complete missing components by defining and demonstrating on-board robotic vision for a set of typical reference mission scenarios, 5. integrate all components into a framework ready for field demonstration 6. increase public awareness of planetary robotic exploration.", 196305.0, 2290298.0, 7, 12, "PROVISCOUT", "http://www.proviscout.eu/", "http://www.scisys.co.uk", null, "fp7_94034_998883788"], [1222819200000, 1341014400000, "Planetary Robotics Vision Ground Processing", "Scisys Uk Ltd", "PROVISG will build a framework for planetary robotic vision ground processing - develop the technology to better process and visualise existing & future data from planetary missions to maximize value-adedd exploitation of the data for research, technology and education - increase public awareness of such missions and the EC contribution to their scientific evaluation.\nWe define robotic planetary space missions as unmanned missions performing in situ surface exploration on planetary objects. Most such missions involve mobility provided by a surface (\u2018rover\u2019) or aerial (balloons etc.) vehicle and require rapid turnaround of imaging data through processing and proper presentation on the ground (i.e., on Earth) to make maximum use of the limited vehicle lifetime.

The theme will be World War 1 and various subjects will develop course material for this theme from their perspective. The subject material will be incorporated into the regular subject curriculum of participating subjects for the target year groups ( 2nd years at SMC, year 8 at Hardenhuish). We strive to achieve a fully developed, in-depth cross-curricular and trans-national educational programme by the end of the three year project that will be incorporated into the curriculum of various subjects and be continued as a joint enterprise at both schools after the project funding has ended. In the first year the subjects History, Geography, English, Media/Art and Drama( only at Hardenhuish as Sintermeerten does not have this subject yet but does invite drama experts in for workshops during our project days). We hope that other subjects will be interested to join in with new perspectives and ideas for the project during the course of the project. Therefore the project will be continually presented in each school and teachers from other subjects invited to take part in it. \r\nIn the first year we will follow the steps laid out in this application. During the year all participants will be asked to reflect and evaluate the steps and then revise, readjust and refine the steps towards a fully workable, enjoyable and innovative international project that can be carried out at both schools. \r\nIt starts off a trans-national meeting at Sintermeerten. The coordinators , some teachers and students will set up a work schedule( time management) and task division for the coming year. Dates for exchanges will be finalised etc. The project then starts with regular History lessons on World War 1 as background information. At the same time pupils from both school will meet each via video conferencing, be paired up( Dutch-English) and they will start their own Facebook page in which they can upload articles and assignments, reflect on programme parts and communicate with each other and teachers.The Facebook page will only be accessible for participating students and teachers for safety reasons. However, students will regularly place articles, photos and updates on the project in their own newspaper which will be on both schools' websites. The pupil pairs will create peer assignments for the trip to Ypres in November. Geography will focus a few lessons on the geographical influences at Flanders Field. During English lessons students will focus on the War Poets. Art will deal with the War theme as well. In November both schools will meet in Ypres for a joint field trip to Flanders Fields and the pairs will work on each others'assignments. \r\nThe second part of the project revolves around the film War Horse. As preparation to the Dutch visit to Hardenhuish school students watch the film, they will again make peer assignments to be carried out by the students in Hardenhuish where they will visit the film location of War Horse. At Hardenhuish they will also have drama sessions and rehearse and perform sketches related to life in the trenches. \r\nThe third part will prepare them for the visit by the English school to Sintermeerten where they will have another Drama workshop on World War 1 led by the English drama group Phileas Fogg. Then they will reflect on the past year and  write the last issue of their newspaper( final big issue). Teachers will evaluate and make plans for the  second year of the project. \r\nIn the second and third year the project will be analysed and evaluated and readjusted, refined and incorporated into the existing curricula of participating subjects.  After these first three years we should have a sustainable, fully functioning, sunstantial and in-depth educational project on World War 1 that has been expanded to involve more than the initial subject areas and will be the basis for further cooperation and collaboration between the two schools.", "http://www.hardenhuish.wilts.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA219-008806_1"]]}}}}
