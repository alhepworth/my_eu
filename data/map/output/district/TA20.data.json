Additionnal biocompatible materials for the casing and the adhesive patche make it comfortable and easy to stick to the user\u2019s skin\n- Reliability: to tackle the high rate of false alarms that hinder the market, the FALLWATCH Consortium has develop a enhanced data fusion algorithm that crosses check accelerometers and heartbeat frequency meter monitored by the wearable device and infra red environmental information from the user\u2019s home\nThe present project will represent the next step, i.e. the progression from research developments and lab-prototype to industrialization and commercializable products. It will aim at:\n- Adapting the technology to the US standards, controlling the performances  of the device, optimizing the component selection, process and overall cost\n- Organizing clinical trials to demonstrate and validate the high performances of Vigi\u201dFall\n- Obtaining CE marking and FDA clearance to launch Vigi\u2019Fall to the EU and US markets\n- Develop the best business strategy and commercialization routes\nFALLWATCH Demo will offer to the market a new generation of practical, easy to use and install, reliable fall detector, which thanks to a strong supply chain of SMEs (Vigilio, BSE, PMBL & Plastod) and a large company (AEMtec) will enable an enhanced quality of life to millions of European citizens, saving more than 10.000 hospitalizations and above 3.000 premature deaths caused by falls.", 150461.0, 1201758.0, 4, 5, "FALLWATCH DEMO", null, "http://www.pmbl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/145801.jpg", "fp7_106817_991971956"], [1233446400000, 1312070400000, "A wearable miniaturized fall detection system for the elderly", "Pmbl Limited", "Falls among the elderly occur frequently. Approximately 30% of people over 65 fall accidentally each year, and for those over 80 this rate raises up to 50%. Falls are an important factor in the health limitations of the elderly due to a high morbidity caused by physical and psychological consequences, loss of independence and even death. Late or non existing responses cause 2 million persons having to be hospitalized and approximately 85000 deaths can be attributed each year to this fact. There are a number of alarm devices trying to satisfy the need of an early intervention in case of fall, but existing fall detectors do not have a remarkable social impact neither a significant market penetration: just 4.5% of Europe&apos;s potential end users have any of the existing social alarms. Two facts hinder their effectiveness of the existing fall detectors, capping therefore the market demand: bad ergonomics and lack of reliability. FallWatch project proposes a new generation fall detector device included in a whole fall detection system and is thought as an effective way of minimizing the consequences of falls in the elderly. FallWatch will automatically detect a fall and immediately contact the health services to allow an early intervention. FallWatch will produce, on the one hand, a miniaturized fall detector device of a scale reduction by 50% of existing devices, and on the other hand, biocompatible materials for the device\u2019s package and for an adhesive patch to comfortably stick the device to the user\u2019s skin. FallWatch system will solve the reliability problem by using both wearable device and environmental infra red sensors at the user\u2019s home and developing a specific data fusion algorithm that will cross check the variables to avoid false alarms. In order to achieve the ergonomics and reliability goals, FallWatch project will work in different technological areas which are widely explained along this proposal.", 93443.0, 1274766.0, 4, 11, "FALLWATCH", "http://www.fallwatch-project.eu/", "http://www.pmbl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58267.jpg", "fp7_95777_991971956"]]}}, "1NF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RH5", "Chard  Community Hospital", "nhs_RH5F2"]]}}}}
