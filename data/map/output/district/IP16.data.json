They are to become mentors who inspire and support  teachers in introducing innovative solutions and curriculums at school,  new methods and techniques  in order to face the dynamically changing society.

Therefore the school is devided into different learning and activity areas. Each area offers suitable learning material and is mentored and supervised by a teacher.

The aim of our project is to get new ideas of how foreign languages can be integrated in a free school like ours  in every day\u00b4s school life and to implement those ideas. Since the teachers are alternately responsible for each learning area in the Bildungswerkstatt Knittlingerhof  and are working together in a pedagogical team, each of them is responsible for the practical implementation of the pedagogical concept. For this reason it is important for us that all of them have the chance to get an insight into the educational practice of other free schools in Europe. We are planning job-shadowings for two days in free schools in England and Italy. For the seven participants, who are teachers at the Bildungswerkstatt Knittlingerhof, this is an opportunity to extend their knowledge of language learning methods and subsequently integrate them into the educational practice of our school.

The produced technical and scientific results of both projects were excellent and very promising in terms of energy and cost efficiency. The most promising MBR system developed in PURATREAT run successfully with reduced energy consumption ( 90 % less than RO). The tested MBR lab-prototypes generated an effluent not suitable for drinking water but an excellent source for irrigation and fertilization purposes (rich on nutrients such as N and P and free of pathogens). In WACOSYS, the application of wastewater in agricultural production schemes has been successfully applied and monitored. Based on these valuable outcomes, within TREA&USE is planned to construct and implement a pre-commercial prototype unit which combines the treatment of substantial amounts of communal wastewater in an up scaled MBR system and the safe application of the effluent as irrigation and fertilization water in agricultural production schemes. The tailor-made MBR effluent will be applied directly for irrigating and fertilizing fruit trees and vegetables in commercial agricultural production site in Southern Spain. To measure the performance and the reliability of the approach, the pre-commercial prototype will include a feedback and control unit based on soil sensors.
