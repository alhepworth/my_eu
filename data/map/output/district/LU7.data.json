This subsequently requires much lower forces to make a weld and therefore the associated FSW machine can be made much smaller, less expensive, and critically mobile - thereby allowing this technology to be more widely used for in-situ fabrication in shipyards.\n\nThe international competitiveness of the European shipbuilding industry is of increasing concern, while current world-leaders, the far-east (especially Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan) and the US are rapidly improving the quality and performance of their vessels \u2013 primarily through the adoption of aluminium in ships.
