Outcomes from CGS are even worse in, females, the elderly (mortality>70%) and high risk sub-groups. The incidence of CGS in Europe alone is >50 000 patients pa. This unacceptably high mortality/morbidity rate represents a true unmet clinical need. No clear strategy exists to improve outcomes, with ad hoc therapies given too late in a spiralling, irrecoverable process.\nEURO SHOCK aims to improve outcomes for CGS patients. At its core is a robust phase3 randomised trial comparing a novel strategy of very early use of ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) to current standard of care. Evidence suggests very early ECMO will halt the spiral of decline and so significantly reduce 12 month death rate and need for heart failure re-admissions. Since both costs of CGS, and ECMO are high a health-economic cost efficacy analysis will be core. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sub-study will test novel protocols in sick patients and provide mechanistic data. We will test transfer networks for CGS patients and analyse ECG data to determine which patients benefit most from early transfer.\nOur multidisciplinary consortium comprises renowned physician-scientists, statisticians, health economists and technology providers, including specialised ECMO SME. \nEURO SHOCK will impact on heart attack survivors, healthcare providers and Europe`s medical technology sector by 1) reducing healthcare costs associated with CGS 2) provide novel cost effective framework for cardiac interventions 3) delivering innovative healthcare technologies and 4) informing guidelines for effective CGS intervention.", 691782.0, 5664617.0, 8, 14, "EURO SHOCK", null, null, null, "h2020_212681_919495302"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "CHALICE MEDICAL LIMITED", 692348.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_5151"]]}}, "3EH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1343779200000, 1438300800000, "Power consumption driven Reliability, Operation and Maintenance optimisation", "Monition Limited", "The normal strategy to keep production systems in good conditions is to apply preventive maintenance practices, with a supportive workforce \u201creactive\u201d in the case of clearly detected malfunctions. This impact on quality, cost and in general, productivity. Added to this, the uncertainty of machine reliability at any given time, also impacts on product/production delivery times. It is known also that a worn-out mechanism has higher energy consumption.\nThe use of intelligent predictive technologies could contribute to improve the situation, but these techniques are not widely used in the production environment. Often sensors and monitors required for the production environment are non standard and require costly implementations.\nPower-OM propose to use the electric current consumption monitoring and profiling, as an easy to implement condition based maintenance (CbM) technique, and manage it also as a way to improve the overall business effectiveness, under a triple perspective:\n\u2022 Optimizing maintenance strategies based on the prediction of potential failures and schedule maintenance operations in convenient periods and avoid unexpected breakdowns\n\u2022 Operation: Managing energy as a production resource and reduce its consumption\n\u2022 Product reliability: Providing the machine tool builder with real data about the behaviour of the product and their critical components\nThis universal solution should also be compatible with the added value information that could come from existing sources (control) and sensors used at the machine, and jointly this will preserve current and future investment in the field. The project will research also in the required infrastructure and new business model for maintenance services provider.\nPower-OM will be applied in machine tools, focussing on spindles and linear guides as responsible for the most common and cost-intensive downtimes.

Companies falling short from meeting the IPPC requirements risk penalties such as substantial fines. Unlike large enterprises, small and medium sized companies lack the necessary human resources and in-house technical knowledge to keep updated with such legislations. In order to abide to the law, these companies are obliged to seek assistance from environmental consultants. These services are very costly and time consuming, due to the extensive material required to compile IPPC applications. The ENVIRON-MENTOR project aims to assist environmental consultants in guiding their clients to implement environmental normative and standards in an efficient manner. ENVIRON-MENTOR will offer a web-based environmental consultancy toolkit (utilizing artificial intelligence techniques) to the participating end-user SMEs in order to help them in their daily activities. Apart from IPPC, ENVIRON-MENTOR will offer support on environmental management systems (EMS) and provides guidelines for EMS standards such as EMAS and ISO 14 000. ENVIRON-MENTOR will also target the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by providing an automated platform for the trading of greenhouse gases. This will enable environmental consultants to offer an efficient emissions trading service to their clients. Guidance to these environmental normative and standards will be provided by using a knowledge-base expert system and multi-agent system targeted for this scenario.
