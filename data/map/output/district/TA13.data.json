This manifests itself in the occurrence of serious ailments such as acute infectious diarrhoea (AID), ulcerative colitis (UC), travellers\u2019 diarrhoea (TD) and antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD). Specifically, in the case of AAD, it is estimated that between five and 25 per cent of patients experience diarrhoea, including Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, as a complication of treatment with antibiotics. The project aims to develop a three-fold Quality Control approach to the development of a probiotic supplement: i) Develop a \u201cTailor made\u201d unique blend of bacteria, the origin of which has a sound scientific basis and is not based on commercial availability. Each individual bacterial component will be screened for stability (both processing and gut environment), and adhesion to gut mucosa. ii) Develop a \u201cTailor made\u201d prebiotic \u201cpartner\u201d which will ensure the sustainability of the resulting synbiotic blend and to potentially enhance the immunostimulatory and anti inflammatory properties of the synbiotic. iii) Pre-conditioning of the bacterial blend will impart inherent robustness and eliminate the need for the additional (costly) physical and chemical processing required for protection in the gut.", 149075.0, 980718.0, 4, 6, "QUALVIVO", "http://www.qualvivo.eu", "http://www.protexin.com", null, "fp7_107795_997665662"]]}}, "5LR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Rural Inclusive Outdoor Theatre Education; Street theatre education methodology and network cooperation model in rural enviroment 2", "TAKE ART LIMITED", 163385.0, 5, 7, "The present project called \"Rural Inclusive Outdoor Theatre Education 2\" (RIOTE 2) was born from a previous \"exchange of good practices\" project (RIOTE) which is still in progress at the moment of this application.\r\n\r\nThe partnership members remained the same, copleted with a seventh, new partner: Teatro Tascabile di Bergamo (Italy) Kud Ljud (Slovenia), Soltis Lajos Theatre (Hungary), Control Film Studio Association (Hungary; coordinator), Shoshin Theatre Association (Romania), Dartington (UK), and the new partner is Take Art Limited (UK).\r\n\r\nThe project RIOTE was based on a knowledge and skills exchange between performing arts- organisations, which provide adult education through outdoor theatre, physical theatre or other cultural and adult educational practices in rural settlements. The project is at the same time based around the research of the question 'How do we develope the reach of our adult educational activity, as arts organisation, so that we can connect with more of our target group?'\r\n\r\nThe new project, RIOTE 2 will use the experiences and outcomes of the previous project to develope them and to produce three intellectual outputs 1. a Practical guide for outdoor theatre; 2. a Rural touring handbook; 3. a Film of outdoor theatre in rural environment. They will be presented in each partner country within the frame of a multiplier event as acomplete training program.\r\n\r\nThe new partner, Take Art is a National Portfolio Organization in the UK who will support the partnership from an important aspect: the promotion of outdoor work in rural arias. Take Art will lead the research about thetre management in rural enviroment to produce a handbook, as a further resource of this competence receiving the support of the South-West Rural Touring Network Federation.\r\n\r\n1. The partnership exchanges outdoor theatre education methods to create  a new methodology which can be shared on a European level. Outdoor performance is traditionally a good tool to create reciprocal cultural dynamic in rural areas. Some of the partners provide theatre courses or camps for local people in rural settlements. They also offer a \"barter\u201d by this we mean a cultural exchange between professional artists and local people who offer their own folk songs, local history, or other unique skills. The project's main idea is that outdoor performing experiences and educational methods could offer an extraordinary support for theatre activities in rural areas.\r\n\r\nOutdoor performing adult education can revitalze culture in socially marginalized environments with proposing: dialogue approach; critical sociology by revealing social problems; interactive cultural exchange; collective education; development of multiple intelligences; trigger the visualization of social change; empowerment of the community; strong pedagogical aspect; collaborative process.\r\nThe implementation of the outdoor theatre competences and teaching methodology will be tested in some geographically disadvantaged villages such as Kide (Romania) or Dunaszekcs\u0151 (Hungary).\r\n\r\n2. The other aim is to understand the English model of the rural touring network. We intend to observe the English practices to long-term implement their model of rural touring network in our partner countries. In turn, they can create a sustainable project with a lasting impact.\r\n \r\nThe new English partner, Take Art will have a leader role in this area of research and Italian and Slovenian partners will contribute to the outcome greatly with their long history of outdoor touring. This would be offered to Hungarian and Romanian partners to help them establish a network in their own locality. Shoshin and Control will have a leading role in prepearing a professional background of a similar network.\r\nThe national networks supposed to meet in a long-term prospective creating the European Rural Touring Network, what sustain as well the impact and the sustainability of the outputs of the project.", "http://www.takeart.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA204-036040_6"]]}}}}
