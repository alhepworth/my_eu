The central idea behind this project is a result of the successful training course that was organized by our organization under the Youth in Action 4.3 action in November 2012 with the title \u201cFormal Education meets Non Formal Learning: The Competence Based Approach\u201d. It is one of the follow-up actions that were designed during this training course and is believed to take the aforementioned training to the next level, providing the participants with the appropriate tools and methods for them to be able to use Non Formal Education in their daily work.\r\n\r\nIt is also part of the cycle of activities that our organization has planned in order to promote the recognition of Non Formal Education, of youth work as well as the importance of lifelong learning and adult education and the amelioration of youth structures through the training and development of skills of those who are working in the youth field.\r\n\r\nThe proposed training course that has a two-fold aim: \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it aspires to raise awareness on the nature of youth work and its methods, focusing on Non-Formal Education and to people that work with young people (youth workers, members, volunteers, staff of youth organisations, youth leaders etc) on how to use Non Formal Education, in order to help their target groups to develop personal, interpersonal and professional competencies. On the other hand, it wishes to foster a closer collaboration between European countries and southern Mediterranean countries in the youth field, in a way that it will facilitate the mutual exchange of know-how and experiences as well as the development of common activities in the youth field.\r\n\r\nSecondary objectives are also to:\r\n-  support the participants in developing and acquiring skills and competencies that will assist them in improving the quality of their work with the young people, and especially with young people with fewer opportunities\r\n- provide the participants with Non-Formal Education tools and methods that will allow them to promote and facilitate the active participation as well as support their target group, especially when it comes to young people with fewer opportunities, on a personal, educational and social level\r\n- facilitate the sharing of methods and experiences in the field of youth work, between the participating organizations\r\n- raise awareness on the different challenges organisations working with young people face in the different countries and exchange good practices on how to battle these challenges\r\n- promote mutual understanding and foster long-lasting collaborations between organisations and young people within the European Union and between EU and neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nAll activities are designed in a way that contributes to achieving the objectives of the training course and, more importantly, that facilitates the best possible learning outcomes for the participants. Methods and tools of non-formal learning will be mainly used, whereas in order to create a theoretical background formal learning methods might be used, while for the reinforcement of the intercultural learning of the participants (for example) informal learning will take place (eg. during the intercultural night).\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, we aspire this project to contribute to the development of the professionalism of organisations and individuals working in the youth field, as well as in the creation of a common strategy for Youth and of a wider recognition of the skills and competences developed through non-formal learning at European as well as International levels.\r\n\r\nThis project will take place in Kalamata, Greece from the 6th to the 14th of December 2014 and in it will participate 24 representatives of youth organisations (youth workers, volunteers, youth leaders, etc)  from 12 EU and Northern Mediterranean countries  (Greece, Croatia France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Romania, UK, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia) as well as 2 trainers that will design and facilitate the learning process.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL02-KA105-000582_3"], [2014, "Every Wall is a Door: Inclusion and employability for youth with\r\nfewer opportunities", "99%", 16695.0, 13, 13, "During the past few years, the economic crisis that effects all Europe, contributes to the creation of even more young people with fewer opportunities, increasing the rate of youth unemployment -youth unemployment in our region, Messinia, is now over 67%, whereas in the European Union, the average is over 23% (according to Eurostat - December 2013). This creates feelings of insecurity and pessimism for the future to the young people. \r\n\r\nWe believe that, in the framework of this economic and, consequently, social crisis in Europe, one of the main objectives of the people that are working directly with the young people is to support, empower and boost the confidence of young people, in order for them to be more able to respond quickly and effectively to the challenges they face, and to support an inclusive development in Europe, where the people have the freedom, the confidence and the social support to move forward, building their future as well as Europe's. To achieve this, the youth workers and people working in he youth field need to exchange their experiences and good practices and to experiment in the creation of new methods and approaches. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this seminar is to exchange good practices and create new methods that will help youth organisations and people working directly with young people to develop new and improve already existing activities mainly on the issue of youth unemployment and inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities to the labour market. The new methods that will be created will have to be easily adaptable to different situations and to every social issue or challenge that the young people face, regardless of the country and social environment they live in. \r\n\r\nThe results of the seminar will include the mapping of the challenges and the needs of young people in the different countries, the comparison of good practices, the transfer of know-how and the development of skills and competences by the participants, in order for them to become more able to support the young people of their target group. \r\n\r\nThe impact in the local communities of the partner organisations will be immediate, as the participants will use the skills and methods they developed in their work with the young people. On the long term, and mainly due to the good dissemination of the seminar's results and the publication and distribution of the \"Handbook of Good Practices\" that will be created during the seminar by the participants, the results of this seminar will foster and support youth organisations all over Europe and outside of it, allowing them to use these results to improve the methods they use in their work with the young people. \r\n\r\n26 representatives of youth organisations, that work with young people, especially young people with fewer opportunities, on a daily basis, will participate in this seminar.

Having worked on different parts of this\r\nfield, we have been strongly convinced that, under the current international, social and economic conditions, the promotion of a more sustainable and traditional lifestyle and the motivation of young people to respectfully use the natural advantages of the region they live in could be substantial parameters on the fight against poverty. \r\n\r\nThus, through this seminar, Prosehos cooperative is aiming to promote this idea, to develop and exchange competences, tools and practices to strengthen the armory of participants and their organizations and to build up a communication panel among the groups to support the cause. \r\n\r\nFor this project, 24 participants from 12 different countries (Greece, France, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Latvia, Croatia, Spain, Lithuania, Czech republic, Croatia and Bulgaria) will be hosted in Messinia Greece from the 17th to the 23rd of November 2014. Having carefully chosen the groups and organizations involved, we tried to develop a balance between participants experienced in natural and traditional practices and participants working with youngsters with fewer opportunities, to produce a constructive exchange, using mainly non-formal learning methods. In particular, through peer education, group discussions, interactive and experiential exercises etc, the participants will have the opportunity to present and exchange tools, ideas and experiences in their field and they will be facilitated to combine, modify and develop these tools in respect to the special social and environmental characteristics and needs of the area under consideration. \r\n\r\nThrough this procedure, not only do we aspire to create bonds and inspire future collaborations among the partners, but we also expect the participants to act as multipliers in their local communities, disseminate the project results, assist those interested and cooperate with local organizations in the implementation of a relevant idea.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL02-KA105-000939_3"]]}}, "7JT": {"nhs": {"data": [["TAH", "The Longley Centre", "nhs_TAHCC"]]}}, "8UG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1422748800000, 1517356800000, "INdependent LIving support Functions for the Elderly", "Sheffcare Limited", "The number of elderly living with cognitive impairment is growing rapidly due to increasing life expectancy.

We need to offer them support across the Trust, allowing them to develop their language skills and cultural knowledge and encourage them to \u201chave a go\u201d and learn with the children in a fun and non-threatening way.

We also want to introduce Spanish into KS1 and Early Years. With the introduction of MFL in Reception we aim to immerse our children in the sounds of the language.  Developing early listening and speaking skills helps pupils with pronunciation and retention of the language for learning at a more sophisticated level in KS2.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to use this opportunity to improve our provision for our pupils with Special Educational Needs and low basic skills. Learning a language is a level playing field for all including those children who struggle academically.  It is wonderful to see them thrive in language classes where they can shine just as brightly as their peers.  Language learning raises self-esteem in these pupils, which then has a knock-on effect in other areas of the curriculum. \r\n\r\nEstablishing links with a Spanish school will help us to show our pupils first hand the reality of life in Spain, improve their cultural knowledge and establish relationships to enable future projects to take place that will engage our pupils and add to their enjoyment of language learning.\r\n\r\nWe would like to develop a collaborative project across the three schools of our Trust. We will work together and pool our skills and knowledge to establish a high quality language provision within three schools. To support this, we would like three members of staff from each of the three schools in our trust (nine in total) to take part in immersion training courses in Spain over the course of two years.\r\n\r\nThese courses include intensive language learning, developing cultural knowledge, language teaching methodology and links with Spanish primary schools. \r\n\r\nThis will result in great improvements in language provision. Language teaching will be more consistent with better teaching. It will be progressive and well-planned and attainment will improve as a result. Languages will be embedded into the life of the schools and into daily routines and other curriculum areas, reinforcing learning and impacting on attainment.\r\n\r\nLanguage learning will be introduced into KS1 and EYFS. The schools will be better resourced with improved and more authentic learning environments. There will be more extracurricular provision for pupils and more parental/community involvement in the life of the school. There will be even more collaboration between the three schools as a result of this project.\r\n\r\nOur pupils will have a much better experience of language learning that is more consistent, progressive and real with better teaching and better resources. This will lead to better outcomes and improved attainment. Through the link with the Spanish school, they will have the chance to develop friendships which could potentially impact on their future lives. They will understand much better why they are learning languages and will see the purpose of doing this.
