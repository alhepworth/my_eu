In 2013, we completed expansion to become a two-form entry school.\r\n\r\nOne of our many strengths is our continuous commitment to achieve the very best education for our children. We have high aspirations for our children, and amongst many of the values that we endeavour to encourage is to be knowledgeable, and thus develop critical understanding of topics of global importance.\r\n\r\nNorris Bank has been involved in a previous Erasmus+ project with five mobilities to Spain, which ended in 2016.  Based simply upon the participant reports the project was an overwhelming success and has gone a great way towards meeting the overall aims outlined in our initial application. All participants increased their ability to communicate in the main foreign language used in the mobility activity, in this case Spanish, and there was a clear agreement that cultural awareness and expression had been furthered. These were the first set of key elements for us at Norris Bank.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the success of our previous project, we aim to continue to follow our vision to offer language learning and enhance inter-cultural awareness across our school from EYFS to UPKS2. We were delighted to observe the success in our young learners\u2019 enjoyment, enthusiasm, skills and knowledge. Additionally, staff involved in the project have continued to maintain enthusiasm for Spanish and there is clear evidence of greater teaching, ideas sharing and staff support across the whole school. \r\n\r\nWe now need to build upon this impact, to make sure that we do not lose the momentum and hard work that was achieved. We do not currently we have the skills and experience to sustain our current model of language teaching and learning. We currently rely on two members of staff to teach Spanish to Years 3, 4, 5 and 6. Teaching staff will be enthused, motivated and skilled to deliver lessons to pupils and embed Spanish as the key FL at our School.\r\n\r\nWe have a skills shortage in teaching languages, and believe that this project will help overcome this so we can deliver high quality teaching and learning of Spanish at our school. We plan to send 8 people to Spain over the next two years on immersion courses to develop language and intercultural skills. \r\n\r\nThe FL Coordinator will lead the project and ensure that all participants are fully prepared and briefed throughout the project. The project lead will report to SLT, and the wider Board of Governors to ensure that they are fully informed of all project developments and proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe will take part in preparation activities in advance of the course including baseline assessments of our current provision and individual preparation to ensure that participants get the maximum benefit from the visits. We will organise regular meetings with participants who have taken part in previous projects to share advice and ideas about how to make the most of the experience on the course and also how to ensure this has the greatest impact on our school and local community.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impact will be to raise the profile of languages within the school and to create a buzz about language learning. We hope this will lead to an increase in uptake of languages as our pupils understand the importance and relevance of language learning, and language becomes an enjoyable experience that many more pupils will wish to take advantage of. Pupils will have more learning opportunities and access to more languages through the development of extracurricular provision.\r\n\r\nWe will use a range of methods to conduct the evaluation, these will include:\r\n\u2022 Observation of lessons\r\n\u2022 Evaluation of quality of lesson planning and assessment\r\n\u2022 Measures against baseline data charting progression in language learning\r\n\u2022 Surveys to gauge opinions of all key stakeholders \u2013 teachers (including those who did not take direct part in the project); SLT; parents; members of the community; Governors; other cluster schools\r\n\u2022 Discussions with children regard teaching and learning Spanish, both before and continuously throughout the project\r\n\u2022 Monitoring changes in our curriculum and impact on other subjects.", "http://www.norrisbank.stockport.sch.uk", "Norris Bank Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036066_coordinator"], [2014, "More effective language teaching, better language learning.", "Norris Bank Primary School", 7859.0, 1, 1, "Our long-term aim will be to adopt a new approach to language teaching here at Norris Bank that as well as being more effective and beneficial to our learners, will improve the capability of teaching and support staff to implement the new curriculum in a sustainable way. \r\n\r\nWe are aiming to change the model of modern language teaching in the school from September 2014 and need training for our teachers and support staff. They will need to improve their Spanish language competence, the cultural knowledge and understanding, and will also need to develop an understanding of language teaching methodology and have ideas to use in class. \r\nAs a school we would like to make links to a school in Spain as a result of this project. We would like to build a sustainable link that would be of benefit to the children in both countries. We would like to increase cross curricular links and bringing an intercultural understanding element to other subject areas and develop the connection between literacy and language learning. We would like to look for ideas and resources that will help us to improve our children\u2019s literacy through teaching them Spanish. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop capacity within school so that we have a group of teachers back and offer support to all the rest of the staff in order to develop a whole school approach to the teaching and learning of languages. We also want to further extend our community links and increase parental involvement in school life and address the issue of transition into Key stage 3. \r\n\r\nWe plan to develop a two-year project in our school which will lead to is achieving all the above aims. The project will involve five mobility activities to Spain. The MFL coordinator will take part in a series of two courses.\r\n\r\nTaking part in these courses will mean that our MFL coordinator will have an excellent understanding of the best way to embed Spanish into our curriculum and all participants will be much more confident in their Spanish language skills and cultural knowledge and will have a good bank of ideas and resources. They will then be in an excellent position to support the rest of our staff and develop a whole school approach to language learning.\r\n\r\nThis will help us with the  development of a new approach to language teaching that will be more effective and lead to better learning. It will also be a more sustainable approach that will help to develop all our colleagues language teaching skills. We will introduce Spanish as a new language and will work as a whole school to develop the Spanish teaching across the curriculum and within our daily routines\r\n\r\nOur staff will be more confident in their teaching, and have better skills which will put them in a better position professionally for the future. They will have access to excellent resources and teaching ideas, increased intercultural understanding and will be more open to other cultures and will develop an interest in other ways of life. We will bring in more cross curricular links and will also find ways to use languages to develop literacy skills. This will impact on our children\u2019s attainment across the curriculum. \r\n\r\nWith our whole school approach, we hope to develop a sense of excitement around languages, encouraging staff, pupils, parents and the community to be involved. We want our children to have an excellent first experience of language learning which will put them on the path of enjoying languages for life, and encourage them to continue with their language learning later in their education. We hope that this will impact positively on their outlook and increase our children\u2019s aspiration, opening them to the possibility of future careers abroad.", "http://www.norrisbank.stockport.sch.uk", "Norris Bank Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000177_coordinator"]]}}, "3EJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1364774400000, 1522454400000, "Silicon Nitride Coatings for Improved Implant Function", "Simulation Solutions Limited", "Articulating joint replacements represent a medical market exceeding \u20ac14 billion p.a. that is expected to rise as demographics reflect an ageing population. However, faster growth has been seen in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in primary interventions. The major cause of these revisions is that all joint replacements are prone to wear leading to loss of implant function. Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. In this work a variety of silicon nitride based coatings will be applied to different tribological scenarios related to total hip arthroplasty. The coatings\u2019 suitability in each scenario will be assessed against target profiles. In particular, it is important to consider coating performance within each of these applications under adverse conditions as well as those outlined in internationally utilised standards. To accomplish this, cutting-edge adverse simulation techniques, in vitro assays and animal models will be developed together with a suite of computational assessments to significantly enhance device testing in terms of predicting clinical performance.

We would like to make a fundamental change in our approach to language teaching. We believe that all members of staff in our school should be involved in language teaching, particularly class teachers and teaching assistants. In this way, our provision will become more sustainable, and it will greatly improve our pupils\u2019 learning experience. Languages will become embedded into our curriculum and into our daily routines. Languages will be visible everywhere in Tithe Barn. Children will see that we value language learning and other cultures, and they will understand the relevance and importance of languages to their own lives.\r\n\r\nWe are also very excited about developing a book project as a way to link literacy and language learning, encouraging our children to read French storybooks independently for their own enjoyment. \r\n\r\nWe intend to improve our teaching and learning by introducing new and innovative teaching methods and developing a link with a French school. We will improve our resources and learning environment and make improvements in planning, assessment, transition, cross curricular links.\r\n\r\nWe believe that taking a whole school approach in this way is the most effective way to establish an outstanding model of language teaching in our school. All of these improvements will mean that our school becomes established within our local authority as the hub of support and an example of good practice. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we need to build knowledge and capacity for high quality language teaching within our staff, developing and strengthening the role of teaching assistants. In light of the fact that primary school teachers are now required to teach languages, it is essential that our staff are given the opportunity to develop these skills in order to support their professional development and future career options.\r\n\r\nWe want to approach our teaching of French in a meaningful way, with first hand experiences that will bring language learning to life. We envisage developing strong links between language learning and literacy, with a particular focus on using books and storytelling, leading to an annual story sharing festival. \r\n\r\nOur school is known for its excellent teaching. Therefore, we want our provision of French to also be of this standard so that we are in a position to be able to offer advice and support to others. We need to ensure that we have systems in place such as effective assessment for languages, a high quality learning environment that uses authentic materials and supports pupils\u2019 learning, and clear progression.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we need to focus on establishing a detailed transition programme with our local high school, ensuring the progress made in primary school is recognised and built upon in secondary. \r\n\r\nWe will develop an innovative project in our school over two years involving 17 immersion courses in France, focusing on language improvement, developing cultural knowledge, language teaching methodology and creating links with a French school. \r\n\r\nAs a result of taking part in these courses, all staff will greatly improve their French language ability. They will be able to teach French confidently in their classes and use French as part of their daily routines.\r\n\r\nThey will have much more insight into French culture and will be able to find exciting ways to engage our pupils with cultural activities and cross curricular links. Language and culture will become much more embedded into the daily life of our school.\r\n\r\nStaff will experience new and innovative teaching ideas leading to outstanding teaching in our school. Pupils will enjoy language learning and there will be clear progression across year groups. \r\n\r\nThis project will have an impact on our school that will be long-lasting. There will be a change in the way we approach our language provision.
