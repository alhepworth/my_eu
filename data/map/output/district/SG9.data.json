Those young people often take hasty and ill-conceived decisions with regards to their education and professional life, are forced to accept job positions below their expectations, knowledge and skills, or are not able to find any employment at all. Entrepreneurship understood broadly, as a certain attitude towards life (being hardworking, active, courageous and independent) is a condition sine qua non for being able to find a satisfactory place on the labour market and in the society. The problem described above is caused mainly by 2 issues, which are being addressed in this project:\r\n1. Lack of innovative methods and tools in teaching entrepreneurship to youth\r\n2. Lack of a stable and constant cooperation between organizations, institutions and enterprises which promote entrepreneurship in particular European countries\r\n\r\nProject aims are:\r\n1. Promoting entrepreneurship education as a tool to support personal and professional development of young people, which in a broader perspective is crucial  to improving their situation on the labour market\r\n2. Improving the quality of working with youth through:\r\na. Collecting and disseminating innovative best practices from European countries (presented in a way that will make it possible for the readers to implement it easily) among teachers, NGO\u2019s promoting entrepreneurship and institutions related to education and the labour market\r\nb. Fostering national and international cooperation between organizations related to teaching and promoting entrepreneurship, as well as between those organizations and other stakeholders (like local or national government officials)\r\nc. Supporting professional development of teachers and youth workers representing partnering institutions as well as institutions not being involved directly in the project\r\n\r\nProject participants are 9 employees and representatives of partnering institutions (5 from Poland, 2 from Malta and 2 from UK), who are responsible for teaching and promoting entrepreneurship in their respective countries. They represent NGO\u2019s (Poland, UK), a university (Malta) and a public institution (Poland). They all have a broad and diverse experience with working for and with youth, especially on the field of entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nThe project will base on collecting and presenting detailed information about innovative methods, tools and solutions used to teach and promote entrepreneurship in 3 European countries. The final result of these actions will be an online publication which will be disseminated on at least 2 local meetings and an international conference in Warsaw. Materials needed for this publication will be collected by the participants through researches, contacting partner organizations, enterprises and institutions, as well as conversations with teachers and youth. 3 international project meetings are of a key importance here: they will let the participants have an in-depth insight into local conditions and collect data, pictures and videos needed. \r\nThe project will have a positive impact on:\r\n1. direct participants: \r\nimproved competences, linked to their professional profiles \r\nincreased sense of initiative and entrepreneurship\r\nincreased motivation and satisfaction in their daily work\r\nmore positive attitude towards the European project\r\nincreased opportunities for professional development\r\nincreased competence in foreign languages\r\nbroader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training or youth across countries;\r\ngreater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education\r\n\r\n2. Participating organizations:\r\na more modern, dynamic, committed and professional environment inside the organisation \r\ninnovative approaches to addressing their target groups\r\nincreased capacity and professionalism to work at EU/international level\r\nmore positive attitude towards the European project\r\n\r\n3. Other beneficiaries (like teachers and youth workers): \r\n\r\nimproved competences, linked to their professional profiles \r\ngreater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education\r\nmore positive attitude towards the European project\r\nbroader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training or youth across countries\r\n\r\nWe believe that in a longer perspective this project will contribute to improving the quality of teaching entrepreneurship and to create a more entrepreneurship-friendly environment in Europe. We want the long-term effect to be also creating a stable platforms for permanent cooperation between different stakeholders responsible for teaching and promoting entrepreneurship  - on national and European level. In a long run, this all will contribute to solving one of the most serious problems of the today\u2019s world: youth unemployment.", "http://www.peacechild.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA205-003680_1"]]}}}}
