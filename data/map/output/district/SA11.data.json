Finally, the developed stacks will be tested up to the 1 kWe level.

Between them, the partners have the sufficient experience and position to ensure that the technology developed will be market oriented and industrially relevant. The members of the METSOFC consortium have also been selected to provide the LEANEST and most efficient organisation possible. All the members have prior collaboration experience in other bilateral and multilateral partnerships.
