As a result, the power is generated very far from where it is meant to be consumed, causing an energy loss of 20% during the transfer (line-losses); they also need strong winds to function and are expensive to install and maintain.\n Newenergy21 has designed and developed UrbaVento, an innovative vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production (smart grid applications as well as off-grid), which features carbon-fibre \u201cwings\u201d, as well as a smart control and fault diagnostic software that simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting and tracks performance and savings. \nThe UrbaVento is a big leap forward compared to current wind turbines due to its unique advantages, which are firstly: its compatibility with the urban environment, since it features silent energy production at low wind speeds, starting from less than 3m/s, while it can produce up to 10 MWh of electricity per year when operating between 7 and 10m/s; it is suited for distributed power production because it can be installed anywhere due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Secondly, it offers a higher return on investment since it is cheaper to install, operate and maintain, due to its low number of moving parts, the absence of a gearbox and the location of all serviceable components are at ground level, enabling the turbine to seamlessly reach its envisaged life-cycle; Thirdly, its wings can be used as a reflective screen, making it an attractive medium for advertising.\nThe Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with 10 turbines installed in different locations, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.", null, 51631.0, 1, 2, "URBAVENTO", null, null, null, "h2020_198845_927975624"]]}}, "8NE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "World of Opportunities", "Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs", 34822.0, 10, 10, "We young people have the right and responsibility to be active citizens and take part in forming their local community, country and Europe.

The six participants of this meeting are the preparation team members for the seminar. They come from Norway, United Kingdom, Slovenia and Estonia. As hosts, the Norwegian meeting participants will manage the practical arrangements, but all will contribute to facilitating the meeting. The main method is group discussion, since the meeting is small and participants are few. The seminar A2 is the main activity of the project and it will be held 2-9 October at Gulsrud camp centre, Buskerud, Norway. The activity will involve 26 participants in the age 18-30 and 6 prep team members.

We will use a wide variety of non-formal methods to meet different learning styles that that the participants may have.Impact on participants: - As youth workers and leaders, the participants will gain competences that are relevant for their tasks in the organisations. Most important are the knowledge, skills and attitude about theme mentioned in part E.2. These will allow them to take the lead in planning of activities that should be accessible by all kind of young people. - At the seminar the participants will meet colleagues working with similar tasks as themselves. The programme offers many opportunities to to share good practice and together reflect on common challenges in youth work. The intense interaction during the seminar will encourage the participants to continue the cooperation also after the activity.- Even if the participants are in the role of multipliers as youth workers and leaders, what they learn at the seminar is likely to be useful in their everyday life. They get a better understanding of inclusion issues, become more critical and aware of how people around them act and speak regarding the theme. Impact on the organisations involved:- The participants bring the gained competences from the seminar to their home organisations, so the organisations get better prepared to facilitate inclusive activities.- By becoming more inclusive, the organisations get potential to grow and to start new types of activities.- Continuous learning process in work life is important to keep up the quality of the work done. This seminar will encourage youth workers and leaders to do their work even better and thereby inspire also other workers. Wherever possible, the participants could arrange workshops in their organisations related to the seminar theme, and likely they multiply mainly their changed attitude in the organisations.  - The seminar participants are as youth workers and leaders role models to many members in the organisations. Their deepen understanding of the theme and inclusive approach at work and everyday life will have a positive affect on the members, as well as others in the community.- By working together on this project, the cooperation between organisations get tighter and they can contact each other about sharing practice related to social inclusion or rural youth work in general. Impact on the preparation team is on similar areas as for the participants. Additionally they gain intercultural competences from working in an international team.The desired impact on local level is that the participants work as multipliers in their own communities, through empowering their peers or taking an active role in changing old/negative attitudes.

A greater public awareness, the need to protect natural resources and increase the food safety requires the development and implementation of new environmental regulations. There is therefore an urgent need to address this negative environmental impact of salmon farming. To date, two means are available 1) preventing fish escaping by improving cage design and containment or 2) produce sterile fish. Although considerable technological advances have been made in the design of cage systems, no system will be fully reliable as escapees through natural disasters are inevitable. Therefore, there is a clear need to revive the previously abandoned triploid concept as the only means, known to date, to address the environmental impact of escapees contributing to genetic pollution. Furthermore, the production of sterile fish would be very beneficial to salmon breeders as a way to protect their domesticated stocks which are the result of long and costly selection processes aiming to improve important traits such as disease resistance, growth performance and flesh quality. Triploidy would also alleviate early maturation problems and subsequent welfare associated infringements and decreased quality standards.

We have identified 3 teachers who will undertake training in one of the two modern languages we are taking forward as a school and who will learn and disseminate the methodology to embed the target language into School.   We made sure that all levels are covered from Early to Second so that all learners will benefit from the participation of the staff in the projects.  These 3 teachers have varying degrees of experience and confidence in modern languages but have the enthusiasm and motivation to take this project forward as they can see the huge benefits linked to the initiative.  \r\n\r\nThe 3 members of staff will participate in immersion courses in both France and Spain, improving their skills in the modern language, developing their confidence and learning new methodology and experiencing new resources and ideas to improve the teaching and learning of Modern languages within our school.

We will find partners abroad through the new links that we will make by participating in the immersion projects and courses.

They will have raised awareness of the wider world and cultures, promoting a increased interest in the world around them.  The impact will be that our learners will be successful learners, confident individuals, responsible global citizens and effective contributors to the wider world which will be opening up to them through their involvement with modern languages.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of C.f.E there is recognition of the importance of language learning as a communicative skill which will enable our young people to participate fully in a global society and economy.
