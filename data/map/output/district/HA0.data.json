Based on the exchange of good practices and the proposals made by more than 60 young Muslims from five entities across Europe, the need to take a further step was concluded in order to build a stable European network of young muslim organizations actively working with their neighbours for the promotion of inclusion, diversity, intercultural dialogue and interreligious exchange, common values of freedom, tolerance and respect for human rights and the prevention of violence.\r\n\r\nWith this new project we want to allow the Young Muslim Associations from all over Europe to have a great impact not only in European, but also inclusion of refugees awareness in order to end the rise of Islamophobia and xenophobic behaviour. To achieve this, a sustainable strategic partnership will be established over time, whit young muslim organizations from Spain, Italy, Germany and UK the capacity of these entities for networking will be increased at transnational level and the involvement of these entities in the social problems of the neighbourhoods of several European cities will be increased.\r\n\r\nThis project will work directly on two complementary but different areas. On one side,  the young muslims trained as intercultural mediators in the previous project will begin to promote social projects of inclusion and social awareness in their neighbourhoods in collaboration with indigenous entities. Fostering cultural diversity as a European value and promoting tolerance through joint work on an equal basis with the social entities of the territories of the partner entities.\r\nOn the other hand, this project aims to encourage the inclusion of refugees who arrive in Europe from Syria and other countries in conflict, teaching them the culture of the country that will host them, showing them the values of European citizenship and informing them about the European resources to promote their integration.\r\nDuring 20 months there will be 3 transnational meetings, several virtual meetings, some materials will be created  and many dissemination activities will be made. In addition, a learning activity will be created where 28 participants will test the results, helping to finish some of the parts of them and will promote the participation of the neighbours of Orriols in the creation of the same ones. Thanks to all this will be created: for an inclusive Europe, a multicultural Europe\r\n- The Audiovisual Guide \"FOR AN INCLUSIVE EUROPE\" aimed at refugees and migrants to facilitate their inclusion. To achieve that, a guide will be created to gather information on European culture. Also this guide will inform the refugees about the resources available to newcomers and it will have some testimonies from refugees who have already been able to call home to their host country, as well as testimonies from neighbours with useful tips for inclusion. They will also have specific materials for their training.\r\n- The Audiovisual Guide \"FOR A MULTICULTURAL EUROPE\" aimed to the neighbours of European cities where the partners have done some social projects. It will have living testimonials from people who have had to leave their home and they come to a unknown place with a strange language. Also this guide will include migrant testimonies where they will tell things about their food and culture (how to make a typical dish, curiosities of their countries, experiences ...)\r\n- A solidarity network where migrants and european people will carry out projects of social awareness and inclusion to improve their neighbourhoods.\r\nNon-formal and informal methodologies will be used to promote the close relations between young participants and the neighbors, especially in the learning activity. This project will have the collaboration of expert technicians (Possible examples: University of Valencia , Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Orriols Convive, Movement against Intolerance, SOS Racisme, CEIMIGRA ...).\r\n\r\nWe want this project, will become the seed of a great tree that shelters people regardless of their religion or ethnicity in tolerance and equity.

Also the participants will develop their skills to become cultural mediators and to implement these projects for the integration of young migrants and refugees.That is the reason why six entities such as the Association of Muslim Youth in Valencia (Spain), Norges Unge Muslime (Norway), Giovani Musulmani d'Italia (Italy) and musilm Association of Ireland (Ireland), Muslim Association of Britain (UK) and Organization of Muslim in Hungary (Hungary) have designed a youth exchange, consistent with the priorities of the Erasmus + program for 2016:-reaching out to young people with fewer opportunities including refugees, asylum seekers and migrants;-promoting diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, common values of freedom, tolerance and respect of human rights as well as on projects enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and sense of initiative of young people;In this youth exchange will participate 60 young people and 6 young leaders from six organizations of young Muslims of Europe with local associations and neighbour representatives  of Orriols and collaborative entities, for 10 days in the city of Valencia in order to carry out:- A exchange of good practices  where Muslim youths will acquire skills as intercultural and social mediators.- Projects to improve marginal neighborhoods and to integrate refugees and segregated groups  through joint efforts.- Campaigns, measures and actions to combat xenophobia, racism, to promote the  multiculturalism and to achieve a full integration of young migrants and refugees.All of this through formal and informal methodologies consisting of working groups, participatory development, street activities... everything with the help of prestigeous experts, expert institutions on the cultural mediation (University of Valencia, City Hall Valencia Orriols Convive, Movement against Intolerance, SOS Racisme, CeiMigra ...) and the neighbors of Orriols (who will help to generate proposals for social projects for this area particularly affected by the crisis).In these meeting, we will develop the skills and competences  that will help us to build those bridges and generate social projects, to achieve the objectives set and  get a great impact in youth and in our communities. A project sustainable in time, that it becomes larger, stronger and more able to build a multicultural society without hatred.We want to build bridges between cultures but also contribute to the social  improvement for all residents in Europe, no matter our religion, our origin or ethnicity or religion.

Around 40% of the world\u2019s energy consumption is dedicated to the production of materials and chemicals. Thus, there is a need to develop high-performance materials based on renewable resources, simpler to synthesise and cost effective. Carbon materials derived from renewable resources (e.g., biomass) are ideal candidates to meet these needs. The main objective of our proposed Innovative Training Network is to develop new scientific knowledge, capability, technology, and commercial products for biomass-derived carbons (BCs); thus impacting the way that Europe uses and innovates with sustainable carbon materials. This will be accomplished through outstanding research and training programmes for fourteen early-stage researchers (ESRs). Our proposed research programme is feasible given the varied expertise and knowledge of the academic and industrial participants. We expect that GreenCarbon will improve our ability to rationally design a range of functionalised BC-derived materials using different individual and synergistically coupled processes and expand their practical applications. Our research programme comprehensively covers all aspects from precursors (the nature of biomass) to processing (thermochemical conversion, porosity development, chemical functionalisation) and application (e.g., CO2 capture, heterogeneous catalysis and chemicals from biomass) enabling a unique design of engineered sustainable BC materials. At the same time, our training programme is designed with the aim to empower the ESRs through the provision of a comprehensive and coherent training package, which includes complementary competencies and knowledge in all the science, engineering and business skills so as to be capable of deploying new technologies within different environments both inside and outside of academia.", null, 3160339.0, 5, 15, "GreenCarbon", null, null, null, "h2020_205578_922670791"]]}}}}
