Caversham have recently been awarded Rights Respecting Schools Award Level 2 and full accreditation of the International Schools Award. The school bases its teaching and learning around the 5 'Core Values': Determination, Enthusiasm, Cooperation, Respect and Compassion; with children's rights being of paramount importance. As part of school improvement, Caversham identified the need to develop the European dimension in the school with the aims of: enhancing the teaching and learning of citizenship across the school; empowering children to become active citizens and learners and providing opportunities to learn about sustainable development through the UN Global Goals.\r\n\r\nThe broad objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n*To understand how citizenship is taught in other countries across Europe and how this links into other curriculum areas\r\n*To work collaboratively with our partner school on joint projects in relation to citizenship, environment (sustainability) and children's rights.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 we used etwinning to find a school with similar interests and we successfully developed a partnership with Nuolialan koulu in Pirkkala, Finland. The school is a large school made up of pre-school and primary (grades 1- 6) and is expanding to include secondary school pupils (grades 7-9). The school is involved in a sustainability project and, as part of the introduction of a new Finnish curriculum, has a particular interest in global citizenship.\r\n\r\nAfter an introductory project sharing information about both schools, Nuolialan koulu applied for KA1 funding to visit us to understand our teaching of citizenship and with a particular focus on provision for children with SEN. Two teachers came to  Caversham in November 2016 and undertook job-showing activities and interviews with subject coordinators.\r\n\r\nBoth schools have continued to work together and, in order to meet Caversham Primary's development needs, have planned for teachers from Caversham to visit Finland to better understand the teaching of citizenship in other countries and to benefit from learning about Nuolialan koulu's sustainability project. Two teachers from Caversham will travel to Finland and participate in a week of timetabled observations, interviews and joint planning time in order to plan a detailed project of continued cooperation between the two schools. They will gather information, keep records of observations, report back to all stakeholders and communicate their visit through a blog on the school Virtual Learning Environment.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be such that Caversham can: compare citizenship teaching between countries and use this learning to enhance the teaching and learning in our school; plan collaborative projects with a focus on citizenship and sustainability; empower pupils to work in partnership with Finnish pupils to promote positive change in the world; and develop a scheme of work/series of lessons across the school so that the whole school community will benefit from the partnership working.\r\n\r\nThis work will be shared with governors, at subject coordinator network meetings and through a series of dedicated staff training time in order to have maximum impact on staff and pupils. The wider teaching community will also benefit from the work undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated thoroughly and further opportunities for continued collaboration identified.", "http://www.cavershamprimary.org", "Caversham Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035974_coordinator"]]}}, "8NN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1359676800000, 1485820800000, "Taking Nanotechnological Remediation Processes from Lab Scale to End User Applications for the Restoration of a Clean Environment", "R3 Environmental Technology Limited", "NANOREM is designed to unlock the potential of nanoremediation and so support both the appropriate use of nanotechnology in restoring land and aquifer resources and the development of the knowledge-based economy at a world leading level for the benefit of a wide range of users in the EU environmental sector.\nNANOREM uniquely takes a holistic approach to examining how the potential for nanoremediation can be developed and applied in practice, to enhance a stronger development of nanoremediation markets and applications in the EU.
