The production of smell free fertilizer will be based on anaerobic fermenting of manure in a bioreactor. The insecticide production will be based on growing specific cyanobacteria proven to be insect repellent to cabbage root fly in a fermentation reactor for subsequent drying to a flake state. The final stage will consist of mixing the solid fertilizer with the small amounts of cyanobacterial flakes (1-10 kg flakes/100 ton fertilizer) to produce granules by protrusion technology with the moisture content of 5-10%. No industrial process can currently manufacture this combined insect repellent-fertilizer product due to lack of carrier substance for the insect repellent that also will add fertilizing value and delayed release. There exist currently no efficient organic product to control adult cabbage root fly. The following novel and innovative features will be developed: \u2022 Development of a drying technology for the cyanobacteria biomass to flakes with humidity 15-20% \u2022 Production of smell-free solid organic fertilizer from manure in &lt;2 weeks/batch, humidity 20-30% \u2022 Development of an innovative and novel extruder chamber with an in-line humidity sensor feedback controlled heating and with vacuum drying of mixed fertilizer/insecticide to ensure rapid drying from ~20% down to 8 \u00b1 2% before entering the compression zone of the extruder allowing a controlled co-extrusion with starch obtaining a fixed coating thickness with &lt;10% variance \u2022 Development of a co-extrusion process to produce starch-coated pellets with a moisture content of 8 \u00b1 2% ensuring even coating thickness of the total pellet surface that can be sold cost-effectively for \u20ac50/ton \u2022 Obtain \u20ac190 Mn in repellent-fertilizer &amp; equipment sales for Year5", 269840.0, 2716785.0, 8, 17, "ECOBUG", "http://www.ecobug.eu/", null, null, "fp7_94369_998799883"], [1243814400000, 1306800000000, "Tracking and Security System with Built-in Energy Generation for Containers", "Haswell Moulding Technologies Ltd", "Approximately 90% of the world\u2019s cargo moves in containers and there are 15 million shipping-containers in circulation which provide for approximately 250 million moves per year. More than 60 million containers are handled in the main EU ports alone. These containers are forwarded by rail, sea or road transport. The transport sector provides more than ten million jobs and generates 10% of EU wealth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to about one trillion Euros a year. Huge savings can be made for the SMEs in the transport sector by securing delivery time and place, improving the capacity utilisation of containers and reducing theft. A project focusing on electronic container security demonstrated savings of $378 to $462 per container per shipment due to improved monitoring of container movement and tampering attempts. The idea is to develop a tracking and security system with energy source and energy generation to be retrofitted in containers to enable tracking and security independently of fixed check point installations and satellite navigation systems. The supply chain will enjoy benefits from lower shrinkage and increased efficiency. The system will meet demands for increased security in the supply chain and provides location information and protection against crime. The system will increase security against terrorist attacks as it will sense and report tampering attempts before arriving to any crowded place and the container can be halted to reduce potential impacts. The aim of the project is to develop a system utilising a combination of commercial transmitters and cell phone base stations for low power, low cost positioning. The navigation will be based on signal parameters and IDs from commercial transmitters and GSM base stations combined with information in a central data base.

The most commonly used concrete piles are the pre-cast concrete piles and the cast in-situ concrete piles. Cast in-situ concrete piles are limited in the length or depth at which it could be cast unlike pre-cast piles (it can be extended to greater depths using mechanical joints). Apart from its advantage in installation depth, pre-cast concrete piles are becoming more preferred because of the decreasing length of the individual pile sections before installation. There are equipments and method available for concrete pile integrity testing that is time and cost effective (e.g. ultrasonic testing), but they have limitations especially when testing pre-cast piles. Therefore, our idea is to produce an innovative quality assurance system to enable a cost effective, efficient and reliable means of monitoring the integrity of pre-cast concrete piles through out its supply chain from manufacturing up until after its installation. The proposed project would involve the development of: \u00b7 A means of recording and accessing pile information (pile number, batch number, pile location, periodic integrity check results etc) using an embedded ID tag on each pile; \u00b7 A means of verifying a number of piles used to form a segmented pile has been properly driven (installed) into the ground and can hold a given amount of weight. This would be done by developing an innovative concrete pile manufacturing process to slightly embed a conductive circuit path through the pile common failure areas to allow current passage through the pile, which would allow for the detection of changes in resistivity due to cracks or strain to the concrete pile using an intelligent monitoring technique.

However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity.

This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.
