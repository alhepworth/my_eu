The European Commission aims to increase the use of design for innovation and growth across Europe; raise awareness of how design-driven innovation increases efficiency in public services and drives business growth; create capacity and competencies to deliver these policies (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/policy/design/index_en.htm). According to a recent recommendation (2015) by the Directorate General for Internal Policies national strategies should amongst other things aim to promote a positive image of science, raise awareness of science, make improvements in school based science teaching and learning, increase students' interest in science. Education and training play a fundamental role in achieving the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 objectives. Investment in education and training for skills development is essential to boost growth and competitiveness: skills determine Europe's capacity to increase productivity.Project DESIGNSTEM is based on the objectives of \u201cEducation and Training 2020\u201d (ET 2020) in education up to 2020: 1) making lifelong learning and mobility a reality; 2) improving the quality and efficiency of education and training (http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/general_framework/ef0016_en.htm). It is aimed at the internationalization of education and growing use of digital learning, supporting the creation of flexible learning pathways in line with learners' needs.The objective of DESIGNSTEM is to contribute to devising, building and disseminating work methods and resources for educators and learners in the fields of design and STEM; to support synergies between education, research and innovation activities, the digitisation of quality learning content and promoting the use of ICT as a driver for systemic change to increase the quality and relevance of open design and STEM education. The number of participants is 10, along the 3 strategic lines of the project:1) Research and development of innovative STEM educational methods and tools, using ICT: the LUMA Centre of Helsinki University, Finland; University of Piraeus Research Centre (UPRC), Greece.2) Applied/vocational design education: the design department of Kuressaare Regional Training Centre, HMC College, The Netherlands; Tartu Art School, Estonia; Gutenbergschule, Germany. 3) Applied/vocational STEM and IT education: Middlesbrough College, UK; ITT Buonarroti, Italy;  Polytechnic School of Leiria, Portugal; Faculty of Information Studies, Slovenia.Three methods will be applied: design-based research, whole-task model and agile methodology. DBR is an a methodology for understanding how, when, and why educational innovations work in practice. Design-based research experiments include addressing complex problems in real, authentic contexts in collaboration with practitioners; designing learning environments and developing theories of learning research and development through continuous cycles of design, enactment, analysis, and redesign. The work process of devising the exercises in the toolkit will be based on the whole task model. Whole-task models support the development of educational programs for students who need to learn and transfer professional competences to a varied set of real-world contexts and settings. Whole-task models try to deal with complexity without losing sight of the relationships between elements (Merriboer).  The work process of developing the IO will be based on agile methodology, an alternative to traditional project management, typically used in software development. Agile development methodology provides opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development life-cycle. This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams must present a potentially shippable product increment.Within 3 years, in 7 training workshops, 10 educational organizations- have collected a resource of the best existing methods, tools and cases of e-teaching design and STEM subjects;- have gained new knowledge and skills in design-based research, whole-task models, agile work methodology in creating educational e-tools;- have worked with ca 100 design and STEM concepts/principles;- have designed and developed an open e-toolkit of ca 30 educational applications, animations, games and a glossary of the main design and science terms in English and the languages of the partner countries;- have tested and applied the e-toolkit in their everyday teaching and learning activities;- have disseminated the e-toolkit to other educational organizations in their and neighbouring countries.The main expected impact will be the improved knowledge and skills on integrated design and STEM of VET, secondary school, colleges, applied sciences university teachers and students, and the better employability of the latter in design and STEM fields.", "http://www.mbro.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-EE01-KA202-017347_5"], [2014, "ALLIER MOBILITE PLUS", "The Further Education Corporation of Middlesbrough College", 164242.0, 5, 13, "Our three vocational schools have made International Openness a key priority in their school project. Working together in a consortium for the second year,all three schools want ,with the 'ALLIER MOBILITY PLUS'project,to improve students' employability chances through work placements in European companies and to enhance the European dimension of their schools by receiving young people from European partner schools for work placements in French companies and by staff training in European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur schools are located in a region ( Allier) where employment is limited and (high youth unemployment rate). Our students,because of the location of our region  are seldom in contact with other European young people. Besides,as they lack information and self-confidence,they are not likely to leave our area even if they can't find a job here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe positive impact former projects have had on the students in terms of linguistic benefits,professional skills and above all personal skills ( self- esteem,adaptability,independence,self-confidence)but also the interest and desire to work abroad born from the communication on past  work experiences abroad and the dissemination  of the results of these experiences lead us to consider enlarging the training and work placements funded by the Erasmus + programme to all our students whatever their level of qualification.Considering the fact that past mobilities limited the possibility to go on work placements abroad to students preparing for an industrial NVQ level 3 certificate and even for one school to the sole Euro -Electrotechnics CLIL class,we come to think that enlarging the possibility to all our classes requires 81 training grants (about 13 per year per school). This enlargement would give the possibility to maximize the training of all the students whatever their academic results ( this is not a selection criterion) and to boys and girls alike without discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development  of the European dimension involves receiving students from our partners and sending 26 of our teachers on professional training periods abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students ( sent and received) will be placed in companies in strict compliance with the training framework as work placements are an integral part of the training ,are assessed and taken into account for the Diploma.The work placements will be adapted to the students' skills ,in particular their language skills. They will be carefully selected in order to avoid the risk of a failed mobility but make the experience  a complete success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers selected for a mobility will be received by our partner schools abroad  for observing activities,mostly but not only as the final objective is the enrichment of their practice ,other activities can be considered (team teaching).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each school  mobilities will be managed by the steering committee and the teachers concerned by the mobility in close and regular  relationship with the inter-schools steering committee. The steering committees will see to the regular assessment of the project within their school as well as within the consortium and with their European intermediary or host  partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the project will be made before,after and during the mobility abroad.\r\n\r\nWe expect this project will allow us to send all the motivated and selected students and teachers on training and work placements abroad, that they will improve their language skills,acquire new skills which  for students will result in   better  results at their examination  and in the long run better employability. We expect  students will gain confidence and awareness that it is possible and necessary to  be mobile to find a job and that mobility can be a driving force for ambition.\r\n\r\nConcerning staff mobility we expect the dissemination of their experience and new  pratices acquired or observed.\r\n\r\nReceiving young Europeans will allow the students who haven't been on work placement abroad to benefit from the exchange.\r\n\r\nAs far as our schools are concerned we hope to increase the number of students who want to attend the CLIL class and /or apply for a mobility.\r\n\r\nIn the long term ,we expect our schools will gain in reputation so that it will be students' choice to enroll in our school and not the result of a lack of possibilities. Thanks to the European dimension, our schools will be better recognised by French and European companies and stronger ties will be forged with them.", "http://www.mbro.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001658_6"]]}}}}
