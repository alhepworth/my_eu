Two students from Falu Fri came to St.Angela's six years ago to make a video as part of their final year project. During the course of their visit it transpired that they had made all the arrangements fro the trip on their own and had had come to the UK on their own. St.Angela's was invited to attend a model UN held annually by Falu Fri and has done so every year since helping those students who attend develop their independent learning skills. \r\nIn March 2014 St.Angela's was awarded National Teaching School status and was required to build an alliance of partner schools. \r\nFalu Fri began a new humanities course that included a week in London and students and staff coming to St.Angela's. It was clear to both schools that a series of synergies existed and also great learning opportunities if the partnership was to be further developed. Falu Fri became a partner school in the East London Teaching School Alliance. It was ten decided to strengthen the partnership following a needs analysis. St.Angela's had a need fro independent learning and Falu Fri a need for improved impact evaluation of professional development. \r\nA two strand project was conceived that would link together students and staff inputs with an overall focus on independent learning.\r\nThe objectives of the project are;\r\n1 To have an annual exchange of students between the two schools in which students from St.Angela's take part in a Model UN in Falu Fri and humanities students from Falu Fri spend a week in London. Both groups of students will stay with families in the host country.\r\n2 To ensure students take a lead in arranging parts of the programme in their respective countries and develop some independent learning skills as a result.\r\n3. To ensure all students taking part in the project reflect and understand the context of global citizenship in which they are working and to reach a deeper cultural understanding than would have been the case without the project\r\n 4 To improve attainment of students through increased motivation as a result of being part of the project\r\n5  To have an exchange of staff between the two schools so that staff from Falu Fri can deliver professional development to staff in St.Angela's and the East London Teaching school Alliance so that these schools may develop their own strategies for independent learning. Staff from the United Kingdom schools would then have the opportunity to spend a week at Falu Fri to observer these techniques first hand and then implement in their own schools. When in  the United Kingdom staff from Falu Fri will study in more depth the impact evaluation of professional development and implement this in their own school. \r\n6 The project to be totally inclusive and in its target group will include students who are at risk of dropping out of education.\r\n7. To address the need of St.Angela's and schools in the East London Teaching School Alliance to have a greater focus on independent learning.\r\n8. To address the need of Falu Fri to address the development and impact evaluation of professional development in the school.\r\nThe participants will be divided into two sections, staff and students.\r\nStaff from each partner school will visit the other to have professional development and top present professional development on the key aims of independent learning and the impact evaluation of professional development. During the lifetime of the project we estimate over 20 students will beautiful directly but many more indirectly from the staff insurers that will raise both motivation and attainment.\r\nStudents from St.Angela's will take part in a model UN and stay with Swedish host families. Students from the Falu Fri humanities course will stay with English families while carrying out their studies in London.\r\nStudents will plan part of the programme and will be encouraged to maintain contact before and after te exchanges.\r\nStaff will also make exchange visits in order present professional developed on independent learning and impact evaluation. staff will have the time to work in each others schools.\r\nThe methodology is one of exchange visits, planned student activities, staff exchange visitors, sharing of professional development and both partner schools and the students gaining from more robust approaches to dependent learning and professional development respectively.\r\nThe result will be more motivated students with improved attainment.\r\nSt.Angela's to have a much improved ethos of independent learning and Falu Fri to have a more evaluative approach to professional development. all results will be measured and for professional development activities the Guskey methodology will be used.\r\nimpact is envisaged at an individual and system level as the aims of the project are met.

Currently many teachers at our school do not have formal French qualifications and lack the confidence and knowledge to successfully teach outstanding French lessons. Additionally, although our school has a strong international focus due to the diversity of pupils' backgrounds, we would like to have a stronger European focus. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to improve the quality of French teaching. We believe that the opportunity to have intensive language lessons and sessions on MFL pedagogy will greatly increase the confidence of those participants who attend the course. Furthermore, practical opportunities to implement their acquired language skills through extra-curricular activities will boost participants' confidence and enthusiasm.  On return these staff will share the resources they have obtained and the skills they have learnt with other teachers in their year and Key Stage. The MFL Coordinator will share the results of the project at a school level as well as at a local and regional level (through Teach First conference presentations, Association for Language Learning regional meetings and through the Elmhurst Primary School's teaching school). A longer-term potential impact is that the MFL Coordinator would like to arrange a Newham Primary Languages Conference, which would partly consist of sharing the results of this project. This has the potential to impact many pupils in schools throughout the borough.\r\n\r\nThe second key objective is to enhance the inter-cultural awareness of staff and pupils at our school. Those staff who attend the course will gain a fantastic insight into French culture including the history of Lyon, the cuisine of the local area and education in France. Furthermore, we plan to involve other pupils and staff on this project through a pre-departure assembly, a blog and class activities researching the local area. In the long-term we aim to forge a successful partnership with a French primary school and to use our new expertise to plan linguistic and cross-curricular activities which will enhance the learning and cultural awareness of all pupils involved.", "http://www.elmhurstprimary.co.uk/", "Elmhurst Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036037_coordinator"]]}}, "8QP": {"nhs": {"data": [["RWK", "East Ham Care Centre", "nhs_RWK89"]]}}, "9QD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Developing the European Dimension through developing teach competence and confidence.", "St Bonaventure's School", 8576.0, 1, 1, "This project will enable us to build capacity within the school so that more teachers are able to offer two languages at GCSE level and have the skills to deliver their second language as effectively as their first language.  One of our teachers will participate in the project. She will improve her  language skills and develop a greater understanding of the Spanish culture which will enable  her to approach her Spanish lessons with more confidence and a readiness and enthusiasm to share her skills and knowledge with her classes, her department and the rest of the school community.  She will participate in 3 training courses  leading initially to DELE B1 and ultimately the DELE C1. The training will include developing listening, reading, writing and speaking skills, grammatical knowledge and an in depth understanding of Spanish culture and  traditions. The training will take place at a language school in Murcia in Spain where we have recently set up a link with a local school. \r\nFor the participating teacher results will include more extensive use of Spanish in the classroom and more encouragement of pupil use of the target language, the development of materials and resources bringing Spanish culture into the classroom and pupils in \r\nGCSE classes will be on track to achieve their target grades. The MFL department will benefit through CPD sessions during which the participating teacher will share the skills and knowledge gained during the training. The whole-school will benefit from having specialist teachers delivering GCSE Spanish and from the the development of cross curricular projects across a range of subject areas, in particular those not yet involved in projects with a  European Dimension.  Long-term we hope that the participating teacher will be able to deliver A level Spanish, that the experience of lifelong learning will inspire other teachers to participate in similar programmes and that the European dimension is extended to every subject area in the school through initiatives such as work experience in Europe.", "http://www.stbons.org", "St Bonaventure's School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012930_coordinator"]]}}}}
