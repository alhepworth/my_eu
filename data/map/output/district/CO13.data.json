The main aim of the project is to compare the school-education of refugees and immigrants between European partners: Adana in Turkey, Frinton-on-Sea in UK, Palermo in Italy,Petra in Greece and  Lousado in Portugal. We are interested in exchanging best-practice in supporting immigrants and refugees, so that students, teachers and educators create a conscious society where there is cultural tolerance, social justice and the equality for all. The project will involve activities that will develop knowledge and understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and language, raise the awareness of global issues such as inequality, conflict and sustainable development. Throughout students will be able to develop and increase skills in critical thinking, cooperation and teamwork, communication and having multiple perspectives. For example team work will be explored when students are visiting host countries and working on common activities such as creating a piece of art or music. Sharing ideas and experiences will enable students from all partners to learn from each other and create mutual respect. In particular it is hoped that experiences will enrich the lives of refugee students who at times don\u2019t see education as valued. Learning will be extended to students who are not immigrants as it will enable to develop skills to combat prejudice, xenophobia and discrimination.During the project students will be exposed to at least one foreign language and they will be encouraged to learn words and phrases that will help them to communicate when on exchange visits.      The result of this project will be published support manual with helpful methods for schools and teachers/educators. In this it will include immigrant stories which will also be a base of teaching resources of immigration and life as refugee. These resources will be available on especially created project website and free teacher sharing websites such as TES in UK long after the project finished.  Dedicated website will include all published materials created by students and any resources, ideas that might be useful either in teaching refugees and immigrants or as awareness of issues relating to this. The final project outcomes and resources produced will enable future refugees (such as with recent agreements or relocation between governments from UK and Turkey,18.March.2016),to settle easier as the expertise developed during the project will be available to share, on line as well as face-to-face (part of Ambassadorial work for the project).     71 students and 29 accompanying persons will take part in the project.     Two transnational meetings are planned in Italy on 20-21.October.2016 and in Greece on 01-02.June.2017.     Our project will start on 05.09.2018 and end on 04.03.2018.", "http://tendringtechnologycollege.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-TR01-KA219-034919_2"], [2018, "#PNSD #AD: in Europa per l'Innovazione Digitale", "TENDRING TECHNOLOGY COLLEGE", 52556.0, 8, 12, "The consortium is structured around a theme / need of strong impact and relevance for the current Italian regulatory and educational scenery: the adoption and implementation of Piano Nazionale Scuola Digitale (Decreto n.851 of 27/10/2015) through the 35 actions foreseen in it and the Piano Nazionale per la Formazione (of 3/10/2016). The action # 28 has been immediately revealed of crucial importance: it deals with the designation  of a \"Digital Trainer \" for each school, which has a strategic role in the spread of digital innovation.\r\n\r\nThe 37 partner institutions of the consortium, therefore, are particularly aware about the need to allow the digital trainer to have formative experiences abroad, relating to the application of digital technology in everyday teaching.\r\n\r\nThe EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT PLAN of the consortium has a strong intrinsic unity, increased by the fact that all schools participating in the consortium refer to Marconi Service TSI, a national excellence acting as planning and operational branch at the USR. Since 1995 it has been coordinating, following, monitoring, evaluating and disseminating all the activities and experiences related to the implementation of digital skills in the region and it has a major role in the current project.\r\nAll phases of the project also will be unified within an ETWINNING dedicated project/group that, in addition to further strengthen the digital skills of those AD who still do not know the eTwinning platform, will allow an even greater regional and international cooperation, a careful  and constant monitoring of all activities as well as their wider dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe OBJECTIVES of this project are all aimed at increasing methodological and digital skills to the  AD who act as driving force for the whole school community and for the network of regional training.\r\n\r\nThe TRAINING ACTIVITIES will focus all around the attendance of high-level digital technology training as well as job shadowing activities by partner schools.\r\nTherefore, starting from Summer 2018, AD will be able to  take  chosen courses (ie, the York Associates courses in York, at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK or at ETI in Malta; or our best choices, courses at the Future Classroom Lab Brussels) or get in touch  with the partner schools to organise job shadowing experiences.\r\n\r\nThe FOREIGN PARTNERS of the project have been chosen due to a dense network of relationships which the leader of the consortium in the first place (in the figure of Servizio Marconi) and the project participants can boast as a result of long-term activities in this area.\r\nThe regional eTwinning representative  and other eTwinning colleagues have also been able to count on the variety of contacts and experiences already implemented within the platform and ask absolutely reliable and, above all, \"tested\" on the use of digital in everyday teaching foreign partners, to actively join this project.\r\n\r\nThe SELECTION of participants AD has been done  according to objective and qualified criteria: territorial representation for a guarantee of wider diffusion, belonging to the regional network of schools and training center and to the  most active schools on the subject; possession of methodological and technological  expertise that makes the AD already a trainer for other digital trainers and staff of all the schools.\r\n\r\nMONITORING process and EVALUATION methods will be continuous, throughout the project in order to assure quality and sustainability to the project itself.\r\n\r\nThe IMPACT of the training activities conducted abroad by the participants will have a very positive impact of all those involved and in different contexts, from the personal, to the college, from the local to the wider professional community, at regional and national levels.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION of these experiences will therefore be conducted in \"circles\", gradually larger, in order to reach not only the \"experts\" but the widest possible audience of stakeholders involved and interested in the issues of the application of digital technology in educational settings, thanks to the dissemination that Servizio Marconi, USR and the Ministry of Education will undertake to give prominence to the experience of school-administration synergy that at present is unique within the national scene.", "http://tendringtechnologycollege.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047418_2"]]}}}}
