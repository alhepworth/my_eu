The apparent benefits from the use of the e-FlyWatch system are the reduction of the resulting damages in FVO production, as well as the sustainable use of insecticide agents. The above targets will be met with the development of e-FlyWatch system, which will include a novel autonomous and wireless trap and a Local Station that will receive data from the traps, and analyze them using integrated optical recognition software. Processed data will be (a) sent to end user via SMS, providing basic information like warnings, reporting, etc (b) transmitted to a Central Station, providing statistical information, density maps, prediction models, etc. The e-FlyWatch system will allow a) producers to immediately take action and minimize crop damages &amp; b) advanced users, authorities, researchers, to evaluate control methods and pesticides effectiveness.

Therefore, the CIFO will provide language courses in order to improve adaptation in the host country. \r\n\r\nCandidates will have to prepare a CV in the Europass format and a motivation letter in the language of the host country or in English as common language. We have a network of intermediary partners which are experts in mobility management in different European countries.
