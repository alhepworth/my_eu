While it operates as a single free-trade common market, it also consists of nations, regions and localities, highly diversified in history, culture, language and resources. Furthermore, European reality consists of multiplicity of local economies, initiatives and small enterprises. We believe the future - which deeply concerns young people - will reinforce the local, especially its capacity of sustainable development and fruitful collaboration. As means of creating a youth platform of voices and perspectives on sustainable community development in contemporary Europe, we will organize a 11 days multilateral youth exchange entitled 'Think Outside the Box - Think Sustainable', taking place 15th-26th September 2014 in Kostanjevica na Krki, Slovenia. The exchange will bring together agents of small scale local communities who are making a real impact by joining together and working collaboratively. Whether in the fields of ethical/social enterpreneurs, handcrafts, local heritage, recycle and re-use, organic farming and food systems, it is within these initiatives that lies the power of producing broader environmental and social benefits. \r\n40 young participants from Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, UK and Slovenia will compare models and methods of ngo\u2019s that work for the benefits of sustainable development. We will exchange best practice in order to implement it in our local environment for continuous benefit.\r\nThe exchange will address the following issues and panel discussions through which we will learn: Conscious consuming (how to form a community that supports short food chains, healthy lifestyle and environmentaly conscious eating habits, as the idea of buying products from the local growers); Guerilla marketing: (we will develop communication skills and creativity, learning how to use guerilla marketing in ngo\u2019s to multiply impact of our activities and work); Local food supply (we will learn how to develop a succesfull and sustainable system of quality and ethical food production, distribution, consumption and disposal, in a way that would empower young unemployed people, vulnerable groups, small farms, thus contribute to rural communities development); Active citizenship (we will tackle present EU situation of communities that work for the benefits of sustainable development: the recognition by EU governments and impact of its regulations, the challenges of Lisbon treaty and Europe 2020 strategy); Economy for the common good (alternatives of working towards the common good and cooperation instead of profit-orientation and competition - alternative currencies, community supported agriculture, swapping, exchanging, sharing \u2026). \r\nTo attrack local community, wider audience and the media, thus ensuring visibility, we will organize open workshops where \u2018theory meets practice\u2019 and everybody get a chance to participate. We will learn to cook from healthy raw ingredients - local fruit, vegetables and grain - that are cheap or even for free if we follow the seasons and its abundances. We will learn about superfood - herbs - that grows wildly in our meadows, forests and backyards and how to make most of it. We will make jam from abundant fruit, and bake bread to go with it. We will organize a vegetable swap. We will take the tour to local wineyards and get to know the heritage of wine-making. We will organize morning yoga by the river, enjoy the evening folk dance session and play music in the street. \r\nYouth exchange will help us gain competences on how to overcome poverty and strenghten local economies by engaging local community. In a kind and positive way, we will target politicians and decision-makers in local/ regional environment. We aim to stimulate and assist those who wish to create, or who already manage/contribute to, local community systems throughout Europe, be they organisers, ngo\u2019s, consumers or the media, while inspiring and educating society to move towards sustainable future.", "http://www.dartleader.org", null, "erasmus_2014-2-SI02-KA105-000215_5"], [2015, "12 STEPS OF TRANSITION", "Dart Leader Ltd", 13387.0, 8, 8, "\u201912 steps to Transition\u2019 Traning Course will take place in Kostanjevica na Krki, Slovenia, from 12. to 20.

These management courses are full-time schooling. Sometimes also graduates of dual system qualifications who don\u2019t find any employment after their graduation take part in this project. For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration. Besides the students and graduates of the mentioned professions the target group also consists of the teaching staff of Friedrich-List-Schule. The different skill enhancements should be realized in this project.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market. This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants in general do a 26- week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market. By means of this project the participants achieve a considerable additional value related to their job and personality and after their return it\u2019s a lot easier for them to get a job on the first labour market. \r\nThe Hessian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs officially authorized the sending organization to make it possible that also graduates from other Hessian vocational colleges which are not in a position to carry out such projects to take part in those projects. To promote the demand for further education above all the mobility of young graduates coming from the structure weak regions in East-North and Mid-Hesse is another vital target of the project since in these regions there are only few jobs available catering for the individual commercial qualifications the students have. \r\nThe students will do a 6-week commercial work placement at the end of their first year of studies in a European target country. The participants will increase their motivation and will start their second year of studies highly enthusiastically. The benefit will be that they got the experience to be able to stay and live in a foreign country. Most of the time they are fond of their experiences and proud of themselves. Due to these positive experiences made they again apply for another work placement  at the end of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is also to cover the different individual demands of skill enhancement of our teachers.

This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners.

With this application we plan to send apprentices in the dual system (13) (office management clerks, retailers, warehouse workers as well as industrial clerks and wholesalers acquiring the additional certificate \u201eEuropean Merchant\u201c) and students in full-time classes at the BBZ (19) (commercial assistants, nursing staff assistants, assistants to social education workers) for 3- to 5-weeks internships abroad (Belgium [3], Denmark [2], Great Britain [20], Austria [7]). As intended in our strategy for international development, the internships enable our  students to realize general differences in professional training as well as differences in business routines and company culture. Furthermore, the apprentices\u2018 professional and intercultural competences are boosted. In many cases this also applies to their command of English. \r\nLast but not least the apprentices\u2018 flexibility and self confidence concerning the ability to handle situations even in a foreign country cannot be emphasized strongly enough. For the assistants to social education workers the milestones for a workplacement abroad (duration, requirements) have been agreed upon in the BBZ. Enquires to several project partners are under way. We expect that we can arrange internships for 3 trainees in kindergartens etc in England. We are still trying to convince some apprentices from the engineering sector to do an internship. No matter how hard we try, it is still very complicated and time-consuming. Nevertheless, we are quite convinced that we will be successful in sending two engineering apprentices to complete an internship abroad arranged by our partner in Austria. Unfortunately, a renewal of the internship project program for hairdressers is still not in sight. Fortunately, we get a slightly but constantly growing number of applications for long-term internships from students for their first year after graduating. Like in 2017 seven future  commercial clerks want to do a several-months-internship in Ireland (6x6 months, 1x4 months). Additionally, there is 1 office management clerk who applies for Denmark (4 months) and a industrial mechanic for an internship in England (52 weeks). Especially with the underage trainees it obviously is necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher during the first days abroad. \r\nThe teacher serves as a kind of reassurance-back-up in case a difficulty arises. Afterwards the apprentices are supervised by our project partners abroad. Before the internships all particpants, students and staff are well-informed (cultural aspects, dress code, language). When they return, a feedback will be given by them to us. In order to constantly improve the quality of our organisational and administrative work, we also ask our project partners and the apprentices\u2018 companies for a feedback. As far as the staff mobilities are concerned we perceive a growing interest in the mobilities \u2013 also with colleagues not being members of the BBZ Europe-Project-Group. Apart from mobilities with a direct relation to the teachers\u2018 subjects (economics, nursing profession, social education, foreign languages) there are also colleagues who take an interest in congresses that concentrate on digitalisation in education and its consequences e. g. for teaching methods. Due to long-term relationships to partner organizations/schools a skype-based exchange \u2013 comparable to e-twinning - between groups of students has been initialized. So it is possible to exchange experiences in the classroom  in a more realistic way. Whether expansions into fields like the coproduction of goods  is realizable is being looked into. In the caring section an intensified exchange has been initialized between the BBZ and  our project partner in Belgium (German speaking community). Topics that will be dealt with are e.g. the different caring concepts and structure of the students' training. Here staff mobilities help to experience what otherwise can only be talked about theoretically. After having returned, all participants of mobilities will contribute to enhance the readiness for cooperation on a European level. They might do this in conversations with their colleagues and bosses or by giving reports about their experiences abroad on our website or the local media.

Especially for the nursing assistants it is very likely to be the first time apart from their family and friends. Sometimes lacking eloquence leads to misunderstandings that might grow into problems which in the end are very hard to solve. An accompanying teacher can prevent this easily.\r\nA similar effect we noticed for the commercial assistants who serve their internship in England. Here misunderstandings might arise due to their not perfect command of the foreign language. An accompanying teacher gives the necessary back-up and reassurance so that it is easier for them to cope with minor problems during their five-weeks\u2019 stay.\r\nat a.)6 three-week mobilities in England (Bournemouth) (4 of these mobilities are reserved for industrial clerks and wholesalers/export merchants as one component of their additional qualification \u201cEuropean Merchant\u201d;2 are planned for the same kind of apprentices not taking part in the additional qualification. Furthermore we plan for 2 two-week mobilities in Belgium (St. Vith) for retailers, office clerks, warehouse workers.

The participation of 2 teachers  in the EcoMedia Congess in Glasgow (2017) serves two aspects: On the one hand it will enhance the teachers\u2019 knowledge concerning the effective appliance of new media  for teaching purposes and on the other hand it will offer the chance to get into contact with representatives of vocational schools that might be interested in a partnership for students of technical professions.

For example social insurance clerks, IT clerks, office clerks, bank clerks, retail clerks, notary clerks and clerks in public administration.\r\nA central target of our project is the better employability on the labour market.This employability however is not given with the majority of the participants before this project. Especially the graduates of full-time schooling courses i.e. graduates of the commercial assistance qualifications have great difficulties in finding a job because they lack work experience, important linguistic and social competences.\r\nThe planned project is suited for the further education demands of the participants and thus enables them to find a job.\r\nOur main target, the good employability of participants on the first labour market is achieved by the acquisition of international competences, foreign language experiences, intercultural knowledge and experiences in the international world of work. Therefore the participants do a 26 or 16 week internship related with their job in a European destination country.\r\nThey acquire linguistic, intercultural, personal and social skills as well as competences referring to their job without those they would hardly find an adequate job. The requirement of our target group is the further education concerning languages, personality and job specific to increase the employability on the local, national and international labour market.

The language courses are accompanied by an obligatory cultural programme. Afterwards a 13- to 14- week or 23- to 24- week commercial work placement in an enterprise will follow. There the interns get to know the working conditions of the host country and get used to the working environment.

Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of understanding of what really motivates students. According to sociological studies, the current school environment has a poor setting for the professional work and it often seems to work against the teachers' best efforts to grow professionally and improve student learning.\r\nTeachers' attitude is crucial to the success of in-depth curricular innovation.\r\nA \"radical rethinking\" of professional development encouraging teachers' growth has to be done. Teachers must have the opportunities to try out new practices by taking new roles and creating a culture of inquiry. The staff development also means \"providing occasions for teachers to reflect crtically on their practice and to fashion new knowledge and beliefs about content, pedagogy and learnes\".\r\nMotivation is optimized when the person is engaged in the task for his own reason rather than in response to external pressure, the task must be of appropriate level of challenge and there must be a sufficient choice.\r\nResearch has shown that good teaching practices can do more to offset student indifference than extraordinary efforts to attack motivation directly. Most students react positively to a well-organized lesson taught by an enthusiastic and motivated teacher who has an authentic interest in students and what they are learning. This in order to generate an atmosphere that is open and positive. It is increasingly evident that the educational methods we have been using for the past 70 years are no longer sufficient.

It also aims at facilitating and increasing teachers'mobility, which holds out the prospect of a stronger European dimension to teaching, and improving the quality of education and training systems through the adoption of innovative solutions which may grant the students up-to date training withe reference to the skills and competencies required by the European labor market.\r\nThe needs of the participans are to improve the professional and linguistc skills and to be trained in the innovative methodologies in teaching with CLIL methodology.

The 14th day in Slovenia will alternate between internships at hotels and school classes. UCH's international EUD coordinator seeks this implemented, which means that the Slovenian partner will be included in the project later.\r\nUCH's employee mobility and cooperation plan for the teachers and leaders in this project includes internship and job shadowing for 12 teachers, with 4 in Spain, 4 in England and 4 in Germany. The teachers and leaders will collaborate with the partners mentioned in the application on the organization of a 5 day internship and job shadow course in both technical vocational training institutions and merit education institutions in the three listed countries (the institutions will be: South Devon College, UK, The Institute Technology and Education (ITB), University of Bremen and Valencia Business School - no fee payable). In connection with this 5-day course, the teachers and leaders will screen and discuss the parts of the European Development Plan (EDP) listed in Section D point. 4th subparagraphs a, b and c. This course will qualify the EDP and ensure a European record for the interdisciplinary aforementioned, which is intended to be conducted at UCH, which will support UCH's internationalization and pave the way for a strategic partnership project between the countries.\r\nThe international department initiates the following\r\n1) By screening all Learning Agreements we will measure whether the goals set have been reached \r\n2) By reviewing the Mobility Tools evaluations we will be able to deduce whether the mobility stay has been instructive.\r\n3) By doing before and after the test in OLS, we can also measure whether the students are language based better after the stay.\r\n4) Staff Mobility - will be measured continuously - using process and self-assessment.", "http://wwww.totneseuropeanschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA102-046907_1"], [2016, "THS goes Europe - St\u00e4rkung des europ\u00e4ischen Profils in der beruflichen Bildung", "S.E.L.S.A.C.S. ltd", 108980.0, 2, 3, "The project \"THS goes Europe - strenghtenting the European profile in vocational education\" has two groups of beneficiaries. The first group are the students, i.e. trainees in different administrative and commercial jobs as well as future graduates in business administration,  who will be enabled by the project to take part in a 2-week or 6-month work experience  programme in a placement relevant to their apprenticeship or chosen focus of studies. The second group of beneficiaries are the teaching staff of THS, who will be enabled to take part in a training programme to enhance their theoretical and practical skills in teaching. Participants are the beneficiaries, their employing companies in Germany and the companies providing the internship in Great Britain. Moreover there is the Theodor-Heuss-School as sending and TWIN and the Totnes European School as receiving organisation. Additionally, there is the IHK (=Chamber of Commerce) in Reutlingen which supervises and certifies the students' professional training. The increasing internationalisation of the companies and universities in the Neckar-Alb-Region leads to the fact, that even smaller and middle-sized businesses have to adapt to a growing number of international clients. It is therefore more and more important for our trainees and prospective junior executives and managers as well as for the staff teaching them to enhance their foreign language skills, practical skills and intercultural competence. The aims of the project for the students comprise the following aspects: Deepening and expanding practical and theoretical skills gained in the apprenticeships and at vocational school / professional school by applying them in an English company. Acquiring knowledge about British economy and in particular about the sector of the internship company. Getting to know the English culture and way of life. Gaining an insight into regional economic developments and their history in the London area or the Devon region, respectively. Last but not least the development of their oral and written communication skills in a foreign language.After returning to Germany the participants will recognize similarities and differences in the work routines in German and Britishcompanies. During their further education and personal development they will benefit from their participation in the project because of their enhanced theoretical and practical competences. The aims of the project for the teaching staff comprise the following aspects: In compliance with the individual needs of our staff in terms of further developing their skills in the foreign language and intercultural competence, the realization of custom-made training programmes is supposed to provide the teaching staff with the means to enhance these skills. Moreover, this project part is supposed to enable the staff to successfully prepare and support the students who take part in the other mobility options of the project. Thus, visiting companies who provide our students with internships is a crucial aspect of the programme, as it serves to highlight the necessity of adequately preparing these students. At the same time the training programm is designed to provide the teachers with the appropriate tools to do so.Furthermore, all participants will be ambassadors for a united Europe, as they will have personally experienced the benefit of the European Union for their own lives. The project will take place in the London area and the Devon County, respectively. In total 88 beneficiaries will be able to participate.The results of this project will be spread through the local press, the school's website as well as through presentations hosted at Theodor-Heuss-School.There will also be events in cooperation with the Erasmus+ Network Neckar-Alb. This ensures that a broad regional, over-regional and even international audience will be reached.A long-term goal pursued by the project is to make the dual education system and the advanced training programmes in business administration at Theodor-Heuss-School even more attractive as well as to open up new vistas for the beneficiaries and their life and career plans in an ever-growing Europe.", "http://wwww.totneseuropeanschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002825_1"], [2014, "Erdi Heziketa 2014", "S.E.L.S.A.C.S. ltd", 101271.0, 4, 38, "This proposal \u201cErdi Heziketa 2014\u201d is aimed at 22 young students and recent graduates, of Middle Level Training Cycles of any professional training center located in the Basque Country.\r\n\r\nThis new proposal includes the following partners:\r\n\r\n-Confebask as proposal's oordinator.\r\n-Vocational training schools included on the consortium, both public and private, belonging to the Training Network of Centres of the Basque Country, as sending institutions.\r\n- The Department of Education of the Basque Government, Provincial Councils as Institutional and co-financiers partners.\r\n- Intermediary partners and Host organizations in Italy, Portugal and the UK.\r\n\r\nThe objectives and expected results are the achievement of meeting the following needs of the participants covered by this proposal: \r\n- Improvement of practical training, in addition to theoretical training gained during their training period in their centers.

A collective reflection allowed us to list all the projects linked to one of the main goals of our lyc\u00e9e : To offer exposure to international experiences.Within the vocational part of the school , we need to organise the mobility of learners and staff which will contribute to the achievement of specific objectives. Our objectives are linked to the following three themes : 1. EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP, AWARENESS AND DEMOCRACY:. To develop amongst our students a feeling of belonging to the European Union ;. To discover another culture, to contribute to social cohesion ;. To discover and learn different working techniques and how other businesses function ;. To create a network of contacts in the host country ;. To give a modern and European dimension to our teaching mission.2. TEACHING AND LEARNING FOREIGN LANGUAGES:. To give a sense of learning a \u2018living\u2019 language and to deepen the students\u2019 linguistic competence in preparation for their future career ;.  To support the school's non-linguistic teaching staff to learn English.3. REGIONAL EXTENT AND COOPERATION :. To create a network of partners linked with our vocational subjects for both our regional sector and that of the collaborating country ;. To cooperate with a sector which exports the label \u201cBistrot Beaujolais\u201d abroad ;. To reinforce cooperation between the world of education and the world of work ;. To create a recruitment pool of qualified young people who have the capacity to respond to the expectations of regional businesses and therefore to develop their employability.Our project is spread across 24 months. Our wish is to send a group of students during the school year 2016-2017 and another group the following year. Each group is made up of students from the three vocational fields. To select the participants, we have established a very precise list of criteria.The job-shadowing will take place during the first months of the school year in order to allow us to disseminate and use the knowledge and skills acquired with our learners and within the school.Our partner organisation selects host families as well as businesses, resolves problems of discipline and adaptation to the country and monitors the work experience of each student. It coordinates a week of vocational English classes. It will host two of our learners.The work experience abroad will be preceded and followed by internal or external activities at the school in liaison with partners in the area. While abroad, the students will be supervised by our partner organisation and the French teachers. To manage this project to the best of our ability we have adhered to the following: put in place a steering committee, with a defined role for each person, create a Retroplanning and a Dissemination Plan, approached partners in our region, established a provisional budget, listed the inherent constraints of the project.In addition to the development of linguistic competence and skills to help in the acquisition of a diploma, this experience will allow students to develop their adaptability to new environments, to reinforce their feeling of membership in the European Union, to give added meaning and value (Europro, Euromobipro) to their chosen path. Furthermore, the ownership of the EUROPASS will enable students to consider jobs abroad.As far as the school and staff are concerned, the mobility will strengthen, modernise and europeanise our vocational department and reinforce our involvement in the overall mission of the lyc\u00e9e, which promotes cultural and international exposure. It will also bring together the teams of teachers involved in the project and establish a partnership between the school and the professional working world.Overall, our school, thanks to different contacts and to communication surrounding the project, can be recognised as a partner source.

After the selection of applicants these go through an organizational, educational, cultural, and task-related preparation. The learning agreement is concluded. Concrete learning outcomes / competences are formulated. At the end of the internship, the results are evaluated with an appraisal form (criteria-based interview) by the mentor and the participant. \r\n\r\nAfter returning the internship is reflected by the participants. Using assessment results the Euro pass mobility is issued. The trainees  write their professional thesis and create their Euro Language Passport.

In addition, good knowledge of foreign languages helps to support pupils in private tutoring.For geriatric care and care for metal handicap people a greater attractiveness of education is due to the possibility of an internship abroad. The demand for skilled workers in these areas is greater than the number of candidates who are interested in these career fields, so incentives are in training essential.Besides there is also the improvement of professional skills, for example, comes from Austria, the biography model by Boehm to dealing with people suffering from dementia or inclusion is already practiced much longer in the Scandinavian countries than with us.For all our students are good commands of English in relation to a later study of great advantage, since most research publications are in English. Besides linguistic improve all students gain by an abroad internship independence and professional maturity.At the beginning of each year a kickoff event is held for those who are interested in an internship abroad, in addition of informations about the course and the necessary formalities, also former foreign interns report on their experiences.We will prepare participants for the internship through additional language learning opportunities in English individually (teaching, vocational English books, self-learning program). For other languages, we financially support courses in the adult education center. At our school teachers have a wide background knowledge of diverse European countries.Our cooperation partners in England and Turkey organize internships, accommodation and provide access to advice who visits the trainees at their facility.Each participant has in practice means a named co-worker (Praxisanleiter) whose level of qualification is at least Level 3 NVQ . This is necessary in order to be comparable with training in Germany.Participants will receive practical assignments of various subjects from their Teacher in Germany.  They should plan, implement and evaluate a project. The orders are also available in the local language.For the current monitoring, the participants submit weekly reports to the school in Germany.At the end, participants will receive an assessment of their practice facility and the EuroPassMobility-Pass for the detection of the stay abroad. The internship is also noted in the final certificate.For the evaluation of the stay we have developed questionnaires regarding internships, placement, preparation and satisfaction.We publish the stay abroad of our students via our website, Facebook and a blog.

Our school is situated at a European crossroads, an area which thrives in terms of both economy and tourism.\r\n\r\nOur \u2018lyc\u00e9e polyvalent\u2019 (a secondary school which caters for both vocational and academic subjects) offers students an education in general, technical and professional fields. Our project will concern 36 students who are studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at in either catering or administration.  The steering committee is constituted of teachers of vocational subjects , English teachers, an history teacher, the chef de travaux and the financial secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur students must undertake 22 weeks of job experience over the course of three years. It will be truly enriching for the students to carry out one of the job experiences abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Our objectives are : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- European Citizenship, awareness and democracy:\r\n\r\n. To develop amongst our students a feeling of belonging to the European Union;\r\n\r\n. To discover another culture, to contribute to social cohesion;\r\n\r\n. To discover and learn different working techniques and how other businesses function;\r\n\r\n. To create a network of contacts in the host country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Teaching and learning foreign languages:\r\n\r\n. To give a sense of learning a \u2018living\u2019 language and to deepen the students\u2019 linguistic competence in preparation for their future career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Regional extent and cooperation :\r\n\r\n.

To cooperate with a sector which exports the label \u201cBistrot Beaujolais\u201d abroad.\r\n\r\n. To reinforce cooperation between the world of education and the world of work;\r\n\r\n. To create a recruitment pool of qualified young people who have the capacity to respond to the expectations of regional businesses and therefore to develop their employability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project allows us to work towards two important goals of the lyc\u00e9e : to combat students dropping out of school early and to offer exposure to international experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur project is spread across 24 months. Our wish is to send a group of students during the school year 2014-2015 and another group the following year. Each group is made up of students from catering and administration classes. To select the participants, we have established a very precise list of criteria (involvement in the activities, commitment to their English lessons, ability to adapt to independence and to the necessary responsibilities required for a stay abroad, motivation, diligence,\u2026)\r\n\r\n Since this is our first project of this kind, we saw fit to call upon \u201cTotnes European School\u201d. This intervening organisation selects host families as well as businesses, resolves problems of discipline and adaptation to the country and monitors the work experience of each student. It also coordinates a week of vocational English classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work experience abroad will be preceded and followed by internal or external activities at the school in liaison with partners in the area. While abroad, the students will be supervised by the intervening agency and the French teachers. The first week of the programme will comprise of professional English lessons and cultural visits organised by the students. During the following three weeks, the students will complete their work placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo manage this project to the best of our ability we have adhered to the following:\r\n\r\n-Put in place a steering committee, with a defined role for each person;\r\n\r\n-Listed the different stages of planning;\r\n\r\n-Approached partners in our region and in that of the host country;\r\n\r\n-Established a provisional budget;\r\n\r\n-Listed the inherent constraints of the project;\r\n\r\n-Enquired into the estimated cost of potential intervening agencies to grasp an understanding of funds (roles and tasks). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of linguistic competence and skills to help in the acquisition of a diploma, this experience will allow students to develop their adaptability to new environments, to reinforce their feeling of membership in the European Union, to give added meaning to their chosen path, and inspire them to either continue their studies or enter into their working life. Furthermore, the ownership of the EUROPASS will enable students to consider jobs abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as the school is concerned, the grant will strengthen our vocational department and reinforce our involvement in the overall mission of the lyc\u00e9e, which promotes cultural and international exposure. It will also bring together the teams of teachers involved in the project and establish a partnership between the school and the professional working world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, our school, thanks to different contacts and to communication surrounding the project, can be recognised as a partner resource.

The multilateral Comeniusproject Eurobacdiploma, coordinated by the RRB, developed a certificate of excellence named \"European Business Baccalaureate Diploma\" (\"EBBD\") with 8 different elements harmonised throughout Europe. One of these elements is the work placement abroad.Project objectivesThe learners should gain practical work experience in a company abroad, develop professional and intercultural competence and improve their foreign language skills. The acquired knowledge should enhance their employability in international companies as well as their mobility and enable them to European, entrepreneurial thinking. The participants should actively participate in their life, working and learning environment  in a European country and reinforce their European identity.By testing the use of various ECVET elements  developed in the \"EBBD\" project and by using the instruments / certificates Euro Pass mobility, the Euro pass CV and the Euro Language Passport the efficiency and quality, the Europe-wide transparency and recognition of the placement abroad in to the training should be increased. The partners involved should further develop their quality standards in the context of the project objectives, exploit synergies and thereby possibly increase their competitiveness and their project financing options.Number of participantsThe total number of participants over the 24-month project period is 36 learners. The internships are planned as a 4-week activity in a company in a partner's country. The internship period is firmly anchored in the annual agenda of the commercial college. In 2017 and 2018 18 learners at any one time will complete the internship (three weeks  in school time and  the first week of their Easter holidays). Description of activities and procedures for project implementation Before start of the project the RRB concludes  partners partnership agreements in which, inter alia, learning areas / competences and fields of action and the procedures for evaluation, documentation, validation and recognition are agreed. After the selection of applicants these go through an organizational, educational, cultural, and task-related preparation. The learning agreement is concluded. Concrete learning outcomes / competences are formulated. At the end of the internship, the results are evaluated with an appraisal form (criteria-based interview) by the mentor and the participant. After returning the internship is reflected by the participants. Using assessment results the Euro pass mobility is issued. The trainees  write their professional thesis and create their Euro Language Passport. The project will be evaluated by the participants and accompanying partners during the project and at its end and disseminated.Description of the expected results and effects and the expected long-term benefitsThe project enhances the employability, enables them  to study at a European university and encourages them to move to different European countries. This effect is supported by obtaining the instruments recognized throughout Europe such as  Europass CV, Europass Mobility  and Europass Language Passport. The participants act internationally, Europe for them grows  together. Their European identity is strengthened.The RRB is at the school site and in the region the only vocational college that offers this Europe-wide harmonized additional qualification (work placement in connection with EBBD).

Street theatre as an artistic activity and a certain kind of adult education supported by non-institutional groups and civil organizations.Street theatre could give a new aspect, while it involves a new mass of public, proposing a new model of \"demand and supply\" on the field of theatre.Outdoor performing adult education  can create culture in socially marginalized environments to propose: dialogue approach; critical sociology by carrying out social problems; interactive cultural exchange;  collective education; development of multiple intelligences; trigger the imagination of social change; empower of community; strong pedagogical aspect; collaborative process.The implementation of outdoor theatre competences and teachin metodology will be tested in geographically disadvantaged villages such as Kide (Romania) or Dunaszekcs\u0151 (Hungary).The next aim is to understand the English model of the rural touring network. We intend to observe practices and in long term implement the model of the rural touring network in our partner countries which would in turn create a sustainable project that has a lasting impact on our partners and their countries. The English partner would have a leader role in this area of research and Italian and Slovenian partners could contribute greatly with their long history in outdoor touring shows in Europe, South America and Asia.

This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities.

The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested.

Dance and music are a universal language which can be highly effective at bringing people of different backgrounds together and benefiting integration - particularly in big city environments. This still requires particular training, knowledge and skills that this project will provide.

We want to build on that and find ways that MM and 5Rhythms can widen the diversity of learners, increase up-take and expand opportunities to include disadvantaged learners.\r\n\r\nAll partners are from European capital cities: London, Berlin, Budapest and Rome. This means that the project spans across the EU (East-West, North-South) and allows teachers in four of the top ten largest cities in the EU to exchange practices and knowledge, share and improve their learning. Each city is facing pressing issues of diversity, exclusion-inclusion and integration and by meeting transnationally we can combine our expertise, learn from each other and develop new methods that could not be achieved alone.  The partnership intends to examine the current state of social inclusion within each organisation and city, the strengths and knowledge each has and the opportunities for improving this situation and the skills that are required by staff of each organisation to do this. \r\n\r\nWe then aim to develop and pilot these approaches in two staff training events, learn, reflect and then embed them as appropriate in the future. 16 teachers and trainee teachers from our four partners will attend the staff training event. We aim for a total of 150 learners to attend part of those events in the movement meditation workshops where we will test our ideas and practice.

The current trend in tourism reveals a boom inthe upper price hotel industry in connection with even more international customers from all over the world. As the \u201cGood customer\u201d is looking for personal care, businesses try to recruit well-trained staff in order to come up to their clients\u2019 expectations.As far as possible staff should be able to communicate with guests in their mother tongue and show some knowledge and understanding about their cultural background. It is of great importance that our students are well prepared for these requirements.In addition to the theoretical and practical tuition at school in commercial subjects,languages, multimedia, computer application, the canteen kitchen and service,practical training in a company is just as important.Personal development, team spirit, social skills, mobility and integration into an organizationwill be promoted in this way.Nowadays many young people consider a work placement abroad as big opportunity.The mobility project Erasmus+ and the financial support that comes with it make it easier for the students to opt for a placement in a foreign country, which will enable themto gain experience they would not gain in their home environment and at the same timeallow them to improve their foreign language skills.A standardized record of achievement guaranteed by internationally recognized certificates is an important addition to their later professional life.This year 36 students of our school will do their work placements abroad.Statistics prove that people with a good education have bigger chances on the job market, suffer less psychic problems and are more self-conscious.Teachers and staff at the H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Berufe will continue tomotivate their students to do their work placements abroad.", "http://www.lovingthebeach.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016547_10"], [2016, "F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika an der HLW/HF Lienz", "The Venus Company Ltd.", 57132.0, 4, 8, "The College for Tourism and Commerce and the Secondary School for Hotel and Catering Lienz aim at being a perfect starting point for the international job market. A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourism, competent language skills in English, Italian and French as well as a focus on services management and international communication is a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. Part of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks in the college and 24 weeks in the tourism school. In the past two years the interest of both the students and graduates of the two schools in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.With this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. Additionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and a number of young people (including students and  apprentices of the area) have contacted us with the wish to get more information about it. The news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.Currently 35 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.  Besides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. The experience of the last years has shown us that our trainees start their practical training abroad as teenages and finish it as young adults. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.Due to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.lovingthebeach.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016396_6"], [2018, "Auslandspraktika von Sch\u00fclerInnen an der HLW/HF Lienz", "The Venus Company Ltd.", 41544.0, 4, 9, "The Erasmus+ project done at the HLW/HF Lienz is called \"Internships abroad of students at the HLW/HF Lienz\". All students of the HLW Lienz have to do a compulsory internship of 3 months after the end of the third year and before the fourth year. Many of the students do this internship abroad, mainly in Great Britain, Ireland and Italy. As interns are often paid very little or sometimes even nothing in these countries, the Erasmus+ project supports the students financially. By doing the intership abroad the students improve their language skills, they get an insight into what it is like to work in another country and they broaden their view of the world concerning culture and multiculturalism. After having done the internship abroad the students feel more self-assured and self-confident which has a positive impact on their performances at school as well as in their private life. \r\n18 participants are going to take part in this year's Erasmus+ project. The HLW/HF Lienz has already had successful business relations with partner companies in Great Britain, Ireland and Italy for many years now. The project coordinator and the teachers at the HLW/HF Lienz support their students throughout the whole project, starting by helping them to write the CVs to booking the flights. During the project many different activities are done which help the students to successfully complete their internship. Already before the students choose where to do their internship they get informed about the possibility of doing it abroad and about how the Erasmus+ project works. As soon as having decided to do it abroad these students get more specific information so that they are perfectly prepared for their stay in another country. Again it is the project coordinator and specific teachers who support the students. During the project the project coordinator always stays in touch with the students and quickly acts if questions arise. \r\nFor the future of the HLW/HF Lienz the Erasmus+ project is very important because it is the possibility for students to do their internship abroad and by doing so broaden various competences which is really advantageous for their future.", "http://www.lovingthebeach.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039091_5"]]}}}}
