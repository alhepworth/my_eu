In addition, experience from operation of older wind farms is of limited value, because the specification of these installations is evolving rapidly, with the capacity (and therefore size and weight) of the generator becoming larger and the consequent dimensions of the tower increasing. The effect is that it is very difficult to extrapolate experience with existing structures to the likely behaviour of new ones.\nOn these installations there are very large surface areas/volumes of material to be examined and degradation may occur almost anywhere, so that the inspection task is not trivial.

Under the current context of climate change, which is above all characterized by extreme weather phenomenon, droughts are becoming more frequent and longer which, associated with heat waves, increases the chances of large wild fires with enormous destruction of forest and biodiversity. But the effects of forest fires are not limited to that single year. It\u2019s not know yet how long it takes for the environmental web of relations, here represented by the plant-pollinator relationship, to be fully recovered. This has immediate consequences at the forest level, but also at the agriculture level (less pollinators less agriculture production) and at the level of honey producers. The EVS volunteers, all unemployed undergraduates, will come to help in studying these effects and to understand the side effects for foresters, farmers and honey producers.\r\n\r\nThis project has the following objectives: (1) Help young European researchers in developing scientific research work, from the planning, through implementation and to evaluation and publication; (2) Help young European citizens in understanding their role within the European Union and to work in partnership with others to safeguard the European environment, through the use of European Environmental legislation; (3) Interaction with local stakeholders (foresters, farmers and honey producers) in order to collect information on the effects of wildfires both in space and time; (4) contribute to increase the citizen knowledge on the consequences of fires and what measures can be taken to reduce their incidence.\r\n\r\nThis project is a partnership of two sending organizations (from different countries) with one receiving organization, involving three volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe activities will involve from planning ones, to field work in science, to conversation with involved stakeholders to collect information and environmental education with school children and other visitors to the Open Day at the receiving organization Field Study Centre. The methodology will be mostly informal learning, putting in practice what the volunteers have learned at the university and gaining experience for a future career in research or any other environmental field. The educational side of the project might require some extra help to get the volunteers to learn some communication techniques, but nothing too difficult.\r\n\r\nAs expected results we hope that the volunteers will learn how to plan a research and communication project from the planning stage to the implementation, evaluate and report. All this done with a good team work in international partnership. We hope that the volunteers will develop identifying skills of Mediterranean species, both in plants, insects and birds.\r\n\r\nWe also expect to convey the conservation message across to many school classes and other visiting groups and with that to generate a longer impact in time. Also that with the volunteers help, the receiving organization will manage to engage with three different types of stakeholders (foresters, farmers and honey producers) and organize meetings which will open doors for future collaboration with them and prolong in time a positive view of environmental conservation, both for biodiversity and for business as well.\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits are:\r\n\u2022 For the volunteers is on gaining experience for their future research career and their CV development. They will also develop an awareness of their citizen role within the European Union to work in partnership with people from other countries and cultures to protect and improve Europe\u2019s environment.\r\n\u2022 The receiving organization will ensure that its environmental education program reaches out to many school children and other visitors, both during the project time, but later is time through educational materials which will remain with our organization.\r\n\u2022 The sending organizations will gain from international cooperation between all the organizations and achieving their organizational objectives within international cooperation and volunteer development;\r\n\u2022 The local stakeholders will share their experiences with scientists and will develop collaboration links with research Centres.", "http://www.changeagents.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-PT02-KA105-002059_1"], [2014, "Open your mind", "CHANGE AGENTS UK CHARITY", 17464.0, 5, 5, "\"I\u0161laisvink savo mintis\" - tai projektas, kuriame dalyvaus keturi savanoriai i\u0161 Did\u017eiosios Britanijos, Vokietijos ir Vengrijos ir socialin\u0117s rizikos vaikai, kurie yra socialiai ir psichologi\u0161kai pa\u017eeisti bei gyvena institucijoje ir da\u017eniausiai savo t\u0117vus tik prisimena, bet j\u0173 nemato.

The range of problems is very wide, and is mainly experienced by the South (Latin America, Africa, Asia). Therefore, a transition to a new economy and a sustainable use of natural resources is necessary. To reach this change in our own country, we need strong leaders and entrepreneurs who stimulate sustainable development in both the North and the South. In September 2014 CATAPA, together with Mediaraven, Putumayo and Act 4 Change, will start a new campaign named \u2018Generation Transition\u2019. The aim of this campaign will be to offer the new generation or 'Generation Transition' (managers, leaders, politicians, CEO\u2019s, teachers etc) skills and tools on sustainable development, in order to make the transition towards a society that uses resources in a sustainable manner. We will thus offer the young generation the opportunity to learn how they can contribute to a sustainable society. \r\n'CATAPEDIA 2.0' forms part of the first, logic, phase of the campaign: the phase of preparation and development of educational tools by gathering, systematizing and production of different media for dissemination of information. The project 'CATAPEDIA 2.0' will contribute to the education of \u2018generation transition\u2019 by producing multiple ways and media of formation, education, communication, and other learning methods for spreading the information about sustainable use of resources. The focus will thus be on solutions on how to contribute positively to a new economy. We will do this by stimulating entrepreneurship and leadership skills, and by focusing upon the \u2018good practices\u2019.  \r\nFor 'CATAPEDIA 2.0' we are looking for 2 volunteers, both with different tasks, though tasks can coincide. One volunteer will mainly be responsible for communication. Task for this function can be: writing articles, managing the (digital)library, following-up social media and website, making powerpoints and prezi presentations, and gathering relevant information on sustainable use of resources for CATAPA's website and digital library. The other volunteer will mainly be helping out with making short video clips and organizing events. Tasks will among other be: editing short videos on the subject of sustainable use of resources, offering guidance to students, welcoming new volunteers and organizing information meetings and masterclasses. As mentioned before, tasks of both volunteers can coincide and overlap and both volunteers will collaborate intensively. The volunteers will assist us in our office in Ghent.\r\nEverybody can apply, but important is, that the volunteers believe in the possibility of a more sustainable future and are willing to work for it. Moreover, they must be familiar with social media such as facebook and twitter and a basic knowledge of editing short clips adds value.\r\nAs is apparent from the description of the project's background, we believe a transition towards a more sustainable future is necessary. We will start from this believe, by offering the new generation educational tools with the expectation that these tools will have a positive impact on the transition towards a more sustainable society. We hope students will make use of these tools for many years, also after the end of the official campaign. We are in close contact with our partner organizations and networks, which according to us, is very important in the elaboration of our campaigns and actions.

LET has 50 years\u2019 experience of supporting personal development through challenging and inspiring outdoor activities, including climbing, caving, kayaking and bushcraft, delivered in a safe, supportive environment and led by professional instructors. LET\u2019s work is delivered from two residential centres in the Peak District, and, increasingly, through outreach projects in disadvantaged urban areas. LET is committed to inclusion and is able to adapt many of its activities to support those with additional needs. The organisation also has a bursary fund to enable the participation of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to support groups that need a higher instructor to client ratio.Objectives:This project aims to \u2022 provide an immersive experience of the outdoor learning sector\u2022 support employability through facilitating the development of the skills, experience and attributes needed to work in the outdoor learning sector \u2022 support the development of range of task-specific skills, informal learning, reflective processes and personal development.  \u2022 support the development of English language skills in a range of real life contexts\u2022 support cultural exchange and understanding and help build ongoing links with organisations across Europe to facilitate exchange of ideas and best practice\u2022 raise awareness of European volunteer opportunities with the young people that LET works with, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities\u2022 increase the number of outdoor activity projects taking part in EVS and other international exchange  programmes.Volunteer Profile:The current project seeks to support one volunteer, an 18-year-old woman from Germany who proactively contacted LET as the receiving organisation and IJGD as the sending organisation. Following an outward bound course, plus voluntary work supervising outdoor activities for children, the volunteer decided she wishes to pursue a career in outdoor education.LET is keen to host more Erasmus and EVS placements in the future, and potentially to act as a sending organisation for some of the many young people they work withActivities and Methodology:Through this project, the volunteer will get involved with all aspects of LET\u2019s work. She will work alongside our instructors and experience all aspects of working in the delivery of outdoor education.  The volunteer will initially observe sessions; as her confidence, competence and experience increases she will have opportunities to lead certain sessions, under supervision, and, potentially, to lead low risk activities by herself. She will have the opportunity to complete LET\u2019s in-house training programme for on-site activities, plus attend relevant National Governing Body training courses for adventurous outdoor activities. She will also learn how to facilitate learning, develop a range of practical guided reflection and reviewing techniques, and gain valuable experience of different learning styles. Whilst these skills and techniques are used in the outdoor education setting they are highly transferable, and highly sought after, in many other industries.LET also works in an outreach capacity with young people in a very deprived area of Greater Manchester. The volunteer will have opportunities to get involved with this programme, supporting the delivery of sessions and hosting discussion with participants.Refection and review are a key part of the programme and the volunteer will be supported in setting and reviewing objectives, and also in identifying the areas of LET\u2019s work in which she is most interested. She will be assigned a Mentor with whom she will have regular review sessions.Results and Impact:The expected impact for the volunteer are the development the competences, values, skills and ability to work with a diverse range of young people in an outdoor education setting, including those with additional needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The benefits for LET include having a fresh perspective on current practices and procedures - the volunteer will be asked to give feedback and suggest improvements. LET will also be able to forge links with European partners to support information exchange and future volunteer placements.Longer term benefit:Dissemination of the programme results will, we hope, encourage more young people to enroll on EVS and Erasmus+ programmes and experience the huge range of benefits these bring. Since registering on the EYP database, LET has been inundated with requests from potential volunteers. By sharing the results of the current programme amongst the outdoor learning sector, LET aims to encourage more outdoor learning organisations to offer EVS and Erasmus+ placements, helping to meet the demand and share the benefits.", "http://www.changeagents.org.uk", "CHANGE AGENTS UK CHARITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023704_coordinator"], [2014, "EKOenergy for the UK", "CHANGE AGENTS UK CHARITY", 7698.0, 2, 2, "EKOenergy is a network of European NGOs willing to promote the use of renewable electricity. \r\nEKOenergy is also an ecolabel for electricity supplied to consumers (households, corporate consumers, others).

This will start with defining the framework for market characterisation, followed by exhaustive, integrated market research combining climate vulnerability analysis deriving into potential market estimation, confronted to actual transactional market quantification, qualitative surveys, and nine case studies on specific sectors and regions.  This will be followed by a gap analysis and innovation modelling to reveal the untapped market. A foresight exercise will then outline market growth till 2030.
