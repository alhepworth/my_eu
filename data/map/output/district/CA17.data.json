According to the \"Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training (ET 2020) Council Conclusions\", the goal is to increase the number of 15 years European students with insufficient skills in the field of mathematics and science, to less than 15% by 2020.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it becomes essential to develop training methods that foster interest and motivation in mathematics and the sciences.\r\nThe proposal aims to develop, including through the transfer and adaptation of best practices from partner countries that have already experienced in their effectiveness within their school systems , training programs and related devices for use replicable 3D printers, for encourage innovation in teaching on the basis of 2 separate and complementary criteria:\r\n\r\na) the logic of the project work (with a focus on design and applied technology), through which you look at the process of engineering and production of an object: the conception, design, modeling, creation;\r\nb) disciplinary logic of experimentation, through which you print three-dimensional objects that support reflective observation and abstract conceptualization of calculations, measurements and geometric figures (mathematics), magnitudes, motions and forces (physical) particles and structures of organic matter and inorganic (biology, chemistry).\r\n\r\nThe project is divided into several logical and sequential activities, related to the specific Intellectual Output:\r\n1) Identification, by a panel of experts at the transnational level, the hypothesis of profitable use of 3D printing technology in relation to specific critical points in the learning curriculum of the literacy skills of mathematics and science. Delphi method will be used.\r\n2) Establishment of an interdisciplinary team of Institute (one for each partner education-oriented) and familiarization of teachers in the subject areas involved in experimenting with 3D printing technology, also with the support of partner technology / business-oriented.\r\n3) Implementation of pupil-led experimentation in methods of project work, which aims to cover the entire production process of an object (conception, design, modeling, creation).\r\n\r\nIt is expected an education-oriented experimentation by each partner's modeled and released in the form of open educational resource.\r\n4) Implementation of teacher-led experimentation mathematical literacy skills, according to a disciplinary logic of experimental teaching refers to the key ideas and / or mathematical processes and / or contexts / situations scientific.\r\n\r\nIt is expected an education-oriented experimentation by each partner's modeled and released in the form of open educational resource.\r\n5) Implementation of teacher-led experimentation of scientific literacy skills, according to a logic didactic sperimentation that refers to knowledge, and scientific concepts for the understanding of the phenomena; scientific processes of description, explanation and prediction; contexts / situations in the areas of life-health, land and environment, science and technology.\r\nIt is expected an education-oriented experimentation by each partner's modeled and released in the form of open educational resource.\r\n\r\nSTEM. Approximately 600 students can be identified (20 students x 2classes x 3 experiments x 5 Institutes) and 20 teachers (4 teachers x 5 Institutes).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at least 2 different classes of specialization , for each experiment (Output 3,4,5) , conducted within each partner school and in which it will be activated an interdisciplinary team , composed of at least 4 teachers , representative of each STEM discipline . Approximately 600 students can be identified (20 students x 2classes x 3 experiments x 5 Institutes) and 20 teachers (4 teachers x 5 Institutes).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on the target groups of participants is two-fold:\r\n- The expected impact on students is the increase of interest / motivation and their knowledge, that has to be considered as a set of information, skills and personal resources .\r\n- The teaching staff and / or organizational learning ( Staff ) , the expected impact is the developing of competences regarding new skills in experimental teaching of mathematics and science subjects , also in view of continuing professional development\r\nFor organizations involved , however, the expected impacts are identified in the innovation of their contexts of organization of experimental teaching , with the aim of improving the effectiveness of teaching in the subject areas of mathematics and science", "http://www.ksgs.cumbria.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA201-004204_2"]]}}}}
