The artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci is the inspiration for this project: daVinci/2019.co.uk. The project aims to develop a creative and collaborative approach to STEM for pupils across the Primary sector. There will be a particular focus for pupils aged 8-10 years old, including those with special needs.  It is anticipated that over 2,000 pupils will be involved and of this number over 300 in the focus group across the schools. \r\n\r\nWhile the focus will be STEM there is a clear expectation that this work will improve basic skills, especially mathematics. The children's creative abilities will be encouraged via an exploration of the art and inventions of da Vinci. All schools in the partnership see the arts as a language that is universally understood. In this spirit, there is a clear intention to encourage and develop the schools' ability to teach additional languages to promote European identity and belonging. \r\n\r\nKey activities and output of this work will include: \r\n- the development of an interactive website across the partnerships fronted by a virtual robot called daVinci/2019; \r\n- pupils will be taught about the story of daVinci and inspired by his work;\r\n- staff will be trained on how they may use works of art to stimulate pupils' thinking skills and creativity;\r\n- pupils will engage in joint science challenges across Europe: \r\n- staff will observe good science lessons and will enhance their practice:\r\n- pupils will learn how to code and produce apps that combine art and technology:\r\n- staff will be trained to code and use this language as a powerful tool to promote logical thought and ICT:\r\n- pupils will engage in international trade as they share their arts and crafts across Europe in Christmas markets:\r\n- staff will be equipped to teach children to embrace enterprise:\r\n- pupils will be enthused and taught to use an additional language in context:\r\n- staff will be exposed to a range of teaching strategies used across Europe to teach an additional language.\r\n\r\nIn summary, 'For once you have tasted flight (creativity), you will walk the earth with our eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return' (Leonardo da Vinci, circa 1500).", null, "Whitehouse Primary School and Nursery Unit", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036644_3"], [2014, "'M\u00b3' - Mathematics, Mini-Enterprise and Marketing Project", "Saint James's Primary School", 70116.0, 5, 6, "This partnership aims to exploit the links between maths and music and to develop enterprise in pupils aged between 9 and 10 years, including those with special needs.

Children will be encouraged to share musical knowledge and awareness and develop musical ability (e.g. video conferences for bands) alongside maths activities.  Maths songs will be developed through joint creative activities relating to popular television shows in all countries (e.g. The Apprentice, X Factor).
