This will require significant investment in new pipelines to bring the resource onshore. 10,000km of pipelines form part of the oil & gas infrastructure in the North Sea. Combined with the huge growth in the installation of offshore wind farms & telecommunication networks, many thousands of kilometres of newly installed subsea cables & pipelines (CPs) will be required. It is critical that such underwater infrastructure is properly managed over its lifetime to ensure proper laying, inspection, quality maintenance, quick repair and comprehensive decommissioning.\n\nExisting state-of-the-art cannot currently provide a complete lifecycle solution. The SonaTag project will develop a novel low-cost position, location & identification passive underwater tag and a custom designed sonar system designed to \u2018see\u2019 the tags. SonaTag will offer CP laying contractors a means to greatly reduce the cost of CP laying operations, thereby ensuring its initial adoption in the market. Downstream stakeholders such as IMR (Inspection Maintenance and Repair) crews and governments will have the means to locate and uniquely identify these vital assets.\n\nThe system will provide a robust environmentally sound solution for longterm lifecycle tagging by achieving the following objectives: specialised sonar with transmit power adequate for deployment (220 dB) at transmit end to achieve operational accuracy of \\/- 0.1m @ 10m to 1000m range; the ability to detect range & position of tag in 5secs @ 1000m and 2 secs @ 10m from sonar transceiver; inert tag device with detectability in high noise environments i.e. seabed.\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of unmanaged critical underwater infrastructure & address the high operation costs of laying CPs. In doing so, we will deliver \u20ac45 million in revenue with a profit of \u20ac9.3 million to the SME partners after 5 years, while creating over 100 high skill jobs.", 356070.0, 1277113.0, 5, 8, "SONATAG", null, "http://www.cesalt.co.uk", null, "fp7_110740_952404977"], [1501545600000, 1517356800000, "STREAM - Sonar Technology for Remote Environmental Monitoring", "Subsea Asset Location Technologies Limited", "Oil and gas is continuously leaking from offshore deepwater infrastructure. Up to 1 million tonnes of oil are lost from deepwater drilling leaks each year, with 601 oil and gas releases reported in the North Sea in 2015 alone, up 14.5% on the previous years. Current leak detection technologies suffer from high false positives, high cost, lack of continuous monitoring and safety risks, meaning the majority of leaks are not detected by equipment. To address this major environmental and economic problem, we have developed STREAM, a unique technology which uses subtle changes in the speed of sound to detect contaminants in seawater. We have recently completed a funded project to technically prove our concept at TRL6.\n \nSALT has a proven track record of successfully commercialising highly innovative technologies such as our award-winning SonarBell. We have also successfully led two European collaborative projects to exploit the SonarBell in different applications. Currently, we are in advanced discussions with Statoil and BP who have shown great interest in the STREAM technology. Crucially, we are in negotiations with Subsea7, a global tier 1 service provider, to include STREAM in their service offering. \n\nWe now need to validate the market opportunity and reduce commercial risk by running large scale trials and optimising our product performance. 5 years post-project, we will generate annual revenues of \u20ac31.8 million, \u20ac4.7 million in net profits, 282 jobs, representing an 8 x ROI to EC investment.

The proposed project aims to combat the digital exclusion of adults in terms of Internet use by making students the educators of the their digitally illiterate parents in safe and creative web. Greece falls short of the demand side with their citizens characterized by a low level of digital skills. The digital illiteracy of 37% of the population inevitably leads to social exclusion of all those citizens as they lack of internet benefits in entertainment, information, communication, education and employment, and child custody in the virtual world.Teachers\u2019 training about safe and creative Internet use, by using specialized educational tools and educational programs will help them in order to stimulate students to train adult members of their families, who are digitally illiterate, at Internet use. The proposed project aims to change the traditional way of educating children regarding safe and creative Internet use. Children from passive Internet users, become trainers for adults supporting this way the national aim to combat digital exclusion. Through this project, children will be trained in safe and creative web in order to transfer their knowledge to the elderly. We hope that this pedagogical learning process will have important results in assimilating the messages of safe and creative Internet use.Two are the main type of project\u2019s activities:-Teachers training will take place in two parts: (a)at the first part (theoretical part) the teachers will be trained using a learning platform in topics related to learning basic rules of internet and ways of mobilizing children in educating digitally illiterate adults (b)at the second part (practical part) the teachers will attend experientially workshops regarding safer internet issues in schools and delivery of working sheets with the process and results of the intervention. These workshops will take place in schools with the participation of students.  -In order to promote the actions of the project and trigger the children two categories of competition will be organized in the countries participating in the consortium; (a) school competitions will be organized in order to highlight schools with most digitally illiterate adults who were trained and (b) knowledge competitions for students and trained adults.In order to support the actions of the project a portal regarding adults and old people and Internet Education will be created which will include publicly available educational content in Internet use for beginners and advanced users. Also this portal will provide the e-learning environment, which will be used for the on-line training of teachers. This e-learning environment has as objectives (a) the presentation of training materials and Internet learning courses for trainers and information services, (b) the enhancement of conventional training and introduction of trainees in the new digital culture, (c) the continuous training and access to the contents of the training without time limits that new trainers can educate themselves, (d) the provision of a user-friendly and dynamic learning environment that supports continuous, two-way communication trainers and trainees and individualized learning.Finally, for the needs of teachers\u2019 training, the necessary educational material will be created. This educational material will indicatively include the following axes: (a) browsing the Internet, on-line Services, entertainment, education, communication, (b) secure Internet rules (privacy, secured transactions etc.), (c) dangers from the Internet use (social networks, etc.) and (d) mental health and Internet (excessive use, cyberbullying, grooming, gambling etc.)The EduWeb\u2019s consortium numbers 10 partners and their selection was based mainly on the tasks required to be accomplished. Specifically, four public actors PDEDE, USRV, CPI and MYS, two ICT oriented partners CTI and BU and one school from each participating country.EduWeb is expected  to have a strong impact on its participants. Specifically,  teachers will widen their teaching methodologies on modern ICT based curricula. Students will deepen their knowledge on safe and creative use of internet. Parents will experience the joy of learning on how to use safely the internet with a lot of confidence and a big smile. \u03a4he involved schools will benefit by utilizing the educational tools developed in ICT teaching. Therefore, more and more students will be trained on EduWeb's educational tools and hence more and more digital illiterate parents will be trained by the students, on how to use the internet. Thus, the society will benefit indirectly from the impact of EduWeb in education, since year after year the low scores on DESI will increase significantly.
