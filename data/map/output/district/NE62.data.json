The first activity will bring together 17 youth workers active at national and European level from 12 countries and the second will gather 26 key local volunteers from 21 countries.\r\nThe project aims at empowering organisations of the AFS network in Europe to improve their European, national and local youth work practices and structures to provide quality youth work, while keeping intercultural dialogue at the centre of attention. \r\nThe specific objectives are:\r\n1)      Explore and map the internal and external conditions for quality youth work for intercultural dialogue to identify the directions for organisational development\r\n2)      Provide youth workers in decision making positions with skills for strategic planning at all levels: local, national, European\r\n3)      Share different realities and challenges from local volunteer chapters across Europe, and develop skills to strengthen and expand local structures\r\n4)      Empower participants to address intercultural dialogue in the context of current issues in Europe (refugee crisis vs nationalism) on local, national and international level\r\n5)      Learn from and get inspired by best practices of other youth organisations \r\n6)      Plan future steps to incorporate the results of the project into local/national/European \r\nParticipants come from different organisational backgrounds (small and large organisations) and they will share different needs and experiences of their local, national and European realities.  A key element of the project is the learning from other youth organisations, outside the AFS network.\r\nAll activities are based on non-formal education methods. Each seminar will include teambuilding and introduction at the beginning, best practice sharing, development of action plans and evaluation at the end. \r\nThe 1st seminar will focus on strategic planning at national and European level for improving the quality of youth work, and therefore will include:\r\n1. Exploring of the framework and internal measures of quality youth work \r\n2. Exchanging with other youth organisations \r\n3. Strategic planning \r\n\r\nThe 2nd seminar will focus on organisational development at local level and thus will include:\r\n1. Linking with the first seminar\r\n2. Quality youth work in AFS through Intercultural Learning\r\n3. Current political situation and social inclusion in AFS\r\n4. Volunteer development\r\n5. Linking to other youth organisations through organisational development\r\n6. Development of a toolbox based on skill development in the field of organisational development on local level\r\n7. How to reach out to society through Active Citizenship and changemaking\r\n\r\nAFS Finland will manage the project, with strong support from the European network of AFS organisations, EFIL. The facilitators will be recruited from EFIL\u2019s own European Pool of Trainers for each of the two seminars. In addition one support person will join each seminar. \r\nThe participants are key multipliers of the project and will implement follow-up projects at all levels and share the outcomes with other youth workers upon their return. Moreover, the reports of the two seminars, namely a collection of the structures of European youth organisations to ensure quality youth work, and a toolbox on organisational development at local level, will be shared widely within the AFS European and worldwide network and to other youth organisations represented within European networks.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-3-FI01-KA105-034268_1"]]}}}}
