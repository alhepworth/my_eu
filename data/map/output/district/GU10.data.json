Neural Nets are, in a monitoring type system, ideally suited to detect minute changes in signals, caused by defect initiation and subsequent growth, and separate them from changes in signal caused by other factors. \u2022Develop and validate novel flexible MFC transducers / magnetostrictive transducers suitable to be bonded to / integrated into aircraft components to form LRU sensor arrays enabling detection, localisation and sizing of flaws. \u2022Development of Focusing thechniques such as Time reversal focusing and Time delay focusing in complex materials used for aircraft component manufucturing. \u2022Develop, train and validate the Neural Net defect detection and classification system using LRU technology for aircraft components Monitoring. \u2022Develop a central software program with high-level functions comprising data collection, signal processing, data analysis and representation, information storage and user interface. Additional software will be developed to enable focusing of LRU to identifiy significant potential failure sources. \u2022Undertake modular integrations of the sensors/transducers, signal processing and software functionalities to develop the prototypes and demonstrate its the capability to monitor , to reduce the maintenance costs and increase the safety of aircraft components.", 206182.0, 1217156.0, 6, 8, "SELF-SCAN", "http://www.selfscanproject.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58256.jpg", "fp7_93489_988861942"]]}}}}
