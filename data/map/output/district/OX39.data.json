We will target the eyewear market, where there is unmet need. \n\nThe general rise of eyewear prescriptions and the subsequent need for perfect fitting eyeglasses driven by the growing ageing population, increasing effect of conditions such as myopia and hyperopia, extensive use of computers and need for protection against the sun\u2019s ultra-violet radiation. Current eyewear prescription methods cannot accurately cater for different facial features. Therefore customers or opticians are not able to make informed decisions for the perfect fitting glasses.\n\nPresent procedures require an optical patient or customer to try out several frames before finally choosing a close fitting frame, and not necessarily a perfect fit. Poor fitting glasses cause discomfort and misalignment of the lenses with the eyes, a problem which has resulted in dissatisfied customers returning glasses, costing an estimated \u20ac500 million/year in losses in Europe. \n\nOur 270 degree scanner will be configured to suit two business models as follows: i. White-label version \u2013 will be produced under license and sold to opticians (\u20ac4,000) ii. Branded version \u2013 will be developed for large eyewear manufacturers on a \u20ac10 pay per scan model. Our patented technology was developed at the University of Oxford in 2006 and is currently being refined. We will optimise the scanner, software and hardware to enable high resolution image output so as to commercialise our product for \u20ac4,000. The scanner is also expected to increase revenues for eyewear manufacturers as a result of high quality eyewear production. \n\nWe have an ambitious growth target to achieve revenue of \u20ac50 million pa by 2020.

The completion of the training programme will provide ESRs with appropriate knowledge, skills and awareness of the science-business reality, crucial for scientific and/or commercial based research projects.\n\nThe training objectives will be achieved by participation in:\n-specialized courses, to gain: a) knowledge in food science, microbiology, malting and brewing technology, b) experience in using high-tech analytical equipment, c) managerial and business skills (generic skills, industrial economics, project management, research design and data analysis);\n-an international research project team, using the facilities of multi-institutional consortium;\n-academic and industrial internships.\n\nConsequently, ESRs will be awarded a double doctoral degree in food science and/or engineering. The main goals of the research are: \n1)\tdevelopment of innovations in malting and brewing technologies (to reduce demand for energy) and new protocols for yeast preparation;\n2)\tverification of their impact on the quality and stability of the products;\n3)\tacquiring new scientific knowledge on formation and release of staling aldehydes.\n\nThe consortium of top class universities, institutes and industrial partners, with an on-going history of co-operation, will provide an outstanding opportunity for young, ambitious and brave researchers to realize their potential.
