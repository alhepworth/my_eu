This in turn, will allow our teachers to help train primary teachers in our cluster schools and across our authority to develop courses and teach Spanish in primary schools. Teachers from the Modern Languages department in Graeme High School are already training primary teachers from across the authority in implementing L2 (French) into the primary classroom. We have a long term plan in place in which teachers from our school will help implement L3 (Spanish) into the primary classroom however, our teachers require further training in Spanish and indeed primary methodologies in order for this to happen. Natalie has completed her first year of study in Spanish at Strathclyde University and is halfway through her second. As a result, Natalie has helped introduce Spanish to Graeme High School through an elective programme offered to S3-S6 pupils. Natalie's participation in the LFEE 3 week immersion course is crucial to her becoming GTCS registered in Spanish and to her introducing Spanish to pupils across the school. It will also help to improve her fluency in the language to be used both in and out of the classroom, increase her cultural awareness and provide her with new and innovative teaching methodologies. Our vision, is to make French and Spanish accessible to all pupils in our school and indeed our cluster primary schools. In terms of the impact in Graeme High School, the immersion course will allow our Modern Languages department to work together on creating and developing courses to introduce Spanish within a Broad General Education. With regards the Senior Phase, attending the immersion course will afford Natalie the opportunity to teach SQA certificated courses. With Spanish introduced into the school, the profile of the languages department will be raised and pupils' cultural awareness increased. Natalie and her Modern Languages colleagues will also be able to liaise with their primary counterparts on developing a course which sees Spanish introduced from Primary 5 onwards.Most importantly, Natalie's attendance on the course will allow pupils in Graeme High School to have personalisation and choice in terms of their own language learning. It will allow pupils to use their transferable language skills and develop a deeper and more profound understanding of both English and Modern Foreign Languages.Furthermore, once Spanish is launched in Graeme High School and our cluster primaries, we would look to initiating links through eTwinning with a Spanish-speaking school.", "http://www.graeme.falkirk.sch.uk", "Graeme High School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023224_coordinator"], [2015, "Introduction of L3 -  Spanish Language Training", "Graeme High School", 2672.0, 1, 1, "In line with the Scottish Government's 1+2 Languages policy Graeme High is keen to introduce Spanish as Language 3 and also to train teachers in cluster primaries to afford them the opportunity to introduce Spanish as L3 from P5 .\r\n While training for the implementation of  L2 is now underway, planning and training for the introduction of  L3 in both primary and secondary has required a long term plan to train secondary language teachers in Spanish and develop expertise in primary language learning methodology. The participant, Laura McEwan  has completed a 3 year qualification in Spanish at the University of Strathclyde. This has allowed Graeme High to introduce Spanish as an elective in S3-6.The participant has also been working part of the week on the development and introduction of the Scottish Government's 1+2  policy across the Falkirk authority. \r\nThe mobility activity which has been selected is the LFEE 3 week immersion course in Spain as this will allow the participant to improve her fluency in Spanish, enhance her discursive skills in Spanish and methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish in the target language to secondary school pupils. It will also develop the participant's cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain and further develop her methodology in primary language learning. This course will also allow the participant  to meet the standard GTCS residency in a foreign language in order to become fully registered in Spanish.  \r\nThe envisaged impact for Graeme High school will be improved learning and teaching in languages: development of secondary courses to introduce Spanish within Broad General Education; development of  teaching programmes for SQA certificated courses in the senior Phase and development and delivery of primary language learning programmes in Spanish.\r\nThe potential long term benefits include the transfer of skills within secondary modern language department to cluster primary colleagues; raised awareness of the importance of languages and Europe within Graeme High ,the primary cluster and parents ; an increasing number of primary teachers trained to deliver Spanish both in cluster primaries and across Falkirk council and greater European Dimension with the potential engagement with a Spanish speaking schools through E-twinning.", "http://www.graeme.falkirk.sch.uk", "Graeme High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013249_coordinator"]]}}, "5ES": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Cultural Awareness Supporting Training for Innovation", "MAPS", 195715.0, 4, 5, "This project is to develop a working model with stages for improvement and development between us as partners to be innovative in giving trainers the best tools and resources from our shared experiences and practices.
