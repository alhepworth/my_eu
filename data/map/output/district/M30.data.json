This therefore has to be our key priority as without competent, confident teachers our mission to improve language development across the board cannot come to fruition. \r\n\r\nObjectives Being given the responsibility of MFL lead, its been my ambition and aim to raise standards of language in school and improve the language provision. This is why the main objective of our intended project is to increase competence in our teachers and LSAs language ability. By involving teachers across both key stages as well as LSAs means we can have a greater impact in school. This key set of trained staff can then inspire and coach other staff in school and create a much stronger Spanish provision in school. \r\n\r\nWe have a range of participants from both Lewis Street and Christ Church primary that wil be working together through the project sharing ideas. \r\n\r\nWe hope to improve General linguistic improvement through updating teachers' knowledge of Spanish, acknowledging the fact that Spanish is a changing language and discovering new vocabulary and expressions. The effect of this will be to modernise the teaching of Spanish in their school and provide more motivating materials for pupils thereby improving attainment. Outcomes can be measured through tools such as 'Europass'.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bringing a real purpose to language learning for your children through establishing regular communication with your partner school (weekly or even daily!) This could be done through eTwinning tools, ICT applications (email, skype, video conferencing, social media), letters and exchange of resources. Classes could upload work they are doing in different curriculum areas so that they can compare and comment on what they have produced. This will raise attainment in school by providing strong motivation for pupils to use the foreign language, allow teachers to exchange best practice and share their ideas and could also provide motivation for children in other curriculum areas. Regular communication with native speakers will raise children's attainment in language learning and enhance bilingual projects. The recognised outcome would be the establishment of regular communication between partner schools and could also be the establishment of a platform through which schools can communicate and share resources.\r\n\r\n\u2022 For schools who have some children who don't speak English as their first language, their project could be based on improving provision for these children. This could be done through staff from schools in Spain and England sharing ideas and expertise through observation of each other's teaching, professional discussions and resource sharing. It could lead to the production of materials that can be used in both countries to welcome new arrivals and improve the attainment of children with English as an additional language. Teachers could also improve their understanding of children's home cultures and look at ways of celebrating cultural diversity in their classrooms. This could lead to outcomes such as celebration days/ weeks involving parents and the local community.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Comparison and sharing of teaching methods. Teachers can experience each other's educational systems and take part in classes. They could focus on e.g. language teaching in the early years, observing best practice and bringing ideas back to their own classroom thus improving attainment. Other possible things to focus on could be; behaviour management, cooperative learning (e.g. KAGAN), promoting independence, improving boys' writing, handwriting, teaching languages across the curriculum, sport (the possibilities are endless!) Schools could focus on an area that they are already involved in (e.g an area in which they specialise or something that is on their school development plan).

European Youth Health Champions will create an innovative training and learning resource adaptable for different national settings that can be rolled out Europe-wide. \r\nThis project will focus on young people with fewer opportunities, aged 14-25.  In times of austerity and high youth unemployment across Europe, this project is timely as it will focus specifically on disadvantaged youth.\r\nThe project will boost the skills of young people and increase their employability. The project will also improve and modernise youth work education and training. \r\nThis project incorporates an experienced group of eight partners from six countries, which are UK, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, and Malta.\r\nEuropean Youth Health Champions is innovative because our genuine and adequate needs assessment has indicated there is a limited evidence base within the EU of the impact of peer education on the health and physical activity levels of young people. This project will create that evidence base. This project will create significant added value. It will pool the existing good practice occurring within the participating countries.  By bringing together eight  experienced and high caliber partners from six countries, the project will achieve a higher standard of outputs and results than could be produced in any one country alone. \r\nAll of the project partners are experienced in using grassroots sport and physical activity to engage young people with fewer opportunities. Because the eight partners are well known to each other, having worked together effectively in the past and spent time developing this project, they will form a dynamic and coherent partnership. \r\nWe have created a robust cross-sectoral approach to achieve the highest impact for this project.  Project partners represent the youth sector, the training sector, the public health sector, the grassroots sport sector, and the local authority sector. The inclusion of ISCA (International Sport and Culture Association based in Denmark) as a project partner will ensure the project results receive intensive dissemination and exploitation using their extensive networks across Europe.\r\nThe project will last for 24 months, which is the right amount of time to conduct a robust evaluation of all existing peer health and physical activity education programmes for young people, pool knowledge into new resources and internationalise them, test the resources by training up a new cohort of European Youth Health Champions from each country, refine the resources, and develop an innovative online learning portal for the finished project resources.\r\nOur comprehensive needs analysis has involved extensive desk based research, inquiries to governments and NGO\u2019s,  and concluded that there is a need for a new accredited qualification to train young peer educators in health and physical activity in the participating countries. Our needs analysis also indicates a wider need across Europe. The UK partners, which are StreetGames , Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), and Birmingham City Council, all offer valuable expertise in peer education by young people with fewer opportunities in the field of health and physical activity.

In the face of this crisis, governments have largely not succeeded in finding pan-European solutions, relying instead on national approaches. This project will take a different approach by aiming to strengthen European cooperation in the field of adult learning to enhance inclusion of refugees at the level of civil society organisations. Successful inclusion of the high number of refugees into the European societies is an ongoing agenda that will demand commitment and solutions in the longer term. It is the premise of this project that sport and physical activity organisations in particular, as the biggest civil society sector in the world, can play an important role in providing learning opportunities and taking a holistic approach to successful inclusion of refugees into the European societies. When engaging in sport and physical activities, participants for instance acquire positive life skills, attitudes and values. Moreover, non-formal educational and training activities carried out by sports organisations further enhance leadership and organisational skills and can make important contributions to the learning, self-esteem and, ultimately, employability of the individual participants involved. OBJECTIVES AND OUTPUTSThe Inclusion of Refugees through Sport project has as its overall aim to strengthen the societal inclusion of refugees via the informal and non-formal learning opportunities sport and physical activities provide. The specific objectives areObjective 1: To build the knowledge base for informal and non-formal learning opportunities for societal inclusion of refugees via physical activities and sport Objective 2: To build capacities in participating organisations and develop tools to deliver informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the target groupObjective 3: To establish and run a broad thematic network of organisations working in the fieldObjective 4: To disseminate results and widen the impact of the projectObjective 5 (management objective): To ensure quality in the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the projectThe proposed project will deliver five specialised Intellectual Outputs: A Good Practices Collection with examples from the field (including key principles that are characteristics of a successful practice); A Grundtvig Video for refugees to learn lifelong principles of active participation in civic society activities; An online learning resource for staff and volunteers in grassroots sport organisations to learn about ways of integrating refugees through their activities; A supporting Toolkit; and A Networking Platform for these organisations to meet and collaborate. After the project has ended, the partner organisations will be able to use the results to train staff and volunteers in their own organisations and thus enhance their own capacities further.PARTICIPANTS AND TARGET GROUPThe International Sport and Culture Association (ISCA) will lead the coordination of the project, and the cross-sector partnership consortium includes the University of Kent and StreetGames (UK), SISU Idrottsutbildarna (Sweden), UISP (Italy), Ollerup Academy of Physical Education (Denmark) and Deutsche Turnerjugend (Germany). The direct target group of the project is the organisations and entities (and the individuals in them) that provide opportunities for engaging in grassroots sport and physical activity. At least 22 organisations will form a network by the end of the project and test the project\u2019s resources before they are disseminated.The ultimate target group of the project is refugees that have arrived in Europe. Since the handling and status of refugees, including their availability to engage in various civic actions differ a lot between the different European member states, the project will from the outset take an inclusive approach to defining the target group. As the project progresses, learnings are expected to emanate as to how various subsets of the ultimate target group can engage in the learning opportunities provided in the grassroots sport setting. It is expected that approximately 4900 refugees will be directly involved in the project\u2019s activities.IMPACTThe project aims to maximise the impact on the target group by increasing the capacity of the grassroots sport organisations that can reach out and provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities, with a starting point in the project consortium. By creating a platform for continued and expanded organisational collaboration on this emerging issue, the project will also impact further organisations and thus potentially impact the systemic level by showcasing and enabling the grassroots sport sector to deliver relevant, informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the inclusion of refugees to achieve wider societal benefits.", "http://www.streetgames.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA204-022362_2"], [2015, "Youth Leaders Across Borders", "STREETGAMES UK", 150516.0, 4, 4, "1.

The 4 participant organisations are specialists in grassroots sports for youth, and each organisation has developed successful youth leader training programmes. 3. The focus is on promoting healthy behaviours through the practice of grassroots sport.  The 6 module training resource enables young leaders to promote healthy behaviours to their peers. In addition, the project will focus on engaging more disadvantaged young females as new leaders, and ensuring that both youth and sport workers and the young people gain an international understanding from the training.4. The new training resource will improve and add value to the best existing modules from the 4 participant organisations through transnational cooperation, and create new modules about gender and internationalisation. 5. The new training resource is targeted at over 2000 organisations that deliver youth leadership training. Initially, these will be the organisations in the networks of the 4 participant organisations. Beyond this initial goal, the project dissemination plan will reach thousands of organisations across the EU that want to provide disadvantaged youth with access to innovative and informal learning that develops soft transversal skills that are advantageous in the labour market.  The resources will be in 5 languages.6. The transnational significance of this project is very important, as it adds value to best practice in four different countries to create a unique and important new training resource that will stimulate young people to be active. Levels of physical activity are dropping across Europe leading to a public health crisis, especially for young people with fewer opportunities. 7. The project will bring together the four participant organisations five times to develop and test the training resource.
