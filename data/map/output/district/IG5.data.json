Promoting a 'single service for every device' vision, webinos will move the existing baseline from installed applications to services, running consistently across a wide range of connected devices, ensuring that the technologies for describing, negotiating, securing, utilizing device functionalities and adapting to context are fit for purpose. Innovations in contextual description will be broad covering but not limited to device capabilities, network access, user identity and preferences, location, behaviourally induced properties and finally the more complex issue of the users' social network context.webinos will directly address security and privacy issues as part of Quality of Service that users of web services expect. The addressed challenges comprise: how to provision and adapt security across a range of devices, services, networks as well as how individuals can gain control over the privacy aspects of their web presence regardless of the service that is being used. Context and privacy are intimately intertwined: rich context is valuable but without user controlled privacy it becomes a liability.webinos will boost the industry migration towards web-based services. webinos can back this by providing inter-operable, standardised, open source technology utilizable across domains with direct commercially exploitable value. webinos will also act as an industry catalyst to encourage collaboration and discourage fragmentation in this space.There are strong industry moves towards Internet friendly and Internet integrated offerings, and there exists a window of opportunity to place this Web OS technology on a robust open foundation that will remove economic barriers to engagement, embody policy on data privacy in concrete technology (protecting consumers and enterprise) and creating a centre of web centric expertise (benefiting technical competitiveness).", 361184.0, 11516728.0, 9, 23, "webinos", null, null, null, "fp7_95793_985754353"]]}}}}
