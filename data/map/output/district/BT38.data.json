It\u2019s based on a previous detection of the teachers\u2019 training needs in our school and it seeks for the inclusion of training, evaluative and innovative activities. In order to prioritize,  and make sure that the above mentioned needs are taken into account and included in our training programme, our school counts on the help of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes.\r\n This Department, in an attempt to give an answer to the training needs, seeks for the participation in programmes such as Erasmus+ Ka1 since we think that this kind of programme is a guarantee for us to get the objectives related to the previously detected needs. \r\n\r\nAt IES Chaves Nogales, we are constantly doing our best to improve the quality of teaching since we know well that it affects considerably students\u2019 learning and outcome. As teachers too, we  constantly keep in mind the importance of giving an answer to our students\u2019 needs. They  are very important and valuable for us and in this sense, we usually need to go beyond making reports or using statistics.\r\nOur main goal is that students are able to manage by themselves in their social world. For that reason, we have developed some work strategies which take into consideration the following: collaborative team work, the library as an element for cultural dissemination, the necessary involvement of students\u2019 families in the school library and the use of social networks as a tool for communication within an educational environment.\r\n\r\nConsequently, by taking into account all the strategies mentioned above, we have detected that those activities which are susceptible to some kind of improvement in our school can be divided into three main areas of interest. They are the following:\r\n\r\nWorking collaboratively in the planning,  elaboration and development  of Content Units. Also, the collaborative implementation of projects and activities by students\u2019 families, teachers , pupils, scientific community, social agents, etc.\r\nRevitalising and dynamizing the library by supplying it with new formats and communication systems so that it may be transformed into a MEDIA LIBRARY.        Also carrying out regular activities which contribute to the dissemination of culture and the full  integration of the whole school community members.\r\nFostering social competence and strategies for good and effective communication when using social networks, including the e-twinning platform. In both cases, under the framework of interdisciplinary learning contexts, the efficient use of language as a means of communication achieves a special relevance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding  teachers\u2019 training needs, the most notorious are those which would allow us to conceive Learning communities as a feasible reality in our educational environment. Last but not least important is the challenge of transforming our Library in a \u201csource of resources\u201d, a real Media library , which would become a central axis for the search of knowledge in our school or a starting point from which any search of knowledge would be carried out. In this sense the library would encourage multidirectional communication among all the members of the school community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo finish, in the next school year training period, we will keep on pursuing our objectives by sharing the acquired experience and by inviting other colleagues to participate in a seminary dealing with the different areas of interest established in our project. Furthermore, the project could also become extensive to other schools which could be interested in it, including the Primary schools usually assigned to our school.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our school blog and our profile in some social networking services such as Twitter- also linked to the blog- will be constantly updated. This will allow us to disseminate in an open and extensive way our already acquired experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe IES Chaves Nogales has always proved its willingness to internationalize the teaching process as it has successfully demonstrated with the creation of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes. Thanks to this Department the innovative knowledge and information acquired during the mobility and European cooperation period will also be disseminated through the different didactic programmings. Some relevant and innovative methodological guidelines will be stated in them in order to orientate the teaching and learning process.", "http://www.ulidiaintegratedcollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036547_1"]]}}, "7QX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Europe in Love: creating European citizenship", "Carrickfergus College", 114522.0, 6, 6, "\"Europe in love\" project is a Strategic Partnerships addressing more than one field of the School Education but also providing relevant results in the Vocational Training (VET) and Youth field.\r\n\r\nLove is the project connecting thread and the main link between people and cultures. Besides, love is the engine that fulfils and guides our lives. It is everywhere and there are lots of different ways of loving, being all as good as any other. Love has no borders, understands no language and has no age restrictions.\r\n\r\nEurope and europeanism need to look for solid and common references to consolidate its existence and also to guarantee the progress in the union process. We do not want an educational project for students and by students but involving politics too, because it might lead to disagreement. We have looked for a common connecting thread we all know and feel and that, far from being practical or rational, is addressed to our feelings and our hearts. Sometimes is really positive to follow your heart.\r\n\r\nThis project involves six educational institutions from Germany (Gesamtschule An der Erft), Slovakia (ZS a Gymn\u00e0zium s VJM), England (Carrickfergus College), Italy (Liceo Classico Statale Giulio Perticari), Finland (Myllyharjun Lukio) and Spain (Patronato de la Juventud Obrera). The plan integrates secondary education, vocational training, high secondary education and also enhances the methodologies of non-formal and informal education. Most of the teachers and the students between 12 and 18 years are expected to participate. \r\nThe project comprehends a simultaneous process of learning and producing intellectual results, being the students themselves who will learn and participate in the whole process.\r\n\r\nWith love as a central theme, the main objectives of the project will be: \r\nCompile: Students will research the historical heritage of Europe, both past and present, including legends, films, music, places, traditions, customs, poems, etc. Once the information has been compiled and always with the advice and supervision of the teachers, students will\r\nReflect (on): compiled material after it has been analysed, catalogued, classified and organised in a way it can be used to \r\nProduce: and develop three high quality intellectual products including: \r\n- Teaching units that will be part of the subjects European Union, History and practical English curricula.\r\n- Professional audiovisual production recorded by the students and where the students themselves explain the history of Europe to be used in video and sound Vocational Training courses.\r\n- Methodological guide of non-formal education in youth  throught the new technologies and ICTs. \r\nAll materials shall be compatible with the different curricula of all the schools and organizations in different countries.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, an eTwinning project through Twinspace system will be created to publish the advance of compilation and the ongoing production. This will be our window to look out for people\u2019s reaction and, at the same time, the window where people can look through to know us and participate in this project.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the expected results, as well as constant communication and coordination between all partners, continuous work and meetings on-line, there will be meeting spaces every six months to work together:\r\n- 4 transnational project meetings for teachers will be held to begin, define and work in the intellectual products\r\n- 3 mobilities events where the students will participate and eventually develop all materials, being this a fundamental process to their learning \r\n- An international multiplier event where the project outcome will be publicly presented.\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be noted the great impact this project will have at the local, regional, national and European level since a number of materials in English, with clear added value, will be developed in the field of education, vocational training and youth. All this educational products will be used by different schools, institutes of VET as well as youth and non-formal education organizations, having a direct and great impact on thousands of students and young people who want to acquire and improve their foreign language skills, their knowledge of our common european history and their sense of european citizenship.", "http://www.carrickferguscollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA201-016218_1"]]}}, "8AT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "International Volunteer Programme", "Carrickfergus YMCA", 25484.0, 3, 3, "The EVS \u2018International Volunteer Programme\u2019 at Carrickfergus YMCA involves participation in our family activities (Parents & Kids Together - PAKT), Youth Centre and Health Hub Information Point. \r\n\r\nCarrickfergus YMCA has been involved as a hosting organisation in EVS for over 14 years and during this time has hosted three international volunteers on an annual basis.
