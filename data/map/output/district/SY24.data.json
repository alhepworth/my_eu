Adverse hydrological regimes are the main factor, caused by past peat cutting, drainage and artificially steep surface gradients which promote water loss. Drainage has also caused extensive scrub development and the spread of problem species such as moor grass (<i>Molinia</i>), both of which also contribute to the unfavourable status. Lack of or poor grazing management is a further key issue.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6340", "https://naturalresources.wales/about-us/our-projects/nature-projects/new-life-for-welsh-raised-bogs/?lang=en,", "life_110"], [1995, "Natura 2000 sites in Wales - Integrating monitoring with management planning:  a demonstration of good practice on Natura 2000 sites in Wales", "Countryside Council for Wales", 638148.0, 319074.0, "The main objective of this project is to develop a monitoring methodology for all the terrestrial habitat types listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive which are found within the proposed NATURA 2000 sites in Wales. This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_14"]]}}}}
