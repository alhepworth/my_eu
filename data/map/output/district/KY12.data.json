The objectives for undertaking this activity are to extend the language skills of the lead teacher to enable more thorough support to colleagues.  The acquisition of more up to date and effective teaching methods in Moder Foreign Languages.   To develop progression in teaching MFL to ensure it is embedded in the curriculum throughout the learner's experiences from Nursery to Secondary Transition.  To incorporate ICT skills into learning and communication experiences for better learning.  To identify ways in which opportunities for Global and European experiences can enhance learning. As a result  of this activity all staff, teachers and support staff as well as interested colleagues in the cluster schools will be upskilled by feedback on new methodology and new resources to improve teaching and learning experiences.  All children from Nursery to Secondary Transition will benefit from better skills progression and more effective learning experiences.  The pupils, staff,parents, carers and other community partners to our school will have access to a wider real life dimension to teaching and learning in Europe through new activities.  In particular this course will offer confidence to teachers and pupils in using ICT skills to communicate with others in real life exchanges with schools in France. This immersion course offers the opportunity for learning alongside teachers from other European countries and this face to face experience is invaluable for sharing and broadening the cultural experiences beyond the classroom for teachers and pupils. The short term impact of this course will be on the school staff who will have access through the participant to new methods, skills and resources for teaching within their own classes.  Evaluating these will lead to improvements in the curriculum integration, coverage and progression throughout the school.   In the longer term methods and skills will be applied to the teaching of other Moder Foreign Languages in the school and similar experiences in other countries will be sought and shared with all stakeholders.", null, "Bellyeoman Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023301_coordinator"]]}}, "8AB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "1 + 2  The World and You", "Pittencrieff Primary School", 1578.0, 1, 1, "Context and background:\r\nThe Scottish Government expect schools in Scotland to introduce the 1+2 Modern Languages policy, i.e. all pupils from Primary 1 (pupils aged 5) will begin to learn a modern foreign language  and a second language from Primary 5 (pupils aged 9).\r\nFife Council - our local authority - set up a group of 40 pilot schools to implement the 1 + 2 policy in different clusters across the region - in towns, in areas of deprivation and in rural areas in order to get a balanced representation of all schools in the authority. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project: \r\nOur school has volunteered to be one of these pilot schools .
