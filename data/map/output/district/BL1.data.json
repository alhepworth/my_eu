It also brings, on the other hand, efforts to include disadvantage persons, to treat people justly and equally, to respect human rights and dignity and to educate toward tolerance.\r\n\r\nIf we want to provide our students with quality education applicable in practical life, we cannot do without interns in countries in which abovementioned goals have been top social priorities much longer than in the Czech Republic.- Great Britain and Germany.  Institutions which we chose as foreign partners are known to accentuate aspects of social work that we find important (e.g. inclusion of disadvantaged persons, human dignity, empowerment, respect to otherness). The aim of the project is to enable students to stay 3 or 4 weeks in these institutions and to undergo professional training which would subsequently be reflected upon and used in real life. \r\n\r\nFurthemore, we expect the students to gain a notion of social and cultural climate of the host country. In confrontation with the abovementioned topics, many a young person in the Czech Republic is embarassed and under the influence of various ideological and populist cliches. All partner institutions are excellent examples of how to deal with all these problems effectively.\r\n\r\nAn improved command of a foreign language is also an important aspect of the interns. The students have undergone special theoretical training in this area, which it is necessary to bring into practice of real life communication with clients. Especially the German labor market in social work area is stiill undersaturated and open to Czech workers, which brings our students the opportunity to join foreign teams.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, personality development of our students is an important, however unmeasurable, goal of the intended activities. A foreign stay will make our students more self-reliant and confident, they will learn how to assess a situation and how to react to it, they can be inspired by positive impulses in foreign countries and critically assess social work there and perhaps appreciate practice in this country.\r\n\r\nPractice will be attended by a total of 18 students of the 2nd and 3rd years, with theoretical and practical foundations in their field of study who underwent a careful selection and vetting process.

Sharples languages department  offers two languages, one of which is compulsory for students up to year 8 and can then be chosen as a GCSE option from year 9 onwards. The department currently has 4 specialist teaching staff and 5 non specialist teachers at KS3. These non specialists do not have any previous experience or understanding of the languages they are speaking and so this not only has a negative effect on the pupils being taught, but also the staff having to deliver a subject that they do not understand. \r\nAs the reputation of Sharples School is growing in the local community following excellent GCSE results, we are seeing a rising number of students entering the school in year 7. This in turn means that class numbers are growing and in the coming years we will need even more teachers able to teach languages at KS3. Using this funding to provide staff with a basic understanding of the languages will allow their delivery to be more confident and therefore have a positive impact on their practice and the learning of the students. In addition to this, having more staff able to communicate in Spanish and French will allow us to communicate, and assist the pupils in communicating, with our partner schools in these countries. Teachers currently working with pupils on international projects do not have the necessary language skills to be able to do this at present. With more staff able to do this, we will aim to succeed in keeping our International Schools Award for many years to come.

By addressing their needs in an outdoor setting, they will become more resilient and confident learners and this will then have a positive impact on their learning.  \r\nAnother of our objectives is:\r\n-To ensure that CPD opportunities are shared with partners beyond school to strengthen collaborative learning. \r\nAttending the course in Sweden will allow us to achieve this aim, and we will then seek to share our findings with other schools to support their development as well as our own.

The placement will help build confidence and give the participants renewed motivation to achieve their employment goals, by acquiring new skills, communicating with other language speakers and developing teaching and coaching skills. In terms of the whole project, we will judge its success through the retention of participants, the number of qualifications gained and feedback from participants in terms of enjoyment, relevance and finally whether employment is achieved.\r\n\r\nIn each year of the project, two cohorts will travel (one to Romania, the other to Hungary), thus gaining practical experiences that will change their outlook on life, personal expectations and aspirations. The project will also enable people to make strong friendships, learn independence and gain first hand experience of different language and cultures. It will also help the participants to develop greater understanding, empathy and compassion for people who are from communities that are even more deprived than their own.", "http://www.boltonathome.org.uk", "Bolton at Home Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012206_coordinator"]]}}}}
