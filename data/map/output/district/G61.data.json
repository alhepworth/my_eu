However, it has recently become clear that p53 also plays roles in aspects of human health and disease extending beyond cancer - although most of these are poorly understood. We therefore propose to investigate some of these non-cancer functions of p53, with an emphasis on the role of p53 in the regulation of metabolism, extending to an analysis of whether p53 contributes to pathologies such as diabetes and obesity. This is a pioneering project that brings p53 research into new areas, yet builds on the solid platform of existing knowledge about the regulation and function of p53. State of the art genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and imaging analyses will be used to identify the roles of p53 in the response to metabolic stress caused by nutrient deficiency or excess, and investigate how these activities balance cell survival and cell death. Models will be developed to address how these functions of p53 relate to the control of metabolism and disease in vivo. Understanding how the cellular response to metabolic stress is controlled, and identifying a role for p53 in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis has enormous potential to influence the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The proposal will help to define the role of p53 in the development of diabetes and obesity, and lay the groundwork for the investigation of a role for p53 in other pathologies, such as neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.

Successive rounds of E3-catalyzed substrate ubiquitination lead to the formation of poly-Ub chains or multi-monoubiquitination, which direct the substrate to different biological fates such as degradation by the 26S proteasome. RING E3s comprise the largest family of E3s with approximately 600 members in humans. Over the last fifteen years, structural biology and biochemical studies have paved the way for understanding how RING E3s interact with E2s and substrates, and how they are regulated. Recently my group has trapped the crystal structure of a RING E3 bound to an E2 covalently-linked to Ub (E2~Ub), thus providing a molecular snapshot of how RING E3 optimizes E2~Ub for catalysis. Despite these advances, the mechanisms of RING E3-catalyzed ubiquitination are not completely understood. Here, we propose to investigate three key aspects of RING E3 functions. First, we will determine structures of several RING E3s bound to E2~Ub to dissect the molecular basis for RING E3-E2~Ub selectivity.

Overexpression of Id proteins in transgenic mice causes cancers. Ids have been shown to inhibit differentiation and promote cell proliferation in a variety of systems. This is achieved through interactions with other transcription factors such as MyoD, E47 and Ets. To date, all of the published targets of Id regulation are genes encoding protein. However we have discovered that Ids can also stimulate expression of short non-coding RNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. This regulation appears to be direct, as endogenous Id proteins can be crosslinked in vivo to pol III transcribed genes. We also detect E47, a protein that promotes differentiation of several cell types, at these genes and find that it represses pol III transcription. This is consistent with the established antagonism between Id proteins and E47. It is well documented that pol III transcripts are overexpressed in many tumours. Our data suggests that, direct activation by Id proteins may contribute to this. It may be important, because elevated tRNA expression was recently shown to have proliferative and oncogenic effects in cell culture and in mice.\nThis proposal aims to dissect molecular mechanisms responsible for Id mediated activation of tRNA and other pol III transcribed genes.

Any resources gained from the course will be able to be shared with the school community to encourage all staff to use the language. \r\n\r\nThe training course would allow a member of Bearsden Primary School's staff to attend a one week course run by LFEE which would compliment the learning of Spanish that the staff member has already undertaken through Strathclyde University. The aim is to have more teachers trained in delivering Spanish in the primary school, which would create more engaging lessons encouraging more children to enjoy learning a foreign language. This in turn will aim to help support Bearsden Academy's Modern Language department as more children will have a positive experience of learning Spanish. \r\n\r\nAs a result of attending the course we believe our participant will be able to lead whole school and staff CPD. We aim to introduce children to eTwinning and to create links with Spanish schools allowing real life need to understand and use a foreign language. Having links to Spanish skills will help to improve the motivation for children to learn the language. \r\n\r\nIt will improve cultural awareness and this will be shared and taught to pupils. The participant will aim to inform other schools within the local area about the course, both promoting LFEE and Spanish learning, and as part of this will host a Spanish day in the school for staff and learners. Local councilors and members of the public will be able to attend part of this day to inspire and show the wider community exactly what the school are doing to promote language learning within the town of Bearsden.\r\n\r\nIf the number of teachers who can teach Spanish increases, we will be able to meet the First Minister's challenge of teaching 2 languages in schools by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe impact of attending this course will in turn allow a participant to improve their Spanish skills, will allow the participant to deliver whole staff CPD to sharing and resourcing others with Spanish teaching ideas and lessons. It will promote language learning in Bearsden Primary School, the local community and will encourage all learners to achieve excellence within the context of Spanish learning.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/ed/bearsdenprimary/", "Bearsden Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046859_coordinator"]]}}, "3AX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Language training", "Bearsden Academy", 3909.0, 1, 1, "Since she started to learn Spanish in High School, Nadia has always expressed a strong interest for the language and culture of Spanish countries. By undertaking the Certificate in continuing education Spanish course at the University of Strathclyde, Nadia expressed the wish to be fully registered as a Spanish teacher and to complete an intensive course - it has been identified as part of her Personal Review and Development. She delivered lessons in Spanish and helped the department delivering lessons to S2-S3 pupils but had so far had limited opportunity to teach Spanish notably regards the senior phase. This immersion course will enable her to refresh and update her grammar and linguistic skills as well as to develop new methodology of teaching and learning of a foreign language. Nadia sustains effective professional relationships within the department by sharing classes with different teachers and sharing good practise with all her colleagues within the department and also from other subjects. Developing linguistic and teaching skills in Spanish can then be shared with the rest of the Modern Languages department, at whole school level, with parents at parents' information evening and the associated Primary schools.  Nadia is also responsible for the languages lunch club offered to pupils on a weekly basis, this immersion course will enable her to increase her awareness of the Spanish culture and to share it with pupils. It will also help her developing  knowledge of ICT tools and ressources suitable for the learning and teaching of Spanish in her class.\r\nAt Bearsden Academy, we strongly wish that Spanish can be established as a realistic option for pupils from S1 onwards, as French is being the only language offered in S1 at the moment.  The course will complement the school\u2019s strategy for the 1+2 in accordance with the Scottish Government\u2019s policy and will also help to develop a sense of International Global Citizenship within Bearsden Learning Community.  Language learning being life enhancing, the immersion course in Malaga will give Nadia the tools to help her pupils to open the doors to possibilities and experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of one language. The school will be able to raise the profile of languages and increase the intercultural awareness by strengthening links with fellow European colleagues and initiating international activities with partner schools. As a direct result of the course the pupils will have increased choice in the languages being offered at Bearsden Academy from S1 and will also benefit from new teaching methods and resources, which will be incorporated into teaching and learning within the classroom. It will also enable Bearsden Academy to organise and offer a trip to Spain in the near future.\r\nOverall, the impact of this training will be hugely significant, both to Nadia and the entire Bearsden Learning Community. Indeed, Nadia\u2019s participation in the LFEE 3 week immersion course is crucial in her process to become GTCS fully registered in Spanish and will help her deliver Spanish to pupils across the school. It will provide her with new and innovative teaching methodologies; help to improve her fluency in the use of the language and to increase her cultural awareness, which will be used in and out of the classroom. \r\nOur vision at Bearsden Academy, is to make French and Spanish accessible to all pupils within our school and our cluster primary schools. In terms of the impact in Bearsden Academy, the immersion course will allow our Modern Languages department to work together on creating and developing courses and sharing good practice to introduce Spanish within a Broad General Education. With regards the Senior Phase, attending the immersion course will afford Nadia the opportunity to be registered and to teach SQA certificated courses. With Spanish introduced into the school, the profile of the languages department will be raised and pupils' cultural awareness increased. Most importantly, Nadia's attendance on the course will allow pupils in Bearsden Academy to have personalisation and choice in terms of their own language learning. It will allow pupils to use their transferable language skills and develop a deeper and more profound understanding of both English and Modern Foreign Languages. Furthermore, once Spanish is launched in Bearsden Academy and our cluster primaries, we would look to initiating links through eTwinning with a Spanish-speaking school.", "http://www.bearsdenacademy.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", "Bearsden Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047250_coordinator"]]}}, "3SF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Mednarodnost kot prilo\u017enost za razvoj \u0161ole za \u017eivljenje", "Bearsden Academy", 16754.0, 3, 3, "For the past fifteen years the primary school Preserje pri Radomljah has been working intensively on the realization of its vision; Seen as a leader in its field being a role model for schools who are inspired by us. We also received a certification of the fifth level of achievement of innovation from the State.  The non-authoritative leadership of our headmistress encourages a highly motivated and creative team of employees who devote a lot of time and energy to making changes and finding strategies for the introduction of innovations. \r\nEducation being the basis of our remit we also recognized the role of good relations, which today brings us a high degree of confidence from our pupils and their parents to trust our expertise in making changes. We continue to modernize teaching methods and working formats, which includes monitoring skills, having an early start for the introduction of foreign languages and subtle work with pupils with special needs (also gifted pupils). \r\nThrough this process we of course have encountered obstacles. We believe that this could be eliminated by training abroad - by observing teachers and principals at work and by the exchange of experience. Learning and gaining experience abroad would enable us a new insight and assessment of our own work, progress and development, which is the foundation for further learning and development. Above all, we want a larger and more intensive involvement of the individual in the learning process (methods and working formats), monitoring his/her progress, giving feedback (before, during and after the process, formative and summative), in integration objectives and content and in linking the learned with life (outdoor learning and learning in nature), thus identifying the reorganization of activities and teaching at the school where needed.\r\nAll these areas are current topics of modern teaching practices. We want to visit and acquire new knowledge from Finland, Scotland and Sweden, as we believe they have more experience in their education systems.  In Slovenia we are a big school and we really want to be at the forefront of our educational practices, consequentially we need to train an adequate number of staff. For this purpose, we are about to send abroad at least ten people who teach in different age groups and have different profiles in order to facilitate the widest  implementation. The chosen are university educated class teachers, History, Mathematics and English teachers and teachers for special pedagogy and sociology, also including the headmistress, who is the driving force behind the school and is an example in the way she introduces innovations. In order to achieve the goals we need a variety of abilities, skills and experience. \r\n\r\nWe are a regional center for development and we participate in the training of Slovenian teachers, we have been working in the area of monitoring the knowledge for already ten years, but feel we need new skills and strategies. This is why we will attend the training in the countries stated and with the professors who are one of the leading experts in the world in this area. We will visit the countries which introduced in the curriculum, by the reorganization of the education systems, all that we believe are needed i.e. good relationships, well-being, inclusion of pupils in all phases of learning and evaluation, early introduction of foreign language in a modern way, the support and teaching of pupils with special needs, integration of the school with life, the local community, integrating the content and objectives. \r\nWe want to know how they did it and how they introduced the reorganization. In addition, these countries achieved a high level of achievement and success (including the international PISA, TIMSS). Based on the visits, we will make comparisons and decide which practices are best and how to implement it in the work and life of our school. We expect the introduction of new methods and working formats/organization in the classroom in different age groups, more project and interdisciplinary learning, connecting the school\u00b4s objectives with life, outdoor learning and learning in nature, and the introduction of the necessary reorganization of teaching, as well as an update of the implementation of the curriculum of the school.  We will strive even further, that by the example and demonstration of our good practices we expand our knowledge outwards, first to the teacher practitioners through the \u201cMarket of knowledge\u201d, workshops, teacher trainings, and thus, we also indirectly influence on policy makers.", "http://www.bearsdenacademy.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SI01-KA101-012452_1"]]}}}}
