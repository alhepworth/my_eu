The English Baccalaureate is a fairly new concept in Golborne High School. The Ebacc is a performance measure and not a qualification. Pupils who can achieve 5 grade C or above at GCSE level in English, Mathematics, 2 Sciences and a Humantities subject ( History or Geography) with a Language (French or Spanish in Golborne) are awarded an English Baccalaureate certificate which is recognised by many Colleges of Further Education and Universities. Currently, the number of pupils at Golborne High School who have achieved the Ebacc certificate is 16%. We would like this figure to be much higher and have more pupils each year who will leave with this certificate. \r\nGolborne High School and IES Salvador Rueda have worked together for the past 10 years. Part of the Spanish education system is the Bachillerato, which is similar to the English Baccalaureate. The objectives of this project are to look at how the Bachillerato is taught and also how the higher ability pupils in the cohort who study the bilingual project when they start secondary school in Spain cope with the demands of the Bachillerato and how they perform at the end of their exams. \r\nThere will be two teachers from Golborne High School who will take part principally in the project. Both are teachers of different English Baccalaureate subjects (History and Modern Languages). They are both experienced teachers who are keen to share new ideas with other members of staff in Golborne High School through a series of dissemination activities including whole school and cluster inset presentations, media write ups in Teaching and Teaching Union magazines and newspapers and also from speaking to the local community, and preparing displays for the local library to promote internationalism in a very white British ex-mining community which is deprived in areas. They want to provide opportunities for raising standards in school through the English Baccalaureate. \r\nThe objectives of the project are to observe good practice in the Spanish school. We shall look at Newly Qualified and Experienced teachers in a variety of subjects but mainly the English Baccalaureate subjects.  The project will allow teachers to look at and share new ideas for teaching methods which can also be shared with other teachers in Golborne and also nationally from the dissemination activities.  We shall look in detail at the Spanish curriculum used and the advantages and disadvantages of it. This will allow us to take ideas back to the UK to see how a newly adapted curriculum could impact upon results. Discussions with the Head Teacher and staff in Spain will give us more idea about how we can encourage and engage our pupils through curriculum and lessons. \r\nWe shall carry out a series of observations in lessons to look at the methodology of teaching and also feed back effectively to colleagues in Spain and the UK at the end of our visit. We may encourage more staff and pupils to be involved more in international activities. With this project and more which we could be involved in in the future added with teachers in the UK having the option to use new methodologies, and also by looking at a revised curriculum we may see an increase in the percentage of children leaving school with an English Baccalaureate certificate.", "http://www.golbornehigh.wigan.sch.uk", "Golborne High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012907_coordinator"]]}}, "3GR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1293840000000, 1356912000000, "A novel NIR-based instrument for in-line monitoring during injection moulding", "Micro Systems (Uk) Ltd", "Injection moulding is a complex process and is dependent on the relationship between the supplied material and the processing conditions. The properties of the plastic materials are directly dependent on the temperature, time and environment. Any change in the injection moulding variables, such as temperature, pressure and speed, the mould temperature, the mould cooling temperature, the backpressure and the cycle time, to mention but a few, can change the process stability, affecting the subsequent consistency and quality of the manufactured parts. The simultaneous control and adjustment of the injection moulding parameters and properties of the material poses a major challenge for plastics manufacturers and the subsequent manufacture of quality parts that are of a consistent high quality and free from defects proves difficult. Defect detection and quality improvements are mostly carried out on the basis of quality control of finished parts, using visual inspection, weighing the moulded parts or using off-line analytical and mechanical measurements. To date, the optimisation of certain parameters of the injection moulding has been carried out using off-line analysis of the finished products. This project will build on the results of past research that has demonstrated the feasibility of using near infrared spectroscopy as a quality control tool in an injection-moulding machine. The optical fibre probes allowed in-line process monitoring of the material passing through the injection moulder. Preliminary results showed that the near infrared system can detect several types of materials, can identify colour changes and moisture in materials.

During operation, the graphite and other carbonaceous materials like carbon brick, pyrocarbon and silicon carbide coatings are contaminated by fission products and neutron activation. These irradiated carbonaceous wastes are problematic due to their content of long-lived radioisotopes (e.g. Carbon14, Chlorine 36) and due to their large volumes. About 250000 t of i-carbon are existing, worldwide. Acceptable solutions have not yet been established to handle this kind of waste. This fact also represents a significant drawback for the market introduction of graphite-moderated reactors like Very/High-Temperature Reactors (V/HTR) as a promising Generation IV system candidate.  Graphite moderated reactors represent the very first generation of nuclear reactors and therefore need to be decommissioned ahead of other reactor types which evolved later.
