It is part of the Natura 2000 network, consisting of several sites in two neighbouring areas: Thorne Moors (including the Goole &amp; Crowle Moors) and Hatfield Moors. These sites are breeding sites for European nightjar (<i>Caprimulgus europaeus</i>). Over the years, however, large amounts of peat have been removed from the edges of the central areas of these moors, changing their topography. Peat-forming vegetation only grows if water levels are within +/- 20 cm of the peat\u2019s surface. However, the topographic changes mean achieving such a hydrological balance is a challenge. Water needs to be more efficiently drained from the milled areas during peak rainfall, while there is also a need for terracing across the peatlands to retain water during dry periods. In some areas, on older peat cuttings, work is also required to remove scrub and raise water levels to around ground level.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=5075", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humberhead-peatlands-restoration-life-project,", "life_261"]]}}}}
