Thus it is essential to create a project which will help us while  teaching and learning science. The main aims of the project will be to support students' way of learning science as well as preparing them for the future. Furthermore we would like to equip them the skills necessary when learning and teaching science. \r\nAs the future of mankind depends absolutely on science,  the need to bring up dedicated students that are really interested in science is undeniable. Unfortunately most students today are not interested in science lessons. It is either due to boring lessons without experiments or they do not see any connection between lessons taught and day to day life. The project is aimed at motivating them with ICT  tools and by organising interesting and practical activities, including visits and fun experiments. \r\n\r\nThere will be six partners in the project. The coordinator school is a science high school whose students are of high academic ability and whose subjects mainly consist of science lessons. Other partner schools are general high schools. The partner from the UK is a special needs school.\r\n\r\nActivities:-\r\nGetting to know you activities:\r\n-Powerpoint presentation preparation giving information about individual institutions and local\r\ngeographical situation, including many photos.\r\n-creating a web-page for the partnership\r\n-setting up an eTwinning project platform\r\n-pupils preparing a logo  - logo competition in the first personal meeting\r\n-Questionnaire about needs and  expectations of students on science education\r\n-creating CLIL materials with science subjects with the help of ICT\r\n-content, task and inquiry based experiments on science (physics, chemistry and biology)\r\n-preparing posters and power-point presentations amazing & amusing science - cartoons, jokes, etc.\r\n-short documentary film contests on environmental related issues\r\n-Creating science magazine\r\n-e-Book with outputs of the project\r\n-future technology as I image by means of digital posters\r\n-pupils visiting science museums, power-plant stations \r\n-simple experiments with house-hold stuff - A seminar and workshop at the University of Mehmet Akif Ersoy/Turkey\r\n-science fair in Turkey with the contribution with project/paintings from partners\r\n\r\nThe approach we will take to achieve our objectives will be as follows:\r\n-sharing the cultural richness of each country through regular communication on a variety of platforms \r\n-sharing experience with other colleagues via website, newsletters, exhibitions, booklets & DVD \r\n-reviewing the success of the project through structured & regular evaluation\r\n-involving outside agencies in the project e.g. scientists, university lecturers, politicians and artists\r\n\r\nBy providing a challenging programme of skills development, innovation, expression and adventure our aim is for all our learners to recognize and achieve their highest individual goals in a mutually supportive partnership. By giving students opportunities to devise and manage their own learning journey we wish to equip them with the entrepreneurial skills and attributes required by our rapidly changing dimension of science, technology and innovation in Europe.\r\n\r\nOur aim is for our partnership to help pupils and teachers acquire and improve their knowledge and understanding of global sustainability, whist developing additional skills including teamwork, social relations, planning and undertaking project activities and using information and communication technologies (ICT). It will also provide opportunities to practice foreign languages and increase the motivation towards language learning and cultural tolerance.\r\n\r\nBy developing skills of working together and cooperation with others the impact will be for our students to understand how human relationships and friendships can cross any borders. In addition to this our aim is for students to recognize the value of European Citizenship and to encourage the European spirit of integration and cooperation between member states embracing the diversity of multi-cultural societies.\r\n\r\nIn addition inter-cultural exchanges will also give staff a broader understanding of educational pedagogy within an international context thus allowing them to question and refine their own educational practice back in their home school.", "http://www.morecambe.lancsngfl.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-TR01-KA201-011817_5"]]}}}}
