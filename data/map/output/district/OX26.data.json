To undertake the project areas - 6 months each are provided. The project results will be shared by eTwinning, websites, BLOGs, exhibitions and of course by the student and teacher exchanges with partner institutions.\r\n\r\n1. An artist from our region\r\n2.

The aim  is to build a set of teaching skills for the professionals as well as develop the learning and skills base of our children. The aim is to work with experts from the world of art and music, share expertise within schools to design a set of activities which will stimulate, motivate and develop a set of basic literacy skills for life. The aim is to take the everyday interests of children and use their innate enjoyment within the world of \"Art\" to raise standards across each school for different groups of children. The children will record and communicate their work via different methods - speaking, listening, reading and writing. Sharing within and between the schools of the partners plus exhibitions, concerts and written communications to the local and wider community will encourage the use of, and give a purpose for, the development of the basic skills, and disseminate our work to as wider an audience as possible. Technology as well as pen and paper will form these communication methods.

The ability to use lightweight materials allows vehicles to maximise fuel efficiency.\nCurrent adhesive bonding methods require an energy intensive oven cure process. Furthermore, oven curing has the potential to warp a chassis / vehicle constructed from dissimilar materials. If low energy manufacturing and lightweight construction is to be achieved novel bonding technologies that result in lighter, higher performance and more efficient vehicles with less energy used and lower costs of manufacture must be developed.\nPowderBond will address the issue of having to oven curing adhesives by developing a 1K epoxy adhesive system that is designed to deliver on-demand curing at low temperature (70\u00b0C). We will develop a low temperature cure powder coating (120\u00b0C) for primary structures (e.g. chassis components) which will deliver corrosion protection and the catalyst for initiating cure of the epoxy adhesive. The powder coating containing the catalyst will be pre-applied to one of the adherent surfaces (component parts) to be joined and supplied to the vehicle OEM. The 1K adhesive component will be applied to the second adherent surface prior to joining in-line with current adhesive assembly line methods. The PowderBond adhesive system will not require an oven cure at high temperature to achieve bond strength.\n\nPowderBond will enable SMEs tier suppliers to add value to supplied components by helping vehicle manufacturers lower manufacturing carbon footprint and meet obligations regarding vehicle CO2 emission through light-weighting.
