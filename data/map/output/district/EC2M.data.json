Despite the numerous advantages of FLOSS as a cooperation model, however, most developed software faces a limited life cycle and applicability. The absence of a common platform where projects can publish their software - with reliable and trustworthy usage terms/conditions - creates adoption difficulties. As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.", 5991.0, 497988.0, 5, 8, "PROSE", null, null, null, "fp7_188908_955504418"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Uvas y aceitunas, exquisiteces mediterr\u00e9neas.", "Jos\u00e9 Pizarro", 44209.0, 2, 2, "GRAPES AND OLIVES, MEDITERRANEAN DELICACIES\r\n\r\nThe IES \"SAN FERNANDO\" is a Secondary School that is located on the right bank of the Guadiana River in the city of Badajoz (Extremadura).
