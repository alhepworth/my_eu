All of the sites - whether large or small, private or public \u2013 had been subject to human intervention at some stage through peat cutting, drainage works, tree planting, scrub encroachment and grazing pressure.

The Head Teacher gave each teacher in our school was given the opportunity to attend and Immersion course in France and two volunteered to attend the course training us in developing our French spoken language but also to develop an understanding of French culture. Our overall aim is to embed the French language and culture in our school with staff being confident in their own abilities.

In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000.
