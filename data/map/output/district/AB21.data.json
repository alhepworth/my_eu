The immersion course will support the participants to further develop their delivery of language lessons and embed the culture aspect in their daily practice. Thanks to exposure to new teaching methodologies and professional dialogue, the participants will be an asset to their Faculty and share good practice with colleagues back in Aberdeen. \r\n\r\nThe participants are aware that the main goal of this programme is to enhance the students\u2019 opportunities and attainment in Modern Languages and to motivate them to become responsible citizens thanks to international links. Pupils will be exposed to communication with other schools abroad through the use of ICT. \r\n\r\nThe programme would not only help the pupils and the teachers, but would also have an impact on the wider school community. Other staff members will be made aware of this programme which is a great professional development opportunity across the European Union. Besides, it is required that pupils access at least two foreign languages by 2020, which is not currently possible at Bucksburn Academy. Erasmus+ will allow our language teachers to receive further training and therefore they will be able to offer courses in these languages at the level required by SQA (Scottish Qualification Authority).", "http://www.bucksburnacademy.org.uk", "Bucksburn Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046843_coordinator"]]}}, "9TR": {"cordis": {"data": [[1433116800000, 1532995200000, "bLadder cAncer URine cEll aNalysis", "Cytosystems Limited", "Bladder cancer is the 4th most common cancer in men and the 7th in women, with 330,000- 380,000 new cases annually worldwide or more than 150,000 in Europe and is one of the most expensive cancers to manage.  Bladder cancer incidence is strongly related to age, with the highest incidence rates being in older men and women. Cystoscopy/cystoscopic biopsy remains the current gold standard diagnostic and monitoring tool. This procedure is highly invasive and expensive - costing up to \u20ac1200 per test - and has been reported to miss in the region of 25% of all bladder tumours.  As an adjunct to cystoscopy, urine cytology is routinely carried out globally but its deficiencies in terms of poor cancer detection (low sensitivity) are well recognised and reported.  \n\nThe overall objective of the LAUREN project is to provide a commercial non-invasive in vitro diagnostic that will significantly reduce the management cost of caring for bladder cancer patients, whilst at the same time improving patient comfort and reducing morbidity associated with current invasive procedures.  The specific diagnostic is based on the MCM2 \\ Immunofluorescence biomarker for bladder cancer cells found in urine.The scope of the project is to complete the final development, validation and regulatory activities required to prepare a novel the new diagnostic for the market.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to:\nPO1  Clinically validate the biomarkers including the addition of Immuno Fluorescence \nPO2  Complete development of and validate a single use cell collection device,\nPO3  Validate the cell recognition software for regulatory acceptance\nPO4  Validate the software of an automated slide analysis system.\nPO5  Prepare a complete evidence package to support obtaining a CE Mark and FDA approval for commercialisation", 2589510.0, 2589510.0, 1, 1, "LAUREN", null, null, null, "h2020_197552_934942552"]]}}}}
