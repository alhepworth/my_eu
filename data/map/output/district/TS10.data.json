This project, conceived and led by its European industrial partners, is designed to improve the competitiveness of European industry by developing new and more efficient cooling technologies and processes; specifically a new, state of the art, nanofluid coolant with a significantly enhanced technological capabilities that will transform the design and performance of thermal management systems. Nanofluid coolants represent a new exploitation of nanotechnology that has only become possible as a result of recent advances in nanoparticle production and dispersion technology. The beneficial adoption of nanofluid coolants usually requires re-design of the whole system including heat exchangers, pumps, pipe work and operating points. The gains come from a subtle re-balancing of the pump power, heat losses, plant cost and thermal efficiency. Flow regimes and the geometry of cooling channels play a key role. Understanding how to design systems to realise these benefits is a bottleneck to industrial adoption of nanofluids coolants. The mechanism of how heat transfer is facilitated by nanoparticles in carrier fluids is not clearly understood by the global research community. Analytical Models as yet do not fully explain and predict the thermal performance of nanofluid coolants. The advancement of this knowledge will enable engineers to readily design heat systems using nanofluid coolants. The most promising application opportunities for nanofluid coolants reside in large information data centres containing computer servers and racks, power electronics and power electronics for electric drives.

An integrated, completely simultaneous device named \u00b5COSMOS will be used as a proof-of-principle for therapeutic interventions in rare anaemias. Both techniques rely on molecular detection: optofluidic microscopy relies on molecular biomarkers, and scanning ion conductance microscopy on functional imaging of molecular structures. \u00b5COSMOS allows for the exploration, diagnosis and development of therapeutic interventions for several rare anaemias, including hereditary xerocytosis, overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, familial pseudohyperkaliemia, cryohydrocytosis, certain types of spherocytosis, hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and phosphofructokinase deficiency.\nThe non-invasive nature of the combined imaging technologies, which probe the function of molecular effectors, facilitates the testing of medications and their dosage in a personalised manner. For some of the rare anaemias, CoMMiTMenT will provide an initial proof-of-principle, whereas for others, such as sickle cell anaemia, personalised medical interventions should become available and will be tested in clinical practice within the project.\nCoMMiTMent will ensure an effective therapy with diminished undesirable adverse effects, largely replacing splenectomy.\n\nCoMMiTMenT includes clinical partners and builds a strong relationship with the European Network for Rare and Congenital Anaemias (ENERCA). Furthermore, CoMMiTMenT acts as a bridge between the technology-driven SMEs and ENERCA and, as such, supports the competitiveness of Europe in this area.

In particular, milk and dairy products can be contaminated by aflatoxin M1, a potent carcinogen. The aflatoxin contamination represents a hazard for human health and an economic loss for the dairy industry. The available technology for aflatoxin detection is i) laboratory-based, ii) requires sample preparation, iii) does not provide timely identification of the carcinogen, thus iv) fails to deliver cost-effective management of contaminated milk.<br/>In this context, the SYMPHONY project aims to overcome these limitations by the integration of heterogeneous technologies, encompassing photonics, microfluidics and system integration, in a miniaturised smart system that will perform low cost label free detection of aflatoxin in milk and prevent infection of dairy products. The  main goal is to produce an automated sampling and analysis system to be used on-line in Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In our strategy the following key enabling technologies will converge:<br/>1) microfluidic technologies and biochemistry, to provide a miniaturised device capable of sample purification and pre-concentration by using the selectivity of aptamers and antibodies;2) photonic resonators integrated in microsystem technologies, for highly sensitive detection;3) compact hardware for the integration in the production chain and communication interfaces compatible with the information system of the industry.<br/>In our vision, the system will represent a breakthrough for the dairy industry, leading toward precision process management. The smart system will be assessed on site and end-users will be involved in the evaluation of technical results, thus creating a close collaboration between SMEs who supply sensors, systems and microsystems, and to improve the exploitation of MNBS in industrial settings.", 393007.0, 2461034.0, 5, 10, "SYMPHONY", null, "http://www.epigem.co.uk", null, "fp7_110046_984556112"], [1349049600000, 1443571200000, "Pilot-scale hybrid roll to roll/sheet to sheet manufacturing chain for flexible OLEDs", "Epigem Limited", "Organic Electroluminescence (OLED) is the most promising technology to deliver flexible, thin, light weight, power efficient and environment-friendly light sources. Currently glass based OLED devices are slowly entering the market place, opening new possibilities for lighting solutions. By adding flexibility and robustness at a lower price point, flexible OLEDs will change the lighting industry and revolution the way we all experience lighting.<br/>The introduction of flexible OLED lighting is hampered by a lack of reliable series production technologies, flexible OLEDs exist in the lab but not yet in the fab. Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing of these devices is seen by many as the future cost-efficient manufacturing technology for flexible OLEDs. However, complete roll to roll manufacturing of flexible OLED is still years away and will not be able to bring flexible OLEDs to the market place within 10 years.<br/>The overall objective of the Flex-o-Fab project is the demonstration of a reliable manufacturing process for OLED lighting foils enabling market introduction within 3 years after the end of the project.<br/>Flex-o-Fab will take existing technologies in use for the manufacturing of glass based bottom emissive small molecule OLEDs and use these as a basis to develop a pilot series manufacturing process for flexible OLEDs.

It thus presents a serious health care problem and an economic burden. Reduction in red blood cell (RBC) number can be caused by blood loss, diet, stress conditions including endurance sport, and pathologies which are caused by primary genetic aberrations or are secondary to the malfunction of other cell types.  Transfusion of RBC, which is often the only cure for severe cases of anaemia, is associated with risks such as thrombosis and transfusion reactions due to allo-immunisation. There is an unmet need to improve treatment of anaemia through early and accurate diagnosis, targeted treatment, and increased safety and effectiveness of RBC transfusion. The aim of RELEVANCE is to improve fast and cost-effective diagnosis of the underlying cause of primary anaemia, and to improve treatment options for both general and personalised medicine. We defined five key objectives: (1) to improve diagnostics of anaemia, particularly for hereditary rare forms of anaemia (RA); (2) to find novel treatments for anaemia that target RBC production, ageing and clearance; (3) to reduce premature loss of RBC following transfusion; (4) to produce cultured RBC for transfusion; (5) to monitor and optimise RBC function during sport and exercise. RELEVANCE will train 15 early stage researchers (ESR) at four SMEs and eight academic partners, two of whom are at blood supply centres and two are diagnostic centres for RA.

We will achieve this by developing sustainable technologies to enable water system managers whether in large or small water systems or within food growers or manufacturers to better control the safety of their water supplies. The work of the project is divided into four main clusters of work packages that sequentially lead to the development of appropriate technologies. These four clusters are: 1. Platform targets, 2. Platform development, 3. Field studies in European drinking water systems, and 4. Improving Public Health through safer water. In cluster 1 we shall generate new knowledge on the molecular genetics of viral, bacterial and parasitic waterborne pathogens. This will enable us to identify gene targets for the identification, and characterisation of these pathogens, that will also enable the determination of their virulence for humans. In cluster 2 we shall use the knowledge gained to develop new technologies that integrate sample preparation and detection into a single platform. These platforms will then be subject to a rigorous process of validation and standardisation. In cluster 3 we will use the validated platforms to undertake a series of field studies in large and small drinking water systems, and in food production. These field studies will generate new knowledge about the risk to public health from waterborne pathogens in Europe and also test the value of the technologies in the field.
