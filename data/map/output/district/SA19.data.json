The 139 young people involved in the Erasmus + program will go to 12 different countries: Malta, Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia and Greece. The young people will leave for a month in a company of one of these countries on the spring season of 2018. They are preparing to obtain the technological or vocational \u201cBaccalaur\u00e9at\u201d in different options: leadership and Management of farms, Service to individuals and Territories, Science and Technology of Agronomy and Life, Leadership and Management of forestry and horse farms, Livestock Dominant system and technician in Sale.\r\nThe MFR, training Centers in associative status, have signed contracts with the State and the region of Brittany. They aim the alternating training and social and professional integration of young people. As such, an immersion in a European country should allow young people to better adapt themselves to the jobs of tomorrow. Live a new experience, with different professional practices in host countries, while discovering the cultural characteristics guarantee of openness and personal development should enable greater creativity to flourish in our society and European citizens. The project aims to improve youth employability by acquiring new skills carried out within the framework of a reciprocal process of sharing knowledge while being in compliance with the standards degrees. In addition, training masters and mobility referents of each MFR co- construct term objectives for each young person to discover the host company, organization and progress of tasks and responsibilities assigned. Beyond the strictly professional contributions, language learning will help to overcome shyness in practicing foreign languages and facilitate integration into family units or lodging structures. The challenge is that every young person can, after its training course, become a European citizen engaged and proud of it to create the jobs of tomorrow and improving the competitiveness of Europe.\r\n\r\nFACILITATE THE DEPARTURE OF PROFESSIONALS TOWARDS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO CONFRONT THEMSELVES WITH NEW PEDAGOGICAL PRATICES OR LIVE INTO A COMPANY IMMERSION\r\n\r\nIn parallel with the mobility of young people in vocational training, the FRMFR wants to mobilize teachers who have a true educational mission to youth. Their responsibilities are great in the implementation of the mobility project but also in the implementation of alternate training, educational project, monitoring alternation business / MFR and social and professional integration of young people. For this, the FRMFR aims to enable 5 teachers to live a European mobility for a week, to meet the objectives of the movement of MFR which are to boost education and teaching teams by strengthening their capacities and skills to re - update their knowledge to progress and innovate in their practices. Sharing experiences will improve the quality of relationships with European partners and particularly institutions, host companies and social partners to enable recognition of qualifications and skills acquired including non-formal situation. Comparison of training systems is rich and allows us to understand another reality that is taking support on these distancing own practices. Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support. Faced with the rapid development of our society, education systems need to modernize and adapt themselves to new ways of teaching and learning by taking all the opportunities that the professional immersion, with our European partners, offers our teachers.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035493_8"], [2017, "PREMIERS PAS VERS L'INTERNATIONALISATION DE NOS JEUNES BRETONS EN MFR", "JONES DORIS AND EIFFON", 93201.0, 11, 39, "First steps towards the internationalization of our students from Brittany in the MFR schools\r\n\r\nWe wish, as the MFR from Brittany network, to boost mobility activities in order to promote students formal, non formal and informal skills in an international and European economic context.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Federation of the MFR in Brittany (FRMFR) is involved in the Erasmus program and leads 5 schools all over the Breton territory.  61 young students are concerned by the European program, they will leave to 9 different countries: Denmark, Croatia, Poland, the Netherland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland and Greece for a four week- work experience in Spring 2018.\r\n\r\nThis training is a part of their vocational or technical A level studies specializing in farming; Personal help and Territory support, Agronomy and sciences.\r\n \r\nThe mobility project aims to improve the youth employability, by getting abroad new professional skills as part of a reciprocal approach of sharing the knowledge whilst respecting the diplomas framework. Moreover the training masters and the teachers in charge of the mobility project in each school write the work experiences \u2018purposes in order for each student to discover the business, its way of working, the work progresses and the responsibilities assigned.\r\n\r\nThe MFR are associative schools which have contracts with the government and the Breton council. They suggest an alternative way of learning (students are part time at school and part time in a business) and they work for the youth social and professional integration. So a stay in a European country should allow young students to adapt themselves to their future jobs. Getting a new experience with different professional tasks (according to the chosen country) and discovering foreign cultural aspects are a guarantee to be more confident and open-minded. It should also allow a higher creativity to grow up in our European and citizen society.\r\n\r\nThe European mobility is accessible to all vocational or technical A level students and should allow them to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Practice a foreign language and to improve it\r\n\u2022 Gain new Professional skills\r\n\u2022 Meet new people and discover their culture, their way of life  and their traditions\r\n\u2022 Push themselves\u2019 limits and to take responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the students could, after their studies become involved and proud European citizens able to create their future jobs and to increase the European competitiveness.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035440_19"]]}}, "7BP": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Natura 2000 Rivers  - Safeguarding Natura 2000 Rivers in the UK", "English Nature", 1819483.0, 909741.0, "The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_161"]]}}}}
