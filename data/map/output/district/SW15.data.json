In order to reach this goal, the E-hub concept is developed, which is crucial for the implementation of such a large share of renewables. An E-Hub is a physical cross point, similar to an energy station, in which energy and information streams are interconnected, and where the different forms of energy can be converted into each other and/or can be stored. The E-hub exchanges energy via the energy grids between the different actors (e.g. households, renewable energy plants, offices), who may be a consumer at one time, and a supplier at another time. The consumers and suppliers exchange information on their energy needs and energy production with the energy hub, the hub then distributes the energy available in the most efficient way. For proper matching of supply and demand, the E-hub uses conversion and storage of energy, as well as load shifting. The consumers and suppliers should be connected to this E-hub by means of bi-directional energy grids (low and/or high temperature heat grid, cold grid for cooling, electrical grid (AC and/or DC), gas grid (H2, biogas, syngas). The renewable energy may be generated locally (e.g. from PV on residences) or by centralised means (a geothermal plant or a large CHP located within the district that may be fuelled by biofuel or H2). The E-Hub concept holds for all types of energy flow, from heating and cooling to electricity, biogas and H2, and may connect not only households but also (electrical) cars, commercial buildings or industry. The aim of the proposed project is: to develop the e-hub as a system, to develop technologies that are necessary to realize the system, to develop business models in order to overcome institutional and financial barriers, and to demonstrate an E-hub in the form of a real situation and in a few case studies/feasibility studies.", 174563.0, 9690464.0, 9, 19, "E-HUB", "http://www.e-hub.org/", "http://www.icax.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/163159.jpg", "fp7_97061_989265947"]]}}, "1SF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1419984000000, "Non-Equilibrium Social Science in ICT and Economics", "Volterra Partners Llp", "Traditional economics uses models that assume limited interaction between agents, simplistic behavioural assumptions and equilibrium analysis.

This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing.

Therefore a major gap between political will and concrete implementation of ICF (CY) can be observered, due to missing on-the-job training, and usable tools (ICF-CY consits of approx. 1400 Items). \r\n\r\nWithin the specific field of and Early Childhood Intervention and Social Pediatry (children and adolescents 0-18a with up to 6% of children  assessed as disabled or at risk in EU28) this lack of implementation also decreases necessary exchange between the relevant sectors of medicine, education and labour market. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nICF-CY Med-Use \r\n1) increases the usage of ICF-CY by tansfering electronc tools into clinical practice and combining them with on the job-training (peer-to-peer learning). \r\n2) transfers training curricula into EU strategies (learning outcome, EQF) by blended learning possibilities and makes trainings comparable (trainer certification)\r\n3) integrates formal and informal (on-the job-learning) by training passports)\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\nThe consortium consists of multisectorial (Medicine, education, roof organisations, training) and mutligeographical partners (DE, AT, TR, UK, IT, MK). Partners contribute  specific expertise: curricula and training (DE), ICT (AT), transition (AT), best practice (IT), research (UK), strategic implementation (MK, TR).\r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nThe partnership transfers finding from previous LLL projects (www.icf-training.eu, www.ebiff.org) into the specific field of Social Pediatry (143 SPZ in DE), transfers roof-organisation training curricula (DE) into EU learning outcomes and online training platforms, initiates trainer certification (based on online self-assessments) and iniatiates the usage of individual training portfolio (to assess furher training needs of users). Beside 6 consortium meetings national multiplyer seminars are organised to increase knowledge and skills concerning ICF-\r\n\r\nResults\r\n1) \"ICF-CY practice-translator\": Current static icf-cy lists (1400 items) are transfered towards usable forms (easy usability to be transfered into daily clinical practice, including  \"context-search-functions, local community of practice tools)\r\n2) ICF-CY training platform: Transfer of existing training curricula (e.g. VIFF) into EU learning outcome frames,availablility of online blended learning environments. Certification of trainers to ensure comparability in cooperaton with national bodies  (DIMDI, Chamber of MD...). Roof partner in DE are involved in curricula\r\n3) ICF-CY online training passport in terms of online assessment based on learning outcomes, EQF-levels to assess formal and informal learning in the field or on the job.\r\n\r\nmpact: ICF-CY Med-USE by means of high level on the job learning in the field of prevention of disability increases the quality of services provided (by means of a common language and common assessment criteria), the relevant exchange between medical field, education and transition into labour market for disadvantagded groups and the intervention outcome and increases therefore the chances of vulnerable groups.\r\n\r\nLong term benefit\r\nEspecially the roof partners in DE (representing the relevant systems Social Pediatry and Early Childhood Intervention), strong political will in MK and legal requirements in  TR and AT contribute to sustainability (clinicla usage, better exchange towards transition). Both consortium partner in DE represent  certification bodies in terms towards longterm training and implementation (in cooperation with WHO). A common language will increase understandingand compliance of PwD and their families and quality of life of disadvantaged groups (including employability due to better information exchange between sectors. EU regulations on ICF will be implemented.

People with MDVI constitutes a distinct and heterogeneous group with a unique set of needs and every student with MDVI presents a unique educational challenge. \r\nThe current project concerns the training  of teachers regarding how to assess and teach communication skills to children with MDVI. Communication is fundamental in learning, acceptance by peers and meaningful participation in the home and community. Assessing communicative skills in children with MDVI is a challenge. A  range of subskills need to be assessed, such as receptive, expressive skills, sensory and motor skills related to communication, collaboration with families is required, conducting structured and unstructured observations are important and also their is a need to request evaluations by specialists. The accurate assessment of communication will enable teachers to set realistic goals, develop appropriate learning exercises and address the educational needs of children with MDVI. PrECIVIM  bridges assessment and intervention and underlines the need of assessment of communication skills for the development of individualized educational  approaches, the use of appropriate educational material and play activities to promote the communication skills of students with MDVI. \r\nHence, the proposed project aims to address the following objectives:\r\n\u2022 to develop a screening inventory of the communicative profile of MDVI students,\r\n\u2022 to create communicative, learning, and social opportunities for students with MDVI,\r\n\u2022 to promote the collaboration between universities, schools and associations of individuals with visual impairments and multiple disabilities.\r\n\u2022 to point out the best practices and guidelines for the development of effective communication regarding students with MDVI enhancing their acceptance and promoting their inclusion from a broader social context.\r\nThe above objectives were identified through an up-to-date literature review.
